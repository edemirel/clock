But these heaven-born Pegasi cannot be harnessed to the working vehicles of our streets. The marvel of Thackeray's command over language is this--that it is unfailing in prose or in verse, in pathos or in terror, in tragedy or in burlesque, in narrative, in repartee, or in drollery: and that it never waxes or flags in force and precision throughout <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> full volumes. Of Thackeray's style--a style that has every quality in perfection: simplicity, clearness, ease, force, elasticity, and grace--it is difficult to speak but in terms of unstinted admiration.

The Dealer is expecting to take four tricks with his own hand, and if the Dummy take three (one-third of the remaining nine), he will fulfil his contract. Even if the Dummy fail to render the amount of aid the doctrine of chances makes probable, the declaration is not likely to prove disastrous, as one No-trump is rarely doubled.

The didactic story of _Bazile et Thibaut_ attempted to relate in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> chapters the influence of a good education on the formation of a whole life; and, just as in Hogarth's story of the two apprentices, here too, at the conclusion, the well-educated Thibaut pronounces sentence of death over his old friend Bazile, the badly educated, and now condemned murderer. The fact that in other things the two moral apostles differ greatly from each other is accounted for by the difference in the national characteristics of those to whom they variously...", "...road in the Chardeh valley. Strong forts were built on the Asmai and Sher Derwaza heights and on the spur above the Balla Hissar, which, well garrisoned and supplied adequately with provisions, water, and ammunition, would enable Cabul as well as Sherpur to be held.

When a second march is made they load at 3 P.M. and advance till dark; thus fifteen miles would be the average of fast travelling. In places of danger they will cover <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> or twenty-seven miles of ground without halting to eat or rest: nothing less, however, than regard for \"dear life\" can engender such activity.

The first great philosopher of the seventeenth century (if we except Galileo) was Des Cartes; and if ever one could say of a man that he was all _but_ murdered--murdered within an inch--one must say it of him. The case was this, as reported by Baillet in his _Vie De M. Des Cartes_, tom. I. p. 102-3. In the year 1621, when Des Cartes might be about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old, he was touring about as usual, (for he was as restless as a hyaena,) and, coming to the Elbe, either at Gluckstadt or at Hamburgh, he took shipping for East Friezland: what he could want in East Friezland no man has ever discovered; and perhaps he took this into consideration himself; for, on reaching Embden, he resolved to sail instantly for _West_ Friezland; and being very impatient of delay, he hired a bark, with a few mariners to navigate it.

CHAPTER XIII THE MOQUI INDIANS The Indians of Arizona are, perhaps, the most interesting of any of the American aborigines. They are as unique and picturesque as is the land which they inhabit; and the dead are no less so than the living. The Pueblo Indians, with which the Moquis are classed, number altogether about ten thousand and are scattered in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> villages over Arizona and New Mexico. They resemble each other in many respects, but do not all speak the same language. They represent several wholly disconnected stems and are classified linguistically by Brinton as belonging to the Uto-Aztecan, Kera, Tehua and Zuni stocks. He believes that the Pueblo civilization is not due to any one unusually gifted lineage, but is altogether a local product, developed in independent tribes by their peculiar environment, which is...", "...are those which had been made upon certain vegetable infusions, which, in certain circumstances, exhibited minute particles in motion, apparently by vital forces. These were called _monads_, and were not supposed to be distinct animals, but only atoms, ready to be organized. The more modern and accurate researches of Ehrenberg and others, however, have shown, beyond all doubt, that these monads are true animals, the minutest of all living beings hitherto discovered. Not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> species of them have been described and figured by microscopists, the smallest of which never exceeds the twelve thousandth of an inch in diameter. The vegetable physiologists have described certain peculiar motions in the minute vessels of plants, that might readily be regarded as matter essentially vital. I refer to what they call _rotation_ and _cyclosis_. But these are never seen save in the living plant; and, therefore, seem dependent on the general life of the...", "...the states made an agreement with the king, that the debt, which then amounted to eight hundred thousand pounds, should be discharged by yearly payments of forty thousand pounds; and as five years had elapsed, the debt was now reduced to six hundred thousand pounds; and in fifteen years more, if the truce were renewed, it would be finally extinguished.[**] * Rymer, tom. xvi. p. 341.

LINCOLN'S ELECTION TO THE TENTH ASSEMBLY.--ADMISSION TO THE BAR.--REMOVAL TO SPRINGFIELD. The first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of Abraham Lincoln's life have been traced in the preceding chapters. We have seen him struggling to escape from the lot of a common farm laborer, to which he seemed to be born; becoming a flatboatman, a grocery clerk, a store-keeper, a postmaster, and finally a surveyor. We have traced his efforts to rise above the intellectual apathy and the indifference to culture which characterized the people among whom he was reared, by studying with eagerness every subject on...", "...entering it. It adopted a medium pace, sometimes staying on the surface, sometimes diving to avoid some ship, and so I could observe both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea. On February 8, as early as the first hours of daylight, Mocha appeared before us: a town now in ruins, whose walls would collapse at the mere sound of a cannon, and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and there. This once-important city used to contain six public marketplaces plus <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> mosques, and its walls, protected by fourteen forts, fashioned a three-kilometer girdle around it. Then the Nautilus drew near the beaches of Africa, where the sea is considerably deeper. There, through the open panels and in a midwater of crystal clarity, our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs of algae and fucus. What an indescribable sight, and what a variety of settings and scenery where...", "...the speed of his horse, and to his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were only sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel--a distance which has been estimated to be over half a mile. But it took some fearful driving. The Captain's whip came down fast, and the blows started so much dust out of the horse's hide that during the last half of the journey we rode through an impenetrable fog, and ran by a pocket compass in the hands of Captain Fish, a whaler of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years experience, who sat there through the perilous voyage as self-possessed as if he had been on the euchre-deck of his own ship, and calmly said, \"Port your helm--port,\" from time to time, and \"Hold her a little free --steady--so--so,\" and \"Luff--hard down to starboard!\" and never once lost his presence of mind or betrayed the least anxiety by voice or manner.

Their lieutenant thought the Indians were Cheyenne.

This was John Becker, who dwelt on the south side of the island, near its westerly termination, in a miserable board shanty nestled between naked sand-hills. He managed to make a poor living by trapping and spearing muskrats, the skins of which he sold to such boatmen and small-craft skippers as chanced to land on his forlorn territory. His wife, a large, mild-eyed, patient young woman of some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years, kept her hut and children as tidy as circumstances admitted, assisted her husband in preparing the skins, and sometimes accompanied him on his trapping excursions.

But they had said to one another that they would do nothing prematurely, that for the happiness of a whole lifetime one might well wait until one was old enough and strong enough to undertake family duties. Some people were greatly astonished that a young man whose future was so promising, and whose position at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age was already a superb one, should thus obstinately espouse a penniless girl. Mathieu and Marianne smiled, however, and consented, knowing their son's good reasons. He had no desire to marry a rich girl who would cost him more than she brought, and he was delighted at having discovered a pretty, healthy, and very sensible and skilful young woman, who would be at all times his companion, helpmate, and consoler.

The most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species. Numerous instances could be given of this fact. I will give only one, that of the Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America. Here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the American continent. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> land birds, and twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest. So it is with the other animals, and with nearly all the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable memoir on the Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands...", "...studies in history, biography, and poetry, concluding with the advice of the serving-man to a young student, in Shakspeare--\"Study what you most affect.\"[3] [3] _Niles' Weekly Register_, New Series, vol.

On the 4th of July, 1837, Mr. Adams delivered at Newburyport, at the request of its inhabitants, an oration on the Declaration of Independence, the spirit of which may be discerned in the following extract: \"Our government is a complicated machine. We have <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> states, with governments administered by separate legislatures and executive chiefs, and represented by equal numbers in the general Senate of the nation. This organization is an anomaly in the history of the world. It is that which distinguishes us from all other nations, ancient and modern: from the simple monarchies and republics of Europe, and from the confederacies which have figured in any age upon the face of the globe. The seeds of this...", "...I felt that kind of happiness which makes forgiveness compulsory upon the being who enjoys it, and causes him to forget all previous unpleasantness. My grandmother took me to the inn, and dinner was served, but she could hardly eat anything in her astonishment at the voracity with which I was swallowing my food. In the meantime Doctor Gozzi, to whom she had sent notice of her arrival, came in, and his appearance soon prepossessed her in his favour. He was then a fine-looking priest, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, chubby, modest, and respectful. In less than a quarter of an hour everything was satisfactorily arranged between them. The good old lady counted out twenty-four sequins for one year of my schooling, and took a receipt for the same, but she kept me with her for three days in order to have me clothed like a priest, and to get me a wig, as the filthy state of my hair made it necessary to have it all cut off. At the end of the three days she took me to the...", "...community at large, due regard being had to the rights of every person in the actual enjoyment of any part of that property.\" And second, \"That this house will, early in the next session of parliament, appoint a select committee, for the purpose of considering the present state of the Irish church, and the various charges to which ecclesiastical property is liable.\" The first of these resolutions was negatived without a division, and the second was lost by a majority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> against thirty-seven. STATE OF THE IRISH CHARTER SCHOOLS. In consequence of the report of the commissioners on education, which showed that great abuses existed in the chartered schools of Ireland, Sir John Newport called the attention of the commons to that subject. After detailing at considerable length the condition of the funds of these schools, and the barbarous manner in which the pupils placed in them were treated, he moved, \"That an humble address be...", "...school, with a considerable tinge of the influence of Da Vinci, and later on of Raphael; in his personal manner there was something of the demonstrative and fantastic. The gentler qualities diminished, and the stronger intensified, as he progressed. By 1524 he was at Varallo in Piedmont, and here, in the chapel of the Sacro Monte, the sanctuary of the Piedmontese pilgrims, he executed his most memorable work. This is a fresco of the Crucifixion, with a multitude of figures, no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> of them being modelled in actual relief, and coloured; on the vaulted ceiling are eighteen lamenting angels, powerful in expression. Other leading examples are the following. In the Royal Gallery, Turin, a \"Pieta,\" an able early work. In the Brera Gallery, Milan, \"St Katharine miraculously preserved from the Torture of the Wheel,\" a very characteristic example, hard and forcible in colour, thronged in composition, turbulent in emotion; also several frescoes, chiefly from the...", "...after executing some works on panel and on walls with very good results, guided by his own good intellect and judgment, and believing that in comparison with other painters he had succeeded very well in everything, he pursued the studies of painting with great ardour, and to such purpose, that in course of time he found that he had gained a firm footing in his art, and was held in good repute and vast expectation by all the world. Having then returned to his own country, now a man <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, he stayed there for some months, giving excellent proofs of his knowledge. Thus he executed, to begin with, the altar-piece of the Madonna for the altar of S. Croce in the Duomo, containing, besides the Virgin, S. Crescenzio and S. Vitale; and there is a little Angel seated on the ground, playing on a viola with a grace truly angelic and a childlike simplicity expressed with art and judgment. Afterwards he painted another altar-piece for the high-altar of the...", "...a short experience with O'Iwa disarmed derision. Most of the unseemly lovers came genuinely to like the girl, unless inherent malice and ugliness of disposition, as with Natsume and Akiyama Cho[u]zaemon, made their sport more than mere pastime. But as grown men they could not face the results of the final step, and no parent was harsh enough to graft his unwilling stock on O'Iwa's persimmon trees. The girl was clever enough to know this. It was Ho[u]ei 6th year (1709) and she was now <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old. It was indirectly at her suggestion that Matazaemon sought the aid of Kondo[u] Rokuro[u]bei. This man lived just behind the large inclosure of the Sainenji, on the hill slope which dips steeply down to the Samegabashi. The relationship was very distant at best; but with nearer relatives in general, and with Yoemon his brother in particular, the master of Tamiya had deadly feud. To them he would not turn to find a husband for O'Iwa. Thus it happened that one day...", "...in Peking.

As regards the Catholic mission, which has been intrusted to my care, we have founded one college, with Drs. Boyer and Hinard as rectors, in which <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> pupils study Latin language, philosophy, and theology, as well as geography, mathematics, &c. Four graduates from this college have been ordained priests already, and are offering themselves with most pleasing readiness for the service of preaching and directing the Christians of the region.

Such a force, if led out and exerted with judgment and spirit, could not be resisted by the rebels--it must bear down all opposition.

Having now full confidence in myself, I sold out, bought a fine new American ship, filled her with an assorted cargo, and cleared for Rio and the South Pacific.

A short stroll into the forest adjoining the house proved rich in treasures, for in a few minutes I had gathered <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> varieties of ferns, including gold and silver ferns, two creeping ferns, and many other kinds. The moon rose, and the fireflies flashed about among the palm-trees, as we sat in the verandah before dinner, while in several places on the distant hills we could see circles of bright flames, where the forest had been set on fire in order to make clearings.

He was full of wild escapades, for which he was often subjected to the ordinary punishments of the university.

Thus, one after another, all of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> officers filed into the palace and made their guesses--and became ornaments. Meantime the King ordered refreshments to be served to those waiting, and at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered, bearing a tray.

This would be at the rate of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles a day, allowing Sunday as a day of rest. This advice is seriously given for the consideration of those who can command the time for such a thorough process of restoration.

The land in this stolen estate, as I said, was nine-tenths of it bog and stone, and only the arable...", "...powder-stained survivors breathed a prayer of thanks as they saw on the southern horizon the vanguard of De Lisle riding furiously to the rescue. For the last hour, since they had despaired of carrying the kraal, the Boers had busied themselves in removing their convoy; but now, for the second time in one day, the drivers found British rifles pointed at their heads, and the oxen were turned once more and brought back to those who had fought so hard to hold them. Twenty-eight killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> wounded were the losses in this desperate affair. Of the Boers seventeen were left dead in front of the kraal, and the forty-five had not escaped from the bulldog grip which held them.

After a warm engagement, which continued for three hours, they obliged the French ships to sheer of, with scarce any loss on their own side.

This peace is the foundation of the whole system of modern European politics, of all modern treaties, of that which is called the freedom of Germany, and of a sort of balance of power among all the countries of Western Europe.

There is, too, the account of the martyrdom of _St. Alban_, recorded at length in the pages of Bede, which cannot be treated as an idle legend. It took place at Verulam during the persecution under Diocletian and Maximian, somewhere about 303. Although the record does not rest on contemporary evidence, the story was fully believed at Verulam itself as far back as 429 A.D. (_i.e._ within a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of the traditional date) and is accepted by Constantius in the fifth, as well as by Gildas and Venantius Fortunatus in the sixth, century--while the difficulty of believing in the possibility of a persecution in Britain, which was then under the kindly and tolerant rule of Constantius, seems to us purely imaginary. It is hardly probable that Constantius would have been able to restrain the persecuting zeal of subordinates, in face of the superior authority of Maximian,...", "...of productiveness may still be sleeping underneath its soil, awaiting but the kiss of water and the touch of man to waken them to life!

For her aunt, Queen Adelaide, the Princess Victoria had always felt a strong affection; and though it can hardly be said that this gentle and benevolent lady exercised any great influence over her more vigorous and impetuous niece, yet the letters will testify to the closeness of the tie which united them.

At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> she was married to the Duke of Clarence, then in his fifty-third year, without any preliminary courtship. They lived for a year in Hanover, and then principally at Bushey Park. Two daughters were born to them, the elder of whom lived only a few hours; the younger, Princess Elizabeth, died in the first year of her age. Their married life was a happy one, in spite of the disparity of age.

In addition, the British had a respectable naval force on the lake, amounting to ninety-five guns and one thousand and fifty men. To cope with this combined, and vastly superior force, the Americans had the troops already named, and a flotilla carrying eighty-six guns and eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> men. On the 3d of September, Sir George Prevost, having taken possession of Champlain, proceeded to occupy Plattsburgh. But, instead of making the most of his advantage, the British general contented himself with erecting works, by which to annoy the Americans--thus giving the latter opportunity to strengthen themselves, and to summon from New York and Vermont a considerable force to their aid. At the moment, the delay of the British was not understood, but in a few days...", "...to the literature are given by pages or sections at the end of each chapter, and at the back is a list (about twenty pages) of the most useful texts, documents, and materials. _Financial History of the United States_, by D.

Is political economy a study of things or of men? 3. Shall a piece of coal be studied...", "...Allyn Cole. Mrs. Hosmer was out of the city. A short recess was taken that the first vice-president, Mrs. Anna M. Scott, might be heard, who made a brief but eloquent speech. When the time came for the final vote Speaker Cole surrendered his place to Representative Bigelow, so that a woman might wield the gavel when the result was announced.[21] The bill went immediately to the Governor, who signed it on the 15th. Colorado had by this ratification placed the seal of her approval on the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of woman suffrage in the State. During the war, the Woman's State Council of Defense was a most efficient organization, Governor Gunter saying that he ascribed its remarkable work to the experience which the women had gained by their quarter-of-a-century of active citizenship.

In this bed we all formed ourselves securely and at our leisure, and marched quite near to the verge of the village without being discovered. Every man posted himself in readiness to fire.

On February 1, 1329-30, the day of the patron saint of his house, St Bride, he bestowed lands on the Abbey of Newbattle to secure her special intercession in his spiritual interests. Shortly thereafter he set out on his mission, with 'a noble company'--one knight banneret, seven other knights, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> squires, and a large retinue. According to Froissart, he sailed from Montrose to Sluys, where he lay twelve days, thinking he might be joined by other knights 'going beyond the sea to Jerusalem'; and then to Valencia in Spain. According to Barbour he sailed from Berwick direct to Seville. In any case, he proceeded to the camp of Alfonso, then on his frontier warring against Osmyn, the Moorish King of Granada, and was received with honour befitting his fame and his mission....", "...in this revolt of the celestial beings against their Sovereign, there were no blows given, no celestial blood spilled, no mountains thrown at one another's heads, no angels deft in twain, as in Milton's sublime and grotesque poem. According to the Shastah, it was only a formal disobedience of the orders of the Most High, which God punished by relegating the rebellious angels to a vast place of darkness called Onderah, for the term of a whole mononthour. A mononthour is a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> millions of our years. But God vouchsafed to pardon the guilty at the end of five thousand years, and their Onderah was nothing more than a purgatory. He turned them into _Mhurd_, or men, and placed them on our globe, on condition that they should not eat animals, nor cohabit with the males of their new species, on pain of returning to the Onderah.

At the end of the battle they found that they had the worst of it, for, as they were naked, we always made great slaughter.

One day we saw a great many people, all posted in battle array to prevent our landing. We fitted out <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> men, well armed, and covered the boats, on account of the arrows which were shot at us, and which always wounded some of us before we landed. After they had hindered us as long as they could, we leaped on shore, and fought a hard battle with them. The reason why they had so much courage and fought with such great exertion against us was that they did not know what kind of a weapon the sword was, or how it cuts.

Yet with an aggregate force of 234,000 men, opposed to a total of less than 63,000, General Grant failed signally in the plan, or plans of his campaign--losing in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days, and nine heavy fights and several skirmishes, _seven men for one of General Lee's_!

By the sixth month it gets down to 120 or 130, and from that on to a year the normal pulse beat of the baby is about 120.

With some exceptions, every statement of fact relating to the military operations may be verified in one or more of the following publications-- The \"Times\" History of the War; The War Office Official History of the War; The Minutes of Evidence taken before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the War. To the two Histories, which have been but recently completed, the Author is much indebted. Other authorities have, however, been...", "...or sluggishness with which the blood circulates--a bird would be killed very soon--some partially torpid animals would live a long time.

Others will struggle on longer, as in the case of the two thousand and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> who died of consumption last year, in Philadelphia. And now let us see in which part of the room this deadly poison of our breath is mostly found. It is the popular idea, that because the body, and consequently the breath, is warmer than the ordinary temperature of a room, it rises and accumulates at the ceiling. Upon this theory most of our buildings have been ventilated whenever any attention whatever has been given to the subject; but that theory is incorrect;...", "....... 9.9 0.009 ........ 38 .22 .22 14.8 -7000 8.2 9.9 0.009 0.000041 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- On the basis of column 14 and of the movements and distances of the stars as given in the other columns Fig. 10 has been prepared.

It is based on the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> stars for which complete data are available in Table 6. The inclusion of the other twelve would not alter the form of the curve, for even the largest of them would not change any part by more than about half of 1 per cent, if as much.

He allowed for rent, for expenditure, for household, for extras, then his face, brimful of ill-disguised exultation, he said to his daughter: \"Well, Mary, dear, 'taint much to boast of, but for a first week, you see, 'taint amiss, either.

Here again the influence of religion will be quite evident. \"The knight had to swear to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> articles.

He overflowed with indignation at the disaster of Bourbaki's army in the east, which had been compelled to throw itself into Switzerland, and the result of the elections made him furious: it would be just as he had always predicted; the base, cowardly provinces, irritated by Paris' protracted resistance, would insist on peace at any price and restore the monarchy while the Prussian guns were still directed on the city. After the first sessions, at Bordeaux, Thiers, elected in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> departments and constituted by unanimous acclaim the chief executive, appeared to his eyes a monster of iniquity, the father of lies, a man capable of every crime. The terms of the peace concluded by that assemblage of monarchists seemed to him to put the finishing touch to their infamy, his blood boiled merely at the thought of those hard conditions: an indemnity of five milliards, Metz to be given up, Alsace to be ceded, France's blood and treasure pouring from the gaping...", "...* By this time the eyes of the world had been turned to Port Royal, and to the strange spectacle of a girl who, possessed of every talent which would enable her to shine in society, had deliberately chosen the worst of everything, and had induced her nuns to choose it too.

The king, Louis XIII., a very different man from his father, Henry IV., had determined to put an end to the state of things that prevailed, and resolved to begin with Maubuisson.

He spent six years in the public schools of Brooklyn, but even while getting the rudiments of a formal education he had to work during his spare hours to bring home a few more dollars to aid his needy family.

At twelve he became an office boy in the Western Union Telegraph Company; at nineteen he was a stenographer; at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> he became editor of _The Ladies' Home Journal_, which during the thirty years of his supervision achieved the remarkable circulation of two million copies and reached every month an audience of perhaps ten million persons.

This city is built on a plain, watered by a large river, and is defended by a citadel which is built upon a rock. Our guide notified our arrival to the commandant, who ordered us a house for our lodgings, apparently for the purpose of extorting a present; for shortly afterwards he informed me that he had letters from the king, by which he was ordered to receive <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> ducats from me for himself, and that I should pay six to my guide. I endeavoured to evade this demand, by saying that the king had received me favourably, to whom I had already given seventy ducats, and could not give any thing more, and urged my free passport. But he would listen to nothing I could urge, and I was forced to comply with his extortion.

CHAPTER XIX MY ROMAN CONSULATE The convenient road from London to Rome, when I went there as consul, was via Paris to Marseilles, and thence by sea to Civita Vecchia. It was December when I left London, and the journey from Paris to Marseilles, in a third-class carriage, took <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> hours. The Mont Cenis tunnel had not been opened yet, and the voyage by diligence was tedious, costly, and at that season uncomfortable on account of the cold. I arrived at Rome shortly before Christmas, when the city was astir with the preparations for the great ceremonies which were then the principal attraction for foreigners there, but the number of visitors was very small compared with that which now gathers to their diminished religious and spectacular interest.

The `odium theologicum' gave the Governor some work at once. Two friars -- Fray Bernardo de Armenta and Fray Alonso Lebron, Franciscans -- had burnt the houses of some Indians, who had retaliated in the heathen fashion by slaughtering two Christians. The `people being scandalized', the Governor sent for the friars, admonished them, and told them to restrain their zeal.

The servants gathered clean straw from the German dump and strewed it down the shaft. Major Mallaby-Kelby and the colonel, a slim soft-voiced young man at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, with a proved reputation for bravery and organising powers, had their blankets laid side by side at the top of the shaft; the two adjutants, plus telephones, came next; then a couple of signallers with telephone switch-boards; and, lowest of all, the doctor and myself.

On examining some moccasins which we found there, our Indian woman said that they did not belong to her own nation the Snake Indians, but she thought that they indicated a tribe on this side of the Rocky mountain, and to the north of the Missouri; indeed it is probable that these are the Minnetarees of fort...", "...courage; for when I return to my own thoughts and think of all that I have lost, I burst into tears and call Death to my assistance, but Death will not come.

It was reported, too, that a cider press in Herefordshire had let down a dozen firkins of cider without any apples being set in it, and this was accounted an omen of great plenty, whilst many sheep had died, so that men who had set their fields down in grass talked of giving them to the plough again, and upon St Swithin's Day no rain had fallen.

A judge would find it hard to tell why he sentenced one boy five years for stealing a dollar and another boy one year for stealing two hundred dollars, or another judge why he sent one boy to prison for a year, and another, a first offender, to sixteen years for the...", "...By developing new processes it has given employment to whole armies of workmen in numerous arts, manufactures, and occupations. Some of those employments necessitating scientific training. About 300,000 persons are employed on railways alone in Great {37} Britain, besides those who were engaged in their construction; and in the postal department alone of the telegraph service of this country more than fifteen thousand operatives are employed. Chemical works also find employment for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> thousand, and gasworks for ten thousand work people. The telegraphs of the United States of America alone, provide employment for about 7,000 persons; and the railways of the world employ about 1,900,000 men. It may be objected that the extension of science in this country, instead of increasing employment for workmen has produced an opposite effect, by so increasing the production of goods by machinery, and by physical and chemical processes, that we have glutted the...", "...in such a way that when a seal was struck the harpoon head dropped from its place in the shaft, or handle, after which the handle was towed broadside on through the water by the wounded beast. Of course, towing the harpoon shaft in this fashion impeded the animal's flight more than towing it end on would do. Another harpoon that I have is twenty-one inches long, and but one inch wide and a half inch thick at the base, but instead of one heavy barb near the base it has a series of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> small ones along one side. These barbs hook back like shark's teeth, and are about as keen-pointed. Nothing of better shape to hold fast could be devised by a fish-hook maker. Indeed, the turtle hunters of the West Indies, who have a steel harpoon of a similar shape, do not make as well-formed barbs. The harpoon of one barb is for seals, otters, and small whales (large whales were never attacked unless stranded), while the other form was for the various kinds of birds found...", "...different parts of its range, including the territory where it is known only from plantings.

It is rated very durable in contact with the soil, and this is one of the chief advantages claimed for it. The annual rings are clearly marked by several bands or rows of large open ducts, and the denser summerwood forms a narrow band. The medullary rays are numerous and obscure.

In appearance, the heartwood suggests butternut, but it is coarser, and lacks the gloss shown by polished...", "...this purpose, I established myself at Trieste where, two years later, I obtained it.

Moreover, in common gratitude, I was bound to treat my neighbours and the workmen sent to look for me, and the treat cost me five gallons of whiskey.

At that time he was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, having been born in 1475. He was tall and robust, with a handsome, prepossessing countenance, and was one of the most expert swordsmen and archers in the island. \"His singular vigor of frame,\" says his Spanish biographer, Quintana, \"rendered him capable of any degree of fatigue; his was the strongest lance, his was the surest arrow in the company; but his habits were loose and prodigal, though his nature was generous, his manners extremely affable.\" He...", "...enough remained for the outfit of the other stations. Nevertheless the zeal of the naval pilots, encouraged and supported by the First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Winston Churchill) and by the Director of the Air Department (Captain Murray Sueter), wrought good progress in a short time.

EBEN'S COWS PART 1 Eben was looking at the cows. And the cows were looking at Eben. What Eben saw was twenty-six pairs of large gentle eyes, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> mouths chewing with a queer sidewise motion, twenty-six fine fat cattle, some red, some white, some black, some red and white, and some black and white, all in a bright green meadow. What the cows saw, held by his mother on the rail fence, was a fat baby with a shining face and waving arms. What Eben heard was the heavy squashy footsteps of the slow-moving cows as they lumbered toward the little figure on the fence. What the cows heard was a high, excited little voice saying...", "...if necessary, have been apprehended and brought to justice_.\" E.B. PRICE. September 30. 1850. The Rev. Dr. John Free[2] preached a sermon on the above occasion (which was printed) from the {334} 24th chapter of Leviticus, 21st and 22nd verses, \"He that killeth a man,\" &c.; and he boldly and fearlessly denominates the act as a murder, and severely reprehends those in authority who screened and protected the murderer. The sermon is of sixteen pages, and there is an appendix of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> pages, in which are detailed various depositions, and all the circumstances connected with the catastrophe.

Some additional trials were made, and altogether thirty-six similarly-coloured unions yielded thirty-five good capsules; whilst thirty-five dissimilarly- coloured unions yielded only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> good capsules. Besides the foregoing experiments, the purple V. phoeniceum was crossed by a rose-coloured and a white variety of the same species; these two varieties were also crossed together, and these several unions yielded less seed than V. phoeniceum by its own pollen. Hence it follows from Mr. Scott's experiments, that in the genus Verbascum the similarly and dissimilarly-coloured varieties of the same species behave, when crossed, like closely allied but distinct...", "...pesos of income which would be lost from the present tributes (for all the encomiendas belong to your Majesty); and these islands would be left alone without a single soldier, and with only the bishop and the religious, so that within one week there would be neither the one nor the other.

Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, \"Le Coque et la Perle.\" On the other hand, in the romances of Reynard the Fox we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, Corti, is said to have developed an apologue of \"The Talking Animals\" to the bulk of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> cantos. La Motte, writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it _menage et flatte l'amour-propre_ by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist.

In Art. 98 we supposed the sun and planets to be stationary in the solar system, each planet being at its respective mean distance, from which it cannot move owing to the equality of the two forces. Now give to the central sun from whence the electro-magnetic Aether waves flow, a rotatory motion on its own axis, which it really possesses, as it rotates on its axis once in every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days nearly, and this will give to the Aether medium a circular or rotatory motion. This circular or rotatory motion the Aether has already been proved to possess (Art. 91, where we learned that all solar magnets were caused by electro-magnetic aetherial currents constantly circulating round them). So that the Aether will actually possess two motions: 1st, a radial motion due to the Aether waves generated by the sun, which are radiated out into space with the velocity of...", "...Railway.

In 1592 funds were applied for, which were not, however, promised by the States of Holland and West Friesland until 1597. In 1607, a company was formed at the Hague, by Dirck van Oss and others, to pump out the Beemster in whole or in part; and on their security the States lent the necessary capital. At the commencement, it was thought that sixteen windmills would suffice for the undertaking; but this number was shortly increased by ten, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> mills were then divided into thirteen gangs. By the end of 1608, several of the mills began to pump, and early in 1609, they were all ready. Towards the end of this year, the bottom of the lake became visible in some places: but during a storm on the 23d of January 1610, the great waterland sea dyke gave way, and the pressure on the ring dyke that had been constructed round the Beemster proved greater than it was capable of resisting.

Was it not on the glorious First of June, a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years ago, that his great-great-great-grandfather won victory for his country and immortal fame for himself? On such an anniversary he was obviously bound, no matter at what personal inconvenience, to show a like public spirit.

In the autumn of 1732, James Oglethorpe embarked with 114 settlers; they were unsatisfactory colonists, for the men who had so hopelessly failed in England had not that grit and sturdy endurance necessary for founders of new homes in the West.

Thirteen feet from the lot line on each side would take <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet, and planting them forty feet apart in the other direction makes those trees forty feet apart each way.

She told of the tenth anniversary this year of The Hague Conference, which was attended by representatives of forty-six instead of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> nations and had made various international agreements that would lessen the likelihood of war. She spoke of attending the second National Peace Congress in Chicago in May, at which all the women who took part were suffragists.

Fifty years later the passengers on all the English lines numbered six hundred million, of whom eighty-five per cent traveled third-class. The freight traffic in the same year was two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> million tons. Robert Stephenson lived to see one per cent of the entire population of the United Kingdom employed on the railways. In 1884 the number of such employees was 367,793.

There was nothing, she had said, that she wanted, except to be young and beautiful for a long time, to be gay and happy, and to have money and love. She wanted what most women want, but she wanted it much more fiercely and passionately. She had been married over two years.

Men, however, do not die for love at the mature age of forty-nine, and as Thomson was 'more fat than bard beseems,' and was not always temperate in his habits, constitutional causes are more likely to have led to the poet's death than Amanda's cruelty. Dr. Johnson says somewhere that the further authors keep apart from each other the better, and the literary squabbles of the last century afforded him good ground for the remark. It is to Thomson's credit that, like Goldsmith <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years later, he died, leaving behind him many friends and not a single enemy. His fame rests upon two poems, _The Seasons_ and _The Castle of Indolence_, and on a song which has gained a national reputation. Apart from _Rule Britannia_, which appeared originally in the _Masque of Alfred_ and is spirited rather than poetical, his attempts to write lyrical poetry resulted in failure; but from his own niche in the Temple of Fame time is not likely to dislodge Thomson....", "...fine homely face and smiled my welcome.

The monotony of night-watchman service, followed by a year as a drummer for an Eastern firearm firm, and another year as an inspector for a Pennsylvania powder factory, had infected him with the _wanderlust_ of his kind.

This sign had said: \"MEN WANTED.\" Being <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> and adventurous and out of a job, he had drifted in with the rest of earth's undesirables and asked for work.

One of the most prominent of its members was William Livingston. In May, 1773, Francis offered Vauxhall for sale, when it was described as having an extremely pleasant and healthy situation, commanding an extensive prospect up and down the North River. The house, \"a capital mansion in good repair,\" had four large rooms on each floor, twelve fireplaces and most excellent cellars. Adjoining the house was built a room fifty-six feet long and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet wide, under which was a large, commodious kitchen. There were stables, a coach house and several out houses, also two large gardens planted with fruit trees, flowers and flowering shrubs in great profusion, one of which was plentifully stocked with vegetables of all kinds. The premises, containing twenty-seven and a half lots of ground, was a leasehold of Trinity Church, with sixty-one years to run. The ground rent was forty pounds per annum.

They ask why a ton of American steel rail should cost <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> or twenty-seven dollars in the country where it is made, and only twenty dollars in Europe. They inquire why a citizen of Chicago or St. Louis has to pay more for an American sewing-machine or clock than a citizen of Stockholm or Copenhagen pays for the same article. They say that a heavy burden has been laid upon the common people by a system of indirect taxation, adopted for a special purpose, and maintained long after that purpose has been fulfilled. They claim that for...", "...but after what he had just seen, it became of secondary interest; his curiosity being, however, awakened, he determined to go on, even should night overtake him, to the head of the falls. He therefore pursued the southwest course of the river, which was one constant succession of rapids and small cascades, at every one of which the bluffs grew lower, or the bed of the river became more on a level with the plains. At the distance of two and a half miles he arrived at another cataract of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet. The river is here six hundred yards wide, but the descent is not immediately perpendicular, though the river falls generally in a regular and smooth sheet; for about one-third of the descent a rock protrudes to a small distance, receives the water in its passage, and gives it a curve. On the south side is a beautiful plain, a few feet above the level of the falls; on the north the country is more broken, and there is a hill not far from the river. Just below the...", "...mounds which marked the lines of the old walls. 'There is no sign of them yet,' I remarked, as we pulled up upon a convenient hillock.

He would fly through the country pell-mell, horse, foot, and artillery, as if the devil were at his heels. He might make fifty blunders, but the enemy had never time to take advantage.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years that were his after the close of the great struggle in which he had been one of the central figures, were filled with a quiet enjoyment of life and a wide personal popularity. Wherever he went he was a living hero, welcomed and honored as such by the people who owed so much to his wise brain and his unsheathed sword. He could have been President of the United States, had he been willing to accept the nomination that was offered him; instead, he declined with peremptory...", "...looked about for an inn; When a noble savage lady, of a color rather shady, Came up with a kind of grin: \"Oh, marry _me_, and a king you'll be, And in a palace loll; Or we'll eat you willy-nilly.\" So he gave his _hand_, did Billy, But his _heart_ was true to Poll.

Frontenac's youthful passion was to be a soldier, and at the early age of fifteen he went to the war in Holland to serve under the Prince of Orange.

At twenty-three he commanded a Norman regiment in the Italian wars, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> he was raised to the rank of Marechal de Camp. This was wonderful progress in the profession of war, even in an age when war was the sport of kings and soldiers fought for the mere love of fighting.

He was at that time only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, but already his tall, well-built form, his fine features and commanding presence, marked him out as a born leader of men. He possessed an eloquence which, commonplace as it now appears on the printed page, apparently exerted a profound influence upon his contemporaries.

He shrank, perhaps, from appropriating libretti on which his friend Telemann had a prior claim.(387) But the reason is found rather in the fact that at Weimar Bach discovered in 1715 a local poet of first-rate ability who, with perhaps but one exception, wrote the libretti of all the Cantatas he composed during the last two years of his Weimar appointment.

One of the earliest of these was founded in Boston, where, in 1737, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> \"gentlemen merchants and others, natives of Ireland or of Irish extraction\", organized the Charitable Irish Society.

Railways ended at Inverness, and to get there needed a journey to Aberdeen, and from there by the slowest of slow railways, but quick enough--life was not run at so fast a pace as now. The more remote districts of the north and west of Scotland were as unknown as the wilds of Labrador.

The twenty-six nuns of St Mary's Winchester had gathered round themselves a large household of nine women servants, five male chaplains and twenty male officers and servants; but they boarded and educated <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> children, gave three corrodies and supported thirteen poor sisters (who may however have done some of the work of the house). The twelve nuns of St Radegund's lived more economically, with three male and four female servants and six hinds, besides the chaplains; but even their household seems a sufficiently large one. The ten nuns of Whitney Priory employed two priests, a waiting maid for the prioress, nine other women servants and thirteen hinds[421]. It is notable that the...", "...every time he sees me he grins,\" was the reply. Grayson seemed suddenly discomfited.

Besides, Florida accused Texas of being the home of paludian fevers, which carried off, one year with another, several thousands of inhabitants, and Florida was not far wrong.

Select the centre and deal seventeen cards, placing them in a pile beside the one containing the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> cards. Shuffle the stock again together, and let them be shuffled and cut as before, taking again the centre packet and dealing eleven cards. Collect the remaining twenty-four cards and put them aside.

The first packet, containing the twenty-six cards, represents the soul or...", "...During pregnancy she had an attack of small-pox and suffered all through pregnancy with constipation. She had taken a laxative, and when returning to bed from stool was surprised to find herself attached to the stool by a band. The child in the vessel began to cry and was separated from the woman, who returned to bed and suddenly died one-half hour later. The mother was entirely unconscious of the delivery.

Brown speaks of a woman of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> who had a call of nature while in bed, and while sitting up she gave birth to a fine, full-grown child, which, falling on the floor, ruptured the funis. She took her child, lay down with it for some time, and feeling easier, hailed a cab, drove to a hospital with the child in her arms, and wanted to walk upstairs. She was put to bed and delivered of the placenta, there being but little hemorrhage from the cord; both she and her child made speedy recoveries.

But his subsequent action shows that he was already a convinced disciple of the new movement. Doubtless he had fallen under the spell of Gilbert of Limerick.

In the following year he went on a circuit of the Cenel Eoghain, and \"took away his full demand:...", "...being two miles greater on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy.

Andrea Piccolomini had left Siena on Pandolfo's return, and the new Pope was probably not well disposed to the re-establishment of this despotism in his native city. But his pontificate only lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days--he was broken down already with age and ill-health; and Pandolfo managed to establish friendly relations with his successor, Julius II. Like his uncle, Pius III. has left his mark upon Siena, and we shall return to him in the Duomo. Henceforth Pandolfo was practically undisputed lord of Siena and her dominion, though he never succeeded in getting the longed-for imperial investiture. The citizens appear to have acquiesced in his supremacy. The Balia was in his hands;...", "...law, for, painted in big white letters, where every passenger and every observer can read it, is a notice giving the number of people that can be jammed into that particular compartment in the summer and in the winter.

A misunderstanding arose, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> British and twelve French subjects were seized, in spite of the flag of truce, and hurried off to different prisons. Their sufferings as prisoners were frightful, the result being that half of them died, while the remainder, when released, bore evident signs of the ill-treatment they had undergone.

Reference to Perrotin's work will be made further on. The reason why so few have seen them is the lack of observers with acute eyesight and patient devotion to the work, coupled with unsteady air. Size of aperture seems to be of little importance. That Schiaparelli, with an 8-1/3 inch glass, discovered the canals, while with the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> inch glass of the Naval Observatory at Washington they have never been seen, is emphatic evidence of what a clear and steady atmosphere means in the study of delicate planetary markings.

At the head of this class stand the leading contributors of the Edinburgh Review, of whom Mr. Whipple has aptly said, \"they made reviewing more respectable than authorship.\" Jeffrey, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years its editor, shed over its pages a strong, steady, and beautiful light, which tempered and irradiated the whole.

These were the _Princess Amelia_, of twenty-four guns and one hundred and fifty men: the _Prince Frederick_ of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> guns and two hundred and sixty men: the _Duke_ of twenty guns and two hundred and sixty men; and the _King George_, of thirty-two guns and three hundred men.

How to obtain all these desiderata, and at the same time overcome the difficulty in respect to room, we knew not.

Two hollow steel cylinders, of very thin metal, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet long and one foot diameter in the centre, tapering gradually away to nothing at each end, were constructed in thirteen lengths of two feet each. These lengths, being of different diameters, stowed one within the other, thus taking up very little room indeed. In either end of each length was inserted a narrow band of metal thick enough to allow of a worm and screw, so that all the lengths of each cylinder could be screwed together perfectly water-tight.

And I suppose I wanted to be of the company of the others.

The other candidate is Duke Charles, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old, the most beloved of the sons of our present king. People say he has a real gift for attracting all hearts to him; he is very handsome, very stately in figure, and very courteous in manner; and having spent almost his whole life in Poland, he knows our language perfectly. I have heard so much of his good qualities that my best wishes are for him, although Poniatowski is my countryman. This day will be a memorable one for Duke Charles.

It consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> thousand men, including one French infantry division,--the Prussians being generally estimated at twenty thousand men. This corps did very little during the campaign, and soon after the failure of the French it went over to the Russians, taking the first step in that course which made Prussia so formidable a member of the Grand Alliance of 1813-15. But even so late as the close of May, 1813, Prussia was in danger of annihilation, and would have been annihilated had not...", "...Meanwhile our ten-year-average yield of wheat is 14 bushels an acre, while Germany's yield has gone up to 29, Great Britain's to 33, England's to 37-1/2 and Denmark's to more than 40 as the average for a decade. Potato Yield Twice Doubled There is only one place in the world where we can go for the results of soil improvement for more than a quarter of a century in connection with the growing of potatoes. Of course this place is Rothamsted, England, where as an average for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years the yield of potatoes was 51 bushels an acre on unfertilized land and exactly 102 bushels where only a phosphate fertilizer was applied. Where the same amount of phosphorus--29 pounds of the element per acre per annum--was used in connection with other minerals--300 pounds of potassium sulfate and 100 pounds each of the sulfates of magnesium and sodium--the average yield of potatoes was 109 bushels.

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT To Life It is indelibly imprinted on my memory in a manner which royal joy, fame, pleasure, and excitement beyond the dream of poets could never efface, not though I should be cursed with a life of five-score years. I will paint it truthfully--letter for letter as it was. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles from Yarnung to Barney's Gap, as M'Swat's place was named. He had brought a light wagonette and pair to convey me thither. As we drove along, I quite liked my master. Of course, we were of calibre too totally unlike ever to be congenial companions, but I appreciated his sound common sense in the little matters within his range, and his bluntly straightforward, fairly good-natured, manner. He was an utterly ignorant man, with small ideas according to the sphere which...", "...that the large bones were originally those of giants. I had then neither time nor men to make excavations of any importance; but Mr. White, the mineralogist of the expedition, whom I sent to look into the matter, and who devoted a week to the examination of the deposits, reported that one of them, in a valley sixteen miles south of Nacori, was a bed of clay thirty feet thick and about a mile and a half long. On the edge of this field he discovered a tusk six feet eight inches long and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> inches at its widest circumference, and having almost the curve of a circle. It was not petrified and had no bone core, but the hole filled in with clay, and its colour was a rich mahogany. It was undoubtedly the tusk of a mammoth. From the beginning it had surprised me how very ignorant the people of Sonora were regarding the Sierra Madre. The most prominent man in Opoto, a town hardly forty miles from the sierra, told me that he did not know how far it was to the...", "...above four hundred dollars in a year, and as he has a wife and several young children, the closest scrimping is necessary to get him through to the end of the twelve months debtless. To such a man a funeral is a colossal financial disaster. While I was writing one of the preceding chapters, this man lost a little child. He walked the town over with a friend, trying to find a coffin that was within his means. He bought the very cheapest one he could find, plain wood, stained. It cost him <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> dollars. It would have cost less than four, probably, if it had been built to put something useful into. He and his family will feel that outlay a good many months.

In spite of our every effort to save them, as many as one hundred died in a single day. I stayed with them for six weeks, or until the fever had run through the herd, spent my last available dollar in an effort to save the dumb beasts, and, having my hopes frustrated, sold the remnant of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> head for five dollars apiece. I question if they were worth the money, as three fourths of them were fever-burnt and would barely survive a winter, the only animals of value being some half dozen which had escaped the general plague.

So I rather suppose Josephus wrote three furlongs for the ascent or altitude, instead of thirty; and six furlongs for the circumference at the top, instead of twenty-six,--since a mountain of only three furlongs perpendicular altitude may easily require near an hour's ascent, and the circumference of an oval of the foregoing quantity is near six furlongs.

He found that children with fathers below <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> at their birth showed the maximum of bad conduct and the minimum of good; they also yielded the greatest proportion of children of irregular, troublesome, or lazy character, but not of really perverse children--the latter being equally distributed among fathers of all ages.

Young fathers produced the largest number of...", "...let us note that in spite of Lord Palmerston, he won no inconsiderable success. When 1866 came, and his financial administration ended, he had managed, with the aid of the reduction of debt charge after the lapse of the long annuities, to carry expenditure back to the level of 1857. Naval expenditure rose until 1861, and then began to fall; army expenditure rose until 1863, and then began to fall.

To tell the truth, for those who knew how to look and to see, the pale face of Nougarede, his thin lips, restless eyes, and an austerity of dress and manners which clashed with his <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years, gave him more the appearance of a man of ambition than of an apostle.

Knyghton has asserted, that one hundred thousand sacks of wool were annually exported, and sold at twenty pounds a sack, money of that age. But he is widely mistaken both in the quantity exported and in the value.

A sack contained <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> stone, and each stone fourteen pounds;[**] and at a medium was not valued at above five pounds a sack,[***] that is, fourteen or fifteen pounds of our present money.

In the October number of the Annales de la Medecine Physiologique, Mr. BECQUART of the military hospital of Bayonne, details <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> cases of gonorrhoea, inflammation of the testicles, chancres on the glans and lips, buboes, excrescences around the anus, &c., all of which were cured without mercury, and with the same remedies as were employed by Mr. RICHOND.

The Turkish squadron and bastion were destroyed, in which enterprise Sir Sidney Smith lost only four men killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> wounded. Sir John Duckworth now passed in apparent triumph into the Bosphorus, whence he sent a letter to the Reis Effendi, demanding a declaration of the sultan's views--whether he was determined to espouse the cause of France, or renew his alliance with England, and second her efforts in opposing the tyranny of Napoleon. The British were again overreached by French subtilty. Sebastiani, the French envoy, inspired the Sultan with confidence, and persuaded him to enter into...", "...strength of nations.

In the same year Piero Soderini was chosen gonfalonier for life, in accordance with certain changes in the constitution of the state, which were intended to bring Florence closer to the Venetian type of government.

But he knew that his work had not the zest it used to have in her day, or even before her day. It may well be doubted whether he, who had been in Holy Orders <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years, quite knew now what he believed.

The design of the border indicates that it belongs to a date somewhat subsequent to 1330, the year when the Black Prince was born; but, seeing that it is quite separate from the velvet, it must have been added later, and the main portion of the vestment may actually be part of Queen Philippa's gift.

Their fleet consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> ships of the line, the same number as his own. He at once sent four of his fastest ships to get to windward of them, and attack their rear. A partial action took place in which the _Revolutionnaire_ (110) was utterly disabled, and her last assailant, the _Audacious_ (74), was so crippled that she went home.

Translated into different languages--transported into Britain, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Carthage, Egypt, Parthia, Persia, India, and China--committed to memory by children, and quoted in the writings of Christian authors of the first three centuries, to such an extent, that we can gather the whole of the New Testament, except <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> verses, from their writings--appealed to as authority by heretics and orthodox in controversy--and publicly read in the hearing of tens of hundreds of thousands every Sabbath day in worship--we are a thousand times more certain that the New Testament has not been corrupted, than we are that the Declaration of Independence is genuine. On this ground then we plant ourselves. The whole story of a late and gradual formation of the New Testament, or, in plain English, of its...", "...the Hebrew \"knows how to make propositions, but not how to link them into paragraphs.\" So the earlier Bible stories are like a child's way of talking. They let one sentence follow another, and their unity is found in the overflowing use of the word \"and\"--one fact hung to another to make a story, but not to make an argument. In the first ten chapters of I Samuel, for example, there are two hundred and thirty-eight verses; one hundred and sixty of them begin with _and_. There are only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> of the whole which have no connective word that thrusts them back upon the preceding verse. In the Hebrew language, also, most of the emotions are connected either in the word used or in the words accompanying it with the physical condition that expresses it. Over and over we are told that \"he opened his mouth and said,\" or, \"he was angry and his countenance fell.\" Anger is expressed in words which tell of hard breathing, of heat, of boiling tumult, of trembling.

The boatswain threw a leg over the stern-post of the much-battered ship's boat that lay listed over just beyond the breakers of a rough sea, and cast a glance at the two young men who stood, with hands in pockets, gazing up at the cliffs. Their backs were towards him; they had either not heard, or were disinclined to notice what he had said. 'Ay, 'twas <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> year ago,' he resumed, in a voice like the note of an organ pipe. 'We was working between Brisbane and the Solomons, blackbirding and what not; 'twas before your time, young gents, but----' 'What's that you 're saying?' demanded one of the two whose backs he had addressed.

The history of English agriculture in the latter half of the eighteenth century has been so well described by Arthur Young that any account of it at that time must largely be an epitome of his writings. The greatest of English writers on agriculture was born in 1741, and began farming early; but, as he confesses himself, was a complete failure. When he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> he took a farm of 300 acres at Samford Hall in Essex, and after five years of it paid a farmer L100 to take it off his hands, who thereupon made a fortune out of it. He had already begun writing on agriculture, and it must be confessed that he began to advise people concerning the art of agriculture on a very limited experience. It paid him, however, much better than farming, for between 1766 and 1775 he realized L3,000 on his works, among which were _The Farmer's Letters_,...", "...With modern machinery, such as is being used at Panama, it could have been built for one-quarter as much. As an engineering problem it is to the Panama Canal as a boy's toy block house to a forty-story skyscraper. How it will compare with Panama as an avenue of commerce is a question to which Americans anxiously await the answer.\" The jubilee of the Suez Canal, work on which commenced in 1859, took place on April 25, 1909. When I passed through in 1874 its depth was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet; the present depth is about thirty-two and a half feet, and improvements are now going on which will bring it to thirty-four feet. The original width was seventy-one feet on the bottom, and this has been gradually increased until at present the bottom width is ninety-seven and a half feet. In 1870 there passed through the canal four hundred and eighty-six ships, whose gross tonnage was 654,914. Last year 3,795 ships used the canal, and their total tonnage was over...", "...37 A.D., and apparently lived till about the close of the reign of Domitian in 96. According to his own testimony he was the son of a priest named Mattathiah. Until he was sixteen he studied under the Jewish rabbis. He then spent three years with the Jewish sect known as the Essenes. At the age of nineteen he joined the party of the Pharisees. His point of view in general is that of this dominant popular party. He was able to read Latin, but wrote his histories in Greek. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> he went to Rome where he spent three years. Returning to Palestine at the beginning of the great rebellion against Rome, he was appointed revolutionary governor of the important province of Galilee. The appointment was unfortunate, for he proved both incompetent and unreliable. In 67 A.D. he and his followers were shut up by Vespasian in the Galilean city, Jotapata. During the siege he vainly tried to desert to the enemy. At the fall of the city he was captured, but his life...", "...the late storm while proceeding to the Cape with a prize crew. On approaching St Helena, the captain \"gave orders for the ship to be painted, both inside and out, that the people of the island might not say we came in a dirty ship; and as we neared the land, a white flag was hoisted to apprise those on shore that there was no one ill on board. In cases of sickness a yellow flag is displayed, and then no one is permitted to land from the ship for fear of contagion. The island is about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles in circuit, and is constantly enveloped in fog and mist. It is said to have been formerly a volcano, but has now ceased to smoke. The vegetation is luxuriant, but few of the flowers are fragrant. I recognised some, however, both flowers and fruits, which seemed similar to those of India. I took the opportunity of landing with the captain to see the town, which is small, but extremely well fortified, the cannon being so numerous that one might suppose the whole island...", "...most triumphantly in October, 1810. The first session of this, the twelfth congress, commenced November 4, 1811. Clay, then speaker of the house, evidently expecting much of him, gave him the second place in the committee on foreign relations. There came before the house a measure contemplating an increase of the army in view of the war which appeared to many to be nearer than ever. John Randolph was against it. In March, 1799, a year before Calhoun started to school, Randolph, then not <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old, had fearlessly met the great Patrick Henry in stump discussion, and had, in the opinion of his auditors, got the better of it. He was elected to congress in this year. Steadily since then he had developed, until he was now one of the most prominent figures upon the national stage. While his powers of discussion of a subject were great, the power that especially characterized him was that of nonplussing his antagonist with a snub or a sarcasm. Randolph made an...", "...an average daily paper in America contains from 1,800 to 2,500 words; the reading-matter in a single issue consists of from 25,000 to 50,000 words. The reading-matter in my copy of the Munich journal consists of a total of 1,654 words --for I counted them. That would be nearly a column of one of our dailies. A single issue of the bulkiest daily newspaper in the world--the London TIMES--often contains 100,000 words of reading-matter. Considering that the DAILY ANZEIGER issues the usual <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> numbers per month, the reading matter in a single number of the London TIMES would keep it in \"copy\" two months and a half. The ANZEIGER is an eight-page paper; its page is one inch wider and one inch longer than a foolscap page; that is to say, the dimensions of its page are somewhere between those of a schoolboy's slate and a lady's pocket handkerchief.

He spoke of her as doing all the heavy work on buildings and paid only one kroner (equivalent to a trifle over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> cents) for a hard day of this toil. He found women sweeping the streets, hauling rubbish, dragging hand-carts up the hills and over the cobble-stones, unloading bricks at the quays, attending to the parks, doing the gardening and rowing the numerous ferries which abound in that city. The entire dairy business of the city is in their hands and here they have the help of neither horses nor dogs but take the entire place of the beasts, carrying the heavy cans of milk on their...", "...amid cries of \"Long live our King Joachim,\" the unfortunate man landed with twenty-six followers. He was at once arrested, and on October 13th tried by court martial, condemned to death, and executed a few hours later. Joachim Murat met his death like a soldier. As he wrote to his wife, his only regret was that he died far off, without seeing his children. Death was what he courted when landing at Pizzo, for he must have known how impossible it was for him to conquer a kingdom with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> men. Still, he preferred to die in the attempt to regain his crown rather than to spend an ignoble old age, a pensioner on the bounty of his enemies. Murat died as he had lived, brave but vain, with his last words calling out, \"Soldiers, do your duty: fire at my heart, but spare my face.\" The King of Naples owed his elevation entirely to his fortunate marriage with the Emperor's sister; otherwise it is certain he would never have reached such exalted rank, for Napoleon...", "...Narew, German troops captured enemy positions north of the confluence of the Skroda and Pissa rivers. Fresh Landsturm troops who were under fire for the first time especially distinguished themselves. North of the mouth of the Skwa we reached the Narew.

Beneath that mass of dust and smoke, and unburnt bricks, lay all the men, women, and children, left to represent the glorious 50th Regiment of Foot! Beneath that mass were the heroes who had escaped the carnage of the battle-fields in which three to one of the Regiment had died! Fifty-one men, eighteen women, and twenty-nine children, were killed by the fall of those barracks; one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> men, thirty-nine women, and thirty-four children, were badly wounded--many maimed and disfigured for life! Well might the Colonel of that regiment cry aloud, \"My God! there is no 50th left! The enemy did its worst; but it is the Company Bahadoor that has given us the finishing blow!\" The English reader may possibly doubt the accuracy of these details; but there is a huge grave at Loodianah containing the bones of those men, women, and children of the 50th; and scores of...", "...them in a pile beside the one containing the twenty-six cards.

In one case it goes as low as 2.98.

On the whole, between being the wife of a Yale or Harvard colonial graduate and being a member of one of the first ten Smith classes, a modern girl might conclude that the chances of being a dead one matrimonially in the latter case would be more than offset by the chances of being a dead one actually in the former.

Evans[10] gave the 1/120 of a grain of atropia to a child aged three years until the pupils were dilated, then reduced the dose; this stopped the paroxysm in twenty-one days. At the commencement of the treatment the child had twenty-three paroxysms in the day, and twenty-seven at night. Case No. 2 under same circumstances recovered in fourteen days. In case No. 3 the paroxysms were reduced from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> to two or three a day. Arthur Wiglesworth[11] used a solution of sulphate of atropia, administered in the morning fasting; the dose he advises for children from one to four years is gr. 1/120, given only once a day except in some cases. The results are as follows: There is a steady diminution in the number of paroxysms; a change in the character of the whoop as if the vocal cords were not so closely approximated.

I am not so blind.\" Stella Croyle was at this date <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old; and it was difficult to picture her any older. Partly because of her vivid colouring and because she was abrim with life; partly because in her straightness of limb and the clear treble of her voice, she was boyish. \"What a pretty boy she would make!\" was the first thought until you noticed the slim delicacy of her hands and feet, the burnish of gold on the dark wealth of her hair, the fine chiselling of brow and nose and chin. Then it was seen that she was all...", "...was sent in command of a small detachment to Tepeaca, while we were quartered in Mexico. I do not however know what became of him. Mesa, who had previously served as an artilleryman in Italy, was drowned in a river subsequent to the conquest of Mexico. Alobancho, of Old Castile, a man of great courage, died in Indian captivity. Luis Velasquez, of Arevalo, perished in the expedition to the Honduras.

Another beautiful little picture is presented to us by Mr. Sarchet in another letter--a gathering of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> soldier lads on the afternoon of the Lord's Day. \"We had a talk about temptation, and then celebrated Holy Communion. It was all out in the open in a little wooden dell. I had my portable camp table.

There seemed absolutely nothing between us and God, and the presence of the Risen Christ was a great reality. Before next Sunday some who were there...", "...that there would be delay. Snow had fallen on the summit and whitened all the higher points, but seemingly it hung in only a measurably thin crust, and with not enough to necessitate breaking a trail. A crude steam ferry across Lake Lindeman cuts off about six miles from the first part of the trail, after which a rapidly rising path, sufficiently distinct to permit it to be easily followed, winds over the rocks and among rock _debris_ to Long Lake, situated at an elevation of some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> hundred feet, where night shelter is found in a fairly comfortable tent. Up to this point we had encountered but little snow, and the condition of the trail was such as to allow of rapid travel. A wise caution detained us here for the night, and the incoming of a solitary traveler warned us that a blizzard had struck the summit of the pass, and buried it beneath a heavy mantle of snow.

Her sense of superiority over this \"rather crude Western specimen who knew nothing but his job,\" and to whom she could teach so much, had protected her for a time, held her femaleness and imagination in abeyance, but insensibly his sheer masculinity swamped her, left her without a rock but pride to cling to. It was then that she showed her hand. For a time after her discovery she was merely furious with herself; she was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> and no weakling, neither sentiment nor passion should master her. But this phase was brief. Infatuation is not cast out either by reason or pride, and very soon her mind opened to the insidious whisper: \"Why not?\" What was the career of staff artist, full of liberty, excitement, and good fellowship as it might be, to marriage with an ambitious man capable of inspiring the wildest love? Sooner or later had she not intended to make just such a marriage? From this inception...", "...from Gettysburg. Its first order, received near Manchester before night of the 1st, was to march for Taneytown, but after passing the Baltimore pike the orders were changed, directing a prompt march to Gettysburg. The march has been variously estimated from thirty to thirty-five miles, but the distance from Manchester _via_ Taneytown to Gettysburg is only twenty-nine miles, and as the ground for which the corps marched was three miles east of Gettysburg, the march would have been only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles _via_ Taneytown; as the corps marched back and took the Baltimore pike, some distance must have been saved. It was on the field at three o'clock of the afternoon,--the Union cavalry under General Pleasonton in reach.

Mr. Swan was chosen as clerk assistant to the treasurer and secretary. Mr. Webster, a young architect <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old, was engaged as Clerk of the Works. He had been educated at Aberdeen, and had studied at the Royal Academy and with an eminent architect. At this time he had also a small school for about a dozen mechanics.

On Wednesday, June 5, the managers first met in Albemarle Street. In the second...", "...her ambitious aspirations had been blasted, all her early hopes wrecked. Marriage had proved no blessing to a mind so ill-regulated. Her mother died, and then her husband. The secret source from which the mother had been supplied with means was unknown to the daughter, and she had still pride enough to refrain from all endeavor to solve the mystery. No one was able to do so during the lifetime of the former,--who was there to do it after her death? Thus thrown upon herself when only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, she went to work; and when we came to the factory, we found her there, the most industrious and skilful of all the operators. Employment gave a new turn to her thoughts. New associations opened other and more hopeful views to her mind. She became cheerful, sometimes animated, and, with my sister, intimate and confiding. But if interested in what my sister thus learned of her history, I was to be still more surprised by the subsequent portion of it to which I...", "...ten meters, twelve meters. Saved!

It obeys, as does a faithful horse the slightest pressure of a rider's knees, which, in this case, are the diving rudders placed in the bow and the stern. The manometer now shows twenty-four meters, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> meters. I had given orders we should go down to thirty meters.

But the question can...", "...step towards the realisation of the vast schemes contemplated, voluntary associations began to be formed for industrial and commercial purposes, and a law was issued for the creation of limited liability companies. In the space of two years forty-seven companies of this kind were founded, with a combined capital of 358 millions of roubles. To understand the full significance of these figures, we must know that from the founding of the first joint-stock company in 1799 down to 1853 only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> companies had been formed, and their united capital amounted only to thirty-two millions of roubles. Thus in the space of two years (1857-58) eleven times as much capital was subscribed to joint-stock companies as had been subscribed during half a century previous to the war. The most exaggerated expectations were entertained as to the national and private advantages which must necessarily result from these undertakings, and it became a patriotic duty to subscribe liberally....", "...first twelvemonth of my residence in Japan has had four different governors in five years. During my stay at Kumamoto, and before the war had begun, the military command of that important post was three times changed. The government college had in three years three directors. In educational circles, especially, the rapidity of such changes has been phenomenal. There have been five different ministers of education in my own time, and more than five different educational policies. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> thousand public schools are so related in their management to the local assemblies that, even were no other influences at work, constant change would be inevitable because of the changes in the assemblies. Directors and teachers keep circling from post to post; there are men little more than thirty years old who have taught in almost every province of the country. That any educational system could have produced any great results under these conditions seems nothing short of...", "...a more laborious literary life. In addition to the twenty-three books already written, she had prepared for various magazines and journals an incredible number of short stories, letters of travel, essays, and other articles. Yet with all she had accomplished, and tired as she was, she still had seven books to write, besides many more short stories, before her work should be done. As her literary life did not really begin until 1852, the bulk of her work has been accomplished within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years, as will be seen from the following list of her books, arranged in the chronological order of their publication:-- 1833.

We ate quantities of reindeer tallow with our meat, probably about half our daily food. Breakfast is eaten raw and frozen, but we generally have a warm meal in the evening. Fuel is hard to obtain, and consists entirely of a vine-like moss called ik-shoot-ik. Reindeer tallow is also used for a light.

The result was considerable overcrowding, there being no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> men in one of the cages including some of our fellow-countrymen from Sennelager upon the day I entered. But the men from the latter camp happened to be some of the most irrepressible spirits among us.

It has too often been forgotten by Brahms' partisans that his development as a creator was not precocious. The list of Mendelssohn's compositions when he was a boy of sixteen is bewildering in its length and variety; at the same age the most important of Johannes' achievements was presumably the set of Variations on a favourite waltz. Schubert's career was cut short in his thirty-second year; Mozart died at thirty-five. Brahms at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> had not completed any large work which can be regarded as entirely representative of his mature powers, and had introduced but few compositions either to the public or his friends.

In some places the parish authorities are at liberty to make grants to poor families, but it is nowhere done with such a system and with such a delicacy as in Paris.

There are at least a million and a half of articles pledged at this institution yearly, and its receipts are from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> to twenty-eight millions a year. In winters of famine the public are sometimes allowed to pledge property without paying any interest upon it when redeemed.

There are many accounts of the domestic career of these two, written in a tone of patronage or cynicism. But this tone is gratuitous on the part of those who assume it.

Additional buildings of the most approved character were erected thereon, and its capacity for a Young Ladies' Seminary or Boarding School, is greater than it was at Ercildoun, and it is believed that some advantages of a decided character will accrue to it in consequence of it being more easy of access, and of its close proximity to one of the...", "...puts on our shoulders a burden which many cannot carry for ever.

His first and greatest achievement was the formation of the plebeians into an organized order of the state, invested with political rights. He divided them into four cities and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> rustic tribes, and thus made the number of tribes the same as that of the curiae. This was strictly a geographical division, analagous to our parishes, and had no connection with families, like that of the Jewish tribes. 10.

My advice is to begin with a setting of fifteen eggs under a common hen in May or June. The eggs are smaller than hens' eggs and have good, strong shells. They take from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> to thirty days to hatch. The treatment and care of young guinea fowls varies from that given to young chickens in a few particulars only, _e. g._, the chicks should be fed very _soon_ after hatching and need a large percentage of animal food when first hatched.

She was then, as always, carefully and becomingly dressed, and of ladylike self-possession. For the rest her appearance had nothing prepossessing. Her extreme plainness, a trick of incessantly opening and shutting her eyelids, the nasal tone of her voice, all repelled; and I said to myself we shall never...", "...M.

He seized a rope which Dantes flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantes was beloved by them. \"Well, M.

Indeed, if God had not allowed a miracle to happen, she and her daughter Miriam would have been killed by Pharaoh for having resisted his orders and saved the Hebrew children alive.

His father, however, had other plans for his son, and the lad was made a lawyer's apprentice in the father's office. Continuing, as recreation, his reading, he gave six years to the study of law, being admitted to the bar when only twenty-one. For years, he cultivated literature as a relaxation from business. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> he married, and about this time accepted the office of deputy sheriff of Selkirkshire, largely moved to do so by his unwillingness to rely upon his pen for support. Nine years later, 1806, through family influence he was appointed, at a good salary, to one of the chief clerkships in the Scottish court of sessions. The fulfillment of his long-cherished desire of abandoning his labors as an advocate, in order to devote himself to literature, was now at hand.

The only reason given is that Friday is an unlucky day. Starting across the sea on Friday could have no possible effect upon the winds, or waves, or tides, any more than starting on any other day, and the only possible reason for thinking Friday unlucky is the assertion that it is so. So it is thought by many that it is dangerous for thirteen people to dine together. Now, if thirteen is a dangerous number, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> ought to be twice as dangerous, and fifty-two four times as terrible. It is said that one of the thirteen will die in a year. Now, there is no possible relation between the number and the digestion of each, between the number and the individual diseases. If fourteen dine together there is greater probability, if we take into account only the number, of a death within the year, than there would be if only thirteen were at the table. Overturning the salt is very unlucky,...", "...this great superiority of foot over horse, had we not very many modern examples affording the clearest proof of it. For instance, at the battle of Novara, of which we have already spoken, nine thousand Swiss foot were seen to attack ten thousand cavalry together with an equal number of infantry, and to defeat them; the cavalry being powerless to injure them, while of the infantry, who were mostly Gascons, and badly disciplined, they made no account. On another occasion we have seen <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> thousand Swiss march on Milan to attack Francis I. of France, who had with him twenty thousand men-at-arms, forty thousand foot, and a hundred pieces of artillery; and although they were not victorious as at Novara, they nevertheless fought valiantly for two days together, and, in the end, though beaten, were able to bring off half their number.

It is true that Giorgione spent time and energy over fresco painting, and from the very publicity of such work as the frescoes on the Fondaco de' Tedeschi, he came to be widely known in this direction, but it is infinitely probable that his output in other branches was enormous. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> pictures we have already accepted, plus the lost frescoes, cannot possibly represent the sum-total of his artistic activities, and to say that everything else has disappeared is, as I shall try to show, not correct. We know, moreover, from the Anonimo (who was almost Giorgione's contemporary) that many pictures existed in his day which cannot now be traced,[75] and if we add these and some of the others cited by Vasari and Ridolfi (without assuming that every one was a...", "...subsequently to his death, but the Library Register shows that Oxford was indebted to him for a considerable and important portion during his life.

In the following year, shortly before his death (which occurred on April 2, 1754) he forwarded <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> more of his Irish volumes, in folio, marked A, B, C, D, &c. And in 1757 nine more of the same series were forwarded by his widow from Caldecot, near Abingdon, according to an entry in the old Catalogue, which appears to correspond to one in the annual Register to the effect that four more boxes were forwarded by the executors, 'by order of Rev.

These latter appear under a variety of names, two or more titles often being used for the same individual in a single tale.

It will appear that there are some conflicts in the use of names, but when it is realized that the first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> myths which make up the cycle proper were secured from six story tellers coming from four different towns, the agreement rather than the disagreement is surprising.

Having outsailed the emissaries, we were still bombarded with letters mentioning every possible objection. One said the barge would be dark, and we replied that we intended to have <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> windows. Another that it would be damp; against this we set our stoves. Another that it would be stuffy; and the windows were indicated once more. A fourth that it would be cold; and we brought forward the stoves again. A fifth declared that it would be draughty. To this last we intended to reply at some length that a ship with her outer and inner skin, and air-lock or space between the two, is the least draughty place possible.

They no longer recognized political action as necessary.[418] When the convention was called to order by Mr. St. John on September 21, 1908, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> delegates in attendance, controlling an aggregate of seventy votes. Two delegates were debarred from seats in the convention--Max Ledermann of Chicago and Daniel DeLeon of New York--and St. John was made permanent chairman.[419] The West--especially the Pacific Coast--was well represented for the first time.

To all of these, the women of Philadelphia ministered most generously and devotedly, so arranging their labors that to each hospital there was a committee, some of whose members visited its wards daily, and prepared and distributed the special diet and such delicacies as the surgeons allowed. But as the war progressed, these patriotic women felt that they ought to do more for the soldiers, than simply to minister to those of...", "...to the wagon-top form. Early in 1870, the success of the various narrow-gauge railway enterprises in Europe aroused a lively interest in the subject, and numerous similar lines were projected on this side of the Atlantic.

The history of the Baldwin Locomotive Works has thus been traced from its inception to the present time. Over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> hundred locomotives have been built in the establishment since the completion of the \"Old Ironsides,\" in 1832. Its capacity is now equal to the production of over four hundred locomotives annually, and it has attained the rank of the largest locomotive works in the world. It owes this position not only to the character of the work it has turned out, but largely also to the peculiar facilities for manufacture which it possesses.

Such craft are required to display at night a bright white light as near the stem as practicable and a white light aft to show all around the horizon.

The former was charged with tricky dealings with Cornelius Herz, the latter was shown to have demanded money from the company, when Minister, in order to use it for political subsidies. In December the Cabinet decided to arrest Charles de Lesseps, Marius Fontane, Henri Cottu, and a former Deputy, Sans-Leroy, accused of having accepted a bribe of two hundred thousand francs. At the same time, on the basis of the seizure of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> cheque stubs at the bank used by the baron de Reinach, the Minister of Justice proceeded against ten prominent Deputies and Senators, among whom was Albert Grevy, former Governor-General of Algeria, and brother of Jules Grevy.

They also plundered many vessels at the Isle of May, obtained many fresh hands, and fitted one of their prizes with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> guns, and called her the _King James_. At St. Jago the governor accused them of being pirates, and Davis resolved to resent the affront by surprising the fort by night. Going on shore well armed, they found the guard negligent, and took the place, losing only three men.

Reaching Marbach--it was now the spring of 1749--he put up at the 'Golden Lion', an inn kept by a then prosperous baker named Kodweis. Here he fell in love with his landlord's daughter Dorothea, a girl of sixteen, and in the course of the summer married her. He was at this time about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old. He now settled down In Marbach to practice his crude art, but the practice came to little and Kodweis soon lost his property in foolish speculation.

Varahran found himself once more overmatched, and could offer no effectual resistance. Armenia had now been a province of Persia for the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> (or perhaps forty-six) years; but it had in no degree been conciliated or united with the rest of the empire. The people had been distrusted and oppressed; the nobles had been deprived of employment; a heavy tribute had been laid on the land; and a religious revolution had been violently effected.

In Geronimo's story of those {39} days, published many years later, he wrote: \"We killed cattle to eat whenever we were in need of food, but we frequently suffered greatly for need of water. At one time we had no water for two days and nights, and our horses almost...", "...miss the child very much. Gifford Woodhouse was saying to-day Ashurst would lose a great deal when she went.

The English Commissioners, seizing on the words 'a preposterous order,' declined to receive the protest till it should be amended, and at once called on Moray to produce his proofs. Moray then put in the 'Book of Articles,' 'containing certain conjectures,' a long arraignment of Mary. In the Lennox Papers is a shorter collection of 'Probable and Infallyable Conjectures,' an early form of Buchanan's 'Detection.' The 'Book of Articles' occupies <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> closely printed pages, in Hosack, who first published it, and is written in Scots.[308] The band for Bothwell's marriage is said to have been made at Holyrood, and Mary's signature is declared to have been appended later. This mysterious band seems to have reached Cecil _unofficially_, and is marked 'To this the Queen gave consent the night before the marriage,' May 14 (cf. p. 254).

After the _Impregnable_, the frigates suffered the most, particularly the _Granicus_, which took a line-of-battle ship's station; and the _Leander_, which was much cut up by the Fish-market and other batteries, and as late as seven o'clock was obliged to carry out a hawser to _the Severn_, to enable her to bear her broadside upon one which annoyed her. The loss in the other line-of-battle ships was remarkably small. They had together but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> killed, including the casualties in their respective boats. Lord Exmouth escaped most narrowly. He was struck in three places; and a cannon-shot tore away the skirts of his coat. A button was afterwards found in the signal locker; and the shot broke one of the glasses and bulged the rim of the spectacles in his pocket. He gave the spectacles to his valued friend, the late gallant Sir Richard Keats, who caused their history to be engraven on them, and directed, that when he...", "...pole, is now enjoying the current. \"Really, something romantic?\" she asks, curiously. \"There was nothing romantic in the affair save his way of taking it,\" Katrine says, with a dry smile, \"and therefore the remembrance of this piece of his past may be particularly distasteful to him.\" \"Ah, but it was a married woman, was it not?

And this is the epitome of the Confederate battle. The army when it set out on the campaign was all that could be desired, (except that the arms were not all of the most approved pattern), but it was despoiled of two of its finest brigades, Jenkins's and Corse's of Pickett's division, and was fought out by detail. The greatest number engaged at any one time was on the first day, when <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> thousand engaged twenty thousand of the First and part of the Eleventh Corps. On the afternoon of the second day about seventeen thousand were engaged on the right, and at night about seven thousand on the left; then later at night about three thousand near the centre.

Wurmser had <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> thousand men in Mantua; but from fear and fever half of them were in the hospitals. Meanwhile, disaster had overtaken the French arms in the North. Jourdan had crossed the Rhine at Duesseldorf, as Moreau had at Kehl.

Let us now see what there is for us to learn from these facts. First of all, we may inquire why such conditions obtain. Why is it that the Oriental gets such low wages, and has such low earning power? \"An overcrowded population,\" somebody answers, \"in China, for example, four hundred million people--one fourth the human race--crowded within the limits...", "...their schemes of aggression was mixed strongly with that of enmity to Popery.

The Orinoco River, which flows through Venezuela, and whose drainage area is largely covered with mountains, has a greater fluctuation than any other river, the difference between high and low water amounting to seventy feet. The River Nile has an annual rise of from fourteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet. This river is the sole dependence of the inhabitants of lower Egypt, and their sustenance depends upon the height to which the river rises; if it does not rise high enough the agricultural lands are not sufficiently irrigated, and if it rises too high their crops are destroyed by the floods. In this section they depend entirely upon the overflow of the Nile for irrigation, and not upon the rainfall.

We were enabled during the year 1838, notwithstanding the continuance of our Indian embarrassments, somewhat to reduce this amount, and that for the present year (1839) will not in all probability exceed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> millions, or six millions less than it was last year. With a determination, so far as depends on me, to continue this reduction, I have directed the estimates for 1840 to be subjected to the severest scrutiny and to be limited to the absolute requirements of the public service.

Germany did her utmost to prevent it; for this assertion the world has documental proof. Often enough during the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of his reign has Wilhelm II. shown himself to be the upholder of peace, and often enough has this fact been acknowledged by our opponents. Nay, even the Kaiser they now dare to call an Attila has been ridiculed by them for years, because of his steadfast endeavors to maintain universal peace. Not till a numerical superiority which had been lying in wait on the frontiers assailed us did the whole nation rise to a man. _It is not true_ that we trespassed in neutral...", "...I can recall of anything in the line of his profession as an aeronaut that Donaldson ever undertook to do. This failure is not to be counted to his discredit, for precisely as a good soldier does not surrender until his last round of ammunition is spent, so Donaldson did not give in until his last pound of ballast was exhausted. In all respects the most brilliant aerial voyage ever made by Donaldson was his sixty-first ascension, on July 24, 1874, a voyage which continued for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> hours. This was the longest balloon voyage in point of hours ever made up to that time, and indeed it remained a world's record for endurance up in the air until 1900, and the endurance record in the United States, until the recent St. Louis Cup Race. The ascent was made from Barnum's \"Great Roman Hippodrome,\" which for some years occupied the site of what is now Madison Square Garden, in a balloon built by Mr. Barnum to attempt to break the record for time and distance...", "...of the English. What followed was war in its worst form, including the massacre of women and children.

The largest party contained a hundred and fourteen French and ninety- six Indians. It marched from Montreal against Schenectady, commanded by D'Aillebout de Mantet and Le Moyne de Sainte-Helene. The second party, proceeding from Three Rivers and numbering <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> French and twenty-nine Indians under the command of Francois Hertel, aimed at Dover, Pemaquid, and other settlements of Maine and New Hampshire. The Quebec party, under Portneuf, comprised fifty French and sixty Indians. Its objective was the English colony on Casco Bay, where the city of Portland now stands. All three were successful in accomplishing what they aimed at, namely the destruction of English settlements amid fire and carnage. All three employed Indians, who...", "...at the 'House,' but he'll be delighted to look you up.\" \"Thanks awfully.\" \"Holly's in--if you could put up with a female relation, she'd show you round.

These keys are held in position by springs. Under the keys is a cylinder having twenty-eight pins on it corresponding to the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> letters of the alphabet and a dot and a space. This cylinder was driven by some power. In those days it was by man-power. It was carried by a friction, so that it could be easily stopped by the depression of any one of the keys that interfered with one of the pins. One revolution of the cylinder would break and close the current twenty-eight times, making twenty-eight steps. The receiving-instrument consisted of a type-wheel and means for driving it.

Taking the length from the base of beak to the end of the tail as the standard of comparison, I find that, out of thirty-five birds of various breeds, twenty-five have wings of greater, and ten have them of less proportional length, than in the rock-pigeon. But from the frequently correlated length of the tail and wing-feathers, it is better to take as the standard {176} of comparison the length from the base of the beak to the oil-gland; and by this standard, out of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> of the same birds which had been thus measured, twenty-one had wings too long, and only five had them too short. In the twenty-one birds the wings exceeded in length those of the rock-pigeon, on an average, by 1-1/3 inch; whilst in the five birds they were less in length by only .8 of an inch. As I was much surprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so frequently have been increased in length, it occurred to me that it might be solely due to the greater...", "...\"Yes.

If we suppose him to have commenced prophesying two years before the death of Jeroboam, and then add the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> remaining years of Uzziah's reign, the sixteen of Jotham, the sixteen of Ahaz, and two of the first years of Hezekiah, we shall have a period of sixty-two years.

In the last of these Hosea, king of Israel, became tributary to Shalmaneser, king of Assyria; but he proved unfaithful to...", "...greater comfort. When extensive repairs have to be undertaken on iron or steel vessels, the fact that this dock forms part of an extensive shipbuilding plant, and is located right in the yard, enables such repairs to be executed with despatch and economy.

The steamship _Columbia_, of the Oregon Line, had practically a new bottom, including the whole of the keel, completed in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days. This is possible, because every facility is alongside the dock and the bottom of the vessel is on a level with the yard. This being the only hydraulic dock controlled automatically (in 1897), it has attracted a large amount of attention from engineering experts in this class of work. English, French, German, and Russian engineers have visited the Union Iron Works to study its working, and their reports have done much to bring the facilities offered to shipping for...", "...protection of a small force of the Sussex.

It was known that there was a considerable force of the enemy at Metemmeh, and as this would be augmented by the addition of the thousands of Arabs who had been engaged on the previous day, it was probable that, were the enemy aware of the advance of the force, a battle even more serious and desperate than the first would have to be fought before reaching the Nile.

Variation in the skulls of the series from Merida is relatively small. This applies to both males and females.

The difference in size of the two sexes appears to be uniformly greater than in weasels from Central America. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> topotypes show that the color and color pattern are relatively uniform. All are of nearly the same tone except juveniles or young which are, as in the case of _panamensis_, much brighter colored on the underparts. Also, the young have darker-colored upper parts. The adults, without exception, have numerous white hairs scattered over the back of the head, neck and between the shoulders. I have no trustworthy evidence to support the suggestion that these white hairs are the...", "...humor in print. However, publishing was a matter not lightly undertaken in those days. Mark Twain seems to have been rather pleased with the appearance of his first book. To Bret Harte he wrote: The book is out and is handsome. It is full of . . . errors....but be a friend and say nothing about those things. When my hurry is over, I will send you a copy to pizen the children with. The little cloth-and-gold volume, so valued by book-collectors to-day, contained the frog story and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> other sketches, some of which are still preserved in Mark Twain's collected works. Most of them were not Mark Twain's best literature, but they were fresh and readable and suited the taste of that period. The book sold very well, and, while it did not bring either great fame or fortune to its author, it was by no means a failure. The \"hurry\" mentioned in Mark Twain's letter to Bret Harte related to his second venture--that is to say, his New York lecture, an enterprise...", "...had been a life-long Whig.

And need I add, that, as the cold currents of blood come from both arms back into the vital organs, they play the mischief there? If you would preserve your child from croup, pneumonia, and a score of other grave affections, you should keep its arms warm. Thick woollen sleeves, fitting the little dimpled arms down to the hands, at least, constitute the true covering. A distinguished physician of Paris declared just before his death,--\"I believe that during the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years that I have practised my profession in this city, twenty thousand children have been borne to the cemeteries, a sacrifice to the absurd custom of naked arms.\" When in Harvard College, many years ago, I heard the eminent Dr. Warren say,--\"Boston sacrifices hundreds of babes every year by not clothing their arms.\" What has been said of the dress of children is none the less applicable to the dress of adults. One of the gravest mistakes in the dress of women is the...", "...Americans the advance was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Hamilton, with his own battalion and that of Colonel Gimat, the latter in the van; while Lieutenant-Colonel John Laurens, at the head of eighty men, took the garrison in reverse and cut off its retreat.

The French performed their part of the duty with equal gallantry, although from the greater strength of their opponents it was not done so quickly as that of the Americans. The German grenadier regiment of Deux-Ponts, led by Count William Forback de Deux-Ponts, led the column; and Captain Henry de Kalb, of that regiment, was the first officer who entered the work. The chasseur regiment of Gatinois supported the attack; and, in like manner with that on...", "...editor, because he once abused me. Many a man will retract praise; none but a high-spirited mind will revoke its censure, or _can_ praise the man it has once attacked. I have often, since my return to England, heard Jeffrey most highly commended by those who know him for things independent of his talents. I admire him for _this_--not because he has _praised me_, (I have been so praised elsewhere and abused, alternately, that mere habit has rendered me as indifferent to both as a man at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> can be to any thing,) but because he is, perhaps, the _only man_ who, under the relations in which he and I stand, or stood, with regard to each other, would have had the liberality to act thus; none but a great soul dared hazard it. The height on which he stands has not made him giddy:--a little scribbler would have gone on cavilling to the end of the chapter. As to the justice of his panegyric, that is matter of taste.

This picture was painted for William III. during Peter the Great's visit to England, in the early part of 1698, and probably in the house in Norfolk Street, where he took up his residence and lived in close seclusion. It is considered one of the best portraits of the Czar extant, and well portrays \"his stately form, his intellectual forehead, his piercing black eyes, and his Tartar nose and mouth.\" His age was then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years. He naturally excited the greatest curiosity, and became the principal topic of conversation. Every one was full of stories of him; \"of the immense quantities of meat which he devoured, the pints of brandy which he drank, the fool who jabbered at his feet, the monkey which grinned at the back of his chair,\" and last, but not least, of his filthy habits. When he went to stay at Evelyn's house, Sayes Court, at Deptford, in order to more...", "...terror of the Papal Bull, which assigned to Portugal an exclusive right to the Eastern Hemisphere, English, French, and Dutch adventurers hastened to share the spoils.

They were Methodists, and, as far as I can gather, a gentle and sincere piety gave refinement and purity of character. Mr. Branwell, the father, according to his descendants' account, was a man of musical talent. He and his wife lived to see all their children grown up, and died within a year of each other--he in 1808, she in 1809, when their daughter Maria was twenty- five or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years of age. I have been permitted to look over a series of nine letters, which were addressed by her to Mr. Bronte, during the brief term of their engagement in 1812. They are full of tender grace of expression and feminine modesty; pervaded by the deep piety to which I have alluded as a family characteristic. I shall make one or two extracts from them, to show what sort of a person was the mother of Charlotte Bronte: but first, I must state the circumstances under...", "...4,000 men nearly fifty days to make twenty-two miles of line, but the work had been done in such a way that when the autumn rains came on the track settled in many places; traffic on the lines became very dangerous; one of the bridges was washed away by the floods, and almost as many men had to be put on to do repairs as had previously been employed for the construction. Traffic of a very moderate description--each locomotive drawing only four wagons at a time--was carried on for just <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days, and then, happily for the engineers concerned, the developments in and around Metz rendered the line no longer necessary.

The most disappointing figures were those relating to submarines, trawlers and minesweepers. The case of the submarines may be put in another way, thus: In the June forecast <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> submarines were forecasted for delivery during the period July to the end of December, the dates of three, however, being somewhat uncertain; of this total of twenty-six, _only nine were actually delivered_.

Boone set his neighbors to talking, and by the time his family was ready to move to Kentucky, a number were fully as eager as he to go to the new country. The pioneer was chosen to lead them. They turned their backs forever upon North Carolina in the autumn of 1775, and facing westward, set out for their destination. When they reached Powell's valley, several other families were awaiting them, and, thus re-enforced, the company numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> men, four women, five boys and girls--quite a formidable force, when it is remembered they were under the leadership of Daniel Boone, to whom the trail had become so familiar during the preceding years.

There was a slave on Mr. Swan's plantation, by the name of Harry, who, during the absence of his master, ran away and secreted himself is the woods.

This alone threw the complex organization of a modern city into extraordinary confusion. The linemen struck. On June 21, telegraph operators in San Francisco and Oakland left their keys.

The diameter of this orbit, traversed at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles a second, is just 2,000,000 miles; and it is an easy further inference from the duration and extent of the phases exhibited that Algol itself must be (in round numbers) one million, its attendant 830,000 miles in diameter.

In Great Britain we have about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> cows for every square mile, and only one cow for every fifteen people. These figures indicate that in proportion to its population Australia is much more of a dairying country than Great Britain, but that in proportion to its area, it has developed the industry much less extensively, and is still capable of making enormous growth.

The father died, and Dorfling hastened to put the business into liquidation, and devote himself to philosophical studies.

I believe I can safely say that there is nowhere among the exceptions a more honorable class of men than those embraced in the fifth and eighth of these, nor a class that will more faithfully observe any obligation which they may take upon themselves. General Longstreet, in my opinion, stands high among this class.

Behind was the Stonewall Brigade in column of regiments. The guns were placed _en echelon_, the horses taken away, the ball opened with canister. Immediately the Federal guns answered, got the range of the grey, and began to do deadly mischief. All around young trees were cut off short.

Indeed, it seems as if those who attempt to teach reading by this method supposed that the chief object should be to make their pupils fluent in oral spelling; and it ends in spelling, usually, since children thus taught go on spelling out their words through all the reading lessons, and seldom become intelligent readers. They give their attention to the words, instead of the ideas intended to be represented by them.

KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER. This is considered the most honourable order of knighthood in Europe: it was founded by Edward III. in 1349; the fraternity consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> knights, to which are added the princes of the blood royal. The king of England is the sovereign of the order; their officers are a prelate, chancellor, registrar, and king-at-arms. The college of the order is in Windsor Castle, with the chapel of St. George and the chapter-house. These buildings were erected by the royal founder expressly for the accommodation of the knights of the garter. The garter is considered the principal ensign of this order: it is worn on the...", "...I therefore determined to get well to leeward of the spot where my calculations indicated that I ought to find them, and from there work to windward on an easy bowline, making stretches of some twenty-six miles in length. I had already ascertained the height of our royal yard above the sea-level, and from that had calculated that a lookout stationed at that elevation would command a circular area having a radius of thirteen miles. If, therefore, I made stretches across a circle of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles' diameter, I should practically command a belt of ocean of fifty-two miles in width; and this I deemed sufficient for my purpose. Accordingly, having reached our cruising-ground at two bells in the forenoon watch, and having one hand on the royal yard as a lookout, with two more on the topsail yard by way of additional precaution, we made our first reach of thirteen miles in a south-easterly direction. Then, nothing being in sight, we tacked and stood to the...", "...it has never been from the love of false glory, nor to seize the territories of others, but to punish those who have dared to provoke him.

This service is rendered by the Intercolonial Royal Mail-packet Company, with a fleet of four strong steamers, for 22,000_l._ annually. Of course, this company only performs the journeys between Sydney in New South Wales and Auckland in New Zealand. The nearest point from England is Calais, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles from Dover. Notwithstanding the extraordinary length of some of the journeys of the different mail packets, the Postmaster-General informs us that, except in case of accident, the packets, even when late, arrive within a few hours of their time, sometimes within a few minutes.

By a very narrow vote the resolution was carried, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> to twenty-three, a number of Marx's oldest and most devoted followers voting against the proposition.

For instance, a spot near the equator of the sun took twenty-five days to make the circuit, while one higher up or lower down took <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days, and one further out twenty-seven; so that if these spots are, as certainly believed, actually on the surface, the conclusion is that the sun does not rotate all in one piece, but that some parts go faster than others.

It makes no noise, does not disturb game or warn the enemy. Scouts should know how to shoot with bows and arrows, and they can make them for themselves.

At night all lodged upon the cold ground, wet and weary. Thus for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> days, day by day, the party travelled, over mountains, through tangled thickets, and across rivers and swamps, sometimes without any food but pieces of beaver skin, and enduring hardships, to which the Indians were accustomed, but which the poor captives could scarcely bear.

Carson joined this expedition, which was composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> mule wagons, some loose stock, and forty-two men. The boy was hired to help drive the extra animals, hunt game, stand guard, and to make himself generally useful, which, of course, included fighting Indians if any were met with on the long route.

The minimum water discharge into the Plata estuary would, every twenty-four hours, make a lake one mile square and 1,650 feet deep. About seventy-four per cent of it would represent the flow of the Parana, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> per cent that of the Uruguay River. These interlaced with the affluents of the Amazon along a line of fourteen degrees of longitude. The author sought to show that the Plata drainage area was, in a recent geological period, much more extensive than it is to-day; that its extreme northern limit was in 10 deg. 44' south latitude, and that nearly all the waters that now unite to form the Madeira River, the main affluent of the Amazon, once flowed southward into a Pampean sea...", "...him honourably, considerately.

This change of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> degrees was too much for comfort, but of little consequence compared to my subsequent experience. Instances have been known of a change of seventy degrees in twelve hours from a sudden shifting of the wind.

Since then the same gentleman reduced his own world-record to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> and one-fifth seconds; by this time even that record[B] may have been broken. The \"rubbing-stick\" is a picturesque, sensational and interesting method of building a fire, but to-day it is of little practical use outside of the fact that it teaches one to overcome obstacles, to do things with the tools at hand, to think and act with the vigor, precision and self-confidence of a primitive man.

Secondly, it seems to me that those persons who tell us that we ought never in any circumstances to contribute to the propagation of error do in fact lay down a rule which would altogether interdict the propagation of truth.

There are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> of these communities in New Mexico, and some of the cities were old when the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. When New Mexico was ceded to the United States by Mexico, the right of the Pueblo Indians to their towns and to certain tracts of land surrounding them was confirmed by treaty, so that these Indians are better off in many ways than any others. Mr. Armstrong had a special reason for visiting the Pueblos. He had purchased several large herds of cattle, and wished to...", "...that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the uninclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> rings of growth, had during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that as soon as the land was inclosed it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food. Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch fir; but in several...", "...had also \"climbed on a statue\" The Administration evidently hoped by lighter sentences to avoid a hunger strike by the prisoners.

He was born in Philadelphia a slave, and was taught to read and write, and occasionally to compound medicines for his master, who was a physician.

Early in life he showed an inclination toward botany, writing a book on _The Plants of the Pyrenees and Lower Languedoc_ which was published when he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old. For a time he studied law in which he showed considerable talent and where his original views attracted some attention. Later, however, he gave his attention to botany almost exclusively, joined the London Horticultural Society and the Linnaean Society, and was more or less closely connected with the workers at Kew. In connection with J. D. Hooker he wrote the _Genera Plantarum_. Others of his well-known works are _Flora Australiensis_ and _Handbook of the British...", "...descending the hill four or five whistled close past me.

Of the remainder, Stebbins saw seventeen and Carpenter, twenty-nine.

Should the venture of the crew of a brigantine prove successful, then the reis, or captain, might blossom out into the command of a galley, in which his oars would be manned by his slaves; but, in the first instance, he would man his brigantine with a crew of Moslem desperadoes working on the share system and dividing anything that they could pick up; in this manner most of those corsairs who became...", "...the Morteratsch from the Piz Languard, or from the new Bernina Road.

The moraine is in a state of longitudinal compression. Its materials are more and more squeezed together, and they must consequently move laterally and render the moraine at the terminal portion of the glacier wider than above.

A congressional committee which investigated conditions in Pennsylvania in 1888 found that prices charged in company stores ran from ten per cent. to 160 per cent. higher than prices in other stores in the vicinity, and that a workman was more likely to keep his position if he traded with the company. The most insistent cause of industrial conflict was the question of wages. Forty-one per cent. of all the strikes between 1881 and 1900 were for more pay; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> per cent., for shorter hours. Between the close of the war and the early nineties, industrial prosperity was widespread except for the period of prostration following 1873 and the less important depression of 1884.

The division to the east was named Ohio, that to the west Indiana; and Harrison was made Governor of the latter, with his residence at Vincennes.

For when the latter had conducted his new wife and her parents back to Arezzo, his own country, he might be able to find some opportune remedy for their necessities, by the assistance in Rome of Abate Paolo Franceschini his brother, an active and diligent man; thereby putting in order the patrimony of Pietro which had been sequestered and tied up by his creditors. Therefore, when the dowry had been set at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> bonds, with added hope of future succession to the rest of his property by virtue of the reversionary interest to which the wife was entitled, the bargain was accepted. This bargain was advantageous to Pietro and his wife in freeing them from the straits in which they found themselves. And it was likewise advantageous to the Franceschini, as the diligence of the Abate, and some temporary expenditure by their house well attests. For they might well believe that they would...", "...his homeward journey, traveling leisurely at first, for fear of arousing suspicion, but increasing his speed as he neared his destination.

The English possession of Gibraltar dates from August 4, 1704, and the deed rightly keeps alive the name of Rooke, to whose judgment and fearlessness of responsibility England owes the key of the Mediterranean. The Bourbon king of Spain at once undertook to retake the place, and called upon the French fleet in Toulon to support his attack. Tourville had died in 1701, and the fleet was commanded by the Count of Toulouse,--a natural son of Louis XIV., only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years old. Rooke also sailed eastward, and the two fleets met on the 24th of August off Velez Malaga. The allies were to windward with a northeast wind, both fleets on the port tack heading to the southward and eastward. There is some uncertainty as to the numbers; the French had fifty-two ships-of-the-line, their enemy probably half a dozen more. The allies kept away together, each ship for its opposite; there was apparently no attempt on Rooke's part at any tactical...", "...will be seen by reference to the map, of two and a half miles in breadth. This was its breadth at the time of the survey. But a careful observance of the topography of the banks on both sides of the river will show that it must have been originally not less than twice that breadth, and that the depressions now existing are the results of the denudation caused by the removal of the barrier. While this barrier was unbroken, Lake Erie as extended would have covered all land that was not <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> feet higher than the present level of the river at old Schlosser landing, since the water there is sixteen feet below the level of Lake Erie.

These were passed round, exchanged, and carried away as souvenirs of a friendly and interesting occasion.

The fan consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> blades of plain wood on which appear the signatures of such famous painters as Bastien-Lepage, Joseph Israels, Du Maurier, Legros, accompanied in most instances by characteristic sketches; and of such musical executants as Charles Halle, with, in several instances, the addition of a few bars of music. The sketches are dated 1879. The fan of Mrs. Arthur Lewis is a development of the same idea.

These conquests were achieved during the reigns of ten great Sultans, the average length of whose reigns is as much as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years, an unusual period for military sovereigns, and both an evidence of the stability, and a means of the extension, of their power. Then came the period of their decline, and we are led on through the space of another 270 years, up to our own day, when they seem on the verge of some great reverse or overthrow. In this second period they have had as many as twenty-one Sultans, whose average reigns are only half the length of those who preceded them, and afford as cogent an...", "...case.

But to do him justice he did not formulate these now, or in any wise explicitly recognize the favors he was bestowing. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> one does not naturally compute them in musing upon the girl to whom one is just betrothed; and Bartley's mind was a confusion of pleasure. He liked so well to think how fond of him Marcia was, that it did not occur to him then to question whether he were as fond of her.

[2] In the face of these facts, to talk of his \"_having come to New York a stranger some years ago, and finding the state in possession of two rich families_,\" &c. What absurdity! But,...", "...stadholder of these provinces, at their head, met with the deputies of Holland, Zealand, and the provinces between the Ems and the Lauwers, early in January, 1579, and on the 23rd of that month, without waiting longer for the deputies of the other provinces, they agreed provisionally upon a treaty of union which was published afterwards on the 29th, from the Town House of Utrecht. This memorable document--which is ever regarded as the foundation of the Netherland Republic--contained <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> articles. The preamble stated the object of the union. It was to strengthen, not to forsake the Ghent Pacification, already nearly annihilated by the force of foreign soldiery. For this purpose, and in order more conveniently to defend themselves against their foes, the deputies of Gelderland, Zutfen, Holland, Zealand, Utrecht, and the Frisian provinces, thought it desirable to form a still closer union. The contracting provinces agreed to remain eternally united, as if...", "...case, I stood back to the other shore; and, at eight o'clock the next morning, sent all the boats, and a party of men with an officer, to get wood from the place where I had landed two days before. We continued for a while to stand on and off with the ships; but, at length, came to an anchor in one-fourth less than five fathoms, half a league from the coast, the south point of which bore S. 26 deg. W.; and Bald Head, N. 60 deg. E., nine leagues distant. Cape Denbigh bore S. 72 deg. E., <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> miles distant; and the island under the east shore, to the southward of Cape Denbigh, named _Besborough Island_, S. 52 deg. E., fifteen leagues distant. As this was a very open road, and consequently not a safe station, I resolved not to wait to complete water, as that would require some time; but only to supply the ships with wood, and then to go in search of a more convenient place for the other article. We took off the drift-wood that lay upon the beach; and as the...", "...of--he and Mr. Ferguson would laugh over it together; but what an angel she was to think of it! All that night, in the journey over the mountains, he had lain in his berth and looked out at the stars, cursing himself joyously for a dumb fool who had had no words to tell her how he loved her for that sweet, divinely foolish proposal, which was \"not to be thought of\"! \"But when I see her, I'll make her understand; when I hold her in my arms--\" he told himself, with all the passion of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> years which had no easy outlet of speech. When Robert Ferguson's door opened, his heart was on his lips. \"Eliz--\" he began, and stopped short. \"Oh, Miss White. Good morning, Miss White!\" And before poor Cherry-pie knew it, he had given her a great hug; \"Where is Elizabeth? Not out of bed yet? Oh, the lazybones!\" He was so eager that, until he was fairly in the hall, with the front door shut, and his overcoat almost off, he did not notice her silence. Then he gave her a...", "...an increase of not less than 40 per cent in 7 years, during which the population only advanced 23 per cent. How much of this surplus produce may be expected to find its way into the English market, we do not pretend accurately to foretell; but when we find that, without the inducement of an unrestricted access to it, in 1846 America was able to raise her exports of grain to thirteen millions of bushels, from six millions in 1845; and in 1847, with only the preparation of a year, to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> millions, we think Lord Fitzwilliam is quite justified in taking it for granted that the price of corn in England will not rise above its present ruinous average. Attempts, no doubt, will be made to show that the emigration to California has deprived the Western States of the labour that is required to raise these enormous crops. Our answer is, that 300,000 souls were added by immigration to the population of the United States in 1849; and that our own emigration returns for...", "...the heavy ceiling of the cellar, like the small fire of a wood-pile in the steppe on a damp autumn night, when the gray sky is hanging over the earth like a leaden roof. Then another joined the singer, and now, two voices soar softly and mournfully over the suffocating heat of our narrow ditch. And suddenly a few more voices take up the song--and the song bubbles up like a wave, growing stronger, louder, as though moving asunder the damp, heavy walls of our stony prison. All the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> sing; loud voices, singing in unison, fill the workshop; the song has no room there; it strikes against the stones of the walls, it moans and weeps and reanimates the heart by a soft tickling pain, irritating old wounds and rousing sorrow. The singers breathe deeply and heavily; some one unexpectedly leaves off his song and listens for a long time to the singing of his companions, and again his voice joins the general wave. Another mournfully exclaims, Eh! sings, his eyes...", "...as fast as ever his tongue would say it. After a terrible time the wind settled down into a steady howl like a hungry wolf, and the children went to sleep, worn out with fright and conscious that the bedclothes could not keep out the cold. Dawn came. The children awoke, shivering. They sat up in bed and looked about them--yes, they did, the whole twenty-six of them in their different apartments and their different homes. And what do you suppose they saw--what do you suppose the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> flat children saw as they looked about them? Why, stockings, stuffed full, and trees hung full, and boxes packed full! Yes, they did! It was Christmas morning, and the bells were ringing, and all the little flat children were laughing, for Santa Claus had come! He had really come! In the wind and wild weather, while the tongues of the wind licked hungrily at the roof, while the wind howled like a hungry wolf, he had crept in somehow and laughing, no doubt, and chuckling,...", "...stock. June 14. And the next morning at daylight we left the bay, and, passing round the islands of Samow and Rottee, steered South-West by South (which was as close to the wind as we could steer to make a direct course) across the sea, which might, with some degree of propriety, be called the Great Australian Strait; but this course was too westerly to admit of our reaching the coast so far to the westward as was wished. June 19. On the 19th we passed over a coral bank with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-six</span> fathoms in latitude 19 degrees 30 minutes and longitude 116 degrees 15 minutes 30 seconds. The thermometer now ranged no higher than 76 1/2 degrees and obliged us to resume our warmer clothing. June 20. At eight o'clock the next morning land was seen bearing South-West by West, and proved to be that laid down by Captain Baudin, to the southward of the Montebello Islands; one of which, Trimouille Island, was also visible in the North-West. We bore up at noon,..."]
