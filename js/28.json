There is the most horrid collection of hedge-stakes, huge and knotted pieces of rails, of pokers, and hammers, of guns, and knives, and razors, with which murders have been perpetrated, each of which the jailer relates. There is a huge piece of a spar and a heavy stone with which one murderer...", "...movement began by throwing Crittenden's corps over the Cumberland Mountains and Walden's Ridge into the Tennessee Valley, directly opposite and to the north of Chattanooga.

To these bodies were added Minty's cavalry, which, riding on the left, through Sparta and Pikeville, operated along the river for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles above Blythe's Ferry. The boys in blue were bound to deceive the enemy if the thing could be done, and at night immense camp-fires were lighted for miles along the river front, always in front and to the north of Chattanooga. Foot-soldiers and cavalry showed themselves first at one place and then another, and at night bugle-calls sounded out in spots where no cavalry had yet been or was likely to be.

The commercial value of the foreign trade amounts to thirty-nine dollars in yearly average for each inhabitant of Sweden, which is about as much as in France. The imports chiefly consist of coal, coffee, salt, cotton and wool, while the exports are timber products, about forty per cent of the whole, iron and steel, the best in the world, machinery, butter, cattle, matches, etc. The inland navigation and commerce are very lively.

This fourth year was denominated _Bissextile_, because the sixth day before the Kalends of March was reckoned twice. It is also called Leap Year.

The different ways of dividing the shares originate from the different proportions of ownership. Sometimes a mine is divided into sixteen parts, each of which is a twenty-fourth and a forty-eighth; or it may be divided into thirty-two parts, each of which is a forty-eighth and half a seventy-second and a two hundred and eighty-eighth; or into sixty-four parts of which each share is one seventy-second and one five hundred and seventy-sixth; or finally, into one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> parts, any one of which is half a seventy-second and half of one five hundred and seventy-sixth. Now an iron mine either remains undivided or is divided into two, four, or occasionally more shares, which depends on the excellence of the veins.

Big yield alone is frequently no recommendation of a vegetable to the home gardener, but in this instance it does make a big difference; first, because Palmetto is equal to any other asparagus in quality, and second, because the asparagus bed is producing only a few weeks during the gardening season, and where ground is limited, as in most home gardens, it is important to cut this waste space down as much as possible....", "...so they bore up and stood to the E.S.E. in order to get an offing; for the weather threatened a storm, which however dissipated itself in rain.

The only inconsistency is, that Columbus states that Fernandina bore nearly west from Concepcion, and was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> leagues in extent. This mistake must have proceeded from his having taken the long chain of keys called La Cadena for part of the same Exuma; which continuous appearance they naturally assume when seen from Concepcion, for they run in the same S.E. and N.

With Cook's visit the geographical exploration of the coast began in 1778. Vancouver, in 1792-1794, surveyed almost the entire coast of British Columbia with much of that to the north and south, for the British government. The interior, about the same time, was entered by Mackenzie and traders of the N.W. Company, which in 1821 became amalgamated with the Hudson's Bay Company. For the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years the Hudson's Bay Company ruled this immense territory with beneficent despotism. In 1849 Vancouver Island was proclaimed a British colony. In 1858, consequent on the discovery of gold and the large influx of miners, the mainland territory was erected into a colony under the name of British Columbia, and in 1866 this was united with the colony of Vancouver Island, under the same name. In 1871 British Columbia entered the confederation and became part of the Dominion...", "...the constitution so that young men over twenty years of age, if at school, could participate in games held under the rules of the N.E.I.S.A.A.

There the Christian Church was early established, and the popes are to- day the successors of St. Peter. For hundreds and hundreds of years, Italy was the beggar of the world, and to her, from every land, flowed streams of gold and silver. The country was covered with convents, and monasteries, and churches, and cathedrals filled with monks and nuns. Its roads were crowded with pilgrims, and its dust was on the feet of the world.

In his opinion the only conclusive and irrepealable way to make an end of slavery was by an amendment of the Constitution, and the only practical question remaining was whether the resolution recommended by the committee could secure a two-thirds vote in Congress and the concurrence of three fourths of the states. There were thirty-five states, including those in rebellion, and two territories about to become states. Presumably the affirmative votes of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> states would be required for ratification. In this speech Trumbull gave public expression to his feelings regarding the feeble prosecution of the war to which he had given private expression in the letters to friends referred to in the preceding chapter.

The estate of Deogon, containing thirty-seven villages, belonged to a family of Bys Rajpoots. Rostam Khan and his gang seized upon them all, and turned out the Rajpoot proprietors, and by force made three of them Musulmans, Kanhur, Bhooree, Geesee; and all their descendants are of the same creed. Imam Buksh, the father of Bhoree Khan, built a fort in Deogon, which the _family_ still held. In 1829, Rajah Dursun Sing took the mortgage of the estate for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> thousand one hundred and ten rupees, to enable Imam Buksh to liquidate a balance of revenue due to Government. When the time of payment came, in 1832, Imam Buksh could pay nothing; and he transferred the estate to Dursun Sing, on a deed of sale or bynama. He continued to manage the estate for Dursun Sing in farm; but, falling in balance, he was put into confinement, where he remained till he died, three years after, in the year 1842. Bhooree Khan was then a boy, but he...", "...big enough to quarter a regiment, insomuch that each member of the family, including servants, has a separate suite of apartments, and there are vast wildernesses of upper rooms into which we have never yet sent exploring expeditions.

I say it myself lest other competent persons should forget to do it. It appears that four of my ancient letters were sold at auction, three of them at twenty-seven dollars, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> dollars, and twenty-nine dollars respectively, and the one above mentioned at forty-three dollars. There is one very gratifying circumstance about this, to wit: that my literature has more than held its own as regards money value through this stretch of thirty-six years. I judge that the forty-three-dollar letter must have gone at about ten cents a word, whereas if I had written it to-day its market rate would be thirty cents--so I have increased in value two or three...", "...The ancient stained glass of Notre Dame is represented by three magnificent rose windows.

It is in the form of a Grecian temple, surrounded by Corinthian columns, and the flight of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> steps by which one approaches the church, extends across its entire breadth.

In my predictions in 1880 I said that the time was not then far off when the farmers of the Mississippi Valley would secure as large a remuneration from their wheat at thirty-four shillings per quarter in London as they had been gaining from a previous average of fifty-two shillings. I might then have fixed the lessened price at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> shillings, and at the present time I have a greater expectation of a reduction in the price of wheat in Mark Lane to less than twenty-eight shillings a quarter, or eighty-five cents a bushel, than I had in 1880 that it would so soon reach thirty-four shillings.

Among the Chaldaeans or Accadians we find no sign of the number twenty-eight. The ecliptic, or \"yoke of the sky,\" with them, as we see in the newly-discovered tablet, was divided into twelve divisions, as now, and the only connection that can be imagined between this and the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> is the opinion of M.

He went and gave the information, not only to the Winnebagoes, but to the Menomonees, that they might be prepared. The party soon followed, killed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> Menomonees, and made their escape.

He was called back, and invited to go on board as one of themselves; but he declined familiar intimacy[91] through fear of God, because they were Gentiles. In three days they disembarked in a desert land, through which they travelled for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, and were well nigh starving, until relieved at the prayer of Patrick. Reference is then made to the great stone that seemed to fall upon him in a dream, from the weight of which he was relieved by invoking Elias. It seems, too, that he fell into a second captivity, which continued for two months; but the text here is uncertain, and can scarcely be relied on. He succeeded, however, in reaching the home of his parents in Britain--in Britannis--and they most earnestly...", "...days return it with their objections to the house in which it originated, which should enter the objections at large in its minutes, and proceed to reconsider the bill; and that it should not become a law unless re-passed by a vote of two-thirds of the members of each house.

One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> of them were returned by the Council with their objections, and only seventeen of these received the two-thirds vote necessary to re-enact them.[Footnote: Poore, \"Charters and Constitutions,\" II, 1332, 1333, note.] An obvious objection to this method of legislation is that the judges who, as members of a council of revision, find nothing objectionable in a bill presented for their scrutiny, must naturally have a certain pride of opinion to conquer before, should its...", "...battalions and six squadrons, and that the city of Stade cannot absolutely contain the garrison of six thousand men allotted to it, his excellency the mareschal duke de Richelieu, being pressed by M. de Lynar, who supported this representation by the guarantee of his Danish majesty, gives his consent; and his royal highness the duke of Cumberland engages to cause fifteen battalions and six squadrons to pass the Elbe, and the whole body of hunters, and the remaining ten battalions and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> squadrons shall be placed in the town of Stade, and the places nearest to it that are within the line, which shall be marked by posts from the mouth of the Liche in the Elbe, to the mouth of the Elmerbeck in the river Oste; provided always, that the said ten battalions and twenty-eight squadrons shall be quartered there as they are at the time of signing this convention, and shall not be recruited under any pretext, or augmented in any case; and this clause is particularly...", "...of his ship at a moment when his plans were so flourishing and he had every reason to congratulate himself as to the ultimate success of the undertaking, it is much in his favor that he seems to have realized their unfortunate position and to have been determined to make the best of it.

On examining it, they found there was a hundred and fifty pounds of bread, thirty-two pounds of pork, six quarts of rum, six bottles of wine, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> gallons of water. As they were so near Tofoa they determined to put in there for a supply of breadfruit and water, so that they might keep their other provisions. But after rowing along the coast for some time, they only discovered some cocoanut trees on the top of a stony cliff, against which the sea beat furiously. After several attempts they succeeded in getting about twenty nuts. The second day they failed to get anything at all.

Thus every artery and vein of the economic organism of Italy is swathed and pressed and choked by this German isolator, which nobody dares to pull away.

If the letters are good, you shall be paid for them; but don't write _until you know something_.\" July 1, 1844, Bayard and two young friends, after paying ten dollars each for steerage passage, started out for this eventful voyage. No wonder that, as land faded from sight, and he thought of gentle Mary Agnew and his devoted mother, his heart failed him, and he quite broke down. After <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days they landed in Liverpool, strangers, poor, knowing almost nothing of the world, but full of hope and enthusiasm. They spent three weeks in Scotland and the north of England, and then travelled through Belgium to Heidelberg. Bayard passed the first winter in Frankfort, in the plainest quarters, and then, with his knapsack on his back, visited Leipzig, Dresden, Prague, Vienna, and Munich. After this he walked over the Alps, and through Northern Italy, spending four...", "...months earlier. A fleet of one hundred and fifty Dutch ships joined in the battle from the sea side, while a strong force of Flemings, English and Dutch from Antwerp attacked the dyke from the land side. After a fierce struggle it was cut, the waters rushed through and one vessel loaded with provisions for the beleaguered city made its way past. That night Antwerp rejoiced, but in the darkness the Prince of Parma made another furious assault and finally drove back the allies, capturing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> ships of the Dutch fleet and filling in the dyke once more. This victory--which as a feat of arms was one of the most brilliant of the war--sealed the fate of the city, which finally capitulated August 17th. So important was this success to the Spanish, cause that Isabella, the daughter of King Philip, was awakened by her father during the night by the tidings, \"Antwerp is ours!\" Its fall settled approximately the extent of the region that was left to the Spanish Crown out...", "...of all its bearings, it will be lucky indeed if any trace of the original groundwork remains distinguishable.\" Lady Mary's most redoubtable assailants were Pope and Horace Walpole, and both were biassed. The story of Pope's quarrel with her is told in the following pages. Walpole, it has been suggested, disliked her much because she had championed his father's mistress, Molly Skerritt, against the mother to whom he was devoted. Pope, of course, knew her well; but Walpole, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years her junior, only met her in her late middle age. Walpole's prejudice was so great what when Lady Mary said, \"People wish their enemies dead--but I do not. I say, give them the gout, give them the stone,\" he reported it solemnly. Of course, it is not to be assumed that Lady Mary had not her full share of malice--she was undoubtedly well equipped with that useful quality--and she did not turn the other cheek when she was assailed. She could even stand up to the...", "...we sell the cotton to these very people cheaper than they can produce it themselves, and they buy it therefore with eagerness. Nearly twenty years after Arkwright had begun to spin by machinery, that is in 1786, the price of a particular sort of cotton-yarn much used in the manufacture of calico was thirty-eight shillings a pound. That same yarn in 1832 was two shillings and eleven pence a pound. In 1814 the selling price of a piece of calico distinguished by the trade as 72-7/8 was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> shillings; in 1844 it was six shillings and nine pence. It is probably less at this day. If cotton goods were worn only by the few rich, as they were worn in ancient times, and even in the latter half of the last century, that difference of price would not be a great object; but the price is a very important object when every man, woman, and child in the United Kingdom has to pay it. Calico is four times as cheap as it was forty years ago. There are no very certain data for...", "...August 4, 1861. \"I reached here yesterday, dearest Mary, to visit this portion of the army.

Also the abbot was wont, as were his predecessors, at the end of every twenty weeks to give seven shillings for the guard of the castle of Norwich out of his own purse, for default of three knights, whose fees Roger Bigot holds of St. Edmund. Each of the knights of four constabularies used to give twenty-eight pence when they entered to perform their guards, and one penny to the marshal who collected those pence; and they were accustomed to give <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pence and no more, because the ten knights of the fifth constabulary ought to assist the other forty, so that whereas they ought to have given three shillings entire, they only gave twenty-nine pence, and he whose duty it was to enter to perform his guard service at the end of four months, entered at the end of twenty weeks.

Assuming the principle of rotation from a contemporary description, some eighteen settlers held the positions of authority during the years noted.[19] The cases reviewed reveal the names of five of these eighteen. Recognizing the limitations of our <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> per cent sampling, however, it is interesting to note that the three major national stocks are represented in this restricted sample. Furthermore, as was mentioned previously,[20] the Scotch-Irish settlers, being in the majority, enjoyed the majority representation on the tribunal.

A little quiet conversation passed between them, and the cash-box was then emptied out into my hand; it contained <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> Hamburg shillings, equal to two shillings in English money. I returned to my hotel and slept in a good bed that night. The morning broke heavily, and promised a day's rain. Through the lowering weather and the dismal streets I went to the police office to get my passport _vised_ for Schwerin in Mecklenburg. Most dismal streets!

I suspect that the Member for East Nottingham will presently get up and say that this mischief connected with the Colonisation Act accounted for the disturbance.

On the contrary, it rather looks as if there was a deliberate heating of the public atmosphere preparatory to the agrarian...", "...wish of 'Boz.'\" On the Christmas Eve of 1863 my father was greatly shocked and distressed to hear of the sudden death of Mr. Thackeray. Our guests, naturally, were full of the sad news, and there was a gloom cast over everything.

In these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> colossal choruses we perceive at once a reaction against and a triumph over the tastes of the age. The wonder is, not that the 'Israel' was unpopular, but that it should have been tolerated; but Handel, while he appears to have been for years driven by the public, had been, in reality, driving them. His earliest oratorio, 'Il Trionfo del Tempo' (composed in Italy), had but two choruses; into his operas more and more were introduced, with disastrous consequences; but when,...", "...a main central corridor runs the whole length of the United States Section.

Suddenly, in the twilight the men in the second sambuk felt a shock, then another, and a third. The water poured into it rapidly. It had run upon the reef of a small island, where the smaller sambuk had been able to pass on account of its lighter draft. Soon the stranded boat began to list over, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> men aboard had to sit on the gunwale. \"We could scarcely move,\" narrated Lieutenant Gerdts, who commanded the stranded boat. \"The other boat was nowhere in sight.

Yet he is an old school friend; the only one of my <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> classmates whose acquaintance I have kept up. Four are dead, twenty-three others are scattered about in obscure country places; lost for want of news, as they say at the private inquiry offices. Larive makes up the twenty-eight. I used to admire him, when we were low in the school, because of his long trousers, his lofty contempt of discipline, and his precocious intimacy with tobacco. I preferred him to the good, well-behaved boys.

Our vessel was equipped with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> guns, twenty marines, and two hundred and twenty passengers, including those whom the Company sent as free passengers. Soon after we came to an anchor under the Cape of Barfleur, there to join seven other ships of the same West India Company which were to come from Dieppe, under convoy of a man-of-war, mounted with thirty-seven guns and two hundred and fifty men. Of these ships two were bound for Senegal, five for the Caribbee Islands, and ours for Tortuga.

The mother's face is youthful and radiant with divine beauty: the Infant Jesus stands upon her knee, and extends a plump little hand in benediction. Next, a portrait of uncle painted in 1839--two years earlier than the one that hangs in the dining-room. This picture, mamma says, was an excellent likeness of him when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old; and the biographers who are so prone to describe him in his younger days as having been \"uncouth\" and \"awkward,\" would be, I think, much startled if they could see it. His coat is black, with a black tie, like other gentlemen, and his air, instead of being \"rustic\" or \"gawky,\" is expressive of gentle dignity, while his face, so often described as plain, is to me beautiful enough to have represented a young saint. Next these pictures is another medallion--the...", "...is no God.\" The old methods of their interpretation of the Scriptures have been abandoned in many particulars. This is the result of two things: first, progression in scientific knowledge; and, second, the Bible was always ahead of science in its scientific allusions. Now, it is known to scientists that there is, at the lowest calculation, forty-eight times more water in our seas and oceans than Keill was willing to allow when he made the objection that it would require the waters of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> oceans to give us Noah's flood. The objection was, \"there is not water enough.\" Men seemed to think that the earth contained the water; that the water was standing in the earth. This was very natural, for people generally live upon the land. The Bible, however, presented a different idea, saying, the earth was \"standing out of the water and in the water.\" When the Scriptures speak upon this subject they refer to the waters just as a man would who never had any misgivings...", "...a dress could be from twenty dollars the garment up to a hundred and fifty.\" \"We have dresses here as high as three hundred!\" Miss Holzmeyer snapped. She had discerned that she was beginning to be embarrassed in the presence of this self-possessed benedick of youthful appearance, and she resented it accordingly. \"I ain't doubting it for a minute,\" Elkan replied. \"New York is full of suckers, Miss Holzmeyer; but me and my wife is looking for something from twenty-two-fifty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> dollars, Miss Holzmeyer.\" Miss Holzmeyer's temper mounted with each repetition of her surname, and her final \"Step this way, please!\" was uttered in tones fairly tremulous with rage. Elkan obeyed so leisurely that by the time Mrs. Feinermann and he had reached the rear of the showroom Miss Holzmeyer had hung three dresses on the back of a chair. \"H'allow me,\" Elkan said as he took the topmost gown by the shoulders and held it up in front of him. He shook out the...", "...I passed along our lines to the extreme left, to General Garrard's head-quarters, where I left my papers, and procured a pass through the lines.

In the morning I resumed my journey, on a road leading south, and halted for the night at a small village on the Chattahoochee River, called Roswell Factories, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles from Canton. The next morning a division of South Carolina cavalry came along from the east, just as I was ready to start out. I fell in and attached myself to company A, of the 1st South Carolina, and represented myself as belonging to the 11th Texas Cavalry--which I knew was in our front when I started out--going to join my command. The explanation proved satisfactory, and I kept along with them till we reached Marietta, a distance from Roswell Factories of...", "...declared fervently. \"A kid like him should be my husband!

But the two leaders are never exchanged in this way. They are the driver's favorites, and are too valuable to risk in such a trade. Even if their master is starving he will not part with his leaders. About five miles out, we met a team of dogs going up-country. We stopped simultaneously to exchange news, and inside of ten seconds one of our dogs made a jump at one of the other team. This was the signal, and in an instant all the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> dogs were at it tooth and nail in one grand scrimmage. After beating them unmercifully, the drivers were able to separate the two teams, and we found that three of our dogs were limping. I then learned that in a fight the Siberian dog does not make for his antagonist's throat, but for his feet, for he seems to know that injury to that member is the most serious that can happen to a sledge-dog. It was amusing to see with what deftness they would draw their feet back from...", "...eulogium passed upon him by Libanius. The choice of a layman by the emperor shows that an ecclesiastic at that time had not the qualities indispensable for a task so delicate. In fact, St. Augustine remarks that a bishop of Bresse, called Philastrius, whose work is to be found in the collection of the fathers, having collected all the heresies, even including those which existed among the Jews before the coming of Jesus Christ, reckons twenty-eight of the latter and one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> from the coming of Christ; while St. Epiphanius, comprising both together, makes the whole number but eighty. The reason assigned by St. Augustine for this difference is, that what appears heresy to the one, does not appear so to the other. Accordingly this father tells the Manichaeans: \"We take the greatest care not to treat you with rigor; such conduct we leave to those who know not what pains are necessary for the discovery of truth, and how difficult it is to avoid...", "...the canoes were themselves dragged overland; elsewhere they were run down empty, shipping a good deal of water. At the foot of the cataract, where we dragged the canoes overland, we camped for the night. Here Kermit shot a big cayman.

One of his men, working on the Gy-Parana, got lost and after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days found himself on the Madeirainha, which he thus discovered. He was in excellent health, for he had means to start a fire, and he found abundance of Brazil-nuts and big land-tortoises. Senhor Caripe said that the rubbermen now did not go above the ninth degree, or thereabouts, on the upper Aripuanan proper, having found the rubber poor on the reaches above. A year previously five rubbermen, Mundurucu Indians, were working on the Corumba at about that level.

In consequence of this rarity of the air, a pistol, heavily charged, which we fired several times, made scarcely more noise than the crack of a postillion's whip.

They are ranked as varieties, rather than species, just because of their less definiteness. Singular as it may appear, we have heard it denied that spontaneous varieties occur.

Her features resembled Fanny's, but had a much less amiable expression, and betokened, if the thing were possible, an inferior intellect.

From these causes, and also from the immense quantity of waste heat which escapes through the smoke-box and up the funnels, there has always been a theoretical loss of steam power amounting to forty per cent., as [Page 438] compared with the coal consumed. It is this loss of power and waste of heat which the superheating process is intended to prevent, and which will, of course, allow a reduction of from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> to thirty per cent. on the fuel now consumed. By the superheating process the steam is raised in passing along the pipes in the smoke-box (where the heat is about 650 deg.) from a temperature of 250 deg. to 350 deg., and so enters the cylinders at 100 deg. in excess of the temperature due to its pressure. This extra heat is, of course, rapidly communicated to the metals, and prevents the condensation in the cylinders or other parts of the engines, which would otherwise, of...", "...cedar horns broke the stillness of the beautiful mountain village.

In reality, his age did not exceed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years; but his high broad forehead was already so marked with line and furrow, his air was so staid and quiet, his figure so destitute of the roundness and elasticity of youth, that his appearance always impressed the beholder with the involuntary idea of a man considerably more advanced in life.

On my way I had met a man who said he would charge <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> roubles each for our journey to London. So Kazelia was evidently afraid I might yet fall into honester hands. Then we began to talk with him of London, for it is better to deal with the devil you know than the devil you don't know.

The metal is unbearably hot still, and it is small wonder when it is realised that it has travelled <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles, and risen and dropped thirty-three thousand feet in a little over a minute. Though it is only the base-plug, it is some twelve inches across, and later, when cold, requires removal in a wheelbarrow into which two men can scarcely lift it.

But after the first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days of every lunar month, the weekly reckoning must have been discontinued for about a day and a half (when the new moon was what was called \"in coitu,\" or invisible), after which a new reckoning of sevens would recommence.

The large dark eyes that lit his pale face expressed this wickedness strongly, though such was the adaptability of their rays that one could think they might have expressed sadness or seriousness just as readily, if he had had a mind for such.

There would remain 160 transport ships for the Gaulish and Roman chiefs, the valets, and the provisions.

Thus, the year came to be divided into twelve months; and, since the moon presents four phases in each month, first quarter, full moon, last quarter, and new moon--an observation which long antedates astronomical calculation--the month was at once divided into four parts. Since the month has approximately <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, the result was a _week_, comprising _seven days_. This number, therefore, was not, as has sometimes been erroneously assumed, derived from the seven planets. Rather is it true, conversely, that the number of the planets was, with a certain arbitrariness, first fixed at seven after this number, as well as twelve, had come to be regarded as _sacred_, because of its relation to the movements of the sun and moon.

His connection with the Prince lasted until 1790, and was only terminated by the latter's death. But during this period of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years his musical activity was unceasing; and as he had an orchestra of his own, and his patron was ardently devoted to music, the incentive to composition was never lacking.

Two undertakings chiefly focused the group activity of the Transcendentalists. The first of these was the _Dial_, a quarterly publication which ran for sixteen numbers, 1840-1844. The so-called Transcendental Club, an informal group of kindred spirits, came toward the end of the thirties to the point where they felt the need of an \"organ\" of their own. After much discussion they undertook the publication of this journal of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pages to an issue. For the first two years it was under the editorship of Margaret Fuller. When her strength failed under this extra voluntary task, Emerson, with the help of Thoreau, took charge for the remaining two years. Its paid circulation was very small, never reaching two hundred and fifty, and finally, when in the hands of its third set of publishers, it had to be discontinued, Emerson personally meeting the final small deficit.

Hence the Kalmucks are continually on the move to find fresh pasture for their cattle, and seldom remain in one spot for more than a month or six weeks. But the most serious obstacle to agriculture is the want of fresh water.

The cold, too, is as intolerable as the heat: for four months the thermometer is almost always steady at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> degrees of Reaumur in the shade, and very often it rises to thirty-two; then when winter sets in it falls to twenty-eight degrees below zero. Thus, there is a difference of nearly sixty degrees between the winter and the summer temperature.

Still more remarkable is the rise in the population of Java from five millions in 1825 to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> and a half millions in the first decade of this century. The cause of this increase is the augmented supply of food combined with a very low standard of living, a combination which is specially characteristic of Asia, where extreme supersaturation exists in India and China.

The outer door opened, and a young man in a priest's long robe came in. Bird introduced his guest, and Northwick shook hands with the priest, who had a smooth, regular face, with beautiful, innocent eyes, like a girl's. He might have been <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> or twenty-nine; he had the spare figure of a man under thirty who leads an active life; his features were refined by study and the thought of others. When he smiled the innocence of his face was more than girlish, it was childlike. Points of light danced in his large, soft, dark eyes; an effect of trusting, alluring kindness came from his whole radiant visage. Northwick felt its charm with a kind of fear. He shrank away from the priest, and at the table he left the talk...", "...which we know no parallel. It reminds us of the career of John Wesley, whose simplicity and frugality of habits enabled him not only to limit his own expenditure to a very small sum, but whose Christian liberality and unselfishness prompted him to give all that he could thus save to purely benevolent objects. While he had but thirty pounds a year, he lived on twenty-eight and gave away forty shillings. Receiving twice as much the next year, he still kept his living expenses down to the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pounds and had thirty-two to bestow on the needy; and when the third year his income rose to ninety pounds, he spent no more than before and gave away sixty-two. The fourth year brought one hundred and twenty, and he disbursed still but the same sum for his own needs, having ninety-two to spare. It is calculated that in the course of his life he thus gave away at least thirty thousand pounds, and four silver spoons comprised all the silver plate that he possessed when the...", "...This woman could neither cook her own food nor make her own clothes, nor was she engaged in any social, political, or intellectual or artistic labour. Though able to dance for a night or play tennis for an afternoon, she was yet hardly able to do her own hair or attire herself, and appeared absolutely to have lost all power of compelling herself to do anything which was at the moment fatiguing or displeasing, as all labour is apt to be, however great its ultimate reward. In a life of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years this woman had probably not contributed one hour's earnest toil, mental or physical, to the increase of the sum total of productive human labour. Surrounded with acres of cultivable land, she would possibly have preferred to lie down and die of hunger rather than have cultivated half an acre for food.

Juillerat and Olivier Desmonts, the first a young man, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years of age, the second an old man of seventy. The entire weight of the ministry had fallen during this period of proscription on M. Juillerat, who had accepted the task and religiously fulfilled it. It seemed as if a special providence had miraculously protected him in the midst of the many perils which beset his path. Although the other pastor, M. Desmonts, was president of the Consistory, his life was in much less danger; for, first, he had reached an age which...", "...He knew the voices of the forests and of the streams; he had a theory that the world was but a huge animal; that if we were but wise enough to understand, we should hear from Nature's own voices the story of the world and hear revealed all her profound secrets.

One man of the many who competed in this trial of skill performed the whole operation in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> seconds from the time the steer was loosed to the time its legs were secured. A more daring feat is \"bull-dogging.\" The steer is loosed as before, and the cattleman rides after it, but instead of lassoing it, he leaps straight out of his saddle and plunges on to the horns of the beast.

Defeating a superior force of Royalists in several engagements, he made a junction with the revolutionary army, and speedily drove the enemy out of the Northern provinces. It was a far harder task, however, to overcome the jealousy and incompetence of Torres, then in chief command; and Mina, betrayed by his allies, fell into the hands of Viceroy Apodaca, who had him immediately executed, with twenty-five of his followers, on November 11, 1817. Mina was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old when he ended his career, but he had given proofs of rare worth as a soldier and a patriot. Among the Americans who shared his fortunes was Colonel Perry, of New Orleans.

The fortifications consisted of a rampart of stone, nearly 36 feet in height, and a ditch eighty feet wide. There were six bastions, and three batteries, with embrasures for 148 cannon and 6 mortars.

In 1689, during the panic that followed the Iroquois invasion of Montreal, Du Lhut, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> Canadians, attacked twenty-two Iroquois in canoes, received their fire without returning it, bore down upon them, killed eighteen of them, and captured three, only one escaping.

Against the opposition and contempt of the post-office department he at length carried his point, and on January 10, 1840, penny postage was established throughout Great Britain.

The convention assembled on the first day of June, and terminated its labours on the ninth day of October. It was an able body of men. It did not contain, perhaps, so many distinguished citizens as its predecessor in 1821, but, like the convention of a quarter of a century before, it included many men who had acquired reputations for great ability at the bar and in public affairs during the two decades immediately preceding it.

But under the pressure of a column of water one thousand feet high, giving a pressure of four hundred and thirty-two pounds to the square inch at the bottom, water becomes steam, if at all, only by great heat.

Then again, the Mississippi has floods every year or twice a year, and in some years three times, such as most rivers never have. This is because it carries in a single channel the water from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> states and a territory, as we saw on the map one day up the river. Now as soon as the river mud forms a bar that shows above water, vegetation begins to grow on it. When the next flood comes, it covers the new-made land and builds it higher by depositing a great deal more mud on top of it and among the vegetation, which, by checking the current at the bottom, helps the mud to lodge there. In that way, all the lowlands for hundreds of miles along this river were created. It...", "...the alignment and grades are more favorable. From the tunnel to the Deerfield River crossing, below Shelburne Falls, a distance of twenty-two miles, there is but one ascending grade going east; its location is about two miles west of the falls; it is one-half mile in length, and is thirty-five feet to the mile. Within the same space going east, there are the following descending grades, to wit: One of forty-five feet per mile for 2,000 feet, one of forty feet for 6,000 feet, one of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> feet for 2,500 feet, and one, near the village of Shelburne Falls, of fifty feet per mile for 5,300 feet.

In the later books this sensation becomes almost painful, and it is because the earlier publications, the _Atalanta_ and the first _Poems and Ballads_, contain more of definable human emotion, whatever their relation to fact may be, that they are likely to remain the most popular and significant of Swinburne's works.

Although the gross expenditure under the Reclamation Act is not yet as large as that for the Panama Canal, the engineering obstacles to be overcome have been almost as great, and the political impediments many times greater. The Reclamation work had to be carried on at widely separated points, remote from railroads, under the most difficult pioneer conditions. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> projects begun in the years 1902 to 1906 contemplated the irrigation of more than three million acres and the watering of more than thirty thousand farms. Many of the dams required for this huge task are higher than any previously built anywhere in the world. They feed main-line canals over seven thousand miles in total length, and involve minor constructions, such as culverts and bridges, tens of thousands in number. What the Reclamation Act has done for the country is...", "...The Duras was an ancient Indiaman with a high poop, which made my grandfather exclaim, when he saw her, at the remarkable fulfilment of old Stanwix's prophecy.

In late years, however, the interest in the study of these languages has grown so much that Honour Courses and Examinations in them have been established at all our Universities. The result is that a book even intended for beginners can now reasonably be expected to be of a higher standard than the previous...", "...latitude, six degrees below zero was the lowest the mercury reached, up to the middle of February. This is saying much in favor of its winter climate, when we consider the fact that in the rest of the State it has often been from zero down to forty below for nearly a month at a time. I do not remember such another month in years,--wind, snow, fires, intense cold, and disease, all combined. However, in spite of everything, the people turned out remarkably well, and I managed to preach <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> times, besides giving talks to the children. It took twelve hours of hard driving to make the forty miles between home and the appointment, and we were only just in time for the services. I was surprised to see the number present; but what looked to me like impassable drifts were nothing to people who had sat on the top of the telegraph-poles, and walked in the up-stairs windows off from a snow-bank, as they actually did four winters previously. The church here has a...", "...and loved that we ought not to be surprised at his passion for that creature. All passions lead to excess. My own life is not without reproach of that kind, and yet I call myself an honest woman. A single fault is not vice; and after all, it is only those who do nothing that are never deceived.\" Agathe's despair overcame her so much that Joseph and the Descoings were obliged to lessen Philippe's wrong-doings by assuring her that such things happened in all families. \"But he is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old,\" cried Agathe, \"he is no longer a child.\" Terrible revelation of the inward thought of the poor woman on the conduct of her son. \"Mother, I assure you he thought only of your sufferings and of the wrong he had done you,\" said Joseph. \"Oh, my God! let him come back to me, let him live, and I will forgive all,\" cried the poor mother, to whose mind a horrible vision of Philippe dragged dead out of the river presented itself. Gloomy silence reigned for a...", "...of the enemy, broke up his camp on the Pamunkey, and drew nearer to Yorktown. Washington, having concerted with the French commanders a plan of operations, with the combined American and French forces, marched for Virginia, the army being put in motion on the nineteenth, and having completed the passage of the Hudson on the twenty-fifth. Sir Henry Clinton did not suspect that the movement was for the South until the third of September. On the thirtieth of August, De Grasse, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> ships of the line and several frigates, arrived from the West Indies, and entered the Chesapeake. At Cape Henry he found an officer despatched by La Fayette with intelligence of the situation of the two armies. On the following day his advanced ships blocked up the mouth of the York. While the French fleet lay at anchor just within the Chesapeake, a squadron was descried early in the morning of September the fifth, consisting of nineteen ships-of-the-line, under Admiral...", "...in it almost as deep as those of a very young man. It was musical, and gave an effect of careful training, as if she had studied voice-production and had become self-conscious through over-practising. \"It's strange, the resemblance in those names,\" the other woman murmured, almost as if speaking to herself. She was small and extremely thin, with insignificant features and sallow, slightly freckled complexion. But, though she was one of those women who might be of any age between <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> and forty, her piercing gray eyes under black eyebrows, her quivering nostrils and slightly pointed chin, gave her a look of intense vitality. She was like a powerful if small electric lamp, purposely veiled by a dun-coloured shade. \"It's doubly strange, because\"----she went on; then let her voice trail away into silence rather than break off abruptly. She had a slight accent suggesting the Middle West of America. \"Because--what?\" Miss Bland caught her up with...", "...repulsed Longstreet who, promptly informed of the Chattanooga disaster, retreated in the direction of Virginia. Not being pursued, however, this general again wintered in East Tennessee; and for the same reason, the beaten army of Bragg halted in its retreat from Missionary Ridge at Dalton, where it also went into winter quarters. The battle of Chattanooga had opened the great central gateway to the south, but the rebel army, still determined and formidable, yet lay in its path, only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles away.

REMARKS. Contrary to what the subject is led to expect, the test is less a test of memory than of ability to comprehend the drift of an abstract passage. A subject who fully grasps the meaning of the selection as it is read is not likely to fail because of poor memory. Mere verbal memory improves but little after the age of 14 or 15 years, as is shown by the fact that our adults do little better than eighth-grade children in repeating sentences of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> syllables. On the other hand, adult intelligence is vastly superior in the comprehension and retention of a logically presented group of abstract ideas. There is nothing in which stupid persons cut a poorer figure than in grappling with the abstract. Their thinking clings tenaciously to the concrete; their concepts are vague or inaccurate; the interrelations among their concepts are scanty in the extreme; and such poor mental stores as they have are little available for...", "...the following year ten lessons, which were directed mainly to the subjects put down in the course of study under the title of Elementary Science Lessons. In his course in Elementary Mineralogy, Professor Crosby followed the plan indicated by Mrs. E. H. Richards in one of the science guides--First Lessons in Minerals. The curator, for his course on Structure and Habits of Worms, Insects, and Vertebrates, used many specimens which had been tanned by a process which was then in use. Over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> thousand zoological specimens were given away in two years. Professor Crosby, with a class of sixty, continued the course of the previous year, giving lessons in the mineralogical laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the specimens there studied were retained by the teachers. In the winter of 1888-'89 Professor Crosby, using for his auditorium Huntington Hall, gave a course of ten lessons on the geology of Boston and vicinity. \"The object of the...", "...A GREAT BANYAN TREE AT CALCUTTA.] A journey of four hundred miles to the northward, the last half of which is performed by narrow-gauge railway, which climbs zigzag fashion over a very hilly country, will enable us to reach Darjeeling, nearly nine thousand feet above the level of the sea. Here we are in proximity to and in full view of the Himalayan range of mountains, the loftiest on the globe. The lowest peak is over twenty thousand feet in height; the highest exceeds <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> thousand. Upon the range rest eleven thousand feet of perpetual snow. There can be no animal life in that Arctic region--only the snow and ice rest there in endless sleep. The Himalayas--meaning the \"Halls of Snow\"--form the northern boundary of India, and shut out the country from the rest of Asia. Thibet, which lies just over the range, whence we view it, is virtually inaccessible by this route, the wild region between being nearly impassable. Bold parties of traders,...", "...little known, in a small boat, twenty-three feet long from stern to stern, deep laden with eighteen men; without a chart, and nothing but my own recollection and general knowledge of the situation of places, assisted by a book of latitudes and longitudes, to guide us. I was happy, however, to see every one better satisfied with our situation in this particular than myself. [Sidenote: 1789. May 3.] Our stock of provisions consisted of about one hundred and fifty pounds of bread, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> gallons of water, twenty pounds of pork, three bottles of wine, and five quarts of rum. The difference between this and the quantity we had on leaving the ship, was principally owing to loss in the bustle and confusion of the attack. A few cocoa-nuts were in the boat, and some bread-fruit, but the latter was trampled to pieces. It was about eight o'clock at night when I bore away under a reefed lug fore-sail: and, having divided the people into watches, and got the boat...", "...he differed in all things from his father; for not only was he pleasure-loving, joyous, and humane, but he was, moreover, a Royalist at heart, and continued in friendship with the Cavaliers up to the period of his proclamation as Protector. It has been stated that, falling on his knees, he entreated his father to spare the life of Charles I.; it is certain he remained inactive whilst the civil wars devastated the land; and there is evidence to show that, during the seven months and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days of his Protectorship, he shrank from the perpetration of cruelty and crime. Accordingly, when those who had at first supported his authority eventually conspired against him, he refrained from using his power to crush them. At this his friends were wrath. \"It is time to look about you,\" said Lord Howard, speaking with the bluntness of a friend. \"Empire and command are not now the question. Your person, your life are in peril. You are the son of Cromwell; show yourself...", "...then uttering to Louis I., son and successor of Charlemagne, that arrogant assertion: \"Know my chair is above the emperor's throne;\" and ultimately see the design of these atrocious acts, in the claim of the subsequent popes to the dominion of the Caesars, by virtue of the donation of Charlemagne. Look at the two hundred and ninety-seven popes that have filled the papal chair: Twenty-four of them were anti-popes; twenty-six were deposed; nineteen were compelled to abandon Rome; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> were kept on their throne only by foreign intervention; fifty-four were obliged to rule over foreign parts; sixty-four died by violence; eighteen were poisoned; one was shut up in a cage; one was strangled; one smothered; one died by having nails driven in his temples; one by a noose around his neck; and only one hundred and fifty-three out of the whole number have proved themselves at all worthy.

It is furnished for its purpose with seven chairs of a kind, an extra chair for the recorder or clerk, a table and a prayer altar. _The Council Room of the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles_ is situated on the north side of the corridor, and with its ante-room occupies the greater part {196} of that side. The main apartment is forty by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> feet. In the center is a prayer altar of white wood upholstered in crimson velvet. Twelve large upholstered chairs of oak are arranged in three quadrants of a circle around the altar. The other quadrant is occupied by a table, behind which are three chairs of a kind for the three presiding high priests who constitute the First Presidency of the Church, and another chair for the Presiding Patriarch. These pieces, with desk, table, and chair for the use of the recorder,...", "...rudders, and parts of all varieties of iron machinery, are prepared here for manufacturers. The production is, in Dominie Sampson's phrase, 'prodigious.' In one day the works can turn out 2700 rails, 350 wheel-tires, 150 axles, 180 railway wheels, 1000 railway wedges, 1500 bombshells. In a month they have produced 250 field-pieces, thirty 5.7-inch cannon, fifteen 9.33-inch cannon, eight 11-inch cannon, one 14-inch gun, the weight of the last named being over fifty tons, and its length <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> feet seven inches. Till the end of 1894 the firm has produced 25,000 cannon for thirty-four different states. Alfred Krupp devoted much attention to the production of steel of the finest quality, and was the first German manufacturer who succeeded in casting steel in large masses. In 1862 he exhibited in London an ingot of finest crucible steel weighing twenty-one tons. Its dimensions were nine feet high by forty-four inches diameter. The uniformity of quality of this...", "...the pinnace of fifteen tons and one of the original five vessels. He landed on the island of Mayo, where the inhabitants salted their wells, forsook their houses, and drove away their goats. Off the island of Santiago he took a Portuguese vessel bound for Brazil, carrying numerous passengers and laden with wine. He kept the pilot, Nuno da Sylva, gave the passengers and crew a pinnace, and transferred the wine to the Pelican. The prize he made one of the fleet, having given her a crew of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> men. At Cape Verd Drake left the African shore, and, steering steadily to the southwest, was nine weeks without seeing land. When near the equator, he prepared his men for the change of climate by bleeding them all himself. He made the coast of Brazil on the 4th of April, 1578,--the savage inhabitants making large bonfires at their approach, for the purpose, as he learned from Sylva, of inducing their devils to wreck the ships upon their coast. On the 27th he entered the...", "...and the Irish Government with respect to the imposition and collection of taxes,\" there shall be summoned to the Imperial Parliament such number of members of the _Irish_ House of Commons as will raise the representation of Ireland in that Parliament from its reduced figure of forty-two to such a number (say seventy) as will represent Ireland's claim to representation on a population basis. That is to say, the Irish Parliament will send some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> of its members to reinforce the forty-two members who are directly elected to the Imperial Parliament by the constituencies. It is only proper that Ireland should not be required to contribute to Imperial purposes except with the consent of the full representation to which she is entitled. But the clause will require more careful definition: for example, the Irish Parliament ought to be required to choose these twenty-eight...", "...in March, 1844. He was the pioneer blacksmith and is supposed to have built the third or fourth house in the city. Harrison Campbell, it is stated, was the owner of the first blacksmith shop, in 1843. Mr. Pollock emigrated west in 1865 and died in Hood River, Oregon, in 1902. He was a brother-in-law of William Stewart, one of the old settlers of this city, both of them well and favorably known among the early pioneers of Cedar Rapids. Hiram Deem was a native of Ohio and at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> or twenty-nine located at Cedar Rapids and hired out to N. B. Brown. He helped to build the dam across the river, erected saw mills, and otherwise was a very useful man in a town with the boom spirit that Cedar Rapids had at that time. He was also one of the first justices of the peace and many a scrap was settled in his house, which stood on First street on the west side. He entered the army and died from exposure in a hospital boat in January, 1863. What later became...", "...forty-three days,--raising its triumphal arch in the skies for the sturdy fighters to sail under to victory and rescue. With ten days' provisions Captain Josiah Mitchell performed this memorable voyage of forty-three days and eight hours in an open boat, sailing four thousand miles in reality and thirty-three hundred and sixty by direct courses, and brought every man safe to land. A bright, simple-hearted, unassuming, plucky, and most companionable man. I walked the deck with him <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days--when I was not copying diaries,--and I remember him with reverent honour. If he is alive he is eighty-six years old now. If I remember rightly, Samuel Ferguson died soon after we reached San Francisco. I do not think he lived to see his home again; his disease had been seriously aggravated by his hardships. For a time it was hoped that the two quarter-boats would presently be heard of, but this hope suffered disappointment. They went down with all on board,...", "...to pay us what you owe? That's what we want to know.\" The \"gentleman of the old school\" did not answer immediately. Instead he turned to the solemn servant at his elbow. \"Augustus,\" he said, \"you may make ready.\" Then, looking serenely at the irate Mr. Gott, whose clenched fist rested under the center table, which he had thumped to emphasize his demands, the Major asked: \"I beg your pardon, my dear sir, but what is the total of my indebtedness to you?\" \"Nineteen dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> cents, and I want you to understand that--\" Major Hardee held up a slim, white hand. \"One moment, if you please,\" he said. \"Now, Augustus.\" Augustus opened the desk in the corner and produced an imposing stack of bank notes. Then he brought forth neat piles of halves, quarters, dimes, and pennies, and arranged the whole upon the table. Obed's mouth and those of his companions gaped in amazement. \"Have you your bill with you, Mr. Gott?\" inquired the Major....", "...to Canton; and they usually yield the merchant a great profit. From _Shan-tung_, fruits, vegetables, drugs, wines, and skins, are brought down the coast to Canton; and coarse fabrics for clothing are sent back in return. The carrying of foreign exports from Canton to Shan-tung, whether over land or up the coast in native vessels, makes them so expensive as to preclude their use among the great majority of the inhabitants, who are poor and numerous. The population of _Shan-tung_ is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> millions. From Chih-le, ginseng, raisins, dates, skins, deer's flesh, wines, drugs, and tobacco, are sent hither; and sundry other foreign imports go back in return. The population, amounting to twenty-seven millions, is in a great degree, dependant on the productions of other provinces and countries for the necessaries of life. _Shan-se_ sends skins, wines, ardent spirits, and musk. Among its fourteen millions of inhabitants, there are many capitalists who come to...", "...themselves. At the command of Hunneric, four hundred and sixty-six orthodox bishops assembled at Carthage; but when they were admitted into the hall of audience, they had the mortification of beholding the Arian Cyrila exalted on the patriarchal throne. The disputants were separated, after the mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence, of delay and precipitation, of military force and of popular clamor. One martyr and one confessor were selected among the Catholic bishops; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> escaped by flight, and eighty-eight by conformity; forty-six were sent into Corsica to cut timber for the royal navy; and three hundred and two were banished to the different parts of Africa, exposed to the insults of their enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual comforts of life. The hardships of ten years' exile must have reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of Thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the...", "...butt of it. Here, too, a wealthy pig butcher, charmed, no doubt, by the mild philanthropy of The Traveler, aspired to be on the most sociable footing with the author, and here was Tom King, the comedian, recently risen to consequence by his performance of Lord Ogleby in the new comedy of the Clandestine Marriage. A member of more note was one Hugh Kelly, a second-rate author, who, as he became a kind of competitor of Goldsmith's, deserves particular mention. He was an Irishman, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years of age, originally apprenticed to a staymaker in Dublin; then writer to a London attorney; then a Grub Street hack, scribbling for magazines and newspapers. Of late he had set up for theatrical censor and satirist, and, in a paper called Thespis, in emulation of Churchill's Rosciad, had harassed many of the poor actors without mercy, and often without wit; but had lavished his incense on Garrick, who, in consequence, took him into favor. He was the author of several...", "...Flint. The State Agricultural Society by request set apart one day of the fair as Woman's Day, and five women's organizations took part in the exercises. At the hour devoted especially to suffrage Mrs. DeVoe made the address, Mrs. Coggeshall presiding. It was hard to tell where this hour began and ended, for to the listener all seemed suffrage hours. This report told also of a series of questions sent out which ascertained that, in the territory covered by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> clubs, seventy-eight ministers were in favor of suffrage and eighteen opposed; and in the same territory forty editors were in favor and nineteen opposed. There were at that time fifty-seven clubs in the State. The year 1893 marked a period of unusual activity. The executive committee held monthly meetings. Four organizers were kept in the field. A large amount of money was raised and $100 donated to the campaign in Colorado. A request was sent to the clubs that each...", "...on great rolls of bedding and a tent. I reckon we looked funny to the \"onlookers looking on\" as we clattered down the street; but we were off and that meant a heap. All the morning our way lay up the beautiful river, past the great red cliffs and through tiny green parks, but just before noon the road wound itself up on to the mesa, which is really the beginning of the desert. We crowded into the shadow of the wagons to eat our midday meal; but we could not stop long, because it was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles to where we could get water for the horses when we should camp that night. So we wasted no time. Shortly after noon we could see white clouds of alkali dust ahead. By and by we came up with the dust-raisers. The children and I had got into the buckboard with Mrs. O'Shaughnessy and Miss Hull, so as to ride easier and be able to gossip, and we had driven ahead of the wagons, so as to avoid the stinging dust. The sun was just scorching when we overtook the funniest...", "...followed with their \"Boxes.\" Mrs. Carter sent him over some spermaceti candles--\"large clear & very elegant.\" The holidays were a round of balls and parties, which Fithian excused himself from as much as possible. He was glad when they were over--\"We had a large Pye cut to-day to signify the conclusion of the Holidays.\" It was so cold in January that \"a cart and three pair of oxen which every day bring in four loads of wood, Sundays excepted.\" In the manor and other houses there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> \"steady fires & most of them are very large.\" It grew so cold that the cart went for wood on Sunday also.

Fithian left Nomini Hall late in...", "...especially as the geological evidence shows many minor oscillations of heat and cold and advances and retreats of glaciers during each phase of these periods, such as must have occurred from the shorter recurrent effects of precession according to Croll's theory. Croll's calculations show that, at the period of _maximum_ eccentricity 210,000 years ago, the earth would have been in mid-winter 8,736,420 miles further from the sun than it is now, and the winter half of the year nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days longer than the summer half, instead of being six days shorter as at present. It appears, moreover, from a volume just published, _On the Astronomical Causes of an Ice Age_, by Sir R. Ball, one of the highest authorities on mathematics and astronomy, that Croll had understated his case. Ball says that \"Croll, misled by a statement of Herschell's, had assumed the number of units of heat received from the sun, in a hemisphere of the earth, as equal in summer and winter....", "...a solution of alkalies, such as potash and soda, were certain poisons to them, and should land be much infested with them, it would be worth the trial to water it with such solutions, especially as they tend rather to enrich the soil than otherwise.

From seventeen bushels he extracted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> quarts of good oil! In Hungary, a kind of grease is obtained from them which is useful for carriage wheels. The ingenuity of man may thus even procure good out of a very formidable evil, although the mischief done by the cockchafer larva undoubtedly far exceeds the benefit it confers upon its captors in the amount of oil extracted from it.

Now there are six banks each with more than $100,000,000 of deposits. A trust company in New York City, which had deposits of $20,000,000 five years ago, now has deposits of $166,000,000 and its <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> directors sit [1912] in boards of other banking institutions with resources of $1,250,000,000.

Though lacking to some extent the dignity of the \"Iliad\", the \"Nibelungenlied\" surpasses the former in the deep tragedy which pervades it, the tragedy of fate, the inevitable retribution for crime, the never-dying struggle between the powers of good and evil, between light and darkness. That the poem must have been exceedingly popular during the Middle Ages is evinced by the great number of Manuscripts that have come down to us. We possess in all <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> more or less complete MSS., preserved in thirty-one fragments, fifteen of which date from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Of all these MSS., but nine are so well preserved that, in spite of some minor breaks, they can be considered complete.

It may naturally be supposed, that so spirited a defence of Oxford against the aspersions of her antagonist would be welcomed with ardour; and among other testimonies of approbation which it received, Dr. King, whose character is eulogized in the poem, coming into the bookseller's shop, and inquiring whether five guineas would be acceptable to the author, left for him an order for that sum.

Thus the twenty-eighth part of the zodiac corresponds roughly with the moon's daily motion, and the twelfth part of the zodiac corresponds roughly with the moon's monthly motion; and both the numbers twenty-eight and twelve admit of being subdivided, while twenty-nine (a nearer approach than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> to the number of days in a lunation) and thirteen (almost as near an approach as twelve to the number of months in a year) do not. It seems to me highly probable that the date to which all inquiries into the origin of the constellations and the zodiacal signs seems to point--viz. 2170 B.C.--was the date at which the Chaldaean astronomers definitely adopted the new system, the lunisolar instead of lunar division of the zodiac and of time.

Nowhere does one feel this more than at Wells. The admirable Somerset Archaeological Society has gone on accumulating information about the cathedral for more years than the present writer has lived. Professor Freeman produced <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years ago, in his \"History of the Cathedral Church of Wells,\" a little book which has since been a model for all works of the kind, and of which one can still say that no one can understand all that is contained in the word \"cathedral\" unless he has read it. Yet since that book was written much fresh material has been discovered, and the theories then held as to the building of the cathedral have been in great measure disproved. To Canon C.M. Church, in his \"Chapters in...", "...his extreme regret that he should be compelled by any circumstances to trespass on leisure so evidently destined for privacy. \"But a few moments' patient hearing,\" continued he, \"will show that, to me at least, the object of this visit did not admit of delay.\" \"Be seated, senhor; and, if I may ask it without incivility, be brief, for I have weighty matters before me.\" \"I will endeavor to be so,\" said Roland, civilly, and resumed: \"This evening, Don Pedro, has seen the last of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> thousand Spanish dollars, which, five weeks since, I carried here along with me.

Having gained a naval superiority on Lake Champlain the army went into winter quarters at Crown Point. The main undertaking of the campaign was the reduction of Quebec, by far the most difficult operation, where General Wolfe was expected to perform an important part with not more than seven thousand effective men. The movement commenced at Sandy Hook, Tuesday May 8, 1759 when the expedition set sail for Louisburg, under convoy of the Nightingale, the fleet consisting of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> sail, the greater part of which was to take in the troops from Nova Scotia, and the rest having on board Fraser's Highlanders. They arrived at Louisburg on the 17th. and there remained until June 4th, when the fleet again set sail, consisting of one hundred and fifty vessels, twenty-two of which were ships of the line. They entered the St. Lawrence on the 13th, and on the 23rd anchored near Isle aux Coudres.

You may perhaps be surprised to find me thus saying that the moon travels round the sun, when you have been accustomed to hear that the moon travels round the earth. In reality, however, it is round the sun the moon travels, though certainly the moon and the earth circle around each other. The distance of the moon from the earth is not always the same; but the average, or mean distance, amounts to about two hundred and thirty-eight thousand eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles. This is the distance between the centers of the two globes. With this distance separating them, the companion worlds--the earth and the moon--circle round each other, as they both travel round the central sun.

He is a corpse.\" That is the history of that episode of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years ago, which pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two whenever it forced its way into my mind. Now then, I take that speech up and examine it. As I said, it arrived this morning, from Boston. I have read it twice, and unless I am an idiot, it hasn't a single defect in it from the first word to the last. It is just as good as good can be. It is smart; it is saturated with humor. There isn't a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it...", "...liability to be deceived about ourselves, but on what we do about it when we are, upon our making arrangements beforehand for seeing through ourselves in time, upon our putting forward men to represent us who shall not be demagogues, who shall lead us as we are, with clear eyes to what we are going to be, men who shall lead us by opening our imaginations by touching, or our vision instead of petting us in our sins. XV TECHNIQUE FOR NOT BEING FOOLED BY ONESELF The next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pages of this book might be entitled: \"An Article that Expected to Appear in the _Saturday Evening Post_.\" When the twenty-eight pages, which had been conceived and written to be read in this way, were completed, they were too late to submit to the _Post_, and too late to change. The reader is therefore requested to bear in mind (as I do) that he is getting the next eleven chapters for nothing--that they have not been paid for and it can only be left to people's...", "...had the effect of turning a page or a corner; she dropped from heights of argument to low plains--\"I expect I shall be big as a mountain by and by.

Then, I'm older than you.\" \"Not at all. I'm older than the everlasting hills; you are the youngest thing that lives.\" \"That's all right, but you were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> your last birthday, and I'm thirty. I'm afraid my character's already pretty well fixed in its present form. When it comes over me, for instance, to play the clown, I've got to do it or burst. And you're naturally a tyrant, you know.\" \"I am.

Indeed, after the election it was easy to trace all these influences. Oneida, a strong canal county, which had given Wright eight hundred majority in 1844, now gave Young thirteen hundred. Similar results appeared in Lewis, Alleghany, Herkimer, and other canal counties. In Albany, an Anti-Rent county, the Whig majority of twenty-five was increased to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> hundred, while Delaware, another Anti-Rent stronghold, changed Wright's majority of nine hundred in 1844, to eighteen hundred for Young. On the other hand, in New York City, where the conservative Whig papers had bitterly assailed their candidate, Wright's majority of thirty-three hundred in 1844 was increased to nearly fifty-two hundred. In the State Young's majority over Wright exceeded eleven thousand,[360] and Gardiner's over Fish was more than thirteen thousand.

England now sent some men on shore, with tents, powder, and shot, to kill hogs, and procure venison, but they searched in vain for Avery's men.

Fourteen of La Bouche's crew boarded the Englishmen in canoes, declaring that they belonged to the _Indian Queen_, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> guns, which had been lost on that coast, and that their captain, with forty men, was building a new vessel. The two English captains, Mackra and Reily, were about to sink and destroy these castaways, when England's two vessels, of thirty-four and thirty-eight guns, stood in to the bay. In spite of all promises of aid, the _Ostender_ and _Kirby_ deserted Mackra, a breeze admitting of their escape, while the pirate's black and bloody flags were still flaunting the air....", "...modified by the second. The extremely low specific gravity of Saturn, which but little exceeds that of cork (and, on this hypothesis, must at his surface be considerably less than that of cork) is supposed to arise from the intrinsic lightness of his substance. That the Sun weighs not much more than an equal bulk of water, is taken as evidence that the matter he consists of is but little heavier than water; although, considering his enormous gravitative force, which at his surface is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> times the gravitative force at the surface of the Earth, and considering his enormous mass, which is 390,000 times that of the Earth, the matter he is made of can, in such case, have no analogy to the liquids or solids we know. However, spite of these difficulties, the current hypothesis is, that the Sun and planets, inclusive of the Earth, are either solid or liquid, or have solid crusts with liquid nuclei: their unlike specific gravities resulting from unlikenesses of...", "...as having its seat in the finger itself. Children and many people believe so still. Physiology has demonstrated that the impression is transmitted from the finger-tip to the brain by means of the nervous system. If the nerve is cut, the finger may be burned with impunity; the paralysis is complete. We have been able to determine the time taken by the impression in transmitting itself from any part of the body to the brain, and it is known that the rapidity of this transmission is about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> metres per second. Since then we have referred sensation to the brain. But we have stopped half way. \"The brain is matter, like the finger, and by no means fixed and stable matter. It is essentially changing matter, rapidly variable, and forming no identity.

A stoppage of motion, of circulation, or of transformation would be a...", "...be adopted under the circumstances. Nothing, however, was done until the arrival at the capital of a personage felt by all to be the proper leader of the nation in the existing crisis. This was Darius, the son of Hystaspes, a prince of the blood royal who probably stood in the direct line of the succession, failing the issue of Cyrus. At the early age of twenty he had attracted the attention of that monarch, who suspected him even then of a design to seize the throne. He was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years of age, and therefore at a time of life suited for vigorous enterprise; which was probably the reason why his father, Hystaspes, who was still alive, sent him to the capital, instead of proceeding thither in person. Youth and vigor were necessary qualifications for success in a struggle against the holders of power; and Hystaspes no longer possessed those advantages. He therefore yielded to his son that headship of the movement to which his position would have...", "...entered. The apartment devoted to customers comprised two large rooms. The first was the cafe properly speaking; the second, opening on it, was the billiard-room. Conjecturing that he should probably find the person of whom he was in quest employed at the billiard-table, Graham passed thither at once. A tall man, who might be seven-and-forty, with a long black beard, slightly grizzled, was at play with a young man of perhaps twenty-eight, who gave him odds,--as better players of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> ought to give odds to a player, though originally of equal force, whose eye is not so quick, whose hand is not so steady, as they were twenty years ago. Said Graham to himself, \"The bearded man is my Vicomte.\" He called for a cup of coffee, and seated himself on a bench at the end of the room. The bearded man was far behind in the game. It was his turn to play; the balls were placed in the most awkward position for him. Graham himself was a fair billiard-player, both...", "...seemed to be a combination of reaper and workbench. But ten minutes after the contest began, Marsh had the race won. His machine was a new type, the forerunner of the modern self-binder. It was so made that two men could stand upon it and bind the grain as fast as it was cut. But on this occasion Marsh could hire no farmer to help him and was obliged to do the work alone. The judges were stunned with amazement, therefore, when they found that he had bound three-quarters of an acre in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> minutes. Here was a man who could do in half an hour what few Hungarian peasants could finish in less than a day! \"He is an athlete,\" said one. \"A wizard,\" said another. Before they could recover from their astonishment, Marsh had stored his harvester, pocketed the prize of forty golden ducats, and hurried away to his hotel, eager for a bath and a chance to pick the thistles out of his hands. But the grand dukes and miscellaneous dignitaries were not to be escaped...", "...$5000 of which he bequeathed to Hampton, and the balance of which he gave to Tuskegee as a fund to establish Captain Paul Cuffe Scholarships.

The squatter wanted to know what had become of his missing sheep, but Baldy could give no account of them. His suspicions, however, soon fell on Nosey. The latter was his nearest neighbour, and although he had only the same wages--viz., thirty pounds a year and rations-- he seemed to be unaccountably prosperous, and was the owner of a wife and two horses. He had been transported for larceny when he was only fifteen years of age, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> he was suspected of being still a thief. Girls of the same age were sent from Great Britain to Botany Bay and Van Diemen's Land for stealing one bit of finery, worth a shilling, and became the consorts of criminals of the deepest dye.

A week later Duquesnel, with whom I had signed a contract, returned with the tour mapped out and all the company engaged. It was almost miraculous. The performances were to commence on Saturday, September 4, and there were to be twenty-five of them; and the whole, including the day of departure and the day of return, was to last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, which caused this tour to be called \"The twenty-eight days of Sarah Bernhardt,\" like the twenty-eight days of a citizen who is obliged to accomplish his military service. The little tour was most successful, and I never enjoyed myself more than during this artistic promenade. Duquesnel organised excursions and _fetes_ outside the towns. At first he had prepared, thinking to please me, some visits to the sights of the towns. He had written beforehand from Paris...", "...it may very well be left unsaid. The eight-line poem is also a favourite, and so, but for its extreme difficulty, is the four-line epigram, or \"stop-short,\" so called because of its abruptness, though, as the critics explain, \"it is only the words which stop, the sense goes on,\" some train of thought having been suggested to the reader. The latter form of verse was in use so far back as the Han dynasty, but only reached perfection under the Tangs. Although consisting of only twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> words, according to the measure employed, it is just long enough for the poet to introduce, to develop, to embellish, and to conclude his theme in accordance with certain established laws of composition. The third line is considered the most troublesome to produce, some poets even writing it first; the last line should contain a \"surprise\" or _denouement_. We are, in fact, reminded of the old formula, \"Omne epigramma sit instar apis,\" &c., better known in its English...", "...to believe that Karslake at this time was planning a novel of military life in the Southwest, and, wishing to get in closer touch with the _milieu_ of the story, actually enlisted in order to be able to write authoritatively. He saw no active service until the time when his narrative begins. The year of his death is uncertain. It was in the spring probably of 1896, in the twenty-eighth year of his age. There is no doubt he would have become in time a great writer. A young man of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> who had so lively a sense of the value of accurate observation, and so eager a desire to produce that in the very face of death he could faithfully set down a description of his surroundings, actually laying down the rifle to pick up the pen, certainly was possessed of extraordinary faculties. \"They came in sight early this morning just after we had had breakfast and had broken camp.

All that he could remember was Blake's flashing eye. The Fox Inn, by the way, is still as it was, but the custom, I fancy, goes more to the Thatched House, which adds to the charms of refreshment a museum containing such treasures as a petrified cocoanut, the skeleton of a lobster <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old, and a representation of Moses in the bulrushes. A third and fourth great man, of a different type both from Hayley and Blake, met at Felpham in 1819.

THE CYCLE OF MENSTRUATION Essentially, the ovary is a collection of follicles, nests of cells, acting as safe deposit vaults for the ova that are to become candidates for fertilization. At birth, there are some 30,000 to 200,000 of these, of which a good many atrophy during childhood so that there are no more than about 30,000 left at puberty. Of the 30,000, only an elite 400 actually mature between the ages of fifteen and forty-five. About every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, one of the follicles swells, becomes filled with liquid, pushes or is pushed to the surface of the ovary, there to rupture and expel into the abdominal cavity the tiny ripe ovum. The rest of the torn follicle makes itself over into a peculiar yellowish body, the true corpus luteum, should pregnancy occur. If pregnancy and the consequent placenta do not occur, it shrinks and turns into a scar, the false corpus luteum.

But at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> and thirty, reading for the first time, he read sometimes with a sense of revelation, always with an enormous satisfaction. Especially the poets.

About the same number we find when Mr. Islip took the pastoral charge of this people in 1831.

Likewise dona Maria Pinel, nun of the Incarnation, says in her deposition: \"She (Teresa of Jesus) took the habit on 2 November, 1535.\" [6] This is corroborated by various passages in the Saint's writings. Thus, in Relation VII., written in 1575, she says, speaking of herself: \"This nun took the habit forty years ago.\" Again in a passage of the Life written about the end of 1564 or the beginning of the following year, [7] she mentions that she has been a nun for over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years, which points to her profession in 1536. But there are two documents which place the date of profession beyond dispute, namely the act of renunciation of her right to the paternal inheritance and the deed of dowry drawn up before a public notary.

For twenty years he was a teacher in the Public Schools of Boston, where he came in close contact with boy life.

I haven't much of my own way at present; but you see, when I'm married I shan't have it at all. You can't wonder that I shouldn't be in a hurry.\" \"I am not advocating anything like hurry, my dear. But, goodness gracious me! I've been here <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> minutes, and that horrid man will impose upon me. Good-bye; God bless you!

This was commenced in excellent order about ten at night, and the usual breeze having set off from shore favored their manoeuvre, so that, all hands being employed in warping and towing, the vessels were got safely into the bay, and anchored, beyond reach of shot, about two o'clock the next morning. So signal and well contested a victory could not have been gained without a considerable loss and suffering. It amounted in the English fleet, to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> men killed, and six hundred and ninety wounded; in the Dutch squadron, to thirteen killed, and fifty-two wounded; grand total, eight hundred and eighty-three. But the enemy suffered much more severly; they are computed to have lost, in killed and wounded, not less than between six and seven thousand men. The loss sustained by the Algerines by the destruction in the mole was four large frigates, of forty-four guns. Five large corvettes, from twenty-four to thirty guns. All...", "...costs. We have another and younger orchard upon which a record has been kept. This orchard of five acres contains 126 standard apple trees, \"filled\" both ways with 375 peach trees. It was set in the spring of 1908, so that the trees have grown four seasons. The permanents (apples) are set 36 by 40 feet apart, so that, with the peaches between, the trees stand 18 by 20 feet apart. A crop of beans has been grown between the tree rows each season. The first season a full seven rows, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> inches apart, were planted in the wider space; the second and third season six rows, and the last season only four rows. The crop has been very good each year until the last. One application of manure, one crop of clover and one seeding of rye have been plowed under, and in addition a liberal amount of commercial fertilizer has been used with each crop. This year the peach trees bore their first crop.

He failed to discover the slightest trace of fire in the hundred and eighty-four rooms and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> courts that he excavated. The marvellous preservation of the reliefs in many of the halls is inconsistent, in his opinion, with the supposition that the palace was destroyed by fire; and if we renounce that supposition the mere action of time is insufficient to account for the disappearance of such an extent of timber roofing, for here and there, especially near the doorways, pieces of broken beams and door panels have been found. \"The wood is not all in such condition as...", "...latter, I thought it still probable that the cowpock infection might have a similar effect.

It is, and always has been, a point of honour for the officers to be among the very last to leave (except, of course, where their presence might be needed in the boats), and the captain to be the very last. Here, the captain was among the _first_ to scramble over the side; and his twelve-oared barge only took off <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> persons, when it would have easily carried many more. A large barge took the colonial governor and his family, _and_ the governor's trunks. His boat wanted for nothing, and would have accommodated ten or more persons than it took.

For my own part, I had never been so near a field of battle before, and I cannot describe my sensations.

As already stated, such passage of the ova from the ovaries into the womb occurs every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, and it is accomplished by a more or less copious flow of blood, a sort of hemorrhage, which carries the ova down through the fallopian tubes, and deposits them in the womb.

This flow of blood continues for about five days, and is known as a menstrual flow; and this time in...", "...should have his wife with him was regarded indeed by the owners as a decided advantage, for, in the first place, she could conveniently act the part of chaperone to young and unprotected lady-passengers when there were any; and, in the next, they were justly of opinion that the captain would take extra care of the ship if she held a being so dear to him as his wife.

Herod, through the medium of one of his confidants, who was a member of the Sanhedrin, agreed to furnish him with the necessary materials, as also with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> architects, who were also Herodians.

He didn't quite appreciate her reserve. No matter how late he wandered through the mysterious bazaars, either here in Egypt or over yonder in India, nothing ever befell more exciting than an argument with a carriage-driver. He never carried small-arms, for he would not have known how to use them. The only deadly things in his hands were bass-rods and tennis-racquets. No, nothing ever happened to him; yet he...", "...Boss. But I reckon there'd be no back-slidin'. The boys ain't admirin' the deal you're gettin'.

If we'd have an open winter we'd likely be able to take care of about three thousand head by watchin' them close. Now, if we'd leave about three thousand head at the Circle L--with four or five of the boys to keep an eye on them, that would leave us about twenty-three or twenty-four men for trail herd work.

My husband with his father and a brother, Jonas, came in '54 and took up claims adjoining the present site of Northfield. They drove two ox teams and brought cattle, a couple of sheep and some pigs.

Every mouthful of food consumed that first year was brought from Hastings, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles away, and it kept one man and an ox team on the road all the time.

The science of astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs was a clear firmament and a naked plain.

The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave, that he might serve his master in another life; and the invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still...", "...though the 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and 4th Gordon Highlanders made similar efforts to get forward, the enemy pinned them to the ground by the intensity of his fire, and prevented them from making any headway.

They accordingly withdrew slowly with a bag of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> prisoners to their jumping-off line. At 11 A.M. a fresh attack by two companies of the 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was carried out on the left of the 6th Gordon Highlanders.

On the twenty-seventh of April, 1838, Charleston was visited by a fire which proved exceedingly disastrous. Nearly one-half the city was swept by the flames, which raged for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> hours, and were finally averted only by the blowing up of buildings in their path. There were 1158 buildings destroyed, involving a loss of three millions of dollars. The most shocking feature of the catastrophe was that, in the carelessness of handling the gunpowder in blowing up these buildings, four of the most prominent citizens were killed, and several others injured. The fire of 1861 exceeded this in destructiveness, and to it were added the terrific effects of a...", "...use, but he declared that Cotton House was in a ruinous condition; and in consequence of his report, in the following year, another Act of Parliament decreed that to increase the public utility of the library, Cotton House should be purchased of Sir John Cotton for 4500 pounds, and a new building erected for the collection of books. Still, nothing was done, till the house, actually threatening to tumble down, the books were removed to Essex House, in the Strand, where they remained for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years.

The Hanskas belonged to the Russian nobility and lived on an immense estate in Ukraine, surrounded only by illiterate peasants. It was another beautiful case of mismating: a man of forty who had gone the pace marrying a girl of seventeen to educate her and reform himself. Madame Hanska must have been a beauty in her youth--dark, dashing, positive, saucy. She had enough will so that she never became a drudge nor did she languish and fade. She was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old when she first appeared in the field of our vision--twenty-eight, and becomingly stout. She had literary ambitions and had time to exercise them. Accidentally, a volume of Balzac's \"Scenes From a Private Life\" had fallen in her way. She glanced at it, and read a little here and there; then she read it through. Balzac's consummate ease and indifference of style caught her. She wanted to write just like Balzac. She was not exactly a writer--she only had literary...", "...if they did not occupy the centre of his consciousness, he had the friendship of Lady Thiselton and the more intimate though less fantastic relation with the Medhursts.

The packet, commanded by acting-Captain W.

Rogers had only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> in his crew, all told, men and boys--sufficient to work the brig fairly well, but not, one would imagine, to fight her against a schooner crowded with men. However, he beat to quarters and made all his arrangements, not forgetting to place some responsible persons in charge of the mails, to shift them about to a place of safety as required, and, in the last resort, to sink them. This, of course, reduced his little fighting force still further.

On examining it, they found there was a hundred and fifty pounds of bread, thirty-two pounds of pork, six quarts of rum, six bottles of wine, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> gallons of water. As they were so near Tofoa they determined to put in there for a supply of breadfruit and water, so that they might keep their other provisions. But after rowing along the coast for some time, they only discovered some cocoanut trees on the top of a stony cliff, against which the sea beat furiously. After several attempts they succeeded in getting about twenty nuts. The second day they failed to get anything at all.

Their distance from the Base at this point was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> miles and the altitude was one thousand feet above sea-level. On the ice-cap they were delayed by a blizzard and for seventeen days--an unexampled time--they were unable to move from camp.

Then they overran Armenia, Cappadocia, Pontus, and part of Lydia, that is, a great portion of Anatolia or Asia Minor; and managed to establish themselves in the country for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years, living by plunder and exaction. In the course of this period, they descended into Syria, as far as to the very borders of Egypt. The Egyptians bought them off, and they turned back; however, they possessed themselves of a portion of Palestine, and gave their name to one town, Scythopolis, in the territory of Manasses. This was in the last days of the Jewish monarchy, shortly before the captivity.

Henry supported the constable Montmorency when he was disgraced in 1541; protested against the treaty of Crepy in 1544; and at the end of the reign held himself completely aloof.

Diane, Montmorency and the Guises were all-powerful, and dismissed Cardinal de Tournon, de Longueval, the duchesse d'Etampes and all the late king's friends and officials. At that time Henry was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old. He was a robust man, and inherited his father's love of violent exercise; but his character was weak and his intelligence mediocre, and he had none of the superficial and brilliant gifts of Francis I.

We could not lift the fish up on the stern and we had to tow him over to Mr. Jump's boat and there haul him aboard by block and tackle. At Avalon he weighed three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pounds. R. C. had caught the biggest Marlin in 1916--three hundred and four pounds, and this three-hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound fish was the largest for 1918. Besides, there was the remarkable achievement and record of seven swordfish in one day, with six of them freed to live and roam the sea again. But R. C. was not impressed.

The General Grant passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> left. But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the...", "...hatch, the main hatch, and the companion-way, the two former being used by the crew, and the latter by the officers.

Similarly, it is bad play to make fourteen or thirty (_i.e._ one short of fifteen or thirty-one) with an _ace_; to make thirteen or twenty-nine (_two_ short) with a _two_; twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> with a _three_; eleven or twenty-seven with a _four_; as in either of such cases, should the adversary be able to pair, he will thereby score four holes. The only exception is where the player chances to hold two deuces or aces, in which case it will be worth while to make twenty-nine or thirty respectively with one of such cards, on the chance of the opponent holding no deuce or ace, in which case the first player will himself gain the advantage of the double score....", "...their suspicions: it now began to be believed that these men were sent forward in order to apprise the enemy of their coming, and as captain Lewis was fearful of exciting any further uneasiness, he made no objection on seeing a small party of Indians go on each side of the valley under pretence of hunting, but in reality to watch the movements of our two men: even this precaution however did not quiet the alarms of the Indians, a considerable part of whom returned home, leaving only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> men and three women. After the hunters had been gone about an hour, captain Lewis again mounted with one of the Indians behind him, and the whole party set out; but just as they passed through the narrows they saw one of the spies coming back at full speed across the plain: the chief stopped and seemed uneasy, the whole band were moved with fresh suspicions, and captain Lewis himself was much disconcerted, lest by some unfortunate accident some of their enemies might have...", "...I lack fifty, for so many have been slain in my days.\" And so King Leodegraunce delivered his daughter, Guinever, to Merlin, and the Table Round, with the hundred knights, and they rode freshly and with great royalty, what by water and what by land.

During a severe illness, he removed from London to Clifton, at which place he wrote \"The Sylphs of the Seasons.\" In 1813, he made his first, and, with the exception of \"Monaldi,\" <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years afterwards, his only publication. This was a small volume, entitled \"The Sylphs of the Seasons, and other Poems,\" published in London; and, during the same year, republished in Boston under the direction of his friends, Professor Willard of Cambridge and Mr. Edmund T.

He used to hang little clay figures up by strings attached to his ceiling, that he might get the effect of them high in air. By looking at them thus from below he gained an idea of foreshortening. Although this artist nearly succeeded in getting into line with Michael Angelo, he did not colour after the fashion of his master, Titian.

Advent (Latin _Adventus_, the coming,) signifies the coming of our Saviour, the period of the approach of the nativity. As Advent-tide lasts from Advent Sunday to Christmas, the length of the season depends upon the day of the month on which Advent Sunday falls. As it may happen as early as the 27th of November or as late as the 3d of December, so Advent-tide will contain no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days nor less than twenty-two. It should be borne in mind that, though this festival is classed among the movable feasts, it does not depend upon the date of Easter, but upon the day of the month on which Advent Sunday falls.

This rotation was determined in 1611, by Galileo, who, while observing the spots, saw that they traversed the solar disk from east to west, following lines that are oblique to the plane of the ecliptic, and that they disappear at the western border fourteen days after their arrival at the eastern edge. Sometimes the same spot, after being invisible for fourteen days, reappears upon the eastern edge, where it was observed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days previously. It progresses toward the center of the Sun, which is reached in seven days, disappears anew in the west, and continues its journey on the hemisphere opposed to us, to reappear under observation two weeks later, if it has not meantime been extinguished. This observation proves that the Sun revolves upon itself. The reappearance of the spots occurs in about twenty-seven days, because the Earth is not stationary, and in its movement round the burning focus, a...", "...to be an Earl.

The composition of the House of Commons is uncertain, for no list of members is extant between 1382 and 1559. In the former of those years eighteen counties or districts and eleven towns were represented. In the latter, ten counties and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> cities and boroughs returned two members each. Through the action of the royal prerogative the number was progressively increased until the 300 of the eighteenth century was reached. In St. Leger's time the Upper House was the more important of the two, and was attended by four archbishops, nineteen bishops, and twenty temporal peers, of whom Desmond was one. Among the temporal peers was Rawson, late prior of Kilmainham and chief of the Irish Hospitallers, who had just...", "...per loom annually. Another class of mendicant, called Ponnambalaththar, which is said to have sprung up recently, poses as true caste beggars attached to the Kaikolans, from whom, as they travel about the country, they solicit alms. Some Kaikolans gave Ontipuli as the name of their caste beggars. The Ontipulis, however, are Nokkans attached to the Pallis. The Kaikolan community is, as already indicated, divided into seventy-two nadus or desams, viz., forty-four mel (western) and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> kil (eastern) nadus. Intermarriages take place between members of seventy-one of these nadus. The great Tamil poet Ottaikuththar is said to have belonged to the Kaikolan caste and to have sung the praises of all castes except his own. Being angry on this account, the Kaikolans urged him to sing in praise of them. This he consented to do, provided that he received 1,008 human heads. Seventy-one nadus sent the first-born sons for the sacrifice, but one nadu (Tirumarudhal)...", "...accordingly selected three hundred men from the infantry forces with Herodian as their leader, and assigned them the duty of guarding Naples.

Belisarius, then, was thus engaged in putting his army in order; but the inhabitants of Rome, fearing lest all the calamities should befall them which had befallen the Neapolitans, decided after considering the matter that it was better to receive the emperor's army into the city.

Each man of the party took from his pouch a small but well-filled packet of food and a flask, and fell to upon their contents voraciously, talking as they worked their jaws and joking with Mistress Clo.

A fine stair-case leads to it, and it is built up with gilded latrices. At the upper end is a sort of altar, where the name of God is written; and, before it, stand two candlesticks, as high as a man, with wax candles as thick as three flambeaux. The pavement is spread with fine carpets, and the mosque illuminated with a vast number of lamps.

He therefore proposed that the Seminary, which had given it to him, should buy it back again, with such improvements as he had made. Queylus, the Superior, being favorably disposed towards him, consented, and bought of him the greater part; while La Salle sold the remainder, including the clearings, to one Jean Milot, an ironmonger, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> hundred livres. [Footnote: Faillon, _Colonie Francaise en Canada_, iii. 288.] With this he bought four canoes, with the necessary supplies, and hired fourteen men.

During the last sixty years the church has strengthened its hold on the loyalty of the nation by its increased efficiency. Its bishops are laborious and active. Since 1876 the home episcopate has been increased by the creation of the dioceses of Truro, St Albans, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southwell, Wakefield, Bristol, Southwark and Birmingham, so that there are now (1910) thirty-seven diocesan bishops, aided by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> suffragan and eight assistant bishops, and a further subdivision of dioceses is contemplated. At no other time probably have the clergy been so industrious. As a rule they are far better instructed in theology than forty years ago, but they have not advanced in secular learning. Changes in the university system have contributed to draw off able young men to other professions which offer greater worldly advantages. The poverty of many of the clergy stands in strong contrast...", "...Coe's Golden Drop, Grand Duke, Quackenboss and St. Lawrence.

By a minute comparison of the two texts we find that Pope printed his edition from Rowe, not from any of the Folios. A second edition, 10 volumes, 12mo, was published in 1728, 'by Mr Pope and Dr Sewell.' In this edition, after Pope's preface, reprinted, comes: 'A table of the several editions of Shakespeare's plays, made use of and compared in this impression.' Then follows a list containing the first and second Folios, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> Quarto editions of separate plays. It does not, however, appear that even the first Folio was compared with any care, for the changes made in this second edition are very few.

The night before, at dinner, the little mother, thankful and happy at having Peter back again at the table, asked a favour. In having to ask it, instead of simply saying that she desired her children to go with her to church the next morning, she proved her knowledge of the fact that she had joined the ranks of mothers whose children have outgrown them.

It was all--yes, even more--than the Saints, so long harassed by mobs, had hoped to receive. It contained <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> sections and was bounded in its limitations only by the Constitution of the United States and that of the state of Illinois.

A municipal court was provided composed of the mayor as chief justice, and the aldermen as...", "...Restrictions were placed on the mints of the Latin Union and of the United States, and thus, by degrees, the whole stress of the trade of the West was transferred from the old composite currency to gold alone. In this way, not only was the basis of credit in the chief commercial states cut in half, but the annual supply of metal for coinage was diminished. In 1893 the gold mined fell nearly nine per cent short of the value of the gold and silver produced in 1865, and yet, during those <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years, the demand for money must have increased enormously, if it in any degree corresponded with the growth of trade. The phenomena which followed the adoption of the gold standard by Western countries were precisely those which had been anticipated by Loyd.

But the Virgin whom one sees in the chapel is not even this copy, but a copy of the copy.

He would labour day and night at correcting the work of his scribes; and Anselm, when he succeeded to the See, used often to deprive himself of rest to finish the transcription of a manuscript. Lanfranc, we are told, was especially generous in lending his books: among a set which he sent to St. Alban's we find the names of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> famous treatises, besides a large number of missals and other service-books, and two 'Books of the Gospels,' bound in silver and gold, and ornamented with valuable jewels.

On landing, he at once converted a storehouse filled with jerked beef into an hospital for the sick: in this he deposited one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> of his invalids.

It has even occurred. For the edification of the possible reader who is entirely uninformed, it may be explained that women are not entirely disenfranchised in the United States. Women vote on equal terms with men, in four States. They have voted in Wyoming since 1869; in Colorado since 1894; in Utah and Idaho since 1896. They vote at school elections and on certain questions of taxation in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> States. While it is true that in the States which have a small measure of suffrage the women show little interest in voting, in the four so-called suffrage States, they vote conscientiously and in about the same proportion as men. But here is a notable thing. The women of the suffrage States differ so little from the women of other States, and women in general, that the chief concerns of their lives are the home, the school, and the baby,--the Kaiser's \"Kirche,...", "...well,\" he agreed. \"I shall give you the coin money now. How much?\" \"And we will see the system work,\" the king proclaimed, partaking in his Chancellor's triumph. \"You have heard!--He will give coin money now!\" Ieremia cried in a loud voice to the assemblage. At the same time he plunged both hands in the basket and drew forth many packages of Fitu-Ivan notes. It was noticed that a peculiar odour was adrift about the council. \"I have here,\" Ieremia announced, \"one thousand and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pounds twelve shillings and sixpence. Here is a sack to put the coin money in.\" Cornelius recoiled. He had not expected such a sum, and everywhere about the council his uneasy eyes showed him chiefs and talking men drawing out bundles of notes.

It consists of all members and alternates of the Executive Council, members of various commissions, and all the chairmen of district committees.

It appears, therefore, that, instead of a small quantity of heat being necessary to melt the ice, a very considerable portion is absorbed in that process.

He was owned by Mrs. Ann Colley, a widow, residing near Petersburg, Va. Isaac and Edmondson were to have been sold, on New Year's day; a few days hence.

The prison of Count William was a strait one. Henry might fairly look on him as a traitor, and it was the general belief that he paid for his treason with his eyes. Here we may perhaps see the groundwork for the foolish story that Duke Robert's fate was equally hard. But Henry was far too wise to commit so useless a crime. The captive Duke spent the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years of his life in this castle, and that, treated with all honour, but kept under such restraint as was needful, specially after he had once tried to get away altogether. He did not even cease to be Duke of the Normans. His brother administered his duchy for him; but he never took the ducal title while Robert lived.

When they had got well out to sea a severe easterly gale sprung up, which drove the vessel before it to the westward.

The islands were all left far behind, and the ship was carried into a region far beyond the limits of the ocean marked on the charts.

Just whether it will rupture and bleed, depends upon whether the egg is going to grow into a child or not. If it is not going to grow into a child, it immediately bleeds freely, and continues to bleed, until the whole lining of the womb and egg is passed out into the outer world. This takes four or five days and constitutes \"menstruation.\" After menstruation is over, the womb begins again to prepare itself for the coming of the next ovule or egg, and as this occurs every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, menstruation is commonly termed the \"monthly periods.\" WHY MENSTRUATION OCCURS EVERY TWENTY-EIGHT DAYS.--The reason why the womb does this every twenty-eight days is because it is impossible to tell just when the womb will be called upon to nourish and support a child.

The men agreed to work the claim on shares, the agreement being that they should work on shares by each receiving half of what they could get out.

Veron was so delighted with the great success of \"Robert\" that he made a contract with Meyerbeer for another grand opera, \"Les Huguenots,\" to be completed by a certain date. Meanwhile, the failing health of Mme. Meyerbeer obliged the composer to go to Italy, and work on the opera was deferred, thus causing him to lose thirty thousand francs as the penalty of his broken contract. At length, after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> rehearsals, and an expense of more than one hundred and sixty thousand francs in preparation, \"Les Huguenots\" was given to the public, February 26, 1836.

The Laplanders hunt the wild rein-deers by different methods, according to the difference of seasons. In the rutting season they make use of their domestic females to attract the wild males. They shoot them with the musket, or with the bow, and they deliver their arrows with such strength, that notwithstanding the thickness of their hair and hide, they often kill one of these beasts with a single arrow.

The early education of Carl Benz was acquired at the Lyceum until his seventeenth year and then at the Technical High School of his native city for four more years. This was followed by three years of practical work in the shops of the Karlsruhe Machine Works. When he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years of age, in 1872, after further experience in Mannheim, Pforzheim and Vienna, he opened workshops of his own in Mannheim. In 1880 he began to commercialize a two-cycle stationary engine. In 1883 he organized his business as Benz & Co., and produced his first vehicle in 1884. In the beginning of 1885 his three-wheeled vehicle ran through the streets of Mannheim, Germany, attracting much attention with its noisy exhaust.

Two thousand dead were found, 2,000 missing, was the record the day I was there. The place became used to death. It was not a sensation to the survivors to see it about them.

There was no inspection, and many of the piston and rod assemblies came back from the motor assembling line as defective. It is a very simple operation. The workman pushed the pin out of the piston, oiled the pin, slipped the rod in place, put the pin through the rod and piston, tightened one screw, and opened another screw.

During this period there were several Anarchist congresses in the United States. In one at Albany, in 1878, the revolutionary element, led by Justus Schwab, broke away from the others; at Allegheny City, in 1879, again there was a rupture between the peaceful and the revolutionary sections. The Voice of the People at St Louis, the Arbeiter Zeitung at Chicago, and the Anarchist at Boston, were the organs of the revolutionary element. In 1883, at Pittsburg, a congress of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> delegates, representing twenty-two towns, drew up an address to the working men of America. The programme it proposed was as follows:-- First, Destruction of the existing class rule by all means, i.e. energetic, relentless, revolutionary and international action.

Third, Free exchange of equivalent products by and between the productive organizations, without commerce and...", "...art. To measure a toe, is to measure the giant.

Sheats, former Superintendent of Education for the State of Florida, in explanation of an...", "...the paper-boat manufactory on the river Hudson, two miles above Troy. Mr. George A. Waters put his own canoe into the water, and proposed to escort me a few miles down the river. If I had any misgivings as to the stability of my paper canoe upon entering her for the first time, they were quickly dispelled as I passed the stately Club-house of the Laureates, which contained nearly forty shells, all of paper. The dimensions of the Maria Theresa were: length, fourteen feet; beam, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> inches; depth, amidships, nine inches; height of bow from horizontal line, twenty-three inches; height of stern, twenty inches. The canoe was one-eighth of an inch in thickness, and weighed fifty-eight pounds. She was fitted with a pair of steel outriggers, which could be easily unshipped and stowed away. The oars were of spruce, seven feet eight inches long, and weighed three pounds and a quarter each. The double paddle, which was seven feet six inches in...", "...my wooden penholder (for the year is not yet over), I consider it extraordinary that no lives have been lost in the transatlantic flights of 1919. The leading edge of the lower plane was bent in some places and smashed in others, the gasoline connections had snapped, and four of the propeller blades were buried in the ground, although none were broken. That about completed the record of preliminary damage. We had landed at 8:40 A. M., after being in the air for sixteen hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> minutes. The flight from coast to coast, on a straight course of one thousand six hundred and eighty nautical miles, lasted only fifteen hours and fifty-seven minutes, our average speed being one hundred and five to one hundred and six knots. For this relatively rapid performance, a strong following wind was largely responsible. As a result of the burst connections from tank to carburetor, gasoline began to swill into the rear cockpit while we were still inside it. Very...", "...also that all the months have eight days of Ides. The number of days of Calends depend upon the number of days in the month, and the day of the month on which the Ides fall. If the month has thirty-one days and the Ides fall on the thirteenth, there are nineteen days of Calends; but if the Ides fall on the fifteenth, there are only seventeen days of Calends. As the Ides fall on the thirteenth of all the months of thirty days, they have eighteen days of Calends. February, the month of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> days, has only sixteen, except in leap-year, when the sixth of the Calends is reckoned twice. It may also be seen from the calendar that the Romans, after the first day of the month, began to reckon so many days before the Nones, as 4th, 3d, 2d, then Nones; after the Nones, so many days before the Ides, as 8th, 7th, 6th, etc., and after the Ides, so many before the Calends of the next month, the highest numbers being reckoned first. In reducing the Roman calendar to...", "...manner of the country from which they came. \"I shall as far as possible live on the food of the country,\" she said. \"It may be that by sharing to a greater extent the conditions of life of the people, I can come to a fuller understanding of them and they of me.

She was at this time <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old. Ever since she was a mere slip of a girl, she had longed to serve in that most discouraging of fields--\"the slums of Africa,\" it was called. The people who inhabited that swampy, equatorial region were the most wretched and degraded of all the negro tribes. They had for ages been the victims of stronger neighbors, who drove them back from the drier and more desirable territory that lay farther inland; and of their own ignorance and superstitions, which were at...", "...by the king on March 5, 1739-40. His judgment was final, and in favor of New Hampshire. It gave that province not only all the territory in dispute, but a strip of land fourteen miles in width, lying along her southern border, mostly west of the Merrimack, which she had never claimed. This strip was the tract of land between the line running east and west, three miles north of the southernmost trend of the river, and a similar line three miles north of its mouth. By the decision <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> townships were taken from Massachusetts and transferred to New Hampshire. The settlement of this disputed question was undoubtedly a public benefit, although it caused, at the time, a great deal of hard feeling. In establishing the new boundary Pawtucket Falls, situated now in the city of Lowell, and near the most southern portion of the river's course, was taken as the starting-place; and the line which now separates the two States was run west, three miles north of this...", "...of the same variety reappeared after passing over three generations. {35} When two distinct races are crossed, it is notorious that the tendency in the offspring to revert to one or both parent-forms is strong, and endures for many generations.

Mr. Sidney[81] states that, in a litter of Essex pigs, two young ones appeared which were the image of the Berkshire boar that had been used <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years before in giving size and constitution to the breed. I observed in the farmyard at Betley Hall some fowls showing a strong likeness to the Malay breed, and was told by Mr. Tollet that he had forty years before crossed his birds with Malays; and that, though he had at first attempted to get rid of this strain, he had subsequently given up the attempt in despair, as the Malay character would reappear. This strong tendency in crossed breeds to revert has given rise to...", "...said the signal-service officer. \"Jode, when is it going to rain?\" said the Governor, anxiously. Now Jode is the most extraordinarily solemn man I have ever known. He has the solemnity of all science, added to the unspeakable weight of representing five of the oldest families in South Carolina. The Jodes themselves were not old in South Carolina, but immensely so in--I think he told me it was Long Island. His name is Poinsett Middleton Manigault Jode. He used to weigh a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pounds then, but his health has strengthened in that climate. His clothes were black; his face was white, with black eyes sharp as a pin; he had the shape of a spout--the same narrow size all the way down--and his voice was as dry and light as an egg-shell. In his first days at Cheyenne he had constantly challenged large cowboys for taking familiarities with his dignity, and they, after one moment's bewilderment, had concocted apologies that entirely met his exactions, and...", "...the German Empire. It was after the foundation of this empire that the claim of the two cities to remain free ports was conceded and ratified in the Imperial Constitution of April, 1871, though the privilege, in the case of Hamburg, was restricted to the city and port, and withdrawn from the rest of the State, which extends to the mouth of the Elbe and embraces about one hundred and sixty square miles, while the free-port territory was reduced to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> square miles. This was the first serious interference with the city's liberty, and others followed, perhaps rather of a petty, annoying, than of a seriously aggressive, character, but enough to show the direction in which the wind was blowing. It was in 1880 that the proposal to include Hamburg in the Customs Union was first politically discussed. It met, not unnaturally, with much opposition among the citizens, and...", "...persons, besides the head-farmers, who at five also to each family are one hundred more; in all, two hundred and thirty-two.

This is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> persons more. They would then require a hatmaker, a glover, at least two ropemakers, four tailors, three weavers of woollen and three weavers of linen, two basket-makers, two common brewers, ten or twelve shop-keepers to furnish chandlery and grocery wares, and as many for drapery and mercery, over and above what they could work.

This was granted, and Caesar returned to Gaul. But the Britons not fulfilling the conditions of the peace, Caesar again invaded their country with 600 ships and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> galleys; he landed without opposition, and defeated the Britons. His fleet again encountered a storm, in which forty ships were lost, and the rest greatly damaged. In order to prevent a similar accident, he drew all his ships ashore, and enclosed them within the fortifications of the camp. After this, he had no further naval operations with the Britons.

From the days of the Restoration no letters were more eagerly sought and prized than those of the queen.

It became a lucrative occupation to steal letters that bore her signature, in order to sell them to wealthy purchasers. Prices rose steadily.

It is an immense figure, cut in the side of a great rock, about a quarter of a mile from the quay, in memory of the twenty-six officers and seven hundred soldiers who were massacred in the Tuileries, Paris, on the tenth of August, 1792, when the Commune obtained control of the government, and compelled King Louis to fly for his life. An immense lion, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> feet in length, lies dying in a grotto, transfixed with a broken lance. Under one paw, as though he would shelter it even in death, is the Bourbon lily. On either side of the lion are the names of the officers, and an inscription. The idea is a simple one, but the work was done by a master hand, (the Danish sculptor Thorwalsden being the artist) and is very impressive.

I have already (Vol. I., p. 360) related how he fell under suspicion of participating in the errors of the Beghards, how his brethren vainly strove to save him, and how the Archbishop of Cologne won a decided victory over the feeble and unorganized Dominican Inquisition by vindicating the subjection of a Dominican to his episcopal Inquisition. If the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> articles finally condemned by John XXII. as heretical be correctly extracted from Eckart's teachings, there can be no doubt that he was deeply infected with the pantheistic speculations of the Brethren of the Free Spirit, that he admitted the common divinity of man and God, and shared in the dangerous deductions which proved that sin and virtue were the same in the eyes of God. To a hierarchy founded on sacerdotalism, moreover, nothing could be more revolutionary than the...", "...an alliance with the United States, and the Treaty of Alliance was signed two months later. Jones, meanwhile, had overhauled and refitted his ship, and on the tenth of April, set sail from Brest, intending to make a complete circuit of the British Isles.

It has been the fashion in some quarters to call Jones a pirate, but it is difficult to see any argument for such a characterization of him. He sailed under the flag of the United States, held a commission from the United States, and attacked an enemy with whom the United States was at war. There is no hint of piracy about that; but Jones came to be a sort of bogeyman to the coast towns of the British Isles, who never knew when to expect an attack from him, and no...", "...which have red blood, a fact which accounts for its popular name of \"bloody clam.\" ^A. ponderosa.^ The most prominent /Arca/ upon our Atlantic coast, especially south of Virginia.

This event, so unexpected and awfully sudden, was occasioned by a fever, brought on by too violent exercise at a game of ball, at an entertainment made for Philip by his favorite, Manuel, in Burgos, where the court was then held. Through the unskilfulness of his physicians, as it was said, who neglected to bleed him, the disorder rapidly gained ground, [18] and on the sixth day after his attack, being the 25th of September, 1506, he breathed his last.

Nevertheless, for the sake of aspirants to literary fame, it may be worth while to tell here how one of the rank and file of the moderately successful Brotherhood was led to Authorship as a profession and how he followed it out. I say \"led\" advisedly, because I made no effort whatever to adopt this line of life, and never even dreamed of it as a possibility until I was over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years of age.

To this point, also, Knowlton and his rangers appear to have been sent. The battery or redoubt here stood about where the...", "...much I might edify, by its recital. We read today of the horrors of Spanish and Turkish massacres or of Siberian prisons, and every page of history has its record of inhumanity--its Black Hole, its Dartmoor, its Andersonville.

It was the dead of winter, but they had no warmth save from their emaciated and vermin-infested bodies. They were ironed two and two, day and night. They were so crowded that there was not floor-room for all to sleep at once.

Resting some days, Maud was again tried, and among other times succeeded in...", "...at a table near me were seated three Americans whose remarks I could not help overhearing; they were travellers in various small articles, one of them being a specialist in neckties; while they were talking two men of the 7th Cavalry walked past; my friend, the necktie man, looked after them, shook his head, and in most contemptuous tones said: \"I suppose we must pay the lazy, useless brutes just for the look of the thing.\" The speaker was a pasty-faced, greasy, fat hybrid, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years old. I am afraid he was a type of which there are many in America; their God is the almighty dollar, an idol the blind worship of which will one day surely bring its own punishment. Of course I do not, for a moment, wish it to be thought that people of this type predominate in America.

If Henry's profession was true, as it probably was, that he kept him as a royal prisoner should be kept, and supplied him with the luxuries he enjoyed so much, the result was, it is possible, not altogether disagreeable to Robert himself.

The three earlier expeditions were made at the expense and under the direction of the Government. The two later ones were private ventures. The first expedition left Choteau's Landing, near the site of Kansas City, on June 10, 1842. The party consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> members, with Fremont in command, Charles Preuss, topographical engineer, Lucien Maxwell, hunter, and Kit Carson, guide. It was accompanied by Henry Brant, a son of Colonel J. H. Brant, of St. Louis, and Randolph Benton, Fremont's brother-in-law, a boy of twelve. The remainder of the party, twenty-two in number, were principally Creole or Canadian _voyageurs_. The party was well armed and mounted, with the exception of the eight cart-drivers.

Thus, although the goods brought into the country fell off unavoidably by reason of the war, and especially of the difficulties encountered by our vessels from the rebel privateers, the customs duties rather increased than diminished, and something was thus secured in the way of a basis of credit for the immense loans which became necessary.

This method was interestingly applied in the German courts, when it was held as to the opera \"Carmen\" that Bizet's music was out of...", "...to secure a period of comfort and repose for the army were, unlike those taken for the campaign, apparently adequate.

The base two gives a series of seven weights that may be used: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 lbs. By these any weight from one to one hundred and twenty-seven pounds may be weighed.

With the same number of weights, representing the arithmetical series from one to seven, only from one to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> pounds may be weighed; and though a more extended series may be used, this will only add to their inconvenience; moreover, from similarity of size, such weights will be readily mistaken.

There was a time at which, at the loss of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> or thirty thousand pounds, I might have freed myself of every liability; and, indeed, I was more than half inclined to do it; but the devil, in this fellow's shape, hinted something about being poor-spirited and craven-hearted; said something about men who bore reverses ill, and only spread canvas when the wind was all astern; and that, in fact, the people who carried the day in life were exactly those who never would accept defeat. All he said met a ready concurrence from...", "...of water in the stream; but the runlet of it at which I filled the flask was giving about two hundred bottles a minute, or rather more, carrying down, therefore, about three quarters of a pound of powdered granite every minute. This would be forty-five pounds an hour; but allowing for the inferior power of the stream in the cooler periods of the day, and taking into consideration, on the other side, its increased power in rain, we may, I think, estimate its average hour's work at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> or thirty pounds, or a hundredweight every four hours. By this insignificant runlet, therefore, rather more than two tons of the substance of the Mont Blanc are displaced and carried down a certain distance every week; and as it is only for three or four months that the flow of the stream is checked by frost, we may certainly allow eighty tons for the mass which it annually moves. It is not worth while to enter into any calculation of the relation borne by this runlet to...", "...Again, he recommends soiling,[H] by all the arguments which are used, and vainly used, with us. He shows the worthlessness of manure dropped upon a parched field, compared with the same duly cared for in court or stable; he proposes movable sheds for feeding, and enters into a computation of the weight of green clover which will be consumed in a day by horses, cows, or oxen: \"a horse, ten Dutch stone daily; an ox or cow, eight stone; ten horses, ten oxen, and six cows, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> stone per day,\"--involving constant cartage: still he is convinced of the profit of the method. His views on feeding ordinary store cattle, or accustoming them to change of food, are eminently practical. After speaking of the desirableness of providing a good stock of vegetables, he continues,--\"And yet, after all, how many indolent farmers remain, who for want of spring food are forced to turn their cattle out to grass before it is ready for pasture! which not only...", "...king of the Mercians, and Oswald, king of the North-men, and he gained the victory by diabolical agency. He was not baptized, and never believed in God. 66. From the beginning of the world to Constantinus and Rufus, are found to be five thousand six hundred and fifty-eight years. Also from the two consuls, Rufus and Rubelius, to the consul Stilicho, are three hundred and seventy-three years. Also from Stilicho to Valentinian, son of Placida, and the reign of Vortigern, are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> years. And from the reign of Vortigern to the quarrel between Guitolinus and Ambrosius, are twelve years, which is Guoloppum, that is Catgwaloph.* Vortigern reigned in Britain when Theodosius and Valentinian were consuls, and in the fourth year of his reign the Saxons came to Britain, in the consulship of Felix and Taurus, in the four hundredth year from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. * In Carmarthenshire. Perhaps the town now called Kidwelly. From...", "...the nearest place to the type locality of _P. ochraventer_ from which _P. mexicanus_ has been taken is at Xilitla approximately 225 kilometers to the southward in San Luis Potosi (Dalquest, Occ. Papers Mus. Zool., Louisiana State Univ., No. 28:8, July 10, 1950). The brown coloring on the underparts is a distinctive feature of _P. ochraventer_; in adults this color differs in shade. In some specimens patches of whitish hair give the tail a splotched appearance. Eleven of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-eight</span> skulls and lower jaws examined have bone eroded away from around the cheek-teeth exposing part of the roots. Most of the fully adult animals have this condition. One adult female, no. 36959, has the upper third molar on the right side missing, possibly as a result of bone erosion. These mice were taken in junglelike forest, in rocks and adjacent to logs. Schaldach writes that \"Their burrows go back under the large limestone blocks, and each burrow where I caught a mouse..."]
