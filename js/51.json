The total amount of the gold was found to be one million, three hundred and twenty-six thousand, five hundred and thirty nine pesos de oro, which, allowing for the greater value of money in the sixteenth century, would be equivalent, probably, at the present time, to near three millions and a half of pounds sterling, or somewhat less than fifteen millions and a half of dollars.4 The quantity of silver was estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> thousand six hundred and ten marks. History affords no parallel of such a booty--and that, too, in the most convertible form, in ready money, as it were--having fallen to the lot of a little band of military adventurers, like the Conquerors of Peru. The great object of the Spanish expeditions in the New World was gold. It is remarkable that their success should have been so complete. Had they taken the track of the English, the French, or the Dutch, on the shores of the...", "...through Torres Strait. I had now determined upon taking up an anchorage round Cape Grafton during the continuance of the bad weather, and for that purpose steered through the strait that separates the cape from Fitzroy Island; and anchored in six fathoms mud, at about half a mile from its northern extremity.

In passing between Cape Grafton and Fitzroy Island, eight or ten natives were observed seated on the rocks at the south end of the beach: one of them waved his spear to us as we passed, but the distance was too great to take any notice of him. In the afternoon we landed upon the small island in the bay, and found it to be separated from the mainland by a very shoal...", "...not even be a man. On the occasion of his marriage not only the senate and the equestrian order but also the wives of the senators received some distribution of presents.

As a result of this encounter sixty-three members of the battalion were court-martialed at Fort Sam Houston. Thirteen were hanged on December 11, 1917, five more were executed on September 13, 1918, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> were sentenced to life imprisonment and five to briefer terms; and the Negro people of the country felt very keenly the fact that the condemned men were hanged like common criminals rather than given the death of soldiers.

Thirty-six pounds on the one side, not much more than thirty shillings on the other.

This encouraged Wildeve. He took the box; and his three casts amounted to forty-five. Down went another of the reddleman's sovereigns against his first one which Wildeve laid. This time Wildeve threw <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> points, but no pair. The reddleman looked grim, threw a raffle of aces, and pocketed the stakes. \"Here you are again,\" said Wildeve contemptuously. \"Double the stakes.\" He laid two of Thomasin's guineas, and the reddleman his two pounds. Venn won again. New stakes were laid on the stone, and the gamblers proceeded as before. Wildeve was a nervous and excitable man, and the game was beginning to tell upon his temper.

Even so, it will be seen that four hundred and seventy-five--nearly half of the Bedford women--had been servants.

Of that number twenty-nine had worked in private homes as domestics. Bedford Reformatory receives mostly city girls; Albion and Rochester are supplied from small cities and country towns.

Domestic service is constantly urged upon women as the safest, healthiest, most normal profession in which they...", "...THE RASPBERRY.--This fruit grows in both a wild and a cultivated state. It derives its name from the rough rasps or spines with which the bushes are covered. Among the ancients it was called \"the bramble of Mt. Ida,\" because it was abundant upon that mountain.

There are one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> named species, although the high-blackberry and the low-blackberry, or dewberry, are said to have furnished the best cultivated varieties. THE MULBERRY.--Different varieties of the mulberry tree produce white, red, and black mulberries of fine aromatic flavor, and acidulous or sweet taste.

Even in 1800, when the votes for Jefferson and Burr in the Electoral College were equal, it is notorious that this equality was simply the result of their being supported on the same ticket,--the former for the office of President, and the latter for that of Vice-President. Mr. Parton says, that, in the House of Representatives, Burr would have been elected on the first ballot, if a majority would have sufficed; and that Mr. Jefferson never received more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> votes in a House of one hundred and six members. Had he taken the trouble to examine Gales's \"Annals of Congress\" for 1799-1801, he would have found that the House consisted of one hundred and four members, two seats being vacant; and that on the first ballot Jefferson received fifty-five votes, a majority of six.

The most extraordinary thing of all is, that on a continent of such length and breadth, the distance to the South Sea was not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles, or seventeen leagues. In Spain people never count by miles; the land league equals three miles, and the marine league four miles. When they reached the summit of the mountain chain, which is the watershed, they found there a cacique called Javana.

In the intervals between the commitees they were often occupied, having each of them some object committed to his charge.

Nor was the effect produced within this short period otherwise than commensurate with the efforts used.

We took up our former anchorage under Moreton Island, and remained there for nine days, occupied in completing our stock of water, and obtaining a rate for the chronometers--so as to ensure a good meridian distance between this and the Louisiade.

Also, some apprentices were bound by means other than indenture to avoid settlement. Laborers who came to work in industries were refused settlement and sent back to their original parishes whenever they seemed likely to become dependent on the rates.

Most of her slave property was kept on her plantation not far from Old Point Comfort.

The ten-pound clause, again, it was admitted, had not suffered from the alteration which had been introduced in it: the fact was, the clause had been merely simplified in its wording and provisions; in its practical effect it was precisely similar to that contained in the late bill.

A strong wind, moreover, had so drifted it that the roads were impassable, and the communication between neighbouring villages, and even between houses in the same village, almost ceased.

John Tyler, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years of age when he took possession of the Executive Mansion, was somewhat above the medium height, and of slender figure, with long limbs and great activity of movement. His thin auburn hair turned white during his term of office, his nose was large and prominent, his eyes were of a bluish- gray, his lips were thin, and his cheeks sunken. His manners were those of the old school of Virginia gentlemen, and he was very courteous to strangers. The ceremonious etiquette...", "...in some measure, to trust in an arm of flesh; going to man, instead of going to the Lord at once.

Our staff and support in this matter were Matthew vi. 19-34, John xiv. 13, 14. We leaned on the arm of the Lord Jesus.

Our God also has, in His tender mercy, given us grace to abide in the same mind concerning the above points, both as it regards principle and practice; and this has been the means of letting us see the tender love and care of our God over His children, even in the most minute things, in a way in which we never experimentally knew them before; and it has, in particular, made the Lord...", "...another, thinking of ways to interest the people in woman suffrage, was too busy and too far away to follow Victoria Woodhull's court battles. * * * * * Mrs. Stanton met Susan in Chicago late in May 1871, to join her on a lecture tour of the far West. Together they headed for Wyoming and Utah, eager to set foot in the states which had been the first to extend suffrage to women. The long leisurely days on the train gave these two old friends, Susan now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> and Mrs. Stanton, fifty-six, ample time to talk and philosophize, to appraise their past efforts for women, and plan their speeches for the days ahead. While their main theme would always be votes for women, they decided that from now on they must also arouse women to rebel against their legal bondage under the \"man marriage,\" as they called it, and to face frankly the facts about sex, prostitution, and the double standard of morals. In Utah, in the midst of polygamy fostered...", "...late in 1902. While working on the History, Susan, although more than satisfied with Mrs. Harper's work, often thought nostalgically of her happy stimulating years of collaboration with Mrs. Stanton. She seldom saw Mrs. Stanton now, but they kept in touch with each other by letter. In the spring of 1902, she visited Mrs. Stanton twice in New York, and planned to return in November to celebrate Mrs. Stanton's eighty-seventh birthday. In anticipation, she wrote Mrs. Stanton, \"It is <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years since we first met and we have been busy through every one of them, stirring up the world to recognize the rights of women.... We little dreamed when we began this contest ... that half a century later we would be compelled to leave the finish of the battle to another generation of women.

Up to date <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> known dead had been reported. Hundreds of those whose homes were in the flooded district, but who were marooned in the business section of the city, away from their families, were able to get to the flood section Thursday by a circuitous route about twenty-five miles long.

At East Liverpool on March 27th, more than a thousand families were driven from their homes, five thousand potters were deprived of employment temporarily and the city water works were out of commission as the result of the flood. The electric light plant was seriously threatened and trolley lines were tied up. The following day the river had eclipsed the 48.8 foot stage of 1884. A stage of at least <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> feet was expected. Conditions remained the same, but the situation at Wellsville, a city of ten thousand, three miles south, was perilous. Over three thousand were homeless. The city is located on a flat promontory, with the eastern portion a slight apex against the fast rising stream. Back water had already made an island of the city, precluding any possibility of escape to the high hills.

Their chief defence was the fortress of Cronberg, near Elsinore, where heavy cannon were mounted to command the narrow strait here separating Sweden and Denmark. But by closely hugging the Swedish coast Parker kept beyond the range of these guns, and in April, 1801, cast anchor in the harbor of Copenhagen. His fleet consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> vessels, twenty of them being line-of-battle ships. Alarmed by the coming of the fleet and taking advantage of the delays in its movement, the Danes had made every possible preparation for a vigorous resistance. Strong batteries defended the city and an imposing array of heavily armed ships, drawn up behind a shoal, presented a formidable line of defence. Some delay took place, against the wish of the fiery Nelson, who was second in command of the fleet.

Nor could any dramatic rise in the number of black officers be expected. Between 1963 and 1968 the three service academies graduated just <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> black officers, an impressive statistic only in the light of the record of a total of sixty black graduates in the preceding eighty-six years. Furthermore, there were only 116 black cadets in 1968, a vast proportional increase over former years but also an indication of the small number of black officers that could be expected from that source during the next four years (_Table 26_).

It would thus seem that there were two creations, the first having been a failure because Belus had not foreseen that it was needful to produce beings which should be able to bear the light.

The last two refer to his being the god who, by his kindness, obtained from his father Ea, dwelling in the abyss, those charms and incantations which benefited mankind, and restored the sick to health. In this connection, a frequent title given to him is \"the merciful one,\" but most merciful was he in that he spared the lives of the gods who, having sided with Taiwath, were his enemies, as is related in the tablet of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> names. In connection with the fight he bore also the names, \"annihilator of the enemy,\" \"rooter out of all evil,\" \"troubler of the evil ones,\" \"life of the whole of the gods.\" From these names it is clear that Merodach, in defeating Tiawath, annihilated, at the same time, the spirit of evil, Satan, the accuser, of which she was, probably, the Babylonian type. But unlike the Saviour in the Christian creed, he saved not only man, at that time uncreated, but the gods of heaven...", "...of \"the gods his fathers\" to Merodach practically identified them with him, thus leading to a tendency to monotheism. That tendency is, perhaps, hinted at in a letter of Assur-bani-apli to the Babylonians, in which he frequently mentions the Deity, but in doing so, uses either the word /ilu/, \"God,\" Merodach, the god of Babylon, or Bel, which may be regarded as one of his names. The most important document for this monotheistic tendency, however (confirming as it does the tablet of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> names), is that in which at least thirteen of the Babylonian deities are identified with Merodach, and that in such a way as to make them merely forms in which he manifested himself to men. The text of this inscription is as follows:-- \". . . is Merodach of planting. Lugal-aki-. . . is Merodach of the water-course. Nirig is Merodach of strength. Nergal is Merodach of war.

The apparent velocity of the meteors is between ten and forty-five miles a second, and their average height is about seventy-six miles at first appearance, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles at disappearance. Occasionally a meteor is so large and compact as to escape total destruction, and falls to the earth. Specimens of these meteorites are to be found in our best museums.

To the Jews they give an annual increase of 1.73 per cent.; to the Christian, 1.36 per cent.

Three new volumes in 1594, together with the reissue of Daniel's 'Delia' and of Constable's 'Diana' (in a piratical miscellany of sonnets from many pens), prove the steady growth of the sonnetteering vogue.

Drayton acknowledged his devotion to 'divine Sir Philip,' but by his choice of title, style, and phraseology, the English sonnetteer once more betrayed his indebtedness to Desportes and his compeers. 'L'Idee' was the name of a collection of sonnets by Claude de Pontoux in 1579. Many additions were made by Drayton to the sonnets that he published in 1594, and many were subtracted before 1619, when...", "...with whom Dampier sailed on board the _Duke_, of three hundred tons, thirty guns, and one hundred and seventy men.

He peered curiously at Howley as he pushed out the chips to make a grand total of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> thousand two hundred dollars.

Howley nodded apologetically and pulled off everything but two thousand dollars worth of chips.

The chief business of these railroads extending into the Andes is carrying ore, bullion, and wool.

When <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> per cent of the people in a community are filled with a desire to give, Socialism will be a success.

Had the Pope and his advisers been wise enough they would have paid no attention to Luther, and thus allowed opinion inside the Church to change, as it has changed in our day.

But the Pope did not correctly gauge the people--he did not know that Luther was speaking for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> per cent of all Germany. Orders were given out in Leipzig from pulpits, that on a certain day all good Catholics should bring such copies of Martin Luther's books as they had in their possession to the public square, and the books would there be burned.

Luther still continued to preach daily, and declared that...", "...pathetic part of it was that the dead man was a total stranger in the city; and then he winked and asked if I knew that though the city paid the coroner his salary, the state guaranteed an extra fee of 'saxty dollar' to that official for every stranger who met with sudden death within our limits? I didn't know, but I do now. I took pains to look up last year's records and, curiously enough, out of one hundred and seventy-six cases that required the services of a coroner, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> were those of strangers. That would add about nine thousand dollars to a quite moderate salary.

Congress declined to make the necessary appropriation of $25,000 for this purpose, although it was strongly endorsed by the President. In 1901 the National Conservation Association was formed, a voluntary organization of public and scientific men. The purpose of this association is to carry on the movement for conservation in every State. Within seven months after the White House conference, forty-one State conservation commissions were created and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> conservation commissions representing national organizations were formed. President Roosevelt carried the movement still farther in calling the first North American conservation congress. Representatives to this conference met in Washington, February 18, 1909. They came from Canada, Newfoundland, and Mexico as well as the United States. Broad general principles of conservation applicable to the North American continent were adopted.

Quakerism is favourable to _longevity_, it seems. According to late English census returns, the average age attained by members of this peaceful sect in Great Britain is <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years, two months, and twenty-one days. Half of the population of the country, as is seen by the same returns, die before reaching the age of twenty-one, and the average duration of human life the world over is but thirty-three years; Quakers, therefore, live a third longer than the rest of us. The reasons are obvious enough. Quakers are temperate and prudent, are seldom in a hurry, and never in a passion. Quakers, in the very midst of the week's business--on Wednesday...", "...Krakatoa to its antipodes. Perhaps even more striking was the extent of our earth's surface over which the noise of the great explosion spread. At Batavia, ninety-four miles away, the concussions were simply deafening; at Macassar, in Celebes, two steamers were sent out to investigate the explosions which were heard, little thinking that they came from Krakatoa, nine hundred and sixty-nine miles away. Alarming sounds were heard over the island of Timor, one thousand three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles away from Krakatoa. Diego Garcia in the Chogos islands is two thousand two hundred and sixty-seven miles from Krakatoa, but the thunders traversed even this distance, and were attributed to some ship in distress, for which a search was made.

The officer opened the porte-monnaie, and counted <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> dollars in bills, which he took from it. The trip down the river had cost me about seventy dollars, but the proceeds of the raft and its furniture had added twenty-five dollars to my exchequer.

Minor consolidations followed these in 1902 and 1903, but none aroused so much fear as the Northern Securities Company of New Jersey, the holding company in whose hands Hill and Morgan determined to put the control of their lines. The fate of any single company could be determined by the ownership of not over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> per cent of its stock. If this was owned by another corporation, a similar proportion of the stock of the latter would control the whole. The holding company was a machine whereby capital could control property several times its bulk. The Governors of the Northwest States, alarmed at the monopolization of their railways, protested and started suits. It was claimed that this sort of merging of railroads was, after all, a conspiracy in restraint of trade. In March, 1902,...", "...greatest service to the schools was his publication of text-books, which were very much needed. He wrote a Greek grammar for boys when himself but a boy of sixteen. Grammar he defined as \"the science of speaking and writing correctly,\" a definition that has been scarcely improved upon. Ten years later his Latin grammar was published, after being tested for some years in his classes. For more than one hundred years this was the principal Latin grammar in use, and there were not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> editions of it. He wrote also text-books on logic, rhetoric, and ethics. It will be seen that the trivium--grammar, rhetoric, logic--furnished the foundation of his literary activity, so far as the schools are concerned. He was active also in authorship of theological works, producing the first theological work of the Protestant Church, the \"Loci Communes,\" which Luther placed next to the Bible for theological study. The interest of Melanchthon for education made him the...", "...years the only publications of which are, in 1850, _Christmas Eve and Easter Day_, a long poem in two parts giving the arguments in favor of Christianity; and, in 1852, an introduction to a collection of letters then supposed to be by Shelley, but since found to be spurious. The essay is nevertheless of importance as an exposition of Browning's theory of poetry, and as an interesting study of Shelley. In 1855, at the close of this period of nine years, there appeared a collection of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> poems entitled _Men and Women_. In \"fundamental brain power,\" insight, beauty, and mastery of style, these poems show Browning at the highest level of his poetic achievement. It is in these remarkable poems that he brought to perfection a poetic form which he practically invented, the dramatic monologue, a form in which there is but one speaker but which is essentially dramatic in effect. The dramatic quality arises partly from the implied presence of listeners whose...", "...the gang that made its headquarters with the rats in the cellar, terrorizing the helpless tenants; knew the well-worn rut of the dead-wagon and the ambulance to the gate, for the tenants died there like flies in all seasons, and a tenth of its population was always in the hospital.

In 1888 I counted 360 tenants in these tenements, front and rear, all Italians, and the infant death-rate of the Barracks that year was 325 per 1000. There were forty babies, and one in three of them had to die. The general infant death-rate for the whole tenement-house population that year was 88.38. In the four years following, during which the population and the death-rate of the houses were both reduced with an effort, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> funerals went out of the Barracks.

These at length formed between them a sort of federation as they grew in number and power. Finally, in 1543, they formed the Gild of Saint Luke. In 1560 they numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> free masters, who gave instruction to a great number of apprentices. They admitted the gold beaters to membership in 1618, and the following year the organization had increased to ninety-six members.

The moon goes around the earth in twenty-seven and a quarter days. It loses about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> minutes in twenty-fours hours; therefore it rises that much later each successive night on the average, but there are wide deviations from this average, as for example, the time of the Harvest and Hunter's moons in the fall, when the full moon rises at nearly the same time for several nights in succession.

The picture-writing so common to savages and barbarians finally passes from a simple _rebus_ to a very complex written language, as in the case of the Egyptian or Mexican. The North American Indians used picture-writing in describing battles, or an expedition across a lake, or an army on a march, or a buffalo hunt. A simple picture shows that <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> warriors, led by a chief and his assistant, in five canoes, took three days to cross a lake and land their forces on the other side. The use of pictographs is the next step in the process of written language. It represents a generalized form of symbols which may be put together in such a way as to express complete thoughts. Originally they were merely symbols or signs of ideas, which by being slightly changed in form or position led to the expression of a complete...", "...from this part of the seat of war. Upon December 3rd Bruce Hamilton, who had the valuable assistance of Wools-Sampson to direct his intelligence, struck swiftly out from Ermelo and fell upon a Boer laager in the early morning, capturing ninety-six prisoners. On the 10th he overwhelmed the Bethel commando by a similar march, killing seven and capturing 131. Williams and Wing commanded separate columns in this operation, and their energy may be judged from the fact that they covered <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles during the twenty-four hours. On the 12th Hamilton's columns were on the war-path once more, and another commando was wiped out. Sixteen killed and seventy prisoners were the fruits of this expedition. For the second time in a week the columns had done their fifty miles a day, and it was no surprise to hear from their commander that they were in need of a rest. Nearly four hundred prisoners had been taken from the most warlike portion of the Transvaal in ten days by one...", "...men. The gunners had time to fire two rounds before they were overpowered and shot down to a man. For half an hour the resistance was maintained, but at the end of that time the Boers had the whole camp in their possession, and were already hastening to get their prisoners away before the morning should bring a rescue. The casualties are in themselves enough to show how creditable was the resistance of the Yeomanry. Out of a force of under four hundred men they had six officers and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> men killed, eight officers and eighty men wounded. There have been very few surrenders during the war in which there has been such evidence as this of a determined stand. Nor was it a bloodless victory upon the part of the Boers, for there was evidence that their losses, though less than those of the British, were still severe. The prisoners, over two hundred in number, were hurried away by the Boers, who seemed under the immediate eye of De Wet to have behaved with...", "...cannot be acquired; it has to be developed: and it is developed by experience only. Experience ordinarily requires time; and though, for special reasons which will be noted later on, most of the great short-story writers have been young, we are not surprised to notice that most of the great novelists have been men mature in years. They have ripened slowly to a realization of those truths which later they have labored to impart. Richardson, the father of the modern English novel, was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years old when \"Pamela\" was published; Scott was forty-three when \"Waverley\" appeared; Hawthorne was forty-six when he wrote \"The Scarlet Letter\"; Thackeray and George Eliot were well on their way to the forties when they completed \"Vanity Fair\" and \"Adam Bede\"; and these are the first novels of each writer.

The two magistrates at the close of their year of office were bound to transmit their power to successors; and these successors whom they nominated were obliged to seek the suffrages of the people. The only body known to us as electing the consuls during the republican period was the _comitia centuriata_ (see Comitia). The consulate was originally confined to patricians. During the struggle for higher office that was waged between the orders the office was suspended on <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> occasions between the years 444 and 367 B.C. and replaced by the military tribunate with consular power, to which plebeians were eligible. The struggle was brought to an end by the Licinio-Sextian laws of 367 B.C., which enacted that one consul must be a plebeian (see Patricians).

It is, therefore, quite preposterous _to take for granted_ that, in _all the families of a whole nation_, the number of descents were exactly the same during a period of 215 years. But this assumption is especially inadmissible, when we consider the peculiar circumstances of the case before us. The first generation, according to Dr. Colenso, was composed of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> grandsons of Jacob. They were already grown up, and some of them even had children when they came into Egypt. Therefore the whole of the first generation was already in existence, and the second had begun to be born some years, let us say three, before the descent.

It was a very kindly and brotherly letter for the first page. Then the colonel stated that Noah had by the time he received the letter discovered that the value of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> negroes on the estate had not been included in his valuation of the property. They were worth at least twenty-five thousand dollars. They had been given to him with the plantation, but he enjoined it upon him on no account to sell one of them.

He simply refrained from meddling with the subject. The <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> negroes on the estate had been willed to him, and he was as much a slaveholder as his brother had been.

By this route a saving of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles in actual distance will be effected, and the traffic will reach the deep and still waters of Puget Sound, far away from the troubles and stickings of the Willamette and Columbia mouths, and the delays, dangers, and expenses of the Columbia bar.

In 1747 was published the first volume of _Espana Sagrada, teatro geografico-historico de la Iglesia de Espana_, a vast compilation of Spanish ecclesiastical history which obtained a European reputation, and of which twenty-nine volumes appeared in the author's lifetime. It was continued after his death by Manuel Risco and others, and further additions have been made at the expense of the Spanish government. The whole work in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> volumes was published at Madrid (1747-1886). Its value is considerably increased by the insertion of ancient chronicles and documents not easily accessible elsewhere. Florez was a good numismatist, and published _Medallas de las Colonias_ in 2 vols. (1757-1758), of which a third volume appeared in 1773. His last work was the _Memorias de las reynas Catolicas_, 2 vols. (1770). Florez led a retired, studious and unambitious life, and died at Madrid on the 20th of August...", "...and 13 are added.] It was with this type of vessel that the Madeira and Canary groups were \"gained from the secrets of the Ocean;\" that the Azores, at a distance of twenty-two degrees west of Portugal, and in the heart of the Atlantic, were discovered and colonised; and that open sea navigation of almost equal boldness was successfully employed in the finding and settlement of the Cape Verdes.

And then it came to pass that the wind arose with such force from the side of the South that he was obliged to raise sail and return to the Kingdom.

We have not the shadow of a doubt that he is perfectly satisfied with Mr. Buchanan's triumph at the Five Points, which, with the exception of the slave-pens in Southern cities, is, perhaps, the most vile and heart-sickening locality in the United States.

Besides this fondness for plotting Sidney found time to earn the reputation of one of the most immoral men, even in Charles's reign. He regarded every woman of beauty as fit prey for his passion, and even when he was nearly seventy his intrigues were the talk of London. [Sidenote: Protestant Party dissatisfied] This was the man William sent to represent him in Ireland, and when Viscount Sidney arrived in Dublin in 1692 he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years of age, unmarried, and still very handsome. But he was not a statesman or a soldier, and his position alone made him great. He was not equal to the task of carrying out the changes created by the Treaty of Limerick--a treaty hotly repudiated by the Protestant party in Ireland, who, now that William's cause had triumphed, naturally looked for a return of their supremacy and the subjection of the majority. Sidney's conciliatory attitude towards the Catholics brought...", "...Molleville, and later was director of the commissary department in the first division of the Armee du Nord, stationed at Lille. It is impossible to follow him through all the different wanderings necessitated by his functions, but it is known that upon returning to Paris he there married the daughter of one of his superior officers, Sallambier, attached to the Ministry of War and at the same time director of the Paris hospitals. At the time of the marriage, January 30, 1797, he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years of age; his bride, Laure, was only eighteen, a young girl possessed of culture, beauty and distinction of manner. The first fruit of this union was a son, who, although nursed by the mother, died at an early age.

He did not know who these new men were, but this scheme was in line with his own ideas.

If these new men were willing to pay a high rate for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> per cent. of this stock for ninety-nine years and would guarantee a satisfactory rate of interest on all the stock as it stood, besides inaugurating a forward policy, why not let them? It would be just as good as mortgaging the soul out of the old property, and the management was of no value, anyhow. Kaffrath could not see how fortunes were to be made for these new investors out of subsidiary construction and equipment companies, in which Cowperwood would be interested, how...", "...The city highway department was constantly jumping on them for neglect of street repairs. The city water department, by some hocus-pocus, made it its business to discover that they had been stealing water.

A couple of days were spent by Wilcox, Barrett and Peyto in a complete circuit of the mountain, a distance as they were compelled to travel of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles, through a country for the most part absolutely devoid of trails, and covered in places with a very wilderness of fallen timber. For hours their only means of travel was along the tops of prostrate trunks piled ten and twelve feet above the ground.

This fact is not insignificant, since it clearly marks the change that had come over the nation, when the scepter of learning was transferred to the northern provinces, and the exclusive privilege of correct Italian composition was shared with Tuscans by men of other dialects.[309] In his early youth Bembo had the good sense to perceive that the...", "...for a time they gave up even the longing for rights which they had lost, and taught their children abject obedience in order that they might simply _live_.

These last, however, no longer possessed any political power. But, without them, there were two hundred and three more or less independent, jealous and conflicting States, united by a bond which was more imaginary than real; and this confused, unnatural state of things continued until Napoleon came to put an end to it.

But even at that period the spirit of ostentation, which forms the substratum of the Russian character, already revealed itself; and while forming those grand institutions, not a thought had been given to the opening of a single elementary school in either capital. Some writers indeed allege that Peter I. left behind him, at his death, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> schools for the people, and fifty-six for the military; but I have always been disposed to think that those establishments existed but in name, and my researches have but confirmed that opinion.

Thomas Sternhold lived to translate <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> only of the Psalms; and the first edition was published in 1549, with this title--\"_All such Psalms of David as Thomas Sterneholde, late groome of the king's majestye's robes did in his lyfetime drawe into Englyshe metre_.\" About this period, the larger cities of the kingdom had become inundated with obscene and blasphemous songs, to such a degree, that some powerful expedient seemed to be required, for the removal of this insufferable grievance.

This was found to be three hundred and sixty-five whole days, and...", "...half years.

At Livingston, a thousand and odd miles from St. Paul, we left the Northern Pacific, and by a narrow-gauge road continued up the Yellowstone, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles to Cinnabar; thence by Park coaches, wagonettes and surreys, eight miles along the wildly rushing Gardner river, and through a narrow defile hemmed in by lofty precipices beneath frowning crags--the gateway to the park--to the \"Mammoth Hot Springs.\" Near the gateway on a lofty pinnacled rock, so slender as at first to be mistaken for the trunk of a huge tree, sat an eagle upon its eyrie, keeping watch and ward over the entrance to the people's pleasure ground. The...", "...Psalm Tune \"Doncaster.\"_--Our organist is about to add another selection of psalm tunes to the large number already existing.

I asked if I could not be allowed to go to see my wife and children, or if this could not be permitted, if they might not have leave to come to see me; but was told that I would be able to get another wife in Georgia. My new master, whose name I did not hear, took me that same day across the Patuxent, where I joined <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> other slaves, whom he had bought in Maryland. Thirty-two of these were men, and nineteen were women. The women were merely tied together with a rope, about the size of a bed-cord, which was tied like a halter round the neck of each; but the men, of whom I was the stoutest and strongest, were very differently caparisoned. A strong iron collar was closely fitted by means of a padlock round each of our necks. A chain of iron, about a hundred feet in length, was passed through...", "...to parish seeking poor relief. Settled people tended to fear wandering people. Parishes sought to keep down their poor rates by devices such as removing mothers in labor lest the infant be born in the parish. So a statute was passed that a child born to a wandering woman could not have the place of birth as his settlement, but takes the same settlement as his mother. Another device to prevent others from establishing settlement in a parish was for its farmers to hire laborers for only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> weeks. Also, some apprentices were bound by means other than indenture to avoid settlement. Laborers who came to work in industries were refused settlement and sent back to their original parishes whenever they seemed likely to become dependent on the rates. Statutes then provided that a parish must give settlement to apprentices bound for forty days there, not only by indenture, but by deed, writings, or contracts not indented. In 1722, parishes were authorized to purchase...", "...at work, day and night the year round, except Sundays. A stoppage here of an hour means $1,000 lost.

Two wheels, 40 feet in diameter, are to swing round here, taking up thousands of gallons of water every minute. XVII. SAD EXPERIENCES. Fourteen years ago I attended <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> funerals in twenty-one months. This large number was due to the fact that toward the south and west the nearest minister was ten miles off, north and east over twenty miles; and though there were only some 450 souls in White Cloud, we may safely put down 3,000 as the number who looked to this point for ministerial aid in time of trouble. The traveller by rail passes a few small places, and may think that between stations there is nothing but a wilderness, for such it often...", "...Two days were spent at Chicago, during which we drove around the Exposition buildings, now rapidly nearing completion; then we took places previously engaged on the Pennsylvania Limited, and in twenty-five hours were landed in Jersey City.

I dwell upon this, because, if we form the syndicate which you propose, it must be managed craftily, and I know you will not disregard my warning. \"As an example of it, let me tell what has befallen the plant for making wood turpentine at Schoville, Georgia. It is a fine, modern, up-to-date plant of the steam process, backed and controlled by Judd Brothers & Morgan, of Brooklyn. Their representative approached my counsel, offering to sell. The Brooklyn firm own <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> per cent. of the stock, and the rest is taken by citizens of Schoville. I sent my man, Donohue, down to investigate the process, intending, if I didn't buy, to organize a similar company and operate under their patents, as I find theirs, if not the best, is at least a satisfactory process, and turns out a pure water-white turpentine with a specific gravity of 31.70.

The two following days were calm. Orders had been given to pass the Sound as soon as the wind would permit; and on the afternoon of the 29th the ships were cleared for action with an alacrity characteristic of British seamen. At daybreak on the 30th it blew a top-sail breeze from north-west. The signal was made and the fleet moved on in order of battle; Nelson's division in the van, Sir Hyde's in the centre, and Admiral Graves' in the rear. The whole force consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> sail of various descriptions, of which sixteen were of the line. The greater part of the bomb and gun vessels took their stations off Cronenburg Castle, to cover the fleet; while others on the larboard were ready to engage the Swedish shore.

XI THE SEVEN SLEEPERS A thousand and a thousand years ago, seven saints hid from heathen persecutors among the cold mountains which circle Ephesus. The multitude who cried, \"Great is Diana of the Ephesians!\" are drifting dust, and the vast city itself but a mass of half-buried ruins. Yet somewhere in a lonely cave sleep those seven holy men, unvexed by sorrow, untouched by time, until...", "...five miles distant, and on to Fort Duquesne. On this faint opening into the western forest the little band and its youthful commander kept their eyes as the sun dropped behind the hills, closing an anxious day and bringing a dreaded night. How large the body of French might have been, not one of the one hundred and fifty men knew. How far away they might be, no one could guess. Here in this forest meadow the little vanguard slept on their arms, surrounded by watchful sentinels, with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles of forest and mountain between them and the nearest settlement at Wills Creek. The darkling forests crept down the hills on either side as though to hint by their portentous shadows of the dead and dying that were to be. But the night waned and morning came. With increasing energy, as though nerved to duty by the dangers which surrounded him, the twenty-two-year-old commander Washington gave his orders promptly. A scouting party was sent on the Indian trail in search...", "...it had occurred, as there seems valid reason to suppose, within the limits of written history. The anachronism between the two dates assigned by Chinese authors (2297 B.C.) and the Jewish historian's calculation (2104 B.C.) is only one hundred and ninety-three years, and this is not so great but that we may anticipate its being explained at some future date. Strauchius' computation of 2293 B.C. for the date of the Biblical deluge is within four years, and Ussher's (2349-2348) within <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> of the Chinese one. The reason for supposing the deluge of Yao to be historically true, will be inferred from the arguments borrowed from Mr. Legge on the subject of the _Shu-king_, in another portion of this volume. It is detailed in the great Chinese work on history, the _T'ung-keen-kang-muh_, by Choo He, of which De Mailla's _History of China_ professes to be a translation. This states that the inundation happened in the sixty-first year of the reign of Yao (2297 B.C.),...", "...and \"scout the place,\" and then begin to let the boat down on a line. We hug the black sides like ants, while the water goes to soapsuds at our feet. The boat bobs and rocks, and is nearly upset in a place where we cannot follow it through. We must take it up a ledge about thirty feet high, and after puffing and blowing and feats of maniacal strength, we at last have it again in the water. After some days of this thing we found from a statistician we had dropped 1100 feet in about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> miles, and with the well-known propensity of water to flow downhill, it can be seen that difficulties were encountered. You cannot carry a boat in the forest, and you will discover enough reasons why in a five-minute trail to make their enumeration tiresome. The zest of the whole thing lies in not knowing the difficulties beforehand, and then, if properly equipped, a man who sits at a desk the year through can find no happier days than he will in his canoe when the still...", "...is said that when the assembly was organized and ready for the introduction of their momentous business, that a long, deep, death-like silence fell upon them.

A royal commission, appointed by the duc de Choiseul to examine the constitutions, convoked a private assembly of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> archbishops and bishops under the presidency of Cardinal de Luynes, all of whom except six voted that the unlimited authority of the general was incompatible with the laws of France, and that the appointment of a resident vicar, subject to those laws, was the only solution of the question fair on all sides.

At a later period magnificent examples of this umbrageous tree continued to flourish in Greece, and many of these are still existing.

Some doubt, however, seems to exist as to whether it should be considered as a single tree, or as a number of individuals which have sprung from a decayed stock, and become united at the base. The hollow contained within the stem of this enormous tree, we are told, affords a magnificent tent to the Seraskier and his officers, when the Turks encamp in this valley....", "...at least equal to any other in extending advantages of a highway; and at the same time establishes the shortest portage between the points already navigated, and on the way accommodates other and nearer points to which navigation may be extended, and still shorten the portage....

He died in London, on the 25th October, 1811, aged thirty-six years. The knowledge, decision, and coolness which he displayed as an officer, won him the confidence of all who served with him; the gaiety and cheerfulness of his temper, the frankness of his disposition, and the warmth and goodness of his heart, rendered him the delight of all who approached him, and made his death an equal loss to private society and to his country.\" On the left is a handsome monument...", "...now two ages he had snatched from fate Whate'er was beauteous, or whate'er was great-- Rests, crowned with princes' honours, poets' lays, Due to his merit and brave thirst of praise: Living, great Nature fear'd he might outvie Her works; and dying, fears herself may die.\" Sir JOHN BURLAND, Knt., LL.D.--One of the Barons of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer; as a man, valued and beloved; as a judge, honoured and revered.

Close to these two letters are several numerals, construed to mean _one hundred and fifty-one_. And according to the account of the voyage, Thorfinn lost _nine_ of the hundred and sixty men with whom it is presumed he started, and therefore _one hundred and fifty-one_ would exactly express the number with him at the time he is supposed to have cut the inscription. This, then, would mean altogether, that Thorfinn Karlsefne established himself here with one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> men. Yet, as the testimony of this rock is not needed, we may readily forego any advantage that can be derived from its study. Besides, the history of similar cases should serve to temper our zeal. In the time of Saxo Grammatticus (1160), there was a stone at Hoby, near Runamoe, in the Swedish province of Bleking, which was supposed to be sculptured with runes. At a late day copies were furnished the antiquarians, who came to the conclusion, as Laing tells us, that it was a...", "...we _is_ ready.\" Two seated themselves upon the box-seat, two upon the back seat of the open barouche; the door was closed with a bang, the polite agent raised his hat. \"_Bon voyage_\"; and the driver, firing a volley of whip-cracks, the four grays started off with a clatter of silver-mounted harness, on a smart trot, as we rode away in the best appointed equipage it had been our fortune to enjoy in our whole European tour. This fact contributed to mitigate the conviction that <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> dollars in gold was a pretty high price, as it was, for a fourteen hour's ride, compared with that paid for carriages in other parts of Italy for similar journeys.

It consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> prelates, some of them cardinals. They met on June 27 and with the exception of the Bishop of Angers, Allais, and especially of Fitzjames, the Bishop of Soissons, who was the head of the Jansenist party and whose pastoral utterances were condemned by the Pope as heretical, addressed a \"Letter\" to the king conjuring him \"to preserve an institution which was so useful to the State,\" and declaring that \"they could not see without alarm the destruction of a society of religious...", "...of various provinces of the Society, most of which are printed in the scholasticates, and convey information about the different works of the Society in different parts of the world.

But Publius Ostorius, as his name implies, was a freeman; presumably he was a gladiator, who, having served a full term, had secured his freedom, and was now fighting on his own account. Though beaten, he was permitted to live, perhaps on account of his creditable record; he had engaged in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> combats. The combatants from the schools of Caesar and Nero were especially popular, and were generally victorious; but gladiators belonging to other proprietors are mentioned, as in the inscriptions of a house on Nola Street, which will be mentioned again presently.

The vestments were arranged according to colour. Three other wardrobes were also stored with goodly vestments, and there were twenty-six in daily use.

The same author has also shown that secondary attacks are most common in the young; so that advancing age not only renders a first attack of the disease improbable, but lessens the risk of a recurrence of it. The influence of age upon acute rheumatism is further shown in the fact that the disease is less severe, and less apt to invade the heart, in elderly than in young persons.

She had an active career as a professional murderess extending to ten years, perhaps even longer than that, but we do know that she committed murder in 1853, and she was not brought to justice and executed until 1862. A very long career, indeed, for a woman whose...", "...rooms in Loughborough Road, Brixton. The poisoner was well off, and did not stint herself, and it was assumed by her new acquaintance that the late Mr. Wilson had dowered her with sufficient goods to enable her to live independently of the world. It may be noted here that a few weeks before the death of Mrs. Soames, Wilson had spent nearly a fortnight shopping with a friend from the North, Mrs. Atkinson. One day Mrs. Atkinson had had the misfortune to lose a purse containing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> pounds. It was a terrible blow, and Mrs. Wilson was so grieved for her that she offered to lend her all the spare cash she had. The offer was refused--as Wilson had known it would be--and Mrs. Atkinson had returned home without having breathed a word against her old friend. But when Catherine Wilson came back after seeing Mrs. Atkinson off from King's Cross she was in funds, and the following day she made an extensive purchase of clothes for herself. Picking the pocket of her...", "...she became faint again, and when she recovered she found she had been robbed. Then she came on here and told me, and I've been lending her money to get about. She was hoping the money would be recovered before she had to tell you. Oh, she was goodness itself, and I have lost my dearest and only friend.\" She sank into a chair, sobbing as though her heart was breaking, and Mr. Atkinson, who had been seized with a suspicion, engendered by a memory of the loss of the purse containing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> pounds the year before, dismissed his thoughts as unfair to the woman who was mourning so whole-heartedly over the loss of the wife he loved. He did not dwell any longer on the disappearance of the notes. After all, his wife was dead, and all the money in the world could not bring her back to him. He journeyed home again, and Catherine Wilson waited only for a week to go by before she paid her debts, added to her wardrobe, and proudly exhibited a diamond ring which she said...", "...20.8 per cent of oxygen, this being the percentage of oxygen in pure air.

A dog which inhaled a mixture containing forty per cent of acetylene died suddenly after <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> minutes, having inhaled one hundred and twelve litres of the mixture; the arterial blood contained twenty per cent acetylene.

The edifices erected by the directors, such as Transportation, Machinery Hall, Electrical Building, etc., were numerous and costly. The beauties of the Art Gallery were a revelation to the busy, pushing American, and the man or woman who spent but a few days among the wonders of the great World's Fair of 1893 found food for reflection and pleasant memories to last a lifetime. Nature was not overlooked and the horticultural show...", "...thunderstruck at the swiftness and might of the assault, again counted their losses. \"By order of Viceroy Alexieff,\" reported the commanding officer to St. Petersburg, \"I beg to report that at about eleven o'clock in the morning a Japanese squadron, consisting of about fifteen battle-ships and cruisers, approached Port Arthur and opened fire.... \" ...

Every mile of this \"single track\" was so delicate, that one man could in a minute have broken or moved a rail, but our trains usually carried along the tools and means to repair such a break.

The annual amount of nitrate which the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> establishments proposed to be bought by the Government are capable of producing, may be set down at 14,000,000 cwts. These establishments do not exhaust the whole of the nitrate deposits. There are several large 'Oficinas,' as they are called, which have, for their own reasons, refused to sell their properties to the State. The region of these deposits is a wild, barren pampa, 3000 feet above the level of the sea, and contains not less than 150 square miles of land,...", "...concernment and of individual opinion.

RESIDENCE IN HOLLAND.--THE REVOLUTION.--RETURN TO ENGLAND.--PUBLICATION OF THE \"ESSAY\" AND OTHER WORKS. Locke must have landed in Holland in one of the autumn months of 1683, being then about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years of age. We are not able, however, to trace any of his movements till the January of 1683-84, when he was present, by invitation of Peter Guenellon, the principal physician of Amsterdam, at the dissection of a lioness which had been killed by the intense cold of the winter. Through Guenellon, whom he had met during his stay in Paris, he must have made the acquaintance of the principal literary and scientific men at that time residing in or near Amsterdam. Amongst these...", "...heretic.[356] The meticulous transcription of some casual and apparently irrelevant remark made by a witness in one case might lead to the arrest of an unsuspecting citizen on the charge of heresy in quite a different part of the world years afterwards.

Thus, at Pamiers in 1329 we find that out of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> experts twenty are civil lawyers.[357] The number of experts varied. Fifty is an exceptionally large number; but twenty or twenty-five quite common.[358] To what extent the councillors had a practical influence in the inquisitorial process must remain doubtful. The idea was that they should act as a check on irresponsible inquisitors, as well as give professional legal opinion when such was needed; and from the frequent references to the system in papal bulls it certainly...", "...his arm at the shoulder must have a different hook from the man who has lost his at the elbow.

Many birds which weave their nests plaster the exterior more or less thickly with cobweb so as to add strength to the structure. It would be wearisome to detail all the kinds of nest into the composition of which cobweb enters.

XXXII INDIAN FLY-CATCHERS There exist in the Indian Empire no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> species of fly-catcher. This fact speaks volumes for the wealth of both the bird and the insect population of India. Fly-catchers are little birds that feed exclusively on insects, which they secure on the wing. Their habit is to take up a strategic position on some perch, usually the bare branch of a tree, whence they make sallies into the air after their quarry. Having secured the object of their sortie--and this they never fail to do--they return to their perch. A...", "...with Ireland and with this country is carried on; and a vast quantity of business is transacted by its merchants with the ports of the Mediterranean, East Indies, and other parts of the world.

The duties paid at the custom-house of Liverpool in 1837, were four millions, three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> thousand, four hundred and ninety-six pounds, being about a fifth of those paid throughout the whole kingdom. Liverpool is the greatest outlet for the goods manufactured in Lancashire and Yorkshire, for sale in America. The town, thus so extensively concerned in that commerce from which England derives its chief glory, presents many external features not unworthy of its mercantile character. Of these the chief are the _docks_, the sight of which, bristling with numberless...", "...railroad across, or rather through, and much of the way under, the most barren succession of mountain peaks and defiles I have ever seen.

He differed also from M. Gunnar Knudsen on the question of maximum working hours, insisting on a nine hours' day and a <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> hours' week, whereas the latter would not go beyond a ten hours' day and fifty-four hours' week. On February 28 the Storthing rejected the proposal of M.

But after some weeks they were compelled by the rainy season and disease in the army to raise the siege and retreat. Meanwhile another Austrian army advanced into Croatia and fought and defeated the Turks. As a result of this the province of Croatia, which had been for one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years under Turkish rule, was freed from it, and was thenceforward an Austro-Hungarian possession. In the following year, 1685, the Austrians made further progress. The important stronghold of Neuhausel, which twenty-two years previously had been captured by the Turks, was now recaptured after a desperate resistance. Of its garrison of three thousand men only two hundred survived. The women and children of the Turks were sold to landowners in the Austrian Empire. The...", "...got to have you, Rowland.

On the 7th of May, the day on which parliament re-assembled after the Easter recess, the motion proposed by Lord Lyndhurst, to postpone the consideration of the disfranchising clauses until the enfranchising clauses had been discussed, was carried against ministers by a majority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> to one hundred and sixteen; and as this was looked upon as the first of a series of obstructions, dextrously intended by the noble and learned lord to delay and mutilate, if not to destroy, the national scheme, the ministers adopted, on the instant, a firm and resolute course. On the 9th of the same month Earl Grey announced in the Lords, and Viscount Althorp in the Commons, that ministers had resigned. A week of terrific agitation ensued, but the sequel proved the efficiency...", "...behavior towards acids and bases, their peculiar color-reaction towards certain salts, their decomposition-products, etc.--are found in all the plasma-substances, and in all the other albuminoids. This is quite in agreement with the results of quantitative analysis. However differently the various plasma-substances behave in detail, they always exhibit the same general composition as the other albuminoids out of the five \"organogenetic elements\"--namely, in point of weight, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> to fifty-four per cent. carbon, twenty-one to twenty-three per cent. oxygen, fifteen to seventeen per cent. nitrogen, six to seven per cent. hydrogen, and one to two per cent. sulphur. However, there is a good deal of variety and complication in the way in which the atoms of these five elements are combined in albumin and their molecules are grouped. Hence the question of the chemical nature of the plasma-substances compels us now to look for a moment at the larger group of...", "...general, Luchesi, had attempted to fall with his troopers on the Prussian flank; but, in the act, he was unexpectedly charged by the main body of the Prussian cavalry. Luchesi fell, his cavalry were broken, and the battle was at an end. The rest was the capture of the separate posts of the Austrians, and the pursuit of the right wing, which, though not engaged, had disbanded. This success was unexampled. The Prussians took twenty thousand prisoners, one hundred and sixteen guns, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> pair of colours, and four thousand baggage waggons. The Austrians left seven thousand four hundred men on the field. The victors lost, in killed and wounded, six thousand men. This victory produced a prodigious effect on the public opinion of Europe.

He, however, sent to the brethren and demanded their arms, saying, that it was intended to disarm both parties; <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> guns, one sword and one pistol were delivered up to him, for although the brethren felt to resist the mob to the utmost in the defense of their wives and children, this demand being made under the color of law, it was complied with.

Once shown by a canal, that canal may confidently be looked to at a proper time to disclose it again.

For sixty-five years he has been in the active ministry, under a great variety of callings; for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> years he has held the apostolic calling; since 1867 he has been one of the general authorities of the Church; during seventeen years he has been President of the Church. No other man is so beloved in the Church. To advertise that President Smith will be at a meeting is to warn the people that standing room will be at a premium.

The little of interest told of John Hopkins is that he was a minister and schoolmaster, and that he assisted the work of Sternhold. The full reason for Sternhold's pious work is thus given by an old English author, Wood: \"Being a most zealous reformer and a very strict liver he became so scandalyzed at the loose amorous songs used in the court that he forsooth turned into English metre <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> of Davids Psalms, and caused musical notes to be set to them, thinking thereby that the courtiers would sing them instead of their sonnets; but they did not, only some few excepted.\" The preface printed in the book stated Sternhold's wish and intention that the verses should be sung by Englishmen, not only in church, but \"moreover in private houses for their godly solace and comfort; laying apart all ungodly Songs & Ballads which tend only to the nourishment of vice &...", "...religious nature. He also was a music-lover, and encouraged the art as much as his short life and troubled reign permitted. Hopkins also wrote a preface for his share of the work, in which he spoke with much modesty of himself and much praise of Sternhold.

Other authors had some share in this work: Norton, Whyttyngham (a Puritan divine who married Calvin's sister), Kethe, who wrote the 100th Psalm, \"All people that on earth do dwell,\" which is still seen in some of our hymn-books.

Insurgent Republicans were carrying the party primaries; and the Democrats, who were plainly confident, emphasized strongly the tariff act, Cannonism and the high cost of living as reasons for the removal of the Republicans. The result was a greater upheaval than even the Democrats had prophesied. In nine states the Republicans were ousted from legislatures that would elect United States senators; the new Senate would contain forty-one Democrats and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> Republicans--too narrow a Republican majority in view of the strength of the insurgents. In the choice of members of the lower branch of Congress there was a still greater revolution; the new House would contain 228 Democrats, 161 Republicans and one Socialist, while Cannon would be retired from the speakership. In eastern as well as western states, Democratic governors were elected in surprising numbers. Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and...", "...that body were prepared to go was to support the proposal of a regency. The first resolution of the Commons was then put aside in order that this proposal might be discussed. It was Archbishop Sancroft's plan, who, however, did not make his appearance to advocate it, and in his absence it was supported by Rochester and Nottingham, while Halifax and Danby led the opposition to it. After a day's debate it was lost by the narrow majority of two, forty-nine peers declaring in its favor and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-one</span> against it. The Lords then went into committee on the Commons' resolution, and at once proceeded, as was natural enough, to dispute the clause in its preamble which referred to the original contract between the King and the people.

Marlborough was to collect and join with him on his march the troops of Prussia, Luneburg, and Hesse, quartered on the Rhine, and eleven Dutch battalions that were stationed at Rothweil.
