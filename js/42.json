About the same time, however, government showed that they were not disinclined to all further commercial relaxation; for at their instance the restrictions on the importation of machinery, imposed by an act of King William the Fourth, were taken off. A bill for this purpose was brought in by the president of the board of trade, and, being supported by all parties in the house, passed without difficulty.

They stepped into the large wainscoted entrance-hall, where a great many withered wreaths were suspended. Weidmann pointed out to Eric that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> of these belonged to him, for that was the number of harvests he had worked in here. The single wreath hanging by itself was the fiftieth one of his father-in-law, which had been placed upon his grave.

They entered the sitting-room on the ground-floor. It was spacious and comfortable, with pleasant...", "...and his house was perished, according as Elijah had foretold. And when he had further destroyed all the kindred of Ahab that were found in Jezreel, he went to Samaria; and as he was upon the road, he met the relations of Ahaziah king of Jerusalem, and asked them whither they were going? they replied, that they came to salute Joram, and their own king Ahaziah, for they knew not that he had slain them both. So Jehu gave orders that they should catch these, and kill them, being in number <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> persons. 6. After these, there met him a good and a righteous man, whose name was Jehonadab, and who had been his friend of old. He saluted Jehu, and began to commend him, because he had done every thing according to the will of God, in extirpating the house of Ahab. So Jehu desired him to come up into his chariot, and make his entry with him into Samaria; and told him that he would not spare one wicked man, but would punish the false prophets, and false priests, and those...", "...nations would reap from the establishment of peace. After this, the two chiefs cordially embraced, and congratulated each other on the happy termination of their joint endeavours.

In consequence of this pacification, all prisoners were released on both sides, and the Spaniards had the satisfaction of receiving, among many others, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> of their countrymen who had been in captivity ever since the time of the toqui Paillamachu. Commerce, the inseparable concomitant of a good understanding among neighbouring nations, was established between the Spaniards and Araucanians.

His disastrous expedition for the conquest of the kingdom of Naples forced him to borrow at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> per cent. A short time previous to his death he acknowledged his errors, but continued to spend money, without consideration or restraint, in all kinds of extravagances, but especially in buildings. During his reign the annual expenditure almost invariably doubled the revenue. In 1492 it reached 7,300,000 francs, about 244,000,000 francs of present money. The deficit was made up each year by a general tax, \"which was paid neither by the nobles nor the Church, but was obtained...", "...was in my mouth as honey, sweet; and when I had eaten it, my belly became bitter.

Sixty boroughs of less than 2,000 inhabitants, returning 119 members, were to be disfranchised altogether; forty-seven others, with less than 4,000 inhabitants, were to be deprived of one member, and Weymouth was to lose two out of the four members which it returned in combination with the borough of Melcombe Regis. Fifty-five new seats were allotted to the English counties, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> to the great unrepresented towns, five to Scotland, three to Ireland, and one to Wales. Altogether the numerical strength of the house of commons was to be reduced by sixty-two, and this entirely at the expense of England.

The other was this. The General Election had just been conducted under his auspices, and had returned a House of Commons devoted to himself. Indeed in all England there were only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> contests. In some Continental countries a general election always returns a ministerial majority; there are mysteries connected with the proceeding of which only ministers have the key.

The bill was carried, with some slight modifications; but, upon bringing up the report, Sir William Molesworth moved the re-committal of the bill, and was seconded by Mr. Gladstone.

Mr. Gladstone was actuated by sheer party opposition. Only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> votes were found in favour of the re-committal. Mr. Gladstone then moved an additional clause, giving the Church of England in the colonies the power of synodical action.

The end sought to be attained, namely the nationalization of the basic industries, and even the control of the foreign policy of Great Britain, vindicated the truth of the British Prime Minister's statement that these great strikes involved something more than a mere struggle over the conditions of labour, and that they were essentially seditious attempts against the life of the State.[5] [Footnote 5: I am here speaking of the...", "...b.

[Illustration: HANNAH BREWER. (_Postwoman._)] Hannah Brewer is one of the Bristol Post Office worthies. Her father was the sub-postmaster of the village of Bitton alluded to herein. Hannah commenced to deliver letters in the hamlets and at the farmhouses near Bitton when a mere child, and continued to do so during all the years our gracious Sovereign has sat on the throne.

And, sir, this is my principal means of usefulness or influence over these poor, and, in many instances, injured natives.

Sixteen hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> were freed on this occasion, and sent on board the fleet.

The whole Psalm, with all its verses, is sung on this melody, or _tono_ as they call it, and I wrote down seven of these _toni_, which were employed during the three days. You cannot conceive how tiresome and monotonous the effect is, and how harshly and mechanically they chant through the Psalms. The first _tonus_ which they sang was-- [Music: In-fi-xus sum in li-mo pro-fun-di, et non est sub-stan-tia] Thus the whole <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> verses of the Psalm are sung in precisely the same manner; one half of the verse ending in G, A, G, the other in G, E, G. They sing with the accent of a number of men quarrelling violently, and it sounds as if they were shouting out furiously one against another. The closing words of each Psalm are chanted more slowly and impressively, a long \"triad\" being substituted for the \"melisma,\" sung _piano_. For instance, this is the first:-- [Music: Qui di-li-gunt no-men...", "...in a day, and the great navigator set forth to conquer islands for the dominion of the Christian King, who lived on the isle of Zebu.

As the Bear is not swift of foot, but rather clumsy in its movements, it cannot hope to take the nimbler animals in open chase. It prefers to lie in wait for them in the bushes, and to strike them down with a sudden blow of its paw, a terrible weapon, which it can wield as effectively as the lion uses its claws. An allusion to this habit is made in the Lamentations of Jeremiah (iii. 10), \"He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as...", "...a 63-inch cylinder working with low-pressure steam, condensed only 4-1/2 bushels of coal in equal time, the proportions of surface being as 190 to 240 in Wheal Towan.

To say, however, that the land tax was lenient is not equivalent to saying that it was the most reasonable source for an increased imposition. That it was so, in the opinion of the fair-minded people, remains now to be shown.

They seemed to be in doubt. All of them wondered where Dory could have got the money to pay for the Goldwing, and the charge of Pearl Hawlinshed appeared to explain the whole matter. Certainly the astonishing statement of Pearl made it look very bad for the skipper of the Goldwing. When they asked where he got the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> dollars to pay for the boat, Dory had refused to explain, and had insisted that no more questions should be asked about the subject. Nat had winked at Corny to intimate that this disposition of the matter was not satisfactory; but, as they were expecting a fine sail in the schooner, they had been politic enough to keep silence. Now they looked from one to another, for they did not like to say just what they thought. Dory was silent also. His heart was swelling with...", "...offering safe convoy, enclosing transportation, and asking that Aristotle come and take charge of the education of his son, Alexander, aged thirteen.

Its prodigious type-case of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> thousand characters contains, therefore, only a series of pictures, direct and symbolic, all highly conventionalized, but recognizable in their earlier forms.

There is this to be said in defence of men of letters on the business side, that literature is still an infant industry with us, and, so far from having been protected by our laws, it was exposed for ninety years after the foundation of the republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods. It is true that we now have the international copyright law at last, and we can at least begin to forget our shame; but literary property has only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can. This may be right enough in itself; but I think, then, that all property should be defended by civil suit, and should become public after forty-two years of private tenure.

It was about the year 563 when he left Ireland, and, as he was born in 521, he was then <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of age. Monasticism had already taken a firm hold in Ireland, and the more zealous of the Irish monks were founding monasteries in the islands around the Irish coast, as well as on islands in the larger lakes.

For an expenditure of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> cents for beef as free from waste as milk, we would pay perhaps thirty-two cents per pound. A pound and a quarter of lean beef would yield about 1,000 calories. So as fuel alone the milk would be twice as cheap as the meat. Three quarts of milk would yield almost if not quite as much protein as the meat and a liberal supply of calcium to offset the iron furnished by the meat. Everything considered, then, milk is a better investment than meat. The same is true of some of the...", "...of July we were getting only two or three good reports a day.

There was one very curious iron gun, of a peculiar shape, being very small at the muzzle, and very large from the middle to the breach. It was of Chinese casting, and had an inscription on it, which shewed that it was upwards of three hundred years old. There was also another curious old gun, with the arms of Spain upon it.

The moment that we take this course, light will begin to dawn upon us. But before going further, let us briefly inquire into the sources of our knowledge of Egyptian mythology. The first and most important place is occupied by the monuments, which contain the names and tablets of the gods of the three orders. Then come the sacred books of the Egyptians, known to us by Clemens Alexandrinus. From him we learn that the Egyptians in his time had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> sacred books in five classes. The first class, containing songs or hymns in praise of the gods, were very old, dating perhaps from the time of Menes. The other books treated of morals, astronomy, hieroglyphics, geography, ceremonies, the deities, the education of priests, and medicine. Of these sacred Hermaic books, one is still extant, and perhaps it is as interesting as any of them. We have two copies of it, both on papyrus, one found by the French at Thebes, the other by...", "...by misfortune, Ainslie became a contractor and supervised the erection of many large business structures in Louisville and other cities.

We find that five lots realised L1000 and over each, and including these five lots, forty-two were over L100 each. Now the total for these <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> lots is L20,348, which, if we deduct from the grand total, leaves 1641 lots for L9803, bringing our average down considerably.

By these means Fortuny was enabled to attend the Academy of Barcelona for four years. In 1857, when he was nineteen years of age, he received the _Prix de Rome_, and set out for Rome itself in the same year. But whilst he was copying the pictures of the old masters there a circumstance occurred which set him upon another course.

There were many kinds of ale, as cock ale, college ale, wormwood ale, sage ale, and scurvy-grass ale, some of them medicated, to be taken at certain seasons of the year. There was also wine, but not much. Occasionally they bought a cask--a tierce of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> gallons--and bottled it at home. The kind of wine is not stated. Sometimes they send out to the nearest tavern for a bottle, and it cost a shilling. The accounts seem to set down everything wanted for the conduct of a house; every week, however, there is an unexplained item, called \"cook's bill.\" This, I think, is the separate account of the servants' table. The \"cook's bill\" amounts every week to a good sum, a little above or a little below a pound. Perhaps it contained...", "...progressive feeling of the community. Their policy, on the contrary, has deprived them of the support of many who are dissatisfied with the Government, and has not materially strengthened their hold upon the working classes. Though they carried twenty seats in 1896, they only polled 964 more votes than in 1893, nor have they improved their position in the House, as, even should they be supported by the ten Oppositionists and Independents, they would be confronted by a solid phalanx of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> Ministerialists. It may be of interest to note that their principal successes have been gained among bushmen and miners, but that they also hold the sugar district of Bundaberg, two agricultural constituencies, two seats at Rockhampton, and three in the poorer and outlying parts of Brisbane.

In April, 1630, eleven vessels went out to Massachusetts Bay, with a large company of English reformers; and during the year there crossed over to America not less than a thousand English men and women who had found the arbitrary rule of Charles quite unbearable. John Winthrop, a wealthy Suffolk gentleman <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of age, and one of the strongest and most lovable characters in American history, was the first governor under the new arrangement. Thomas Dudley, the deputy, was a stern and uncompromising Puritan, cold and narrow-minded.

We first took the court-yard, in which we found their cannon, they defending story after story of the building until driven to the third floor, when, seeing the smoke of a fire which had been lighted on the ground-floor to bam them out, they surrendered, and the fight was over. In the night the greater number of the men escaped towards Rome; only 300 in the palace were taken prisoners, besides <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> horses and two pieces of cannon, 500 stand of arms, and all their materials of war. The fight had lasted twenty-four hours--from eight one day to eight the next--without a single instant's cessation of firing. It cost us between 400 and 500 men, amongst whom were some of our bravest and best officers. This was the first real struggle under the General.

A fourth and last distribution was made, and, in the twinkling of an eye, our last resources were consumed. We were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> people who had to feed upon _six biscuits_ and about _four pints_ of water, with no hope of a farther supply. Then came the moment for deciding whether we were to perish among the breakers, which defended the approach to the shores of the Desert, or to die of famine in continuing our route. The majority preferred the last species of misery. We continued our progress along the shore, painfully pulling our oars.

Andy reckoned that the extreme length of the island was about seven miles, its breadth barely a mile less.

From her whole being there emanated such a joyousness, security and tenderness, and so...", "...wavered between art and science, he decided for zoology, and made a masterly study of a little-known group of sea-animalcules, the Radiolaria. In 1861 he began to teach zoology at Jena University. Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" had just been translated into German, and he took up the defence of Darwinism against almost the whole of his colleagues. His first large work on evolution, \"General Morphology,\" was published in 1866. He has since published <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> distinct works. He is not only a master of zoology, but has a good command of botany and embryology. Haeckel's \"Evolution of Man\" (Anthropogenie), is generally accepted as being his most important production. Published in 1874, at a time when the theory of natural evolution had few supporters in Germany, the work was hailed with a storm of controversy, one celebrated critic declaring that it was a blot on the escutcheon of Germany.

From Edinburgh to London, a distance of 400 miles, the time allowed was forty-five and a half hours; in the opposite direction the time was curtailed to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> and a half hours. From London to York, 197 miles, twenty hours were allowed; London to Manchester, 185 miles, nineteen hours; London to Exeter, 176 miles, nineteen hours; London to Holyhead, 259 miles, twenty-seven hours; London to Devonport, 216 miles, twenty-one hours.

The best of the hens weighed nine to nine and a half pounds each, and three of the cocks drew over twelve pounds each! There were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> birds in all, which, together, could not be equalled, probably, at that time, in America or England, for size, beauty and uniformity of color. The sum paid me for this lot of Greys was eight hundred and seventy dollars.

A column discovered in 1909 describes her as \"a woman of the palace of Samsi-rammon, King of the World, King of Assyria, King of the Four Quarters of the World.\" This dedication indicates that Semiramis, or, to give her her Assyrian title, Sammuramat, evidently possessed an immense influence over her husband, Samsi-rammon, and that perhaps as queen-mother that influence lasted for more than one reign, so that the legend that after a regency of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years she delivered up the kingdom to her son, Ninyas, may have some foundation in fact. She seems to have made war against the Medes and Chaldeans. The story that on relinquishing her power she turned into a dove and disappeared may mean that her name, Sammuramat, was easily connected with the Assyrian _summat_, the word for 'dove'; and for a person of her subsequent legendary fame the mythical connexion with Ishtar is easily accounted for. The Second Assyrian Empire...", "...the information that the Egyptian troops were leaving the town, and in consequence, at daylight, 300 Turks and a party of Austrian marines landed, and took unopposed possession of the place.

An entire battalion, which had been formed near the magazine, ready to resist any attempts to storm, was destroyed. The appearance of the dead and wounded, as they lay scattered about the town, was very dreadful, but they seemed to excite but little sympathy in the breasts of the Turks.

Such an accumulation of wealth is just as wise as if a man who had to walk ten miles on a hot day should, of his own choice, carry on his back a large sack of potatoes. A man of superior sense and feeling will not waste his life so, unless he has in view a grand public object. On the contrary, he will rather do as Franklin did, who, having acquired at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> a modest competence, sold out his thriving business on easy terms to a younger man, and devoted the rest of his happy life to the pursuit of knowledge and the service of his country. But we cannot all be Franklins.

This sounds very trivial when contrasted with the large sums now paid by illustrated newspapers. In 1827 another exciting murder was committed, and the _Observer_, undeterred by former censures, published a portrait of the criminal and a view of the scene of his crime, but did not on this occasion deal with the case in the elaborate way in which the murder of Mr. Weare was treated.

Leprosy was of two kinds, perceptible and imperceptible. If the Cagots were suffering from the latter kind, who could tell whether they were free from it or not? That decision must be left to the judgment of others.

They applied themselves so dexterously to the destruction of this commodity, that in the space of three hours they broke up three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> chests, which was the whole number in these vessels, and discharged their contents into the dock. When the tide rose it floated the broken chests and the tea insomuch that the surface of the water was filled therewith a considerable way from the south part of the town to Dorchester Neck, and lodged on the shores. There was the greatest care taken to prevent the tea from being purloined by the populace; one or two being detected in endeavoring...", "...more than a day. Always of an evening came the old friendly rubber, I playing with the Major, and Captain Brentwood with Mrs. Buckley.

I cannot for the life of me remember what year it was in, somewhere between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> and forty-five, I believe, because within a year or two of that time we heard that a large comet had appeared in England, and that Sir Robert Peel was distrusted on the subject of Protection. After all, it is no great consequence, though it is rather provoking, because I never before or since held more than eight trumps.

Owing to the sickness which prevailed among the troops, the command, on reaching the river Washita, about one hundred and eighty miles west of Fort Gibson, was so much reduced as to render a re-organization of the companies necessary. Colonel Dodge accordingly, out of the effective force, formed six companies, each <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> strong, and, under instructions from General Leavenworth, continued his march to the Pawnee village, situated on a branch of the Red river. Here Colonel Dodge held a council with the Camanches, the Pawnees, (or Toyaslas,) the Kiowas, and the deputation of Indians which accompanied him, amounting in all to about two thousand persons. He explained the object of the expedition, and was instrumental in bringing about a friendly intercourse between several hostile tribes. He also...", "...about three-quarters full.

Rogers divided us into three parties, and about an hour before daylight ordered us to attack the village on three sides. The St. Lawrence River was on the fourth side. We rushed into the village, through its lanes, kicking the yelping dogs aside, and stationed ourselves before the huts. Above the doors were poles, from which dangled rows of scalps, as if they were garlands of flowers. I stood by...", "...away,\" he said. \"We hire it especially for fighting.

Then he added proudly, \"I have <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> scars.\" _Muetterchen_ gasped. I endeavored to look properly impressed. \"But what _do_ you find to fight about in these peaceful times?\" I asked, after what I considered to be a reverential pause. \"Oh, anything serves as a pretext,\" he answered, quite frankly. \"The students are always quarrelling over something or other.

Still further reason for accepting the larger number as accurate is given by the record we have of Gloucester's retinue at Agincourt. Here he was at the head of a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> lances and four hundred and six archers,[75] and this alone would refute the estimate of a hundred and twenty-nine lances and six hundred archers. Moreover, it is recorded that at Harfleur he lost two hundred and thirty-six men,[76] though some of these were _valets_ and _garASec.ons_ who did not rank as combatants, but were the grooms of the men-at-arms and the attendants of the baggage horses.

Even in the \"old\" immigration, which is largely accepted as the type of permanent immigration, for every hundred admitted, there were thirteen emigrants, about one and a half times as many relatively as among the Jews. The Jewish immigration must thus be accorded the place of distinction in American immigration for permanence of settlement.

This is exactly in Steele's style; but we find erelong in the \"Tatler\" a spiritual quality that was not a part of Steele's nature. From current gossip and easy society commonplace, the tone is exalted, and this we know was the result of Addison's influence. Out of two hundred seventy-one articles in the \"Tatler,\" one hundred eighty-eight were produced by Steele and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> by Addison. Yet Steele was wise enough to perceive the superior quality of Addison's work, and this dictated the key in which the magazine was pitched. Yet the fertility of Steele surpassed that of Addison.

It is impossible to explain, the fact that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> gods only are addressed, and equally so to say why this number was adopted. Some have believed that the forty-two gods represented each a name of Egypt, and much support is given to this view by the fact that most of the lists of names make the number to be forty-two; but then, again, the lists do not agree.

When admitted to the Kreuzschule of Dresden, the young student, however, distinguished himself by his very great talent for literary composition and the classical languages.

In one of the soldiers Thompson recognized a man who, before the war, had been a waiter in the St. Regis Hotel in New York and who had been detailed to act as his guide and interpreter during the fighting before Termonde. This man took Thompson into a wine-shop where a detachment of soldiers was quartered, gave him food, and spread straw upon the floor for him to sleep on. Shortly after midnight a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> centimetre shell struck the building. Of the soldiers who were sleeping in the same room as Thompson nine were killed and fifteen more who were sleeping upstairs, the ex-waiter among them. Thompson told me that when the ceiling gave way and the mangled corpses came tumbling down upon him, he ran up the street with his hands above his head, screaming like a madman. He met an officer whom he knew and they ran down the street together, hoping to get out of the doomed town. Just...", "...the strongly melancholic, emotional, and choleric temperament of his race.

And love? To define the sort of sentiment Lane at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> had for his wife, modified by his activities, by his lack of children, by her evident lack of passion for him, would not be an easy matter.

The most hazardous period in the process of breeding the worms, is at the third and fourth moulting; for upon the 6th day of the third age, and the seventh day of the fourth, they in general eat nothing at all.

From this date their appetite continually decreases, till on the tenth day of this age they consume only fifty-six pounds.

It was a favorite anchorage for both French and English fleets in their preparations, as the tide of battle turned, for attacking New England or Acadia in the long struggle for supremacy. In 1696 the French assembled in Spanish Bay for a foray upon Pemaquid. In 1711 Admiral Hovenden Walker, returning from his unsuccessful expedition against Quebec, his ships having been dispersed by a storm, collected in this capacious roadstead the most formidable fleet it had seen, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> vessels. The doughty British Admiral felt so good about it that he set up on shore a large signboard made by his carpenters, whereon was inscribed a pompous proclamation claiming possession of the whole country in honor of his sovereign Queen Anne.

The almost exclusive sources of intelligence on these questions are the correspondence of the period, a portion of which is printed in the volumes of 1813 devoted to Aubrey's Collections, and another in Nichols's _Anecdotes_.

In a letter of 1731 to Hearne, his Lordship mentions his impression that he had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> Caxtons at that date. He seems to have possessed seventy-three examples of Wynkyn de Worde.[8] With respect to some of the college libraries at Oxford, Cambridge, and even Dublin, it is easier to arrive at the facts, so far as they go, or, in other words, many of the rare and important acquisitions of those institutions came to them at a period anterior to what may be termed the bibliographical era, and were often contemporary gifts from the authors of the volumes or from...", "...and peasant alike must stand before the judgment-seat of Osiris and his forty-two assessors.

Any person could bring accusations against the deceased, false charges being guarded against by the most dreadful penalties.

We calculated, from the experience we had had, that we ought to be able to reach this point again with twelve dogs left. We now had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> dogs. Our plan was to take all the forty-two up to the plateau; there twenty-four of them were to be slaughtered, and the journey continued with three sledges and eighteen dogs. Of these last eighteen, it would be necessary, in our opinion, to slaughter six in order to bring the other twelve back to this point. As the number of dogs grew less, the sledges would become lighter and lighter, and when the time came for reducing their number to twelve, we should only have two...", "...were three or four sickly trees, but no grass, in this enclosure, which had been worn smooth and hard by the tread of multitudinous feet.

The titles of only twenty-five are inserted in the \"Biographia Dramatica.\" The proof of his connection with the historical play now reprinted has been already supplied,[249] and it is derived from the same source as nearly all the rest of the intelligence regarding his works--the MSS. of Henslowe. Of the incidents of the life of Henry Chettle absolutely nothing is known: we are ignorant of the times and places of his...", "...vanloads. Very good....

But the unmarried nephew, having the first admitted right to the girl, must be paid eight annas, or two fanams, before he will allow her to be taken away. The argument is said to be as follows. A sister pays <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> fanams as kanam for her brother's wife. When the product, i.e., a daughter, is transferred to a stranger, the son claims compensation on his mother's investment at the same rate as that at which a cocoanut tree is valued--eight annas.

Critics say, however, that whatever he touched he adorned; that his vigorous simplicity, pungent wit, startling invective, and felicity of expression make him one of the great poets of the Latin language. In didactic poetry Lucretius was pre-eminent, and is regarded by Schlegel as the first of Roman poets in native genius. He was born 95 B.C., and died at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> by his own hand. His principal poem \"De Rerum Natura\" is a delineation of the Epicurean philosophy, and treats of all the great subjects of thought with which his age was conversant. Somewhat resembling Pope's \"Essay on Man\" in style and subject, it is immeasurably superior in poetical genius. It is a lengthened disquisition, in seven thousand four hundred lines, upon the great phenomena of the outward world. As a painter and worshipper of Nature, Lucretius was superior to...", "...upon the history of the King. The King, who had just paid the heavy gaming and tradesmen's debts of Madame la Duchesse, paid also those of Monseigneur, which amounted to fifty thousand francs, undertook the payment of the buildings at Meudon, and, in lieu of fifteen hundred pistoles a month which he had allowed Monseigneur, gave him fifty thousand crowns.

The King gave also, but in secret, twenty thousand francs a-year to M. de Chartres, who had spent so much in journeys and building that he feared he should be unable to pay his debts. He had asked for an abbey; but as he had already one, the King did not like to give him another, lest it should be thought too much. M. de Vendome began at...", "...in the interim may be imagined. In 1624, in pity to all parties, some attempt at practical Division of the Territory was again made: Neuburg to have Berg and Julich, Brandenburg to have Cleve, Mark, Ravensburg and the minor appurtenances: and Treaty to that effect was got signed (11th May, 1624). But it was not well kept, nor could be; and the statistic cipher of new treaties, manifestoes, conferences, and approximate written area of Law-Paper goes on increasing. It was not till <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years after, in 1666, as will be more minutely noticeable by and by, that an effective partition could be practically brought about. Nor in this state was the Lawsuit by any means ended,--as we shall wearisomely see, in times long following that. In fact there never was, in the German Chanceries or out of them, such a Lawsuit, Armed or Wigged, as this of the Cleve Duchies first and last.

As these are very Radical, the majority of women, contrary to the expectations of many, had failed to display Conservative predilections. It would seem, indeed, if we take also {190} into consideration the result of two General Elections in New Zealand, that their so-called Conservatism takes the form, not of an aversion from advanced legislation, but of a disinclination to bring about a change of Ministry.

Robson Park has recently been set apart by the Government of British Columbia. Its boundaries extended to the height of land where they run with those of Jasper Park. One of the admirable features of the administration of the Canadian National Parks is the leasing of lots on nominal terms, so that those who prefer home to hotel life may build their own cottages. At Banff you can obtain a lot for from $8.00 to $15.00 a year, according to position and area. The leases run for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years, with the privilege of renewal for an equal period. The same privilege may be obtained in Jasper Park. One of the principal activities of the Park administration is of course the building of roads and trails to the various points of interest, mountains, lakes, waterfalls, and so forth. The Canadian parks are still in their infancy from an administrative point of view, and an immense amount of work remains to be done before their innumerable points of beauty and...", "...Custom had rendered his feelings callous, and Chibisa had to be told that his child would never return.

The Dedham Company, in the same state, also divided ten per cent for six months of the same year; the Norfolk Company, twelve per cent for the same period; and the Northern Company ten.

Napoleon at length showed his true colors, forbade his victim to maintain more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> thousand troops, and declared to the face of Frederick William's brother in Paris that the occupation of the fortresses had passed from the narrow domain of particular politics into the great field of general policy.

No modern biography of him exists; but there is a study of his philosophy in Bouillier, _Histoire de la philosophie cartesienne_ (Paris, 1868); and his mathematical achievements are discussed by Dr Bopp in the 14th volume of the _Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der mathematischen Wissenschaften_ (Leipzig, 1902).

The hardy Joliet lost no time, however, but pressed on, too eager to report his grand discoveries to Frontenac. As mentioned in Frontenac's dispatch, the misfortunes of Joliet began when his long and perilous voyage was practically ended. In the rapids of La Chine, near Montreal, his canoe overset; three of his party were drowned, all his papers lost, and he himself narrowly escaped. In a letter to Frontenac he says: \"I had escaped every peril from the Indians; I had passed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> rapids, and was on the point of disembarking, full of joy at the success of so long and difficult an enterprise, when my canoe capsized after all danger seemed past.

But, waiving all such claims to antiquity, it is at least certain that since the close of the Newer Pliocene period, Madeira, and Porto Santo have constituted two separate islands, each in sight of the other, and each inhabited by an assemblage of land shells (Helix, Pupa, Clausilia, etc.), for the most part different or proper to each island. About thirty-two fossil species have been obtained in Madeira, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> in Porto Santo, only five of the whole being common to both islands. In each the living land-shells are equally distinct, and correspond, for the most part, with the species found fossil in each island respectively.

Many which were amongst the most common in the Pliocene period, have...", "...newspaper declining, he magnanimously refused to retaliate, and allowed his riders to carry the rival journal. How much money Franklin actually made in his business is difficult to determine, although many guesses have been made.

He made enough to retire at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of age, having been working for himself only twenty years. On retiring he turned over his printing and publishing interest to his foreman, David Hall, who was to carry on the business in his own way, but under the firm name of Franklin & Hall, and to pay Franklin a thousand pounds a year for eighteen years, at the end of which time Hall was to become sole proprietor. This thousand pounds which Franklin was to receive may be looked upon as an indication that before...", "...extended from Blindheim to the neighbourhood of Oberglauheim.

This force was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> battalions and eighty-three squadrons strong. The cavalry in this second army, the left of the whole force, had been less severely tried by disease, rapid marching, and ill provisionment than that of Tallard.

He calculates[197] that the 2,300 days were completed at the Bab's manifestation in 1844. In Daniel xii. 6 the _lunar_[198] year is resorted to, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> months (1,260 years) are dated from the hegira of Mohammed, but Daniel xii. 11 does not come exactly right, so the _terminus a quo_ is made to be the proclamation of the prophethood of Mohammed, three years after his mission, which was ten years before the hegira. By this means the date of Baha's manifestation (1863) is reached.

Holmes reported his loss at 1,636, of which 173 were killed; but as Prentiss buried 400, Holmes evidently understated his losses. The Union loss was 57 killed, 127 wounded, and between 30 and 40 missing. This was the last effort on the part of the Confederacy to raise the siege of Vicksburg. On the third, as soon as negotiations were commenced, I notified Sherman and directed him to be ready to take the offensive against Johnston, drive him out of the...", "...fairy of the brook stole them from Joe's breeches pocket, and keep mine still he say because it be the prettiest.

Lanfranc Septala of Milan was made general of the order and provincial rulers were appointed for Italy, Spain, France, and Germany. Under Alexander IV. in 1256 they assumed the rights and duties of a mendicant order and in 1287 they were taken under the particular protection of the Pope. They soon spread rapidly over western Europe and by the fifteenth century covered <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> provinces, had two thousand monasteries, and thirty thousand monks. It was this order which young Martin Luther entered in 1505 at Erfurt. No better summary of the general results of the begging orders has ever been made than that of Lea when he says: The Mendicants came upon Christendom like a revelation--men who had abandoned all that was enticing in life to imitate the Apostles, to convert the sinner and unbeliever, to arouse the slumbering sense...", "...of the settlers were carried above the Falls. Then the party resumed their journey along the north shore of Lake Erie in bateaux, and arrived at their destination in September. Baldoon Farm was an ill-chosen site for a colony. The land, prairie-like in its appearance, lay in what is now known as the St Clair Flats in Kent county, Ontario. It proved to be too wet for successful farming. It was with difficulty, too, that the settlers became inured to the climate. Within a year <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> are reported to have died, chiefly of fever and dysentery. The colony, however, enjoyed a measure of prosperity until the War of 1812 broke out, when the Americans under General M'Arthur, moving from Detroit, despoiled it of stores, cattle, and sheep, and almost obliterated it. In 1818 Lord Selkirk {20} sold the land to John M'Nab, a trader of the Hudson's Bay Company. Many descendants of the original settlers are, however, still living in the neighbourhood....", "...in the St. Charles Hotel, and, taking off my hat, looked at the crossed sabres on its front.

But it was not guess-work, for the record states clearly that the girth of the larger tree lacked two inches of being the complete forty-five feet.

At _Tilsit_, on the North-Prussian frontier, peace was concluded (July 7 and 9, 1807). Prussia fared the hardest. She lost half of her territory.

Now if to the five hundred and fifty thousand free white population in the United States over the age of twenty years who are unable to read and write, as shown by the census, we add forty per cent. for its under-estimates, as facts require us to do in the case of Virginia, it would increase the total to seven hundred and seventy...", "...of the \"slavery restriction\" branch of the Compromise. To show the generosity of the Northern members toward the Southern side: on a test vote to exclude slavery from Missouri, ninety voted not to exclude, and eighty-seven to exclude, every vote from the slave States being ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free States, of whom seven were from New England alone; while on a vote to exclude slavery from what is now Kansas, the vote was one hundred and thirty-four for, to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> against. The scheme, as a whole, was, of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to contend otherwise, as is now being done by the Nebraskites; it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men.

The English, from their strong desire of having a port in the China seas, hastily pitched upon the most unhealthy spots for that purpose, viz. Balambangan and Pulo Condore. The father of the present Sultan of Pontiana was the descendant of an Arab, residing at Simpan, near Matan. By the advice and concurrence of the Dutch he was induced, about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years ago, to settle on the unfrequented shores of the river Pontiana, or Quallo Londa, with promises of early cooeperation and assistance, as well as of rendering it the mart of the trade and capital of all Sukadana.

So that the consumption of those nations pays much greater sums to the rents of our lands and the labour of our people than ours does to theirs. But we keep out as much as possible the goods and merchandises of France, because our consumption of theirs would very much hinder the consumption of our own, and abate a great part of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> millions which it now pays to the rents of our lands and the labour of our people.\"[9] Thus our policy was to confine our import trade to foreign luxuries and raw materials of manufacture which could not be here produced, drawn exclusively from countries where such trade would not turn the balance against us, and, on the other hand, to force our export trade on any country that would receive it.

A dramatic meeting under romantic circumstances between two people of the Anglo-Saxon race always appears to fall a little flat; words are difficult to find. When she went in, to find him looking thin and weak, pale under his sunburn, changed and worn, she was deeply thrilled and touched. It brought close to her the simple, heroic manner in which so many men are calmly risking their lives, taking it as a matter of course, and as she knew for a fact that he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> and had gone into the New Army at the very beginning of the war, she was aware he must have strained a point in order to join.

Another part of the delay was due to the fact that Spider took some time in elaborating a plan to put both Rollie and himself in possession of abundant funds.

Water soon issued from the seam at the rate of twenty-three gallons per minute. On the 29th, the water had risen at the foot of the shaft to two and a half feet above grade, and the work was stopped. The usual speed of the engine working the pump was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> revolutions per minute; it was increased to fifty-six, and at that rate it succeeded in preventing any further rise of the water.

Indeed \"Falstaff,\" which followed \"Otello,\" is considered one of the greatest achievements in the history of opera. Yet it is rarely given, and even \"Otello\" has already reached the \"revival\" stage, while \"Aida,\" \"Rigoletto,\" \"La Traviata,\" and \"Il Trovatore\" are fixtures, although \"Rigoletto\" was composed thirty-six years before \"Otello\" and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> before \"Falstaff.\" Can it be that critics (including myself) and professional musicians have been admiring the finished workmanship of Verdi's last two scores, while the public has discovered in them a halting inspiration, a too frequent substitution of miraculous skill for the old-time _flair_, and a lack of that careless but attractive occasional _laissez faire aller_ of genius, which no technical perfection can replace? Time alone can answer.

The amount given daily was from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> grains. It seemed to rather increase the discomfort in the head, and in some cases it aggravated the irritability of the stomach. The pyrexia was certainly not controlled by it.

We calculated, from the experience we had had, that we ought to be able to reach this point again with twelve dogs left. We now had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> dogs. Our plan was to take all the forty-two up to the plateau; there twenty-four of them were to be slaughtered, and the journey continued with three sledges and eighteen dogs. Of these last eighteen, it would be necessary, in our opinion, to slaughter six in order to bring the other twelve back to this point. As the number of dogs grew less, the sledges would become lighter and lighter, and when the time came for reducing their number to twelve, we should only have two...", "...over 15,000 of the 700,000 population are white.

The book of Kings had stated that Jehu slew <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> brethren of Ahaziah. It is, of course, perfectly allowable to take \"brethren\" in the general sense of \"kinsmen\"; but as the chronicler had recently mentioned the massacre of all Ahaziah's brethren, he avoids even the appearance of a contradiction by substituting \"sons of the brethren of Ahaziah\" for brethren.

It was pitch dark on deck, but I went below to look at my birds, and by the dim light of the lantern, and the flash of lightning that every now and again lit up the whole of the ship, I saw that the poor creatures were swaying to and fro, and that they were in the greatest possible discomfort. That night more than thirty of them broke their legs, and the next day...", "..._Report of the Case of Miss H.

CHAPTER VIII. THE HOME LIFE. At <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years old, Harriet Martineau found herself free for the first time to form and take possession of a _home of her own_. Now, for the first time, she could have the luxury which many girls obtain by marriage so young that they spoil it to themselves and others, and which it is as natural for each grown woman to desire, irrespective of marriage, as it is for a fledged bird to leave the old nest--a house and a domestic circle in which she could be the organizing spirit, where the...", "...to divulge a sacred secret, which Charles kept sealed in his breast, and which she was determined to utter to no one, and least of all to his enemies. 'I have already said,' she told her judges, 'that you will have nothing from me about that. Go and ask the King!' Then followed questions as to the fashion of the crown that the King had worn at Rheims: which brought the fifth day of the trial to a close. The sixth and last day's public examination took place on the 3rd of March, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> judges present. The long series of questions were nearly all relating to the appearance of the saints. Both questions and answers were nearly the same as on the previous occasions, and little more information was got from the prisoner. After these, the subject of her dress--what she then wore, and what she had worn--was entered upon. 'When you came to the King,' she was asked, 'did he not inquire if your change in dress was owing to a revelation or not?' 'I have...", "...and motionless, there was one thought in his mind and only one, whether we would make up the lost nine minutes and get into Albany on time. Al's thoughts were the same, and, like one of Dante's demons, he worked at the coal and the fire and the water, now oiling the drivers, now looking at the gauges, ever busy and ever growing blacker and oilier in hands and face. Very proud we were as we ran into Albany at 11.15 A.M. on time to the minute, having made the run of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles in one hundred and fifty-six minutes, an average of 53.8 miles an hour. This exceeds the average of the Chicago flyer, which is 48.2 miles an hour, although for a much greater distance. Several times our speed had reached seventy miles an hour, and with better coal and other conditions equally favorable, Buchanan has driven 870 up to the eighty-mile point. With the sound devils still dancing in my head, I watched the engineer as he rubbed down his iron horse after the...", "...you get that?\" he asked in quite a feirce voice. I told him, but not quite all. It was the first time I had concealed an AMOUR from my parents, having indeed had but few, and I felt wicked and clandestine. But, alas, it is the way of the heart to conceal its deepest feelings, save for blushes, which are beyond bodily control. My father, however, mearly sighed and observed: \"So it has come at last!\" \"What has come at last?\" I asked, but feeling that he meant Love. For although <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> and not what he once was, he still remembers his Youth. But he refused to anser, and inquired politely if I felt to much grown-up, with the Allowence and so on, to be held on knees and occasionaly tickeled, as in other days. Which I did not.

AREA, 324 SQUARE MILES I Mount Rainier, the loftiest volcano within the boundaries of the United States, one of our greatest mountains, and certainly our most imposing mountain, rises from western central Washington to an altitude of 14,408 feet above mean tide in Puget Sound. It is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles in direct line from the centre of Tacoma, and fifty-seven miles from Seattle, from both of which its glistening peak is often a prominent spectacle. With favoring atmospheric conditions it can be seen a hundred and fifty miles away. North and south of Rainier, the Cascade Mountains bear other snow-capped volcanic peaks. Baker rises 10,703 feet; Adams, 12,307 feet; St. Helens, 9,697 feet; Hood, 11,225 feet, and Shasta, 14,162 feet. But Rainier surpasses them all in...", "...he often preached and taught; and it was here, or in the neighbourhood of the city, that the god [.S]akra (Indra) once appeared to Buddha, bringing a musician from heaven to entertain him, and afterwards testing his knowledge by forty-two questions. These the god traced with his finger on the rock, and the impression of them, according to Fa-hien, was to be seen there in his time, and a monastery was built on the spot. With reference to this legend we may note that the answers to the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> questions are supposed to be contained in a celebrated Tibetan work called the 'Forty-two points on which the Buddha gave instruction[204]', the importance of which is proved by its being translated into several languages. It was in this neighbourhood, too, that Buddha's two chief disciples--[.S]ariputra and Maudgalyayana (Pali, Moggallana, p. 47)--had their noted meeting with A[.s]vajit (Pali, Assaji), already mentioned (p. 104). Here, also, a Jaina ascetic made a pit of...", "...The machine gun in use was of the same caliber and took the same ammunition as the infantry rifle. It was composed of few parts, and was a simple and highly effective instrument. On these first days of August, 1914, the cavalry of Austria--the hussars, uhlans, and dragoons, but really all of one type--light cavalry--was equipped uniformly with saber and carbine. The noncommissioned officers and others who did not carry a carbine rode forth equipped with an automatic pistol. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> cavalry regiments in the entire Austrian army, consisting of six squadrons, each of which had a fighting strength of 150 sabers, not counting the pioneer troops. Every cavalry regiment had four machine guns with 40,000 rounds of ammunition. The pioneer troops of the cavalry, which first were introduced in Austria, were composed of an officer and twenty-five men, equipped with tools and explosives needed by an advance force to clear obstacles, destroy railways, etc. Besides...", "...of value; Richard Oakey, for robbing of Mr. Betts, in Fig Lane; John Shepherd and Joseph Blake, for breaking the house of Mr. Kneebone; with many others, some of which, such as John Malony and Val Carrick, were of an older date.

The next summer the Peloponnesians sent off the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> ships for Mitylene, under Alcidas, their high admiral, and themselves and their allies invaded Attica, their object being to distract the Athenians by a double movement, and thus to make it less easy for them to act against the fleet sailing to Mitylene. The commander in this invasion was Cleomenes, in the place of King Pausanias, son of Pleistoanax, his nephew, who was still a minor.

Finally the Dantas ministry faced it squarely. A bill was introduced prohibiting the sale of slaves, establishing an emancipation fund, and freeing slaves as fast as they reached the age of sixty. A terrific parliamentary battle followed and the project was defeated by only seven votes--forty-eight Liberals and four Conservatives voting for it, and seventeen Liberals and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> Conservatives against. The Emperor dissolved the Chamber and the excitement over abolition became national. The abolitionists subsidised newspapers, held public meetings, and marched through the streets in procession carrying pictures representing the torturing of slaves. No means were spared which might aid to rouse the national conscience. The negroes were advised to revolt, and assistance was openly promised to them. The elections of 1884 were violently contested, instead...", "...be placed under the ban of the church, and neither king nor queen was to be exempt; if a Jew, then the whole of his fortune, personal and real, was to be confiscated by the bishop of the diocese, and applied to the purposes of the church.

At about the same time, or perhaps earlier, Eugenius issued a bull of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> articles against the Italian Jewish communities, in which, among other things, he ordered that, under pain of confiscation of property, Jews should not read Talmudic literature. The papal bull for Castile was proclaimed in many of the towns, as it would appear, without the consent of the king, Juan II. The fanatics had won the day; all their wishes were fulfilled.

Very considerable losses had been inflicted on the enemy, and the prisoners captured amounted to over 2,000, bringing the total since July 1, 1916, to over 10,000.

This request was at once granted: they were sent to Valabregues, where they found <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> of their old comrades, amongst whom were Duplan and Cavalier's young brother, who had been ordered there a few days before. As they arrived they were given quarters in the barracks, and received good pay--the chiefs forty sous a day, and the privates ten.

The former had thirteen divisions including two detached brigades, and the latter had eight divisions. Gen. Bragg's loss in killed and wounded was between 2500 and 3000 men. He lost by capture 6142 men, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> guns, sixty-nine gun carriages, and 7000 stand of small arms. His loss in material was immense, part of which he destroyed in his flight, but a large portion which was uninjured fell to the Union army. The aggregate losses of the armies of the Cumberland and Tennessee were 753 killed, 4722 wounded, and 349 missing, making a total of 5824. These losses were small compared with those of other battles of similar proportions, and very small in view of the fact that the enemy...", "...probe into the wound; putting a finger on each side of the ball, he pressed them together, causing it to fly out. \"It is a lucky thing, captain,\" said Bangs, \"that your collar bone can bear something, as well as my neck, but this bruise on your breast is of more consequence; you must go to bed, and take care of yourself.\" But there was no bed on which I could lie down. The cabin was filled with the wounded, and the surgeon had plenty of work before him, for out of our little crew of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> men, nine were killed and eleven wounded. Accordingly I had a tent erected on deck, in which I and my friends determined to take up our quarters for the night. It was now eight o'clock.

The discussion of the Northern boundary was, in the light of subsequent events, more significant. As proposed by the Committee the line was perhaps a little vague and indefinite since the exact location of certain rivers named was not positively known. Some thought that the boundary proposed would make the State too large. Others thought that it would make the State too small. Mr. Hall proposed the parallel of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> and one-half degrees of North latitude. Mr. Peck suggested the parallel of forty-four. Mr. Langworthy, of Dubuque, asked that forty-five degrees be made the Northern limit. Mr. Langworthy's proposition met with considerable favor among the people living in the Northern part of the Territory who desired to increase the size of the State by including a considerable tract North of the St. Peters.

In mere equity we must admit--not that the British nation had fallen behind its duties, (though naturally it might have done so under the religious torpor prevalent at the original era of manufacturing extension,) but that the duties had outstripped all human power of overtaking them. The efforts, however, have been prodigious in this direction for many years.

In other words _I was in his power_, so far as my means were concerned, and my services were too valuable to be surrendered by him voluntarily.

Nevertheless, this confederacy, he says, became the most powerful and the most united of all the Indian nations. He omits to add, that it was the facility with which this council could be wielded by the French and English in turn, that hastened the grinding of the Six Nations to pieces between those two millstones.

The mass of matter, therefore, carried down annually would, according to this estimate, more than equal in weight and bulk <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> of the great pyramids of Egypt, and that borne down in the four months of the rains would equal forty pyramids. But if, without any conjecture as to what may have been the specific gravity of the mud, we attend merely to the weight of solid matter actually proved by Mr. Everest to have been contained in the water, we find that the number of tons weight which passed down in the 122 days of the rainy season was 339,413,760, which would give the weight of fifty-six pyramids and...", "...had never even seen. The first workmen's compensation act in the United States was passed in Maryland in 1902. Its scope was narrow and it came to nothing as it was declared unconstitutional. In course of time, however, legislation was framed in such language as to pass muster before the courts, and moreover judicial decisions changed, as time went on, in the direction desired by popular opinion. Beginning in 1911 there was an avalanche of liability and compensation laws and by 1920 <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> states, together with Porto Rico, Alaska and Hawaii had passed acts that placed the burden more or less completely on the employer, and provided schemes of compensation. The federal government also took action.

In their famous mobilisation test of 1887 the French despatched from the Toulouse station 150 military trains without interrupting the ordinary traffic, and without any accident.

It is because he represents the entire literary development of the Restoration--it is because he fills up the whole interval between 1658 and 1701, thus connecting the age of Puritanism and Milton with the age of the Queen Anne wits--that we give him such a place in such a list.

Major Baring had held it with his small body of Germans all day long. Twice had he thrust back a general assault, and throughout more than five hours he had resisted partial and equally unsuccessful attacks. Now Ney, ordered to carry it at whatever cost, brought up against it a division, and more than a division. The French climbed upon their heaped dead, broke the doors, shot from the walls, and, at the end of the butchery, Baring with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> men--all that was left him out of nine companies--cut his way back through to the main line, and the farm was taken. Hougomont, on the left, round which so meaningless a struggle had raged all day long, was never wholly cleared of its defenders, but the main body of it was in flames, and with the capture of La Haye Sainte the whole front was free for a final attack at the moment which Napoleon should decide.

Having secured the alliance of the Great Elector, anxious also to aggrandise himself in Polish Prussia, the Swedish king declared war against Poland, and in the early summer of 1656 laid siege to Danzig.

The scheme, as a whole, was, of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to contend otherwise, as is now being done by the Nebraskites; it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men.

Now, out of all these collisions there has come a hardy race, inured to peril, rich in fortitude, loyalty, patience, thrift, self-reliance and persevering faith.

If Julius Caesar were here today he would wear Belgium's bravery like a bright sword, girded to his thigh.

Suppose it, therefore, where perpendicular, to have been thirty-five miles east from London, and by the altitude it appeared at in London--viz., fifty degrees, its tangent will be <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles, for the height of the meteor above the surface of the earth; which also is rather of the least, because the altitude of the place shown me is rather more than less than fifty degrees; and the like may be concluded from the altitude it appeared in at Redgrove, near seventy miles distant.

Ocean picnics to the Mediterranean were made in winter now, and the vessels used for them were fully eight times as big as the old _Quaker City_, which had been a side-wheel steamer, and grand, no doubt, for her period, with a register proudly advertised at eighteen hundred tons!

His book _De Magnete_ was published in 1600.) A few of Kepler's views on gravitation, extracted from the Introduction to his _Astronomia Nova_, may now be mentioned:-- 1. Every body at rest remains at rest if outside the attractive power of other bodies. 2. Gravity is a property of masses mutually attracting in such manner that the earth attracts a stone much more than a stone attracts the earth. 3.

If a volcano were to burst forth in eruption on one of the worlds I have named, we should not see the flames in the Moon till a second and a quarter had elapsed, if in Jupiter not till <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> minutes, in Uranus two hours after, and we should not see it in Neptune till four hours after the eruption. The distances are incomparably more vast outside our planetary system, and the light is still longer in reaching us.

A desperate hand-to-hand fight then ensued. Javelins hissed, war-clubs crashed. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> coloured auxiliaries promptly took to their heels, leaving the four Englishmen to do as they could. Stroyan fell early in the fight. Burton, who had nothing but a sabre, fought like a demon; Speke, on his left near the entrance of the tent, did deadly execution with a pair of revolvers; Herne on his right emptied into the enemy a sixshooter, and then hammered it with the butt end.

Physically speaking we cannot separate.\" The conflict began April 12, 1861, by the enemy firing on Fort Sumter. That sound reverberated throughout the North. The President called for seventy-five thousand men. The choicest from thousands of homes quickly responded. Young men left their college-halls and men their places of business. \"The Union must and shall be preserved,\" was the eager cry. Then came the call for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> thousand men for three years. The President began to study war in earnest. He gathered military books, sought out on maps every creek and hill and valley in the enemy's country, and took scarcely time to eat or sleep.

This preamble makes it clear that there is no copyright in any paintings, drawings, or photographs executed and dealt with before the year 1862--to be exact, 29th July of that year. The duration of the term of copyright in this act of 1862 differs from its predecessors, by being made dependent on the life of the author, to which life seven years were added. In the Literary Copyright Act there are two terms--the life of the author and seven years, or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years, whichever may prove the longer. In taking a fixed term like forty-two years it is necessary to have something to start from, and with a literary work it was easy to start from the date of publication.

But one grand question is, how the semen operates itself, or any part thereof reaches the ovary, and if so, in what way it is conveyed to them. It was long the opinion that the semen was ejected into the uterus in the act of coition, and that it afterward, by some unknown means, found its way into and along the Fallopian tubes to the ovary. But there are several facts which weigh heavily against this opinion,...", "...for success. Encouraged by this assurance and in response to the strong appeal of the leaders among the women of the State, the National Association pledged its support. The suffragists for the most part were now fully convinced that if the amendment was to be carried in 1906 there must be state-wide, systematic organization and in answer to their request the National Board sent to assist them two of its best organizers, Miss Mary N.

During these <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years he found a certain enjoyment in a country home for a little while at a time, but it was chiefly the enjoyment of needed rest from official labor. The price of tobacco and the promise of the wheat crop interested him then, but only as they interested him always as a source of his own income, and as the index to the general prosperity.

Its vineyards, as a matter of fact, repose on a subsoil of iron-stone rocks, which lends a particularly pleasant flavour to the vintages. In addition to the great vineyards that spread themselves over portions of the estate, the cellars of its bodega are well worth a visit. The building is specially constructed for the purpose, and contains air-spaces between the inner and outer walls, thus rendering the interior to all intents and purposes damp-proof. The cellars contain <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> large casks, each with a capacity for holding 3,600 litres, and, beyond these, twelve giant specimens, in each of which eight thousand litres of wine may be stored. The extent of the vineyards on the place is thirty hectares, and from this area an average 250,000 litres of wine are produced annually.

Set was the god of the Asiatic invaders who broke in upon this civilisation; and about a quarter through the long ages of the prehistoric culture (perhaps 7500 B.C.) we find material evidences of {42} considerable changes brought in from the Arabian or Semitic side. It may not be unlikely that this was the first triumph of Set.

To establish a normal form of doctrine, men set to work to compose a Confession, which was completed at that time in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> Articles. There had been a wish that Melanchthon should have come over in person to aid in composing it; at any rate his labours had much influence in deciding the shape it took. The Articles belong to the class of Confessions, as they were then framed in Saxony by Melanchthon, in Swabia by Brenz, to be laid before the coming Council. And it is just in this that their value lies, that by them England attached herself most closely to the Protestant community on the Continent....", "...oranges and cakes, a momentary smile illumined their countenances, a liquid brightness shot from their eyes, only to be replaced by the solemn, almost stolid, expression which has become habitual even on faces so young.

The edifice is, of course, superb and of a new style. On comparing it with other societies in surrounding Europe, and particularly France as she was previous to 1789, the contrast is striking.--Everywhere else the social edifice is a composition of many distinct structures--provinces, cities, seignories, churches, universities, and corporations.

He made several attempts to cross the frozen ocean on a sledge, but was always turned back by ice which would not bear him. He came to the conclusion that there must be an open sea beyond, and he founded this opinion on the immense quantity of warm water which flows into the Arctic Ocean from the great rivers of Asia. In March, 1821, Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral) Anjou crossed the ice to within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles of the north of the island of Kotelnoi, and in N. lat. 76 degrees 38 minutes saw a vapour which led him to believe in the existence of an open sea. In a second trip he actually saw this sea with its drifting ice, and came back convinced of the impossibility of going further in a sledge on account of the thinness of the ice.

In the register of burials at Inverness, the words \"big bells\" are added to the entries of the funerals of \"persons of quality.\" The burials register of the parish of Tough, in Aberdeenshire, record that, in 1784, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> of the parishioners joined in the purchase of a new bell for the church, stipulating that, when deaths occurred in their families, \"the bell be rung once before the day of interment, that is, when the officer gets the first notice of a contributor's death, and then upon the day of interment, from morning until the coffin be laid in the ground, in the manner that bells ought to be rung at funerals, and that by no other person than the officer allenarlie.\" Palls were, from a...", "...between the rivers Pruth and Dniester, and in the valley of Szucsawa; and the mountainous parts are interspersed with rich and extensive pasture-grounds; but on account of the early frosts and the long duration of the winter, the only crops that can be raised there are oats, barley, and potatoes.

A special bat is said to be made of wagon-tongue, but the more commonly favored is of ash, second growth, thoroughly seasoned. These can be bought for from twenty-five cents to one dollar each, according to quality. Lighter bats are made of willow; and the cheapest of basswood. These do not last so well as ash, however. The rules specify that the bat shall not be over two and a half inches in diameter, nor more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> inches in length. In selecting a bat, individual taste is the best guide as to matters of weight and balance, but the grain should be examined carefully.

The water in the foundation-pit at this time measured about two feet in depth, on an area of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> feet in diameter, and yet it was drawn off in the course of about half an hour.

Twice, in his youth, he was smitten to the heart with a feeling of vocation to be a missionary. Both times he was thwarted by the intervention of friends. The second time, he wrote disclosing his half-romantic aspiration in a glowing letter of confidence and friendship to Bossuet, his senior by many years, but not yet become famous. Young Fenelon's friend Bossuet was destined later to prove a bitter antagonist, almost a personal foe. Until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years old, Francois Fenelon lived in comparative retirement, nourishing his genius with study, with contemplation, with choice society. He experimented in writing verse. Not succeeding to his mind, he turned to prose composition, and, leading the way, in a new species of literature, for Rousseau, for Chateaubriand, for Lamartine, and for many others, to follow, went on writing what, in ceasing to be verse, did not cease to be poetry.

They remind him impressively that the oldest things in this city of ages are but as of yesterday in comparison with these imperishable relics of the earliest civilisation. At one time it is said that there were no less than forty-eight obelisks erected in Rome,--six of the largest size and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> of the smaller,--all conveyed at enormous cost and with almost incredible labour from the banks of the Nile to the banks of the Tiber. Upwards of thirty of them have perished without leaving any trace behind. They are doubtless buried deep under the ruins of ancient Rome, but the chance of their disinterment is very problematical. One obelisk, indeed, was exposed a hundred and forty years ago in the square of the principal church of the Jesuits, near the Pantheon; but being...", "...is the making of shingles, which are manufactured from the Weymouth pine. We were assured, that these peasants steal the greater part of the wood for their shingles, in the forests belonging to greater landowners, who live at a distance, and have no keepers to protect their property. One workman can make in a day 300 or 400 shingles, which are sold on the spot for half-a-dollar per 100. They are sent to all the neighbouring country, in large wagons drawn by four horses. At Bethlehem, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles from Pokono, the best shingles were sold, at that time, for eleven dollars per 1,000. These shingles are of two kinds; the German, made by Germans, who first manufactured them in this way, which are considered to be the best, and the English; the former are equally thick at both edges, the latter thicker at one side than the other. Many persons, whose horses are not otherwise employed, come here and fetch shingles. On the 29th of August we continued our journey...", "...rice) to Okhotsk. Moreover, at the stopping place on the Maya, at the mouth of the Yudoma, at the Cross, and on the Urak, we erected magazines and dwellings for the forces, and also built four winter-huts between Yudomskaya Krest and Urak as places of refuge during the winter. Furthermore, in accordance with our plans, we built, in 1736, at the stopping place on the Urak, fifteen, and during this year, 1737, sixty-five vessels on which to float the provisions down the Urak. Of these, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> are still at the place of construction, the remaining thirty-seven having departed with provisions in 1735. All of this has been done under my orders, not by the government officials of Siberia. In Yakutsk, where I was at that time staying, we built two vessels, the boat Irkutsk and the sloop Yakutsk, and in 1735 sent them out on the expeditions assigned to them. We took pains to provision them well, and furthermore sent four barges to the mouth of the Lena with additional...", "...routed troops continued their flight to Fort Jefferson, throwing away their arms on the roadside that they might run faster.

Besides this, twenty-one officers and two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> men were wounded, some of whom soon died of their wounds. This was a most disastrous battle for the whites, the most disastrous they had yet known.

This result, therefore, was deemed extraordinary; but what was that to the extraordinary mischief done to the community by the authorization of excessive gambling! Some curious facts are on record relating to the lotteries. Until the year 1800 the drawing of the lottery (which usually consisted of 60,000 tickets for England alone) occupied forty-two days in succession; it was, therefore, about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> to one against any particular number being drawn the first day; if it remained in the wheel, it was forty-one to one against its being drawn on the second, &;c.; the adventurer, therefore, who could for eight-pence insure the return of a guinea, if a given number came up the first day, would naturally be led, if he failed, to a small increase of the deposit according to the decrease of the chance against him, until his number was drawn, or the person who took the insurance...", "...it looked both business-like and attractive.

Finally these two were linked together, each having fifty loops for that purpose at corresponding places at the edge, which loops were bound together by fifty golden clasps (4-6). Thus, when the nation was about to march, they could easily be divided in the middle and then folded in the seams. This costly fabric was regarded as part of the true tabernacle: why, then, do we find the outer...", "...which had been printed and published previous to performance, it was held in the Court of Chancery that publication as a book before performance does not take away performing rights.

There remain the difficult questions whether when publication precedes performance the statutory protection of the performing right extends beyond the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years from publication and whether copyright and playright should be separately registered. It has been the practice of English dramatists to give a so-called \"copyright performance\" at a minor theatre, in which actors walk and talk through the drama and the public is invited to pay a shilling at the box office--and sometimes given half a crown apiece for the purpose; which performance, though probably not necessary to fulfill any legal requirement, permits registration of...", "...cubits around it. 35:5 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst.

These Acts form a body of legislation by themselves, of which I need refer only to a few salient characteristics. They were all alike in settling the tenant's annuity (in lieu of rent) at 4 per cent, on the purchase money, though the proportions allocated to interest and sinking-fund varied. Under the first two Acts the period for final redemption of his loan by the tenant was forty-nine years, under the third <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years, though this period was extended to seventy years if the tenant availed himself of decadal reductions in the annuity, proportionate to the capital paid off by the sinking-fund. The average price of the holdings sold under these Acts represented seventeen and a half years' purchase, and the tenant's great inducement to buy was that, by the aid of cheap State credit, the annuity he paid, even over so short a period as forty-nine years, represented a reduction of more...", "...points, theology was one thing, and Christianity another; and that many and important changes would have to be made in the creeds and confessions of Christendom, before they could be brought into harmony with the truth as taught by Jesus.

One day, about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years ago, I was travelling homewards from Shields to Blyth on foot, when a man with a cart overtook me, and asked me to get in and ride. I did so. The man and I were soon busy discussing theology. We talked on saving faith, imputed righteousness, predestination, divine foreknowledge, election, reprobation and redemption. We differed on every point, and the man got very warm. He then spake of a covenant made between God the Father and His Son before the creation of the world,...", "...Luke: Forty-three (iii, 23-31).

When Alabama withdrew from the Union in 1861, no bonds were broken. Practically the only bond of Union for most of the people had been in the churches; to the Washington government and to the North they had never become attached. The feelings of the great majority of the people of the state are expressed in the last speech of Senator C. C. Clay of north Alabama in the United States Senate. It had been <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years, he said, since Alabama had entered the Union amidst scenes of excitement and violence caused by the hostility of the North against the institution of slavery in the South (referring to the conflict over Missouri). In the churches, southern Christians were denied communion because of what the North styled the \"leprosy of slavery.\" In violation of Constitution and laws southern people were refused permission to pass through the North with their property.

I was to return to this subject after many years, and when I wrote upon it in 1890, while the Indian expenditure stood at the same sum, the annual expenditure in England had risen to over thirty-eight millions, making the whole fifty-five, and with the rest of the Empire nearly fifty-seven millions sterling.'

The country is more mountainous than the Alleghenies, and some of it barren as the wildest of the Rockies on the borders of the bad lands, and it is volcanic, remarkably so, even more subject to earthquakes than the Philippines. The whole of Japan occupies about as much space as the two Dakotas or the Philippines, and the population is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> millions. With work as careful and extensive as that of the agricultural mountaineers of Japan, the Dakotas would support one hundred million persons.

A week was spent in visiting Southampton, Salisbury, Stonehenge, Wilton, and the Isle of Wight. I then crossed the Channel to Havre, from which I went to Paris. In the spring and summer of 1834 I made my principal visit to England and Scotland. There were other excursions to the Rhine and to Holland, to Switzerland and to Italy, but of these I need say nothing here. I returned in the packet ship Utica, sailing from Havre, and reaching New York after a passage of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> days. A few notes from my recollections will serve to recall the period of my first visit to Europe, and form a natural introduction to the experiences of my second.

Meanwhile rebellion had again broken out in Nubia, where about one- third of the enemy had taken refuge in the river in the forms of crocodiles and hippopotami.

Carne had refused Dolly's offer to get him an invitation, and for many reasons he was not invited. He ought to have been glad of this, because he did not want to be there; but his nature, like a saw's, was full of teeth, and however he was used, he grated.

In the same space of time, the British cruisers had made captures of nine hundred and forty-four vessels, including two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> privateers, many fishing boats and small coasters, the value of which hardly defrayed the expense of condemnation. That such a small proportion of ships should be taken from the enemy is not at all surprising, when we consider the terrible shocks their commerce had previously received, and the great number of their mariners imprisoned in England; but the prodigious number of British vessels taken by their petty coasting privateers, in the face of such mighty armaments,...", "...representative; which appears the more cruel inasmuch as this representative was my father.

The first of these was a Protection of Life and Property Bill brought in in January by Mr. Forster, then Chief Secretary of Ireland. As was to be expected, this was vehemently opposed by the Nationalist members, who retarded it by every means in their power, one famous sitting of the House on this occasion lasting for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> hours, from five o'clock on the Monday afternoon to nine o'clock on the Wednesday following, and then only being brought to an end by the authority of the Speaker.

In fact, one might add that there is nothing which dares insult it by an offer of so obviously unnecessary assistance. Practically all the windows are of the sixteenth century, and they are so fine that it seems unfair to call particular attention to the elaborate set designed by Aldegrevers, a pupil of Albrecht Duerer. These fill the seven tall windows of two lancets each, which light the eastern chapel and are dated 1520.

On the 19th of February, the Indians surprised Lancaster with complete success, falling upon it with a force of several hundred warriors. The town contained fifty-two families, of whom <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> persons were killed or captured. Forty-two persons took shelter in the house of Mary Rowlandson, the wife of the minister of the place. It was set on fire by the Indians. \"Quickly,\" says Mrs. Rowlandson in her narrative, \"it was the dolefullest day that ever mine eyes saw. Now the dreadful hour had come.

Then, as the balloon with its burden rose toward the ceiling, he dropped shot after shot into the little receptacle until the balloon could no longer raise it. Taking the little basket of shot to the drug store, he had the basket and shot carefully weighed. He now knew the exact lifting power of a toy balloon--it was just five ounces. He had seen Gabriel weighed and knew that he tipped the scale at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> pounds. The calculation was easy; sixteen ounces in a pound; sixteen multiplied by forty-two makes six hundred and seventy-two. Gabriel, therefore, weighed 672 ounces: a single toy balloon would lift not quite five ounces; five goes into six hundred and seventy-two, one hundred and thirty-four times; one hundred and thirty-five toy balloons would lift little Gabriel.

There went into the field, for various terms of enlistment, about two million men, and in March last the men in the army exceeded a million: that is to say, nine of every twenty able-bodied men in the free Territories and States took some part in the war; and at one time every fifth of their able-bodied men was in service. In one single month one hundred and sixty-five thousand men were recruited into service. Once, within four weeks, Ohio organized and placed in the field <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> regiments of infantry--nearly thirty-six thousand men; and Ohio was like other States in the east and in the west. The well-mounted cavalry numbered eighty-four thousand; of horses and mules there were bought, from first to last, two-thirds of a million. In the movements of troops science came in aid of patriotism, so that, to choose a single instance out of many, an army twenty-three thousand strong, with its artillery, trains, baggage, and animals, were moved by rail from...", "...are fearful even in your hour of deliverance.

During the preceding thirty-one hours the four companies of the Regiment had marched <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles. Whilst this enterprise was being undertaken the remainder of the battalion, with the transport of the column, had remained at Sondagskraal under Colonel Davies. On the 7th the force marched to Goedehoop, and proceeding without incident on the 8th to Brakfontein, on the 9th to Strypan, reached Springs on the 10th.

Yet these balls actually were used to load the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> pounders taken with the Royal Battery! Moreover, as if to cap the climax, ten other cannon were found buried in the North-East Harbour; and again spare British balls were found to fit exactly!

He once said that he had voted for the principle of the Wilmot Proviso \"about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> times,\" which, if not an accurate mathematical computation, was a vivid expression of his stanch adherence to the doctrine. At the second session Mr. Lincoln voted against a bill to prohibit the slave trade in the District of Columbia, because he did not approve its form; and then introduced another bill, which he himself had drawn.

In 1813 Burckhardt explored Nubia proper, including Mahass and Kemijour. This expedition cost him only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> francs, a very paltry sum in comparison with the price involved in the smallest attempt at an African journey in our own day; but we must not forget that Burckhardt was content to live upon millet-seed, and that his entire _cortege_ consisted of two dromedaries.

The Chinese had raised a rampart of 1,100 yards in length, and this they had armed with ninety guns, while a battery of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> guns protected its flank. Kulangsu was also fortified, and the Chinese had placed in all 500 guns in position. They believed in the impregnability of Amoy, and it was allowed that no inconsiderable skill as well as great expense had been devoted to the strengthening of the place. When the English fleet arrived off the port the Chinese sent a flag of truce to demand what it wanted, and they were informed the surrender of the town. The necessity for this measure would be hard...", "...words, under a hand pointing aloft: \"He has fought the good fight.\" The brave cashier's head-stone has this inscription: \"Be pure, honest, sober, industrious, considerate, and you will never--\" Nobody knows who gave the order to leave it that way, but it was so given.

Every able-bodied man was put to work in strengthening the defences. The governor promptly dispatched <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> well-armed men to Esopus. Large bounties were offered to all who would enlist. Forty-six friendly Indians from Long Island offered their services and were accepted as auxiliaries.

The government was now organized, apparently, to the satisfaction of all parties; but its efficiency would essentially depend on the success of a measure which Washington had pledged himself to institute, and which was yet to be tried; namely, a system of finance adapted to revive the national credit, and place the public debt in a condition to be paid off. At the close of the war the debt amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> millions of dollars; but so little had the country been able to fulfil its engagements, owing to the want of a sovereign legislature having the sole and exclusive power of laying duties upon imports, and thus providing adequate resources, that the debt had swollen, through arrears of interest, to upwards of fifty-four millions.

But it was not till the middle of the eighteenth century that Cornelius van Bruyn (1714) and Carsten Niebuhr (1774-8), the father of the historian, first copied and published the inscriptions in anything like a complete and accurate manner. Niebuhr further pointed out that they comprised three different systems of cuneiform writing, which in the case of every text followed one another in a regular order. The first system of writing was the simplest, as it consisted of only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> different characters, whereas the number of characters in the second and third systems was very large. With Niebuhr's publication the work of decipherment became possible. In 1798, Professor Tychsen, of Rostock, discovered that in the first system an oblique wedge was used to divide the words from one another, and in 1802 the Danish Bishop, Muenter, starting from this basis, showed that the language possessed suffixes, pointed out that certain characters denoted vowels,...", "...but now I can command time enough to make research an object.\" \"I am very glad that you are able to make so favorable arrangements,\" Mrs. Franklin replied. \"You have had altogether too much on your hands for ten years and more.

But from the time he was released from the care of the printing office, his advancement in science was rapid.

That was enough to make the stoutest heart quail, for a meaning must be found for every one of these signs. There could not be so many syllables, and it was, therefore, quite plain that the Babylonian language must have been written in part at least in ideograms. But in 1851 Rawlinson published one hundred and twelve lines of the Babylonian column from Behistun, accompanied by an interlinear transcription into Roman characters, and a...", "...showing great distress. \"No,\" said Popinot, bewildered; \"let us rather talk of the end of all your troubles.\" Anselme turned on his heel towards the window, and drummed with his fingers on the panes as he gazed into the court. \"Well,\" he said to himself, \"even if she did love du Tillet, is that any reason why I should not behave like an honorable man?\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" said the poor woman. \"The total of the net profits of Cephalic Oil mount up to two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> thousand francs; half of that is one hundred and twenty-one thousand,\" said Popinot, brusquely. \"If I withdraw from that amount the forty-eight thousand francs which I paid to Monsieur Birotteau, there remains seventy-three thousand, which, joined to these sixty thousand paid for the relinquishment of the lease, gives _you_ one hundred and thirty-three thousand francs.\" Madame Cesar listened with fluctuations of joy which made her tremble so violently that Popinot could...", "...SEPTIFORM, sep'ti-form, _adj._ sevenfold, having seven parts: like a septum, septal.

Sir Walter Raleigh was also given <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> thousand acres near Spenser. Ireland was then in a state of continuous turmoil. In such a country Spenser lived and wrote his _Faerie Queene_. Of course, this environment powerfully affected the character of that poem.

Thus were seven thousand horsemen swept away and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> hundred infantrymen slaughtered without a struggle, all demoralized simply by a vigorous demonstration. The order to await the charge, given by Pompey to his infantry, was judged too severely by Caesar.

You will see, therefore, that it was rather a _late_ than an _early_ love.

In the Special Mail, the post-office vehicles are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> feet in length, and one of thirty-two feet. There is a gangway communication between all the carriages, so that the officers on duty can pass from one to another throughout the entire length without going outside.

This latter mare, in 1859, trotted a mile in 2 m. 19(3/4) s., a feat which the best horsemen thought would never be repeated, but since that time <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> trotters have beaten 2 m. 20 s. Dexter's record was 2 m. 17(1/4) s. in 1867, and Goldsmith Maid's in 1871 was 2 m. 17 s., which she reduced, by successive efforts, to 2 m. 16(3/4) s., 2 m. 16 s., 2 m. 15 s., 2 m. 14(3/4) s., and finally, in 1874, to 2 m. 14 s.

As one example of what is done, a case came to light some years ago in which a depositor at Dharwar was authorized to operate on eighty-three accounts with a balance of nearly Rs.30,000. He was a broker by profession and it was quite possible for him to control a balance of Rs.2,00,000 in the Post Office, if he wished to do so. Further inquiries made at the time elicited that one depositor at Bijapur controlled <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> accounts, another at Surat thirty, and another at Karwar nineteen. Such persons are really speculators and are a danger to the Savings Bank, and it would be interesting to know what proportion they hold of the total deposits in the Bombay Circle.

He placed her on a pedestal in his thoughts, which was a thing he had never dreamt of doing for any other woman, and before long his admiration melted into love. Then being <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> the disease took rapid and tense possession. He was only happy when he was with her, able to talk to her now and again, to watch her always.

It wasn't so much the slipper that hurt him, though the Female Samson put all her muscle into the operation, but it was the disgrace of the thing; and when you remember that the Dwarf was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years old, you can understand that he felt that the woman had taken a liberty with him. However, the next day he seemed to have forgotten all about it, and when the Giant reminded him of the circumstance, which he did every little while, the Dwarf would grin and say that we must let the women do what they liked, for they were a superior sort of being. \"One of the Female Samson's best feats was done in company with the Dwarf and the Giant.

The fact of the matter is that in pursuing my studies of the apostle Thomas I have actually gone beyond his simple rugged agnosticism, and I now at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of age after eighteen years as a minister of religion find myself unable longer to accept in any literal sense of the term whatever the Virgin Birth.\" Laurence poured himself out a third glass of port and waited for John to recover from his stupefaction. \"But I don't think I'm a very good person to talk to about these abstruse divine obstetrics,\" John protested. \"I really haven't considered the question.

Not long since, of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> subscriptions received from Whitehall, N.Y., in one week, nine copies of PUNCHINELLO No. 16 mysteriously disappeared between that place and New York city.

Now the primary cost of pressing three men on the 20 Pound basis being 60 Pounds, it follows that in order to obtain their ultimate cost to the country we must add to that sum the outlay incurred in pressing another man in lieu of the one who ran.

It is, therefore, obvious that the Egyptians conceived that their gods commanded them not to do the deeds which are here denied.

These differences may, however, be easily explained, for the central administration may at any time have added to or taken from the number of names for fiscal or other considerations, and we shall probably be correct in assuming that at the time the Negative Confession was drawn up in the tabular form in which we meet it in the XVIIIth dynasty the names were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> in number. Support is also lent to this view by the fact that the earliest form of the Confession, which forms the Introduction to Chapter CXXV., mentions less than forty sins.

We found them to be <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> feet high, which is double the mean rise of the Nile. But this measure was taken in a place where the bed of the Orinoco is singularly hemmed in by rocks, and I could only notice the marks shown me by the natives.

The Eastern Section from Rome to Albany was surveyed in part by Engineer Charles C. Broadhead. The seventy odd miles to Schoharie Creek, with a descent of 132.85 feet, called for sixteen locks and forty-five bridges--a total expenditure of $1,090,603.

Thus they ran for an hour and a half, and then the _Avon_ signaled that she was beaten, with five guns dismounted, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> men dead or wounded, seven feet of water in the hold, the magazine flooded, and the spars and rigging almost destroyed. Blakely was about to send a crew aboard when another hostile brig, forsaking the agile Yankee privateer, came up to help the _Avon_. The _Wasp_ was perfectly willing to take on this second adversary, but just then a third British ship loomed through the obscurity, and the ocean seemed a trifle overpopulated for safety.

You might as well limit the family to twenty-two children. If you recall the Americans in the nineteenth century who wrote books that lived <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years you will have to begin with Cooper; you can follow with Washington Irving, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edgar Allan Poe, and there you have to wait a long time. You come to Emerson, and you have to stand still and look further. You find Howells and T. B.

Perhaps, the text is doubtful, he kept it at double the usual distance in rear of the fighting lines. Then, to guard against a turning movement by Pompey's seven thousand cavalry and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> hundred slingers and archers, a movement in which Pompey placed the hopes of victory, Caesar posted six cohorts that represented scarcely two thousand men. He had perfect confidence that these two thousand men would make Pompey's cavalry wheel about, and that his one thousand horsemen would then press the action so energetically that Pompey's cavalry would not even think of rallying. It happened so; and the forty-two hundred archers and slingers were slaughtered like sheep by...", "...very fine orange trees, with several pieces of sculpture.

The Belvidere and terraces here are also prominent objects. I was much pleased with a piece of trellissing that surrounded the oval spot of ground at the south side of the palace. This trellis projects about twenty-one feet on one side, and forms an oblong square about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> feet long. The side next the oval consists of eight round columns, formed by thin flat iron bars, opposite to which are openings to correspond, that look into a running stream of water, that separates the park or pleasure ground from a piece of kitchen-garden ground on the opposite side.

The Dutchmen, under De Wet, had invested the place on the 18th, and poured a heavy fire on the position occupied by the Highlanders, creeping nightly nearer and nearer, and ceasing neither day nor night in their attack.

When he again came to the northwest he brought with him some shell bark and some bull hickory nuts, also some butternut trees and black walnut trees.

It measures more than seven feet and seven inches in circumference around the base and has a spread of fifty-seven feet, while in height it has reached <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> feet. In 1907 it yielded a crop of one hundred and twenty-six and a half boxes of fruit of Frazier's prolific variety.

It was resolved, at supper, that each alchymist present should contribute a certain sum towards raising <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> marks of gold, which, in five days, it was confidently asserted by Master Henry, would increase, in his furnace, fivefold. Bernard, being the richest man, contributed the lion's share, ten marks of gold, Master Henry five, and the others one or two a-piece, except the dependants of Bernard, who were obliged to borrow their quota from their patron. The grand experiment was duly made; the golden marks were put into a crucible, with a quantity of salt, copperas, aquafortis,...", "...sort of new to you.

Yet is this tone mellow and pleasing at the same time. Notwithstanding the organ could be hardly less than three hundred feet distant from the musicians in the choir, it sent forth sounds so powerful and grand--as almost to overwhelm the human voice, with the accompaniments of trombones and serpents.

About seventy species of birds have now been obtained on these islands, and of these forty-one are peculiar to them. But all the species found elsewhere, except one, belong to the aquatic tribes or the waders which are pre-eminently wanderers, yet even of these eight are peculiar. The true land-birds are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> in number, and all but one are entirely confined to the Galapagos; while three-fourths of them present such peculiarities that they are classed in distinct genera. All are allied to birds inhabiting tropical America, some very closely; while one--the common American rice-bird which ranges over the whole northern and part of the southern continents--is the only land-bird identical with those of the mainland. The following is a list of these land-birds taken from Mr. Salvin's...", "...of water. I have not turned away the course of canals.

Dr. Arnold, who died in 1842, the year after his appointment, was the earliest Professor whose lectures were famous, or were attended, and Dr. Arnold did exactly as he pleased. There was no Board of Studies to supervise him, and it was thought rather good of a Professor to lecture at all. Now the Board of Studies was omnipotent, and a Professor's time was not his own. He was bound in fact to give <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> lectures in a year, and to lecture twice a week for seven weeks in two terms out of the three. The prospect appalled him. \"I never,\" he wrote to Max Muller,+ \"I never gave a lecture on an historical subject without a fortnight or three weeks of preparation, and to undertake to deliver forty-two such lectures in six months would be to undertake an impossibility. If the University is to get any good out of me, I must work in my own way.\" He did not, however, work in his own...", "...Sayings of the Philosophers_. The Rev. T.

The colophon of it ran thus: \"Explicit exposicio Sancti Jeronimi in simbolo apostolorum ad papam laur[=e]cium.

It happened, also, that as he was being dragged through the streets to jail, a brilliant cavalcade met the mob, and inquiries were made as to what it was all about, and who the prisoner was. The cavalier who put the question was one who was to be later a devoted follower of Ignatius; he was no less a personage than Francis Borgia.

Some have believed that the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> gods represented each a name of Egypt, and much support is given to this view by the fact that most of the lists of names make the number to be forty-two; but then, again, the lists do not agree. The classical authors differ also, for by some of these writers the names are said to be thirty-six in number, and by others forty-six are enumerated. These differences may, however, be easily explained, for the central administration may at any time have added to or taken from the...", "...some fruit was shot at.\"[10] I realize the extreme difficulty teachers have to devote the necessary time to perfecting the stories they tell in school, because this is only one of the subjects they have to teach in an already over-crowded curriculum.

We apprehend, however, that the estimate is sufficiently large; yet we are not concerned to show any great capacity for the Icelandic ships.

Shoes, soap, and currants totalled $1.50 on April 7th; and on March 20th, two pounds of butter sold for thirty cents and a pound of cheese for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> cents.

It is true that we now have the international copyright law at last, and we can at least begin to forget our shame; but literary property has only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can.

On June 10, 1794, the city gave to Trinity Church a water grant covering all that land from Washington street to the North River between Chambers and Reade streets. The annual rent was one shilling per running foot after the expiration of forty-two years from June 10, 1794. Thus, for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years, no rent was charged. Shortly after the passage of this grant, Trinity Church conveyed it to William Rhinelander, and also all that ground between Jay and Harrison streets, from Greenwich street to the North River. By a subsequent arrangement with Trinity Church and the city, all of this land as well as certain other Trinity land became William Rhinelander's property; and then, by agreement of the Common Council on May 29, 1797, and confirmation of Nov. 16, 1807, he was...", "...Holden, who was appointed, in 1885, president of the University of California and director of the new observatory affiliated to it, stated that during six or seven months of the year an unbroken serenity prevails, and that half the remaining nights are clear.[1640] The power of continuous work thus afforded is of itself an inestimable advantage; and the high visual excellences testified to by Mr. Burnham's discovery, during a two months' trip to Mount Hamilton in the autumn of 1879, of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> new double stars with a 6-inch achromatic, gave hopes since fully realised of a brilliant future for the Lick establishment.

For more than a thousand miles it rushes through a deep canon toward the sea, falling <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> hundred feet between its source and mouth and for five hundred miles of its course tumbling in a series of five hundred and twenty cataracts and rapids--an average of slightly more than one to every mile. Think of the courage of brave Major Powell and his men, who descended this terrible river for the first time, and you have a subject for contemplation as sublime as the canon itself. In the spring of 1869, when John W. Powell started on his famous expedition, the Grand...", "...were not to be defended at the public expense. The Florentines, in order to induce the Venetians to take a more correct view of the case, sent Tommaso Soderini as their ambassador to the senate, and, in the meantime, engaged forces, and appointed Ercole, marquis of Ferrara, to the command of their army. While these preparations were being made, the Castellina was so hard pressed by the enemy, that the inhabitants, despairing of relief, surrendered, after having sustained a siege of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> days. The enemy then directed their course toward Arezzo, and encamped before San Savino. The Florentine army being now in order, went to meet them, and having approached within three miles, caused such annoyance, that Federigo d'Urbino demanded a truce for a few days, which was granted, but proved so disadvantageous to the Florentines, that those who had made the request were astonished at having obtained it; for, had it been refused, they would have been compelled to retire...", "...felt a creeping sensation and numbness, particularly in the arm which was next to the table. She stated positively that in consequence of this feeling she could predict with the greatest certainty when the atmosphere was highly charged with electricity, as the numbness increased on these occasions.

MacDonald offers as a physiologic explanation of this case that probably the impression produced <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years before implicated the right brachial plexus and the afferent branches of the pneumogastric, and to some degree the vomiting center in the medulla; hence, when the atmosphere was highly charged with electricity the structures affected became more readily impressed.

Not one of his followers this year voted for it once. The Senator from New York (Mr. Seward) the embodiment of the Party, sat quietly and did not propose it. What more?

In the book his open petition to Congress that all property rights, as well as literary ownership, should be put on the copyright basis and limited to a \"beneficent term of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years,\" was more or less of a joke, but, like so many of Mark Twain's jokes, it was founded on reason and justice. He had another idea, that was not a joke: an early plan in the direction of international copyright. It was to be a petition signed by the leading American authors, asking the United States to declare itself to be the first to stand for right and justice by enacting laws against the piracy of foreign books. It was a rather utopian scheme, as most schemes for...", "...in my opinion, you ought to put your foot down. There!

He was not prepared to acknowledge that his opinion of Miss Hamilton was colored by any personal emotion beyond the unqualified respect he gave to her practical qualities, and he was sure that the only reason for anxiety about possible developments between her and Hugh was the loss to himself of her valuable services. \"I've reached an age,\" he told his reflection, whose crow's-feet were seeming more conspicuous than usual in the clear...", "...only thirteen and a half fine days. After returning to Elmwood and resting for ten days, the two again set out to the eastward. They were travelling over the ice, on the second day out, when it gave way under the sledge. They lost all their stores and equipment, and saturated their cartridges. They had at once to turn back, but the ice was growing so thin that they had great difficulty in reaching the shore. For nearly twenty-six hours they had to keep marching before they covered the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> miles which lay between the scene of their disaster and Elmwood. This was the last journey undertaken prior to their departure in the _Windward_ for England a month or so later.

Dr. Smith does not appear to have been quite aware of the effect of employing two metals as currency, and both a legal tender for debts of any amount; for he says that \"in reality, during the continuance of any one regulated proportion between the respective values of the different metals in coin, the value of the most precious metal regulates the value of the whole coin.\" Because gold was in his day the medium in which it suited debtors to pay their debts, he...", "...of the Inn are blazoned on the walls.

In the fourteenth century these towers were strengthened and enlarged with the idea of making them more effective for defense and habitation.

In looking over the records of my career I find that in the course of my visits to America I gave private lessons to the heads of two hundred and seventy business establishments in New York, one hundred and thirty-five in Boston, and three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> in Chicago. All these men were large employers of labour and what they principally wanted was, to have some help beyond that of their own judgment in dealing with those with whom they came in contact in the regular course of their business careers. In no other country did I find the same interest taken in the study of character from a practical standpoint. It is for this reason that I write a special Preface for this Edition, believing as I do that my American readers...", "...loses is this _London Times_. Someday I'm going to match the _Congressional Record_ and the _Times_ for the heavyweight championship of the world, with seven to one on the _Record_, to weigh in at the ringside.\" \"You've been up north, Arthur,\" said Fitzgerald. \"What's your advice?\" \"Don't do it. You've often wondered how and where I lost these two digits. Up there.\" The _Times_ rattled, and Cathewe became absorbed in the budget. Arthur Cathewe was a tall, loose-limbed man, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> or three, rather handsome, and a bit shy with most folk. Rarely any one saw him outside the club. He had few intimates, but to these he was all that friendship means, kindly, tender, loyal, generous, self-effacing. And Fitzgerald loved him best of all men. It did not matter that there were periods when they became separated for months at a time. They would some day turn up together in the same place. \"Why, hello, Arthur!\" \"Glad to see you, Jack!\" and that was all that...", "...on the Westport River for Saint George for a cargo of codfish. The voyage was the foundation for a profitable fishing industry near his home for many years. At this time Michael Wainer, his brother-in-law, an Indian, entered his service. His brother-in-law was a good seaman and with a new twenty ton vessel, the _Sunfish_, the men made two trips to the Strait of Belle Isle and Newfoundland. With the profits from the ventures he built in connection with another person, the _Mary_, a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> ton schooner. In the _Mary_, accompanied by two small boats, and with a crew of ten, they went on a whaling expedition to the Strait of Belle Isle. On reaching the Strait, Cuffe found four other vessels fully equipped with boats and harpoons. These vessels would not, as was customary, cooperate with Captain Cuffe, so he and his crew went at it alone. Now fearing they might get no whales the strangers fell in with the _Mary_. Seven whales were captured, six by the crew of...", "...States Revenue Marine_. _____ _Resolution of Congress Voting Thanks to Captain Ritchie._ _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled_: That the thanks of Congress are due, and are hereby tendered to Captain David Ritchie, commanding the revenue steamer Mocassin, and to the officers and men under his command, for their heroic and humane action in saving the lives of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> persons from the wreck of the steamer \"Metis\" on the waters of Long Island Sound, on the morning of the thirty-first of August, eighteen hundred and seventy-two. Approved January 24, 1873. No. 82. (p. 438) PLATE LXXXII. _1876._ These United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States. [Rx].

With all his faults he would never have thus tarnished his fair name. 1424] MARCH FROM CALAIS TO HAINAULT The month of October was now passed, and the Earl Marshal had arrived in the early morning of November 2 with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> sail and the second detachment of Gloucester's army, and on the evening of the same day four more ships arrived. A week later the troops marched out as far as the castle of Guisnes, there to await the last contingent which was now due. They had not long to wait, for on November 13 twenty-two more ships arrived at Calais, and immediately preparations were made for the start.[520] Early in the morning of November 18 Gloucester led out his men on the first stage of the march to...", "...sake in Bedford jail; and having refused to expatriate himself, was in daily fear lest his cruel sentence, 'you must stretch by the neck' for refusing to attend the church service, should be carried into execution. The fame of Fowler's gross perversion of the design of Christ's gospel reached Bunyan in prison, and its popularity grieved his spirit. At length, on the 13th of the 11th Month (February), a copy of the book was brought to him; and in the almost incredible space of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> short days, on the 27th of the 12th Month (March) 1671-2, he had fully analysed 'The Design,' exposed the sophistry, and scripturally answered the gross errors which abound in every page of this learned and subtle piece of casuistry.

Never was the homely...", "...to the profession of arms, as soon as they attained the age of manhood; and their cowardly refusal was punished by the lose of honor, of fortune, or even of life. But as the annual growth of the sons of the veterans bore a very small proportion to the demands of the service, levies of men were frequently required from the provinces, and every proprietor was obliged either to take up arms, or to procure a substitute, or to purchase his exemption by the payment of a heavy fine. The sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> pieces of gold, to which it was reduced, ascertains the exorbitant price of volunteers, and the reluctance with which the government admitted of this alterative. Such was the horror for the profession of a soldier, which had affected the minds of the degenerate Romans, that many of the youth of Italy and the provinces chose to cut off the fingers of their right hand, to escape from being pressed into the service; and this strange expedient was so commonly practised, as to...", "...[Sidenote: Financial embarrassment.] [Sidenote: The religions situation.] [Sidenote: Catharine's neutrality.] Yet the position of Catharine, it must be admitted, was by no means an easy one. The ablest statesman might have shrunk from coping with the financial difficulties that beset her. The crown was almost hopelessly involved. Henry the Second had in the course of a dozen years accumulated, by prodigal gifts and by needless wars, a debt--enormous for that age--of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> millions of francs, besides alienating the crown lands and raising by taxation a larger sum of money than had been collected in eighty years previous.[981] The Venetian Michele summed up the perplexities of the political situation under two questions: How to relieve the people, now thoroughly exhausted;[982] and, how to rescue the crown from its poverty. But, in reality, the financial embarrassment was the least of the difficulties of the position Catharine had assumed. The...", "...the interest of which we have received during the year.\" The feeling of many suffragists that they wished to use all their money for war work retarded contributions but the example of the National Association was pointed out, which undertook a widespread war service, as the treasury had proved, but did not leave its legitimate suffrage work undone. Mrs. Rogers, whose gratuitous services as treasurer had proved of the highest value to the association, told of the help of her committee of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> members in the various States and presented her report carefully audited by expert accountants. It showed expenditures for the year of $803,729. This covered the expenses of the two headquarters, congressional work, State campaigns, publicity and organization throughout the United States. Mrs. Catt's plan to raise a million dollar fund for 1917 had met a generous response and had not lacked a great deal of fulfilment. Pledges to the amount of $120,000 were made for the coming...", "...shame; but literary property has only forty-two years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can. This may be right enough in itself; but I think, then, that all property should be defended by civil suit, and should become public after <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of private tenure. The Constitution guarantees us all equality before the law, but the law-makers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our literary industry. So long as this remains the case, we cannot expect the best business talent to go into literature, and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men. As I have hinted, it is but a little while that he has had any standing at all. I may say that it is only since the Civil War that...", "...These, for the most part, are expressions of Pullman service over and above the service itself, but it is unquestionably true that by such \"over and above\" service is the whole service most truly judged. Who would think, for instance, that in one year 5,819,656 women's hats were protected against dust by paper bags provided by the porters. And yet these paper bags represented a total cost of $14,549.00. Smokers in the same period consumed two million boxes of matches, and over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> million drinking cups costing nearly eighty thousand dollars gave the modern touch of sanitation to the water coolers. Soap would naturally be considered an essential part of the service, but a soap bill for one year of sixty thousand dollars is a large order for cleanliness. So, too, is the sum of $20,000 for hair brushes and a third of that amount for combs. Back in the dark ages of blissful ignorance of germs, railroad coaches were hallowed breeding places for sickness....", "...I am more comfortable without it. III. There is this to be said in defence of men of letters on the business side, that literature is still an infant industry with us, and, so far from having been protected by our laws, it was exposed for ninety years after the foundation of the republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods. It is true that we now have the international copyright law at last, and we can at least begin to forget our shame; but literary property has only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can.

The relief ought to be immediate; and the way to give immediate relief was to limit the duration of Parliaments, and to begin with that Parliament which, in the opinion of the country, had already held power too long. The forces were so evenly balanced that a very slight accident might have turned the scale. When the question was put that the bill do pass, eighty-two peers were present. Of these <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> were for the bill, and forty against it. Proxies were then called. There were only two proxies for the bill; there were seven against it; but of the seven three were questioned, and were with difficulty admitted. The result was that the bill was lost by three votes. The majority appears to have been composed of moderate Whigs and moderate Tories. Twenty of the minority protested, and among them were the most violent and intolerant members of both parties, such as...", "...Third, Alfonso's father. Ferdinand, we know, possessed a sword which he delivered with due ceremony to his elder son, the Infante Don Fernando, upon his leading out a force against the town of Antequera. This sword the chronicler Alvar Garcia de Santa Maria described as having \"a sheath in pieces, with many precious stones.\" Of even greater interest than the foregoing weapon is the great two-handed and two-edged _estoque_ or ceremonial sword of Ferdinand and Isabella, which measures <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> inches in length. The fittings are of iron, gilded and engraved. The crossbars, terminating in small half-moons, with the concave side directed outward, are inscribed with the well-known motto of the Catholic sovereigns, TANTO MONTA, and with a supplication to the Virgin, MEMENTO MEI O MATER DEI MEI. The pommel is a flat disc, suggestive in its outline of a Gothic cross, and bears upon one side the figure of Saint John together with the yoke, emblem of Ferdinand the Catholic,...", "...flew from one swamp to another, filling the air with their startling cries. Both these species are found associated in flocks upon the cultivated prairie farms, where they pillage the grain and vegetable fields of the farmer. Their habits are somewhat similar, though the whooping-crane is the most wary of the two. The adult Whooping-cranes are white, the younger birds of a brownish color. This species is larger than the Sand-hill Crane, the latter having a total length of from forty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> inches. The Sand-hill species may be distinguished from the Whooping-crane by its slate-blue color. The cackling, whooping, and screaming voices of an assembled multitude of these birds cannot be described. They can be heard for miles upon the open plains. These birds are found in Florida and along the Gulf coast as well as over large areas of the northern states. They feed upon soft roots, which they excavate from the swamps, and upon bugs and reptiles of all kinds.

Is that--the gift? Karlsen, you don't mean it!\" said Egholm, weeping. \"One _daler_, yes,\" said Karlsen, laughing heartily. But his expression changed suddenly, possibly influenced by Egholm's threatening look, and, resuming his dignified manner, he went on: \"The gift was originally <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-two</span> _kroner_ altogether, that being the sum found when the box was opened. Fru Westergaard gave thirty-five herself.
