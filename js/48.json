It took him <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> years to travel from the squalor of Camden Town to Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey. He lodged first in Bayham Street. \"A washerwoman lived next door, and a Bow Street officer over the way.\" It was a shabby district, chosen by the elder Dickens because the rent was low. As he neglected to pay the rent, one wonders why he did not take quarters in Piccadilly. I looked in vain for a sign reading, \"Washin dun Heer,\" but I found a Bow Street orf'cer who told me that Bayham...", "...facing Main St. and Otsego Lake and directly in front of the later Otsego Hall, now marked by the Indian Hunter. In 1799 it was moved down the street, and was burned down in 1812. In its time it was the most stately private house for miles around. The second home, Otsego Hall, built in 1798, was of bricks which were made at the outlet of the lake. It had seventy feet of frontage by fifty-six of depth, and had two stories with attic and basement. The main hall measured twenty-four by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> feet and the rooms on either side were twenty feet wide. Otsego Hall is said to have been of the exact, generous proportions of the Van Rensselaer Manor House at Albany, New York, where Judge Cooper was a frequent visitor.

Human affairs would come to a standstill if we did not take the testimony of men. How should we get on in the ordinary intercourse of life, and how would commerce get on, if we disregarded men's testimony? Things social and commercial would come to a dead-lock within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours! This is the drift of the apostle's argument here. \"If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater.\" God has borne witness to Jesus Christ. And if man can believe his fellow men who are frequently telling untruths and whom we are constantly finding unfaithful, why should we not take God at His word and believe His testimony? Faith is a belief in testimony. It is not a leap in the dark, as some tell us. That would be no faith at all.

He neither proceeded to make strong his left against an attack from the direction of Chancellorsville nor did he move southward so as to put his army between that of General Hooker and the Confederate capital, but, leaving General Early, with about nine thousand men, to take care of General Sedgwick, he moved with the remainder of his army, numbering <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> thousand men, toward Chancellorsville. As soon as the advance of the enemy was encountered, it was attacked with vigor, and very soon the Federal army was on the defensive in its apparently impregnable position. It was not the part of wisdom to attempt to storm this stronghold; but Sedgwick would certainly soon be at work in the rear, and Early, with his inadequate force, could not do more than delay and harass him. It was, therefore,...", "...It should never be less than to cause no inconvenience in a week's absence of the laundress, and if a long voyage is to be made by steamship the supply should be proportionally increased.

He sent Archbishop Rokeby to Waterford, who succeeded in preventing Sir Piers Butler from fighting with Desmond, and he himself marched into Leix with his English soldiers, 120 Irish mercenaries, and 300 kerne. The English of the Pale, who, from love or fear of Kildare, usually mustered so strong on these occasions, contributed only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> horse and 120 foot. Surrey made war in the usual Irish fashion, and burned Connell O'More's country. He was joined by Sir Piers Butler, who brought a strong contingent, including Mulrony O'Carroll, whom he induced to take the oath of allegiance. O'Carroll had latterly done great harm in the Pale, and he was considered the best leader among the Irish. He refused to take the oath until Surrey rashly promised that Kildare should never be Deputy again. On being pressed about a...", "...Gustave Rameau entered, accompanied by Monsieur de Mauleon. Isaura was agreeably surprised by the impression made on her by the Vicomte's appearance and manner. His writings, and such as she had heard of his earlier repute, had prepared her to see a man decidedly old, of withered aspect and sardonic smile--aggressive in demeanour--forward or contemptuous in his very politeness--a Mephistopheles engrafted on the stem of a Don Juan. She was startled by the sight of one who, despite his <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> years--and at Paris a man is generally older at forty-eight than he is elsewhere--seemed in the zenith of ripened manhood--startled yet more by the singular modesty of a deportment too thoroughly high-bred not to be quietly simple--startled most by a melancholy expression in eyes that could be at times soft, though always so keen, and in the grave pathetic smile which seemed to disarm censure of past faults in saying, \"I have known sorrows.\" He did not follow up his...", "...fight with poisoned arrows. It is not yet known where Bezerra landed nor what he did; but it was feared at Darien when the vessels were leaving for Spain, that his expedition had turned out badly. Another captain, called Vallejo, carried on operations along the lower part of the gulf, crossing over by another route than that taken by Bezerra; thus one of them menaced Caribana from the front and the other from behind. Vallejo has come back, but out of seventy men he took with him, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> wounded were left in the power of the Caribs. This is the story told by those who reached Darien, and I repeat it.

The latter was amongst those who escaped the massacre executed by the cacique Pariza.

I saw how much the Emperor suffered from the necessity of listening to such remonstrances, notwithstanding the respectful language in which they were couched. For two entire days his Majesty remained undecided; and how long these <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours were! Never did abandoned cabin or bivouac present a more mournful sight than the sad chateau of Duben. In this doleful residence I saw the Emperor for the first time entirely unemployed; the indecision to which he was a prey absorbed him so entirely that his character seemed entirely changed. Who could believe it? To the activity which drove him on, and, so to speak, incessantly devoured him, had succeeded a seeming indifference which is perfectly indescribable....", "...or elsewhere, what the bishop was doing on 9th April, 1595, or where he was; or give any information on the subject?

The demand that Serbia admit Austrian officials into Serbia to take part in the work of investigation and suppression was an intolerable invasion of Serbia's sovereignty within her own borders. But the most threatening part of the note was its conclusion: \"The Austro-Hungarian government expects the reply of the royal [Serbian] government at the latest by 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, the 25th of July.\" In other words, the note was an ultimatum giving Serbia a period of only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours in which to agree to the Austrian demands. SERBIA'S REPLY.--Serbia's answer to the Austrian ultimatum was delivered within a few minutes of the time set. She agreed, practically, to all the Austrian demands except those which required that Austrian officials should conduct investigations and suppress conspiracies in Serbia, and she even went part way toward accepting those.

And now let us consider how this theory accords with the result to which we were led by the position of the great vacant space around the southern pole. So far as the date is concerned, we have already seen that the epoch 2170 B.C. accords excellently with the evidence of the vacant space. But this evidence, as I mentioned at the outset, establishes more than the date; it indicates the latitude of the place where the most ancient of Ptolemy's <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> constellations were first definitely adopted by astronomers. If we assume that at this place the southernmost constellations were just fully seen when due south, we find for the latitude about thirty-eight degrees north.

He had been put in charge of a depot of stores, at the Beaver Dams, between Queenston and Thorold. Colonel Boerstler, of the invading army, was despatched from Fort George, at Niagara, with orders to take this depot. Fitzgibbon was apprized of his approach. Reconnoitring, and discovering that Boerstler had been somewhat disconcerted, on his march, by a straggling fire from the woods, kept up by a few militiamen and about thirty Indians under Captain Kerr, he conceived...", "...the blame, or anything like that?\" \"Blame for what?\" says he. \"I don't believe I understand. But nothing of the sort was mentioned. I was merely given some instructions about my work.\" \"Oh!\" says I. \"That's all, eh? And you've gone right at it, have you?\" \"No,\" says he. \"The fact is, Torchy, I am writing out my resignation.\" \"What! Quittin'?\" says I. \"Say, don't you see what a hole that puts you in? Why, it makes you the goat for fair! If you do that you'll need bail inside of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours--and you won't get it. Look here, Dudley, take my advice and tear that up.\" \"But I can't, Torchy,\" says he, \"really, I can't.\" \"Why not?\" says I. \"You've got a couple of hands, ain't you? And what'll you do for another job if you chuck this one? Say, why in blazes are you so anxious to take your chances between Sing Sing and the bread line?\" He's there with the explanation, all right, and here's the way it stands: Uncle Dudley has been called on because his...", "...though cautiously.

He should find he had not an Irish girl to tease, and--and make love to--especially before other folks!

From the 3d of February to the 1st of April, eight American vessels were sunk by submarines and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> American lives thus lost. Because of the practical blockade of American ports which followed the hesitation of American shipping interests to send boats unarmed into the dangers of the \"war zone,\" President Wilson came again to Congress on the 26th of February to ask authority to arm merchant vessels for purposes of defense. Again he stressed his unwillingness to enter upon formal warfare and emphasized the idealistic aspect of the issue: \"It is not of material interests...", "...and whose fangs convey swift death to those unfortunates who come within reach of their fatal power.

Cortes then sent a courier with a letter to Sandoval, desiring the latter to join him as speedily as possible with all his men; we intended to march to within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles of Sempoalla, in the neighbourhood of the provinces of Tampanicita[78] and Mitalaguita, which are at present comprehended in the commendary of Pedro Moreno Mediana, who resides at Puebla; he particularly cautioned him to keep out of the way of Narvaez, and carefully to avoid coming to any engagement with any part of his troops. We ourselves marched forward with every military precaution, and were ready for action at a moment's notice. Two of our most trustworthy...", "...we raised more and more land, all connected, and seemingly in the direction of our course. At noon, it extended from S.S.W. to E., the nearest part five or six leagues distant; Our latitude at this time was 55 deg. 21', and our longitude 195 deg. 18'. This coast is on the N.W. side of the volcano mountain, so that we must have seen it, if the weather had been tolerably clear. At six in the evening, after having run eight leagues upon an E. by N. course from noon, we sounded, and found <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> fathoms, over a bottom of black sand. Being at this time four leagues from the land, the eastern part in sight bore E.S.E., and appeared as a high round hummock, seemingly detached from the main. Having continued to steer E.N.E. all night, at eight in the morning of the 4th, the coast was seen from S.S.W. to E. by S.; and at times we could see high land, covered with snow behind it. Soon after it fell calm, and being in thirty fathoms water, we put over hooks and lines,...", "...to the platform, and stood it on end in front of him. His purpose was not to form a shield, for the frail pine of which it was made could not have withstood a bullet, and it came scarcely to his waist, leaving exposed all vital parts. Glenning quietly dropped the keys in the long grass at the edge of the platform, took off his hat and placed it to one side, then lay his two revolvers upon the top of the box, gently rested his hand upon the butt of each, and waited. The revolvers were of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> calibre, and brightly nickeled. They caught the gleam from the lamp, and shone suggestively. The jailer had disappeared. John had heard him locking and barricading his door. In all probability he had deserted the place by some rear exit. The faint sound of many moving feet which had been audible a few minutes before had grown into a pronounced tread. As John stood and listened to this portentous advance, his heart did not quicken a beat. Indeed, he had grown calmer. The...", "...XXVI. CONCLUSION. It would be useless to enumerate all the misfortunes which befell the survivors of the expedition. Even the men themselves were never able to give any detailed narrative of the events which occurred during the week subsequent to the horrible discovery related in the last chapter. However, on the 9th of September, by superhuman exertions, they arrived at last at Cape Horsburg, the extreme point of North Devon. They were absolutely starving. For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours they had tasted nothing, and their last meal had been off the flesh of their last Esquimaux dog. Bell could go no further, and Johnson felt himself dying. They were on the shore of Baffin's Bay, now half-frozen over; that is to say, on the road to Europe, and three miles off the waves were dashing noiselessly on the sharp edges of the ice-field. Here they must wait their chance of a whaler appearing; and for how long?

It is interesting to know that the boat has gone 1,000,000 revolutions to Salonika from Liverpool, and a revolution is 25 feet. As we got into the harbour at Salonika there was a vessel called the _Athena_; it belongs to the Germans. We arrived at Salonika at 2 o'clock; we had to anchor outside.

Some days afterward, as he still lingered, a message was conveyed to him:--\"Lord Liverpool expects you to leave London to-morrow, and the kingdom in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours.\" And on the 24th April, 1809, he sailed from Harwich in his B.

Its founder died in 1872, aged seventy-seven years, in the enjoyment of the largest revenue which had ever resulted from journalism in the United States, and leaving to his only son the most valuable newspaper property, perhaps, in the world. That son, the present proprietor, has greatly improved the \"Herald.\" He possesses his father's remarkable journalistic tact, with less objectionable views of the...", "...them to reconsider.

Dear old Rocky is one of the best, but after a few days in his cottage in the woods, miles away from anywhere, New York, even with Motty on the premises, began to look pretty good to me.

Thus he expired, having existed--not reigned--as king for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> years, and was succeeded immediately by Louis the Fat, who was crowned within five days after the death of his father.

At the time of our arrival this way was entirely impracticable by any mode of travel. The inside or shallow water route was about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles long, and the outside or deep water course, sixty miles.

So violent was the shock that the whole water-front of the city was shaken as by an earthquake, telegraph poles were thrown down and the electric lights extinguished.

Of three hundred and fifty-three men in the ship's company only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> escaped unhurt, and the roll-call of the dead in the end reached two hundred and sixty-six. [=Preparations for War=] This terrible event was the immediate cause of the war.

This same Dr. Campbell is one of Dr. Churchill's authorities against contagion. Mr. Roberton says that in one instance within his knowledge a practitioner passed the catheter for a patient with puerperal fever late in the evening; the same night he attended a lady who had the symptoms of the disease on the second day. In another instance a surgeon was called while in the act of inspecting the body of a woman who had died of this fever, to attend a labor; within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours this patient was seized with the fever.' On the 16th of March, 1831, a medical practitioner examined the body of a woman who had died a few days after delivery, from puerperal peritonitis.

But the captain would not hear of the suggestion for a moment. \"No,\" said he; \"I mistrust that mutinous chap, Bill Moody, and the lot who sided with him in making a rush for the boats when we struck. I know they would be up to some mischief or other as soon as my back is turned.\" \"But there is McCarthy your chief mate,\" replied Mr Meldrum,...", "...and asked him what was the matter. \"Matter!\" he answered in a voice that for once really was full of dismay. \"The matter is that those Mazitu have stolen all the guns and all the ammunition.

Nowhere, not even in the War Zone, did war show to me a grimmer face than here. As these men are in good health and tarry barely <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, little is done for their comfort. Soldiers in good condition are not encouraged to expect comforts in war time, and no doubt the discipline is good for them--although, heaven knows, the French as a race know little about comfort at any time.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours more Charmides, making a strong effort, stubbornly refusing to admit that he was still sick, made an appearance of recovery from his indisposition. He talked with Hodo, asking welcome questions about trade, life, and home. He spoke to those members of the caravan from whom hitherto he had held aloof. And he made a desperate effort to learn from the leader a few phrases in the Babylonish tongue. This last, however, proved a Herculean task. The Greek race was notoriously...", "...spoken of as an interesting wager would be. In former times it happened rarely that a duel with swords had a fatal ending, and therefore it is surrounded with none of the mystery that attends the more serious affair; for the seconds, likewise, there is far less responsibility. If a principal gets severely hurt, the attending surgeon declares that the sufferer has not died of the wound, but that there was some trouble in the organism which would have probably killed him within the next <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours. And who, nowadays, would make a fuss over a man who was doomed to die in forty-eight hours? The duel which was to take place between the Marquis Salista and Ivan was spoken of at the club with indifference, as a thing that had a foregone conclusion. Salista spoke most of it himself, and at six o'clock the evening before stood at the chimney-piece and entertained a select group of friends, among whom were the four seconds, with his ideas on the subject.

Until this miraculous Whitsuntide of June 1652, when, suddenly, in a moment, everything was changed.

ENDURANCE.--Two hundred and fifty rounds were fired, the revolver working without difficulty throughout. It was allowed five minutes to cool after each 50 rounds. FOULING.--The revolver remained uncleaned <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, after which it was fired 50 rounds. It was allowed five minutes to cool after the 12th, 24th, and 36th rounds. Though badly fouled at the rear of the cylinder, by the escape of gas at the primer (the ammunition being outside priming) the arm worked satisfactorily.

Ever since having been financed by the Government, Langley had been at work, and the result was a tandem monoplane much like his early models. It was driven by a gasoline motor placed amidships which acted on twin screw propellers, which also were between the tandem planes. The whole machine with the pilot weighed 830 pounds, and had 1,040 square feet of wing surface. It was fifty-two feet long from front to rear and the wings measured <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> feet from tip to tip. The wings were arched, like those of modern aeroplanes, and the double rudder at the rear had both horizontal and vertical surfaces to steer the machine up or down, or from right to left. The aerodrome did not have any device for keeping it on an even keel, such as the ailerons we know to-day, or the wing-warping system of the Wright machine. This was a serious drawback, according to the present-day scientists, but Professor Langley had set his wings...", "...up in vain.

It is the general rule, with frequent exceptions, that the quotidian paroxysm comes on in the morning, the tertian about noon, and the quartan in the afternoon. Another rule is that the quartan has the longest cold stage, while its paroxysm is shortest as a whole; the quotidian has the shortest cold stage and a long hot stage, while its paroxysm is longest as a whole.

In more severe cases the child feels sick and is listless for from twenty-four to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours. There may be a headache, vomiting, pains in the back and limbs, and fever. There is pain in the swelling which is increased by movement of the jaws and by pressure.

But that was not the day for any such consideration on either side! Both parties were anxious to try the strength of their arms. The pride of England would not permit the rebels, as she termed them, to defy her to the teeth; and, without for a moment calculating the cost, the British general determined to destroy the fort immediately. On the other side, Prescott and his gallant followers longed and thirsted for a decisive trial of strength and of courage.

During the first few months the temperature of the water should be 98 deg. F. The temperature of the water should be taken with a bath thermometer; it should not be guessed at.

Morning came, but the cabin was almost as dark as by night. A blinding, swirling snow-storm obscured the sun. A blizzard raged for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours.

It may be proper to conclude our account of Houtman's Abrolhos with a few general remarks. They form three groups instead of one, as was formerly supposed; Pelsart Group being separated from Easter Group by a channel, the least width of which is four miles, whilst the middle passage between the latter and the Northern Group is six miles wide. The Abrolhos extend in a North-North-West direction <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles, diminishing in breadth towards the north; the greatest width of Easter and Pelsart Groups being twelve miles in a West-South-West direction. In Easter Group the outer reefs are most distant from the islands, being there four miles from the nearest, which is Rat Island. In the Northern Group the islands are more detached than in the others, and North Island is separated from them by a distance of ten miles.

This should be done by gathering up the eggs at the end of egg-tray and placing them upon the eggs in centre of the tray, rolling the centre ones back to the end of the tray. The tray should be reversed, and the same thing done to the other end.

About eleven hundred miles through the snowy steppes, over mountains and across deserts we traveled in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> days. We hid from the people as we journeyed, made short stops in the most desolate places, fed for whole weeks on nothing but raw, frozen meat in order to avoid attracting attention by the smoke of fires.

We even feared to shoot, although we met a great herd of antelopes numbering...", "...sliding down hill.

What it could be she could not guess.

The motion of these processes produces and maintains the water currents, which carry the minute food products to the digestive cells in the same cavities. Sponges multiply by the union of sexual product. Certain cells of the fleshy pulp assume the character of ova, and others that of spermatozoa. Fertilization takes place within the sponge. The fertilized eggs, which are called larvae, pass out into the currents of the water, and, in the course of twenty-four to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, they settle and become attached to rocks and other hard substances, and in time develop into mature sponges. The depth of the water in which sponges grow varies from 10 to 50 feet in Florida, but considerably more in the Mediterranean Sea, the finer grades being found in the deepest water, having a temperature of 50 to 57 degrees.

In <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours five hundred new workmen had arrived, and in squads of from twenty-five to fifty they were coming in on every train. Colonel Harris, experienced in strikes, knew just what to do.

The next day the weather changed, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours they struggled on through a heavy snowstorm, with the wind fortunately on their backs.

During this siege many of the whites were wounded, and about eighty of the Indians were killed. The day after the defeat, Philip, with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> warriors, arrived at the Indian encampment at Brookfield.

Edwards, in his _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_, informs us that 'Ratcliffe's <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> Caxtons produced at his sale two hundred and thirty-six pounds, and that the king bought twenty of them at an aggregate cost of about eighty-five pounds.

On their refusal he landed his troops, and after a short bombardment of Fort S.

Whether Loncin held out the full <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, or only forty, or only thirty-six, we do not know; but that moral factor to which I have already alluded, and which must be fully weighed in war, was again strengthened by the nature of such a resistance.

Beaumont, who was a baron of the exchequer for thirty years, died on the 4th of March 1814, and was succeeded as 3rd baron by his grandson Beaumont Hotham (1794-1870), who was present at the battle of Waterloo, being afterwards a member of parliament for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> years.

Two things are to be said about the words: first, that they are few; and, secondly, that they are short. The vocabulary of the English Bible is not an extensive one.

In the Old Testament, in the Hebrew and Chaldaic tongue, there are fifty-six hundred and forty-two words. In the New Testament, in the Greek, there are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hundred. But in the whole of the King James version there are only about six thousand different words. The vocabulary is plainly a narrow one for a book of its size. While, as was said before, the translators avoided using the same word always for translation of the same original, they yet managed to recur to the same words often enough so that this comparatively small list of six thousand words, about one-third Shakespeare's vocabulary, sufficed for the stating of the...", "...Porte to the pasha with orders for his execution.

This is true, and the explanation is simple. Mosquito larvae, or wrigglers, as they are termed, require water for their development. A heavy shower leaves standing water, which, when the air is full of moisture, evaporates slowly. Then, too, the heat favors the growth of the microoerganisms on which the larvae feed; wrigglers found in the water <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours after their formation will have plenty of food, and adult mosquitoes will appear six to eight days after the eggs are laid.

In connection with his plan for coercing Harley, Ormuz Khan had gone to London by rail on the previous night, departing from Lower Claybury station at about the time that Colonel Lord Wolverham came out of the Cavalry Club to discover his Rolls Royce to be missing.

She tried to recall the slightest details of that past day. But the presence of her husband and mother-in-law worried her.

At all councils for the investiture of sachems their names are still called with the others as a tribute of respect to their memory. The general council, therefore, consisted of but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> members. Each sachem had an assistant sachem, who was elected by the gens of his principal from among its members, and who was installed with the same forms and ceremonies. He was styled an \"aid.\" It was his duty to stand behind his superior on all occasions of ceremony, to act as his messenger, and in general to be subject to his directions. It gave to the aid the office of chief and rendered probable his election as the successor of his principal after the decease of...", "...he was to reside for some time in the house of some religious teacher, well read in the Veda, to be instructed in the knowledge of the scriptures and the scientific or theoretic treatises attached to them, in the social duties of his caste, and in the complicated system of purificatory and sacrificial rites.

During all this time the student had to subsist entirely on food obtained by begging from house to house; and his behaviour towards the preceptor and his family was to be that prompted by respectful attachment and implicit obedience.

Six Frenchmen went with Hiens; and the rest, including Joutel, Douay, and the Caveliers, remained behind, in the same lodge in which Joutel had been domesticated, and where none were now left but women, children, and old men. Here they remained a week or more, watched closely by the Cenis, who would not let them leave the village; when news at length arrived of a great victory, and the warriors soon after returned with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> scalps. It was the French guns that won the battle, but not the less did they glory in their prowess; and several days were spent in ceremonies and feasts of triumph.

That which they call _bucare peonio_, is placed at three alleys in good soils (about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> French feet). The former species of erythrina is that which elevates itself the highest. The second species has many thorns, the upper surface of the leaf is darker and the lower whiter. Both kinds should be cut in the wane of the moon, and remain in the shade until its increase, at which time they should be planted. It is much preferable, however, to take them from a nursery.

In addition we have the Federal Government with its own laws and courts. In one class of cases, the Federal courts follow the state laws which govern the particular occasion; in another class of cases, notably in those involving the interpretation or application of the United States statutes, the Federal courts follow Federal law. There is not even a degree of uniformity governing the state laws, and...", "...had disappeared, only I had still the knife in my hand. \"This knife was my only hope. \"I was worn out with fatigue.

Now, multiplying the number of skewers so delivered by the number of barrows, a total of sixty-two thousand seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> skewers daily would be obtained. Allowing that, of these sixty-two thousand seven hundred and forty-eight skewers, the odd two thousand seven hundred and forty-eight were accidentally devoured with the meat, by the most voracious of the animals supplied, it followed that sixty thousand skewers per day, or the enormous number of twenty-one millions nine hundred thousand skewers annually, were wasted in the kennels and dustholes of London; which, if collected and warehoused,...", "...an overestimate of the opposing ships.)] Leaving the _Hornet_ to blockade her, Commodore Bainbridge ran off to the southward, keeping the land in view.

In 1773 the bounty system of the reign of William III was revised, the average price of wheat being reckoned at forty-four shillings the quarter. If it fell below that figure, a bounty of five shillings a quarter was granted on export, so as to encourage farmers to give a wide acreage to wheat, in the assurance that in bountiful seasons they could profitably dispose of their surplus. But when the price rose to forty-four shillings exportation was forbidden, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> shillings foreign corn was admitted on easy terms so as to safeguard the consumer; for, as Burke said: \"he who separates the interest of the consumer from the interest of the grower starves the country.\" Unfortunately, in 1791, Government raised the price at which importation was allowed to fifty-four shillings the quarter. The upward trend of prices may have called for some change; but it was too drastic.

It contains a code of ten primary and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> secondary commandments, worded as prohibitions, but equivalent to positive injunctions, inasmuch as they blame the neglect of various active duties. The ten primary commandments are called Pratimoksha and he who breaks them is Parajika,[861] that is to say, he _ipso facto_ leaves the road leading to Buddhahood and is condemned to a long series of inferior births.

In contrast to this antiquated method of locomotion we are also shown the North Mail railway express approaching Carlisle at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles an hour. Two other figures, one a letter-carrier of 1840, and the other a postman of 1890, complete the ornamentation. This envelope, and a correspondence-card enclosed within it, which appropriately bears a portrait of Sir Rowland Hill, was sold by post offices on the one day only for sixpence.

I thought that the advantage thus given to the self-fertilised seedlings would have been so great that they would never have been beaten by the crossed ones. They were not beaten until all had grown to a height of 18 inches; and the degree to which they were finally beaten is shown in Table 2/4. We here see that the average height of the four...", "...at St. Eloi, and with a nerve and initiative that they have seldom displayed.

The Northumberlands had been in the new line for about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, but they had been unable to place it in a good condition for defence. Their trenches were the remains of German second or third line defences choked with the dead and wounded of both combatants; their communications were only to left and right; firing trenches or platforms there were practically none; the earth was a sodden pulp and the skies full of falling shells; the schemes for the reconstruction of the lines put forward by their divisional command, wise as they...", "...two ago I would have said the same.

Chief among them I would place what I regarded as my wife's altogether unaccountable and quite unreasonable determination to keep up relations with her mother. I thought I was unfairly treated here, and I made no allowance for filial feelings, or the influence of Fanny's life-long tutelage. I only saw that she had very gladly allowed me to rescue her from the tyranny of a spiteful, gin-drinking, old woman; and that, within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, she was for visiting her mother as a regular thing, and even proposed that I should join her in this. That was one of the early difficulties; and another, more distressing in its way, was my discovery of the fact that it was apparently impossible for me to think consecutively, or to write when I had thought, in a room which was my wife's living place.

They were of various sizes, from that of a mustard seed, up to that of a grain of Indian corn. Some were slightly elevated, but most of them were not in the least so.

The skipper's calculations as to time were verified, and they entered the river at Weymouth <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours after leaving Dover. Mrs. Troutbeck was delighted to see Frank. He had indeed written a fortnight before, saying he hoped to be able before long to get a few days' leave and should come down to see her, and she was therefore not greatly surprised at his arrival. \"You have grown a good deal, my dear boy,\" she said after they had chatted together for some time, \"but you are not changed so much as I expected.\" \"Well, Aunt, I don't see how I can change much till the...", "...anyone could be ignorant of the identity of the famous jail.

But while strengthening the fort itself they failed to fortify a little hill near. They had already much experience of the danger of heights commanding a town or fort. But they thought that this hill was too steep and rugged to be a danger. No cannon, it was said, could ever be dragged up to the top of it. When the British came, however, they thought otherwise. They at once saw the value of the hill, and determined that guns should be dragged up it. For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours they worked furiously, and when day dawned on the 5th of August both men and guns were on the summit. The American commander, St. Clair, saw them with despair in his heart. Every corner of the fort was commanded by the guns, and the garrison utterly at the mercy of the enemy.

The Austrian case against Serbia, as embodied in this Note, rested upon a secret investigation in the prison of Sarajevo.

While the _procureur-du-roi_, the commissary of police, and the examining magistrate were gathering all particulars for the basis of their action, the luckless des Vanneaulx picked up the broken pots and calculated from their capacity the sum lost. The magistrates admitted the correctness of their calculations and entered the sum stolen on their records as, in all probability, a thousand gold coins to each pot. But were these coins <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> or forty, twenty-four or twenty francs in value? All expectant heirs in Limoges sympathized with the des Vanneaulx. The Limousin imagination was greatly stirred by the spectacle of the broken pots.

We satisfied our horses, and rested a short time to have something to eat, not having had anything for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours. We bore North-West, and soon afterwards found a fine rock hole of water in granite rocks, sufficient to last the party a day. Plenty of water on rocks, also, from recent rain here. We were rejoiced, as we now had a place to bring the party to. But our good fortune did not end here: continuing on westerly or a little north of it, we came on a summer encampment of the natives, and found a native well or spring, which I believe would give water if dug out.

When he approached the grating he forgot everything. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours since he had seen Cosette; he was about to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, and he felt only a profound and unheard-of joy.

They were obliged to humbly admit, in the seclusion of their own councils, that it was to the obnoxious but energetic Britt that they owed their present and ever-growing comfort.

Britt's brain was a whirlpool of...", "...Division.\" When the first landing was made, this division, with the New Zealanders, penetrated to the top of Achi Baba, the hill that commanded the Narrows. For forty-eight hours the result was in doubt. The British attacked with bayonet and bombs, were driven back, and repeatedly reattacked. The New Zealanders finally succeeded in reaching the top, followed by the Eighty-eighth Brigade. The Irish fought on the tracks of a railroad that leads into Constantinople. At the end of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours of attacks and counter attacks, the position was considered secure. The worn-out soldiers were relieved and went into dugouts. Then the relieving troops were attacked by an overwhelming hostile force, and the hill was lost. A battery placed on that hill could have shelled the Narrows and opened to our ships the way to Constantinople. The hill was never retaken. When reinforcements came up it was too late. The reinforcements lost their way. In his report, General...", "...Assembly will have the power to distribute the school funds and the Governor will appoint the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

After the ordinary duties of examining the berths and bed-places, the crews had their suppers, and the officers went to their tea, and after this the men were allowed to amuse themselves with games of various kinds, as well as dancing and singing, until nine o'clock, when they had to turn in, and all lights were extinguished. The officers employed their evenings in reading and writing, with an occasional game of chess, or a tune on the flute or violin, until half-past ten. For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> days they were entirely deprived of a sight of the sun, the long-continued night being lighted up only partially by the moon and occasionally by the aurora borealis.

At a height of some three thousand feet, while it was still over French territory, the double balloon caught fire and fell flaming to the earth. The earliest balloon ascents in England followed close upon the French experiments. On the 25th of November 1783 Count Francesco Zambeccari sent up an oil-silk hydrogen balloon, ten feet in diameter, from the Artillery Ground in Moorfields; it travelled <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles, and fell at Petworth in Sussex. On the 22nd of February 1784 a balloon of five feet in diameter, liberated at Sandwich in Kent, travelled seventy-five miles, and after crossing the Channel, fell at Warneton in Flanders. To inflate a bag with gas and let it take its chance in the air is no great achievement, but these were flights of good promise. The first person in Great Britain to navigate the air was James Tytler, a Scot, who on the 27th of August 1784 ascended in...", "...method, which I suppose to be of weight with them.

Everybody knew that Snipe Lawton had little or no money of any kind, but few knew why. His own father had been dead many years. His mother had remarried when he was twelve years old, and between the boy and his step-father there was no love whatever. Nor was this the boy's fault. Open-hearted, affectionate, and of gentle nature, he had really tried to like and to...", "...and the aim good.

For many years I always wore this shirt beneath my cotton mail, and it saved my life more than once, for even bullets would not pierce the two of them. I had taken over the command of my archers but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, a scant time in which to teach them discipline whereof they had little, though they were brave enough, when the occasion came to use them in good earnest, and with it the night of disaster that is still known among the Spaniards as the noche triste.

The only thing here that evinces respect to the shade of that great man is an immense lamp, twelve feet in diameter, with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> burners; which was presented, in the twelfth century, by Barbarossa. It is of brass, gilt with gold, has the form of a crown, and is suspended from the ceiling above the marble stone by an iron chain about seventy feet in length. It is evident that some other monument had been erected to Charlemagne. There is nothing to convince us that this marble, bordered with brass, is of antiquity.

This petty advantage was dearly bought with the loss of lord Howe, who fell in the beginning of the action, unspeakably regretted as a young nobleman of the most promising talents, who had distinguished himself in a peculiar manner by his courage, activity, and rigid observation of military discipline, and had acquired the esteem and affection of the soldiery by his generosity, sweetness of manners, and engaging address.

Their home was a nondescript building, made of logs, eighteen feet wide and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> feet long. A partition, also made of logs, divided it into two rooms, one eighteen feet square in which the family lived, and the other eighteen by thirty feet, which was used for a school and assembly room. It had been a great task to erect that house. There were no teams, and all the logs had to be carried four miles by the Indians. It took thirty men to carry one log.

This torpedo was evidently seen from the submarine, as she submerged at once.

The wounded were transferred to the destroyers and the ship taken in tow, but she sank whilst in tow <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours later.

Thenceforward they journeyed without incident. The River of Doubt flowed into the larger river Madeira where they found a steamer which took them to Manaos on the Amazon. A regular line of steamers connects Manaos with New York, where Roosevelt and Kermit and Cherrie, one of the naturalists, landed on May 19, 1914.

The only radical difference between the two was that when I was permitted to quench my thirst that particular form of torture was alleviated for a few brief seconds, while the other was continuous and distracting almost to the point of being unendurable.

And I will--I will.\" MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD Surely Chance must be the damnedest conspirator against human happiness, or my darling could never have been allowed to suffer so much from the report that my ship was lost. What actually happened is easily told. Two days after we left Akaroa, N.Z., which was the last we saw of the world before we set our faces towards the Unknown, we ran into a heavy lumpy sea and made bad weather of it for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours. Going at good speed, however, we proceeded south on meridian 179 degrees E., latitude 68, when (just as we were sighting the Admiralty Mountains, our first glimpse of the regions of the Pole) we encountered a south-westerly gale, which, with our cumbersome deck cargo, made the handling of the ship difficult. Nevertheless the _Scotia_ rode bravely for several hours over the mountainous seas, though sometimes she rolled fifty degrees from side to side. Towards...", "...its imagination had been. I went deeper and deeper into the horror of great darkness, and I suppose that it was just that (namely, that my spirit knew that existence without God _was_ horror) which was my means of rescue. I still clung blindly and without hope to something that my whole mind denied. It was precisely in the same way that I telegraphed to you to come in March if you could. My mind knew for certain that you didn't care, but I did that. \"It was just about then that I had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours of the worst pain I had ever known.

I can't give you any idea of that, for it happened from outside me, just as dawn comes over the hills. And even while my physical anguish was at its worst, I lay here in a content as deep as that which I have now, with you sitting by me, and that delicious sense of physical lassitude which...", "...were in Paris, and besides, who could foresee the turn which affairs have taken? Could we imagine that an unfounded alarm would have removed from Essonne the corps of the Duke of Ragusa, who has this moment left us to bring his troops back to order?\" These words produced no change in the determination of the sovereigns, who would hear of nothing but the unconditional abdication of Napoleon. Before the Marshals took leave of the Emperor Alexander they solicited an armistice of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, which time they said was indispensable to negotiate the act of abdication with Napoleon. This request was granted without hesitation, and the Emperor Alexander, showing Macdonald a map of the environs of Paris, courteously presented him with a pencil, saying, \"Here, Marshal, mark yourself the limits to be observed by the two armies.\"--\"No, Sire,\" replied Macdonald, \"we are the conquered party, and it is for you to mark the line of demarcation.\" Alexander determined...", "...his father's features with eager, radiant eyes, until, convinced beyond a doubt, he could only murmur in a sort of ecstasy: \"My father, oh, God, my father!\" * * * * * The scene that ensued between father and son beggars description; but when the first transports of happiness had given place to a momentary calm, Father Richard said to his son: \"I will tell you my story in a few words, my dear Louis.

The first site was small and circumscribed, and in 1443 the existing site was with difficulty cleared of dwellings. The king designed a close connexion between this college and his other foundation at Eton; he provided for a provost and for seventy scholars, all of whom should be Etonians. In 1861 open scholarships were instituted, and the foundation now consists of a provost, forty-six fellows and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> scholars. Half the scholarships are still appropriated to Eton. An administrative arrangement peculiar to King's College is that by which the provost has absolute authority within its walls, to the exclusion of officers of the University.

Being the Interworld Corporation's local manager had more compensations than headaches, despite the rigid ritualism of native society. Since most of the local population was under his thumb, counter-espionage was miraculously effective. This fellow Johnson, for instance, had been in Vaornia less than three weeks, and despite the fact that he was an efficient and effective snoop, he had been fingered less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours after his arrival in the city. Kemmer closed his eyes and let a smile cross his keen features. Under his administration, there would be a sharp rise in the mortality curve for spies detected in the Vaornia-Lagash-Timargh triangle.

And as for spies, they knew the chances they took and what the penalty could be for interfering...", "...from London of some winter costumes on approval, Victoria's maid had arranged for the little Italian a picturesque dress of dark blue silk, from a gown of her mistress', by which the emaciation of the girl's small frame was somewhat disguised; while the beauty of the material, and of the delicate embroideries on the collar and sleeves, strangely heightened the grace of her curly head, and the effect of her astonishing eyes, so liquidly bright, in a face too slight for them. In <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, even, of comfort and cosseting her elfish thinness had become a shade less ghastly; and the self-possession which had emerged from the state of collapse in which she had arrived amazed Victoria.

A brilliant description of it had interested the civilised world immensely for about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours; the appalling retrogression was still used occasionally as the text for violent denunciations by the poorly educated; the well-educated had ceased to do anything but take for granted that superstition and progress were irreconcilable enemies.

After blistering a horse, his head must be tied up for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours at least, to prevent his getting at the irritated part. _Shoe boils_ are usually caused by the pressure of the shoe when the horse lies down. The boil should be opened and drained and a three per cent solution of zinc sulphate injected. The horse must then wear a shoe-boil boot at night.

No amount of armament we know now will prevent war. It can be prevented only by a definite concord of the nations brought finally to realise the futility of war.

At the present time it is held to be oxygen condensed. To use a chemical phrase, the molecule of oxygen, which in the ordinary state is composed of two atoms, is condensed, in ozone, as three atoms. By the electric spark discharged in dry oxygen as much as 15 per cent. may, under proper conditions, be turned into ozone. Ozone has also been found to be heavier than air. Professor Zinno says, that compared with an equal volume of air its density is equal to 1,658, and that it is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> times heavier than hydrogen. Heat decomposes it; at the temperature of boiling water it begins to decompose. In water it is much less soluble than oxygen, and indeed is practically insoluble; when made to bubble through boiling water, it ceases to be ozone. The oxidizing power of ozone is very much greater than that of oxygen, and, according to Saret, when ozone is decomposed, one part of it enters into combination, the other remains simply as oxygen.

For this reason a battleship needs other protection than that imparted by its cellular subdivision. This is given by its \"torpedo defense battery\" of minor guns of about 5-inch calibre. By reason of the great vulnerability of all ships to attack below the water-line, the torpedo was invented and developed.

Then the House swung into the channel, and went plowing ahead upon the business of the session, and in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, Mr. Hawke, forgotten, had ceased to be important to any save himself. The whole of that first Monday night Speaker Frost put in with Senator Hanway, in the latter's study, revising committee lists and settling chairmanships with the purpose of advancing the White House chances of Senator Hanway and destroying those of Governor Obstinate.

It will of course be in my power to mention only a few instances. In 1484, Pope Innocent the Eighth issued a bull encouraging and requiring the arrest and punishment of persons suspected of witchcraft. From this moment, the prosecutions became frequent and the victims numerous in every country. The very next year, forty-one aged females were consigned to the flames in one nation; and, not long after, a hundred were burned by one inquisition in the devoted valleys of Piedmont; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> were burned in Ravensburg in five years; and, in the year 1515, five hundred were burned at Geneva in three months! One writer declares that \"almost an infinite number\" were burned for witchcraft in France,--a thousand in a single diocese!

It was soon perceived that there was no kind of difficulty in clearing the Church of heretics by hanging or burning them all as...", "...catalogue of _Fifteeners_--preparatory to the sale of their Duplicates.

Here opiates seem to me rarely to do good. They do not hinder the migrations of the round bacteria, there is rarely pain to relieve, and I have sometimes thought that their administration was simply the addition of a second poison to the one which already was overwhelming the nervous system. In pelvic peritonitis, in the course of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours plastic exudation is thrown out and the pain to a great extent subsides. From this time very moderate doses of opium, as a rule, are needed to make the patient comfortable. In France leeches applied to the abdomen are much used as a means of relieving peritoneal sensitiveness. That they do this is beyond question. {1032} Their disuse in this country is due probably more to popular prejudice than to their inefficacy.

Solalay thought he could find the boy and send him to them to be used as a courier. Blakely's opportune coming had cheered not a little the flagging defense, but, not until <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours thereafter, by which time their condition had become almost desperate and the foe almost daring, did the lithe, big-eyed, swarthy little Apache reach them. Blakely knew him instantly, wrote his dispatch and bade the boy go with all speed, with the result we know. \"Three more of our party are wounded,\" he had written, but had not chosen to say that one of them was himself. A solemn sight was this that met the eyes of the Bugologist, as Carmody roused him from a...", "...into line and flew off in pursuit of the Boches. They had nothing but what was on their backs--and ammunition, of course. The result was that they had forty-eight hours of real suffering. It was harder on the officers than on the men, and hardest of all on the horses. All the soldiers always have a bidon with something in it to drink, and almost invariably they have a bite or so in their sacks. No officer ever has anything on him, and none of them carries a bidon except on a march. For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours in the chase they suffered from hunger, and, what was worse still, from thirst. As the weather was nasty and they were without shelters of any kind--not even tents--they tasted all the hardships of war. This must comfort the foot soldiers, who are eternally grumbling at the cavalry. However, the officer who brought back the news says the men bore it with philosophical gaiety, even those who on the last day had nothing as well as those who in forty-eight hours had a...", "...view of this exposition of national traits. Followed by two or three of the guard, Mr. Hatton had obediently hastened to quell the tumult of lamentation, but by the time he reached the nearest shanty the infection had spread throughout the entire community, and--women and children alike--the whole populace was weeping, wailing, and gnashing its teeth,--and no one knew or cared to know exactly why. Having been wrought up to a pitch of excitement by the rumors and rapid moves of the past <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, nothing short of a massacre could now quite satisfy Sudstown's lust for the sensational, and, defrauded of the actual cause for universal bewailing, was none the less determined to indulge in the full effect.

The first method is bulking larger every day, especially in country districts and in camps. The _modus operandi_ is simplicity itself. The fly lives and moves and has its being in dirt. It breeds in dirt and it feeds on food, and, as it never wipes its feet, the interesting results can be imagined. Just to dispel any possible doubt, plates of gelatine have been exposed where flies could walk on them, then placed in an incubator, and within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours there was a clearly recorded track of the footprints of the flies written in clumps of bacilli sown by their filthy feet. More definitely, flies have been caught in the houses of typhoid patients, put under the microscope, and their feet, stomachs, and specks found swarming with typhoid bacilli.

After four days of bombardment by sea and land, and from the air, and a rapid series of what can only be described as wholesale butcheries, the ancient capital of the Sultan shared the fate of Berlin and Vienna, and after four centuries and a half the Turkish dominion in Europe died in its first stronghold.

It was only his miserable wounded body, that the vessel was carrying to a...", "...from Canada of L4600 per annum. The course of conveyance across the territory of the United States was to be, in summer, from Boston to Burlington, Vermont, towards which a railway line was approaching completion, and from Burlington to St. Johns by steamer on lake Champlain.

The time occupied would, under usual conditions, be <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours between Boston and St. Johns, and fifty-three hours between Boston and Highgate. Thus was the great experiment brought to its appointed end. It had its origin in one of those imperial impulses, which seem to come most frequently from the colonies, and which now and then carry the Briton off his feet. But, as conditions stood, the scheme was foredoomed to failure. It was not until the construction of the Canadian Pacific railway in 1889, across the state of Maine...", "...but a general consternation and mutual diffidence and dissension prevailed. The governors of one province refused to march to the assistance of another, and were at last terrified from assembling their forces for the defence of their own province.

And the only expedient in which the English agreed was the base and imprudent one of buying a new peace from the Danes, by the payment of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> thousand pounds. This measure did not bring them even that short interval of repose which they had expected from it. The Danes, disregarding all engagements, continued their devastations and hostilities; levied a new contribution of eight thousand pounds upon the county of Kent alone; murdered the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had refused to countenance this exaction; and the English nobility found no other resource than that of submitting everywhere to the Danish...", "...other guests--a stout manufacturer and his wife, the latter gorgeously dressed, but with scarcely a word to say for herself.

Paul had suffered a good deal from conflicting emotions after the visit to Van Klopen's, and more than once regretted the adhesion that he had given to Mascarin's scheme; but a visit the next day from Hortebise, and the knowledge that the fashionable physician was one of the confederates, had reconciled him to the position he had promised to assume.

Ninety full-grown insects weigh some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> grains, and there is a great reduction by drying; some 27,000 yield one pound of the prepared cochineal. The shiny black cochineal, which looks like small beetles, is produced by sun-drying, and by shaking the insect in a linen bag or in a small 'merry-go-round,' so as to remove the white powder.

This Siegerscht was most certainly the oldest lieutenant in the whole Russian Army.

He was a widower, with four little children and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> roubles a month, on which sum, strangely enough, he managed to get along. It was his practice to hire large flats which he afterwards, in turn, let out to his brother officers. He took in boarders, fattened and sold fowls and turkeys, and no one understood better than he how to purchase wood and other necessaries cheap and at the right time.

The original panel of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> men contained only four who had not expressed opinions unfavorable to the prisoner, and of these four all but one admitted some degree of prejudice against him. These four were nevertheless accepted as jurors. A second panel was then summoned which was even more unpromising in its make-up, and Burr's counsel began hinting that the trial would have to be quashed, when Burr himself arose and offered to select eight out of the whole venire to add to the four previously chosen....", "...struck the midnight hour, we steamed out of the harbor, the lamps from the light-house throwing a bright glare upon our deck, as we passed under its shadow, close enough to \"have tossed a biscuit\" to the keeper; so bold is the entrance of the little river.

The malarial mosquito bites and then goes back to some dark corner where it remains quiescent for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, at the end of which time it again descends to feed. Contrary to the general opinion mosquitoes bite many times, and frequently remain alive for months--the malarial mosquito particularly living in cellars and attics oftentimes throughout the entire winter.

I think the exigency for such reduction is imperative, and again urge it upon the consideration of Congress. The amount of reduction, as well as the manner of effecting it, are questions of great and general interest, it being essential to industrial enterprise and the public prosperity, as well as the dictate of obvious justice, that the burden of taxation be made to rest as equally as possible upon all classes and all sections and interests of...", "...beauty of Rachel, the fidelity of Rebecca, the modesty of Susanna, the piety of Tabitha, the warm affections of Ruth, and the high morals of Anna.

A creepy souvenir of this fight lies on a little table in the Salle d'honneur--an embalmed human hand. It is the hand of Captain Danjou, who was in command of a detachment of sixty men from the third company of the Legion who were killed to a man at Camaron.

These phenomena of salicylism are in great measure proportionate to the dose employed, but they have followed moderate {57} doses, owing sometimes to idiosyncrasy, and perhaps frequently to retarded elimination consequent upon previous disease of the kidneys or disturbance of their function by the salicylic acid or its salt. Those agents are usually completely excreted in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, but in one of Powell's[165] cases elimination was not completed before the fifth day, and not before the eighth in Byanow's case.[166] Possibly uraemia may in some cases cause the delirium.[167] The delirium, which may be violent or not, is often preceded by dryness of the tongue, restlessness, and rapid breathing. Impurities in the acid may account for the inconstancy with which delirium has been noticed by different observers. While but 2 instances in 82 cases were...", "...privates and the noncommissioned officers proved to be true. There was fighting that day near Maubeuge-- hard fighting and plenty of it; but, though we got within five miles of it, and heard the guns and saw the smoke from them, we were destined not to get there. Strung out, with the bicycles in front, we went down the straight white road that ran toward the frontier. After an hour or two of steady going we began to notice signs of the retreat that had trailed through this section <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours before. We picked up a torn shoulder strap, evidently of French workmanship, which had 13 embroidered on it in faded red tape; and we found, behind the trunk of a tree, a knapsack, new but empty, which was too light to have been part of a German soldier's equipment. We thought it was French; but now I think it must have been Belgian, because, as we subsequently discovered, a few scattering detachments of the Belgian foot soldiers who fled from Brussels on the eve...", "...the miners' claims at law, which of late they had been obliged to do in the Court of Exchequer against Mr. Beck and others.

An examination of the original document shows this order to have been signed by one person writing down the names of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> free miners, since they all exhibit the same hand-writing. The _seventh_ of the orders still extant reports the Court of the Mine to have been held at Clearwell on the 5th of April, 1687, before William Wolseley, Esq., and commences by stating that more money was wanted for legal purposes, and that every miner must pay two shillings, with two shillings besides for every mine-horse, towards meeting them.

The corn duty was reduced to meet the emergency, but the disturbed area extended to Naples, Foggia, Bari, Minervino-Murge, Molfetta and thence along the line of railway which skirts the Adriatic coast. At Faenza, Piacenza, Cremona, Pavia and Milan, where subversive associations were stronger, it assumed the complexion of a political revolt. From the 7th to the 9th of May Milan remained practically in the hands of the mob. A palace was sacked, barricades were erected and for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours the troops under General Bava-Beccaris, notwithstanding the employment of artillery, were unable to restore order. In view of these occurrences, Rudini authorized the proclamation of a state of siege at Milan, Florence, Leghorn and Naples, delegating the suppression of disorder to special military commissioners. By these means order was restored, though not without considerable loss of life at Milan and elsewhere. At Milan alone the official returns confessed to...", "...of you gentleman make the attempt?\" M.

Mr. Buchanan was within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours of the close of his term and he promptly and cheerfully signed the bill. He had by this time become not only emancipated from Southern thraldom but in some degree embittered against Southern men, and could therefore readily disregard objections from that source.

Overtime is paid time and a half, and women are fined a penny for being late. Firm No. 2 employed at one time about two dozen girls in the composing-rooms. They were engaged solely on solid newspaper work, and never in the higher branches of the trade, such as \"displaying.\" Seats were provided for them. They worked a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hour week for a \"stab\" wage of 15_s._ or 16_s._, and had three weeks' holiday, off and on, for which they were paid. Further, they were never turned away in slack time. But the experiment was not altogether a success, and by to-day the two dozen have dwindled down to two, who set for newspapers and get 16_s._ a week.

In addition to this Rochester interest, Mr. McDuffee was one of the original grantees of the Dover National Bank, and for a short time was a director; but his interest became more in the Strafford Bank, at Dover, of which (new charter) he was the second heaviest stockholder, Daniel M.

This can be accomplished by placing the animal in a very narrow stall, carrying his feed and drinking water for a month or six weeks, and apply the following ointment: Red Iodide of Mercury, two drams; Pulverized Cantharides, three drams; Turpentine, thirty minims; Pine Tar, two drams; lard, two ounces. Mix well and rub in well for twenty minutes every <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours until three applications have been applied.

To cure a bone spavin it is necessary to unite two or more bones of the hock, and a fractured bone cannot unite if moved frequently.

The other plants turned to nettles and weeds, and died. Marius remained only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours at Vernon.

He then became professor in Marburg, but was afterwards recalled to Prussia by Frederic II. immediately upon his accession to the throne. He was subsequently made baron, and died 1754.

But as he went off, he said half aloud,-- \"And that report is going to give you some trouble, my good man.\" The report was ready then, and his reason for not giving it in, was that he thought, the longer he could delay it, the more chance he would probably have to defeat the plan of the prosecution. \"As I mean to keep it two days longer,\" he thought on his way home, \"why should I not show it to...", "...eggs of the first eleven months are always those of workers, it is evident that those which appear first are also the eggs that come soonest to maturity.

The bull had been imported from Alderney for several months. About a month after--namely, on the 29th of July--a cow in calf was attacked with unusual symptoms. She was separated from the rest; nourishing drinks were administered; but having calved, she died <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours after the first symptoms were observed. This led to the belief that she died of the disease which then began to prevail.

Hove the lead and got <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> fathoms; looked on the chart, and sure enough this depth of water showed that we were right where the captain said we were. Another idea. For ages man probably did not know why God carpeted the ocean bottom with sand in one place, shells in another, and so on.

In the black pit of the crater the yellow torches of the work crew played over the body of the rocket, making it appear like some gargantuan monster pulled from the depths of the sea.

The cables would be let out, slowly, allowing the rocket to descend into the depths of the crevice.

It was also easy to see that it was to be no <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> year campaign before the question must be adjudicated. The Hon.

We are told that the trees in the park were planted according to the position of the troops at Blenheim. The architect of the palace was John Vanbrugh, of whom the satirical epitaph was written: \"Lie heavy on him, Earth, for he Laid many a heavy load on thee.\" The palace is a massive structure, with spacious portals and lofty towers, and its principal front, which faces the north, extends three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> feet from wing to wing, with a portico and flight of steps in the centre. The interior is very fine, with magnificently-painted ceilings, tapestries, statuary, and a rare collection of pictures. The tapestries represent Blenheim and other battles, and there are one hundred and twenty copies of famous masters, made by Teniers. A stately statue of Queen Anne stands in the library. There are costly collections of enamels, plaques, and miniatures; on the walls are huge...", "...good as told me I wasn't fit to black Ashforth's boots.\" \"Anyhow he wouldn't have--have--have tried to make a girl care for him when he knew she cared for somebody else.\" \"Hang it, it seems to me Ashforth isn't exactly immaculate.

Then Charlie remarked, with a reproachful glance at Dora's averted face, \"And this is the sequel to Avignon! I shouldn't have thought a girl could change so in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours.\" Dora said nothing. She held her head very high in the air and looked straight in front of her. \"When you gave me that kiss----\" resumed Charlie. Now this form of expression was undoubtedly ambiguous; to give a kiss may mean: 1. What it literally says--to bestow a kiss. 2. To offer one's self to be kissed. 3. To accept willingly a proffered kiss; and, without much straining of words, 4.

Then, too, Jimmieboy had a new sled he wanted to try, but best of all, his father had promised to make him a snowman, with shoe-buttons for eyes and a battered old hat on his head, if perchance there could be...", "...was promoted to the rink of captain. On the frigate _George Washington_ he sailed to the Dey of Algiers with presents. These \"presents\" were bribes which the United States paid to the Algerian pirates to secure exemption from capture for its merchant ships in the Mediterranean. Bainbridge was disgusted at having to pay the tributes. While his ship was at Algiers war was declared by the pirates against France, and the French consul and citizens were ordered to leave the country in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours. Captain Bainbridge received them all on his ship and landed them safely. When the United States found that bribes to the pirates did not protect their commerce, they decided to use force. Captain Bainbridge was given command of the frigate _Philadelphia_, and sailing to Algiers, blockaded Tripoli. Being driven from his cruising grounds, Bainbridge pursued a strange ship that was trying to break the blockade. He gave chase, but ran upon a reef on the morning of...", "...the abounding success--financially--of the blue-glass cure, the faith cure, and of science healing. The Rain Water Doctor worked wondrous miracles, and did a vast and lucrative business until he was unluckily drowned in a hogshead of his own medicine at his own door.

A quart of tar steeped for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours in a gallon of water, tainted the water enough to make it fit for dosing.

The strength of four fine horses whirled each light, two-wheeled chariot over the hard causeway as though it were a toy.

As regards shipments from Detroit to Boston, via the Grand Trunk, the matter is worse, for we have to add one hundred and three miles from Portland to Boston, making the old route two hundred and fifty-three miles shorter to that point than by the newly opened road.

Following the advice given, he washed himself in a mud paste, allowing the mud to dry on him at the heat of the fire. Later he washed the mud off and used some heavily scented toilet soap, and thus removed the worst of the odor from his person.

He was now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> years of age, but if he had survived forty-eight more he could never have surpassed that eloquence or exceeded that service to the nation, for he never could have found another like occasion for the use of his astounding powers. He died at Chicago, June 3, 1861. Trumbull's eulogy was solemn, sincere, pathetic, and impressive--a model of good taste in every way. He retracted nothing, but, ignoring past differences, he gave an abounding and heartfelt tribute of praise to...", "...some of the chiefs, and Arabi and his confederates waited on him. They went as his enemies in fear and trembling, and left as his friends; seventy native officers were, in one day, made lieutenant-colonels, including Arabi and his companions. Arabi, in addition, received the high honour of having one of the Khedivial slaves as his wife. When the question of the deposition of Ismail came to the front, Arabi took a formal oath to defend him with his life, but this did not prevent him, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours after, going to do obeisance to Tewfik as the new Khedive of Egypt. The latter let it be known that there was a tacit amnesty for the past, and made Arabi a full colonel. Of Arabi's mental gifts it is impossible to form a high estimate. Ignorant of any language but his own, his forte seemed to be the enunciating of any number of quotations from the Koran, quite regardless of their relevancy. He had, however, original ideas at times, and must be credited, at all...", "...Marshals were in Paris, and besides, who could foresee the turn which affairs have taken? Could we imagine that an unfounded alarm would have removed from Essonne the corps of the Duke of Ragusa, who has this moment left us to bring his troops back to order?\" These words produced no change in the determination of the sovereigns, who would hear of nothing but the unconditional abdication of Napoleon. Before the Marshals took leave of the Emperor Alexander they solicited an armistice of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, which time they said was indispensable to negotiate the act of abdication with Napoleon. This request was granted without hesitation, and the Emperor Alexander, showing Macdonald a map of the environs of Paris, courteously presented him with a pencil, saying, \"Here, Marshal, mark yourself the limits to be observed by the two armies.\"--\"No, Sire,\" replied Macdonald, \"we are the conquered party, and it is for you to mark the line of demarcation.\" Alexander determined...", "...He had shared with me the walk from the inn to the garden, and the petty annoyances that had then filled my thoughts. He had faced them with me, and bravely; and this late association, and the picture of him as he walked beside me, full of life and coarse wrath, rose up now and cried out against his death; cried out that it was impossible. So that it seemed horrible to me, and I shook with fear, and loathed the man whose hand had done it. Nor was that all. I had known Hugues barely <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, my liking for him was only an hour born; but I had his story. I could follow him going about to borrow the small sum of money he had possessed. I could trace the hopes he had built on it. I could see him coming here full of honest courage, believing that he had found an opening; a man strong, confident, looking forward, full of plans. And then of all, this was the end! He had hoped, he had purposed; and on the other side of the Cathedral, he lay stark--stark and dead...", "...the part that his corps had taken was almost entirely neglected. The Marshal's letter to his wife showed that he was vexed beyond words with his treatment by Napoleon, and he started out in the worst of tempers to support Murat. But he was too keen a soldier to let his personal grievances interfere with his active work, and, although he gave vent to his spleen in the usual recriminations, he performed his work to admiration. So hard did he push his infantry, marching sixty miles in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, that he was never more than five miles behind the light cavalry, and it was owing to his effective support that, on October 28th, Murat was able to surround Hohenlohe and force him to surrender at Prinzlow. But, in spite of this, Murat in his despatch never mentioned the name of Lannes. It took all Napoleon's tact to smooth the Marshal's ruffled temper, and it was only the prospect of further action which ultimately prevented him from throwing up his command in high...", "...pillory he was mercilessly pelted, and nearly torn to pieces. His first flogging was executed rigorously in the presence of a vast crowd, and Oates, a man of strong frame, long stood the lash without a murmur. \"But at last his stubborn fortitude gave way.

When he was unbound it seemed he had borne as much as the human frame could bear without dissolution....

And as a proof of his attachment to _them_,--shortly after he had left Brooke for Yarmouth, being then only thirteen years old, he borrowed his father's horse, and rode a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles in one day, to pay, unknown to his parents, a visit to a girl of his own age, a Miss Wordsworth, the daughter of a clergyman residing in a village near that which the Coopers had quitted for Yarmouth.

He trusts Verona to 3000 men, and the blockade of Mantua to Kilmaine, and the defence of Rivoli to Vaubois--the weakest link in the chain--and determines to manoeuvre by the Lower Adige upon the Austrian communications. He gets <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours' start, and wins Arcola; in 1814 he deserved equal success, but bad luck and treachery turned the scale. The battle of Arcola lasted seventy-two hours, and for forty-eight hours was in favour of the Austrians. Pending the arrival of the promised reinforcements, the battle was bought too dear, and weakened Bonaparte more than the Austrians, who received new troops almost daily.

On the west side were the outworks, consisting of a platform with a trench half a mile in length, and breastworks, and covered ways, and mounds. The roofs of the building were bordered with parapets, guard walks, and sentry boxes. But the whole space was not appropriated to works intended to ensure the stronghold against the assault of foes. Near the mound was the chapel dedicated to St. Giles. Under the outer wall was a military walk, five yards wide, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> yards in length. Underneath the walls, on the brink of the river, was a beautiful terrace, called the Maiden's Walk, where the lady of the castle and her damsels, after their labours at the loom, were wont to take air and exercise on a summer evening, ere the vesper bell rang, and the bat began to hunt the moth.

The former then took his place at the helm, and the latter seated himself amidships, both eager to hear the story of the captain. It was fortunate for them that the old Blowout was a very heavy sailer; otherwise they could not have obtained the whole of the story, which was long and very interesting and exciting. We have not space to repeat the story, but it was all about a shipwreck, and clinging to a broken spar for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, without food or water, and being rescued when life was nearly gone. \"So you see, Paul, I should have been very comfortable even in a worse boat than yours,\" added the story-teller, as he completed his narrative. \"I should like to be shipwrecked once,\" said John, musing. \"Should you, my fine fellow?\" exclaimed the captain. \"I should, sir, just to see how it would seem.\" \"It would seem very uncomfortable, my boy; and I recommend you never to express such a...", "...together as one nation. In the council held at Sangeeny, where were convened Indian chiefs from lakes St. Clare, Samcoe, Huron, Ontario, and Rice, and other lakes, it was proposed to devise a plan by which the tract owned by the Sangeenys could be held for the benefit of the Ojebwas, to petition Government for aid in establishing a manual-labour school, and to ascertain the general feeling of the chiefs in relation to forming one large settlement at Owen's Sound. At this meeting <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> chiefs were assembled. There is much to admire in the simple, earnest, and courteous style of the oration delivered by Chief John Jones, and will give to my readers some idea of the intelligence of an educated Indian:-- \"Brothers, you have been called from all your parts of Canada, even from the north of Georgian Bay. You are from your homes, your wives, and your children. We might regret this, were it not for the circumstances that require you here. \"Fellow-chiefs...", "...Mr. Crawshay,\" he sighed. \"Up to the present no,\" the former admitted. \"Yet I can promise you one thing, sir.

I was a member of one of the battalions of the 23d. We boarded the \"Leon\" under a Spanish crew and sailed under the Spanish flag. The \"Leon\" was a large vessel of rapid speed, and made the run from Manila to the Island of Jolo in a little more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, a distance of 800 miles south of Manila. Land was in sight almost the entire voyage. We passed through straits and seas, by Iloilo on the Island of Panay, Cebu, Negros Island, through the sea of Jolo to Zamboanga on the Island of Mindanao, and to Jolo. The group of islands forming the Sulu Archipelago is the southern islands of the Philippines. The \"Leon\" sailed into the Jolo Bay in the evening on the nineteenth of May. A large force of Spanish soldiers was stationed...", "...Wilbur twin searched, but it was the most arid of formalities. \"No, sir; I spent it all.\" \"Spent all his money!\" remarked the dog seller with a kind of pitying contempt, and drew off toward the door.

He was alone at the counter now, Merle having joined the withdrawn courtiers. \"I'm a fair trader,\" said Solly Gumble. \"I can take--I give.

He delivered these to the Dey, and in accordance with them, the Dey immediately declared war on France, and notified all the French in Algiers that if they had not left his dominions within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, they would be sold into slavery. There was no French ship in the harbor, and it looked, for a time, as though, the French would not be able to get away, but as soon as he learned of their predicament, Bainbridge gathered them together and took them over to Spain--an act for which he received the personal thanks of Napoleon Bonaparte. Bainbridge was, of course, glad to get away from Algiers, but he had by no means seen the last of the Barbary pirates.

The last was given to the assessor and myself, with forty-nine men. After the provisions and clothes had been taken in, not over a span of the gunwales remained above water; and more than this, the boats were so crowded that we could not move: so much can necessity do, which drove us to hazard our lives in this manner, running into a turbulent sea, not a single one who went having a...", "...sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend.

In the first rank did ride forty-eight in the likeness and habit of Esquires, two and two together, clothed in red coats and gowns of say or sandal, with comely visors on their faces; after them came <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> Knights, in the same livery of colour and stuff; then followed one richly arrayed like an Emperor; and, after him some distance, one stately attired like a Pope, whom followed twenty-four Cardinals; and, after them, eight or ten with black visors, not amiable, as if they had been legates from some foreign princes.

But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> thousand pins in a day. Each person, therefore, making a tenth part of forty-eight thousand pins, might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day. But if they had all wrought separately and independently, and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business, they certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day; that is, certainly, not the two hundred and fortieth, perhaps not the four thousand eight...", "...20.

The calcined Magnesia and bile emitted a sweetish smell, something resembling that of the urine in a diabetes: the liquor which swam above was quite pellucid and colourless, whereas that of the other Magnesia was turbid and tinged green with the bile.

Afterward he was employed in a law office, and still later we find him in a clothing store at a salary of $1.50 per week.

He called the tribesmen to arms, formally declared war, swept down on the plains, destroyed the French cantonments, agricultural establishments, and outposts; slew many colonists, burned the villages and drove panic-stricken fugitives headlong into the city of Algiers. The French Government then ostentatiously declared the adoption of a firm policy and...", "...of my disgust and I once more tried to get forward. \"I know the property, sir, for thirty-eight years I was over it.

It was called _Asiento_ because the Spanish Government _let_, or farmed by _treaty_, the privilege of supplying its colonies with slaves. The two principal articles of this contract, which was to expire in 1712, related to the number of negroes and the rent of the privilege. If the war continued, the French Company was bound to furnish Spain with thirty-eight thousand negroes during the ten years of the contract, but in case of peace, with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> thousand. Each negro that the Company could procure was let to it for 33-1/3 piastres, in pieces of India. In consequence of this treaty, the ports of Chili and Peru, and those in the South Sea, from which all other nations were excluded, stood open to the French, who carried into them vast quantities of merchandise besides the slaves, and brought home great sums in coin and bars. The raw gold and silver alone which they imported for the year 1709 was reckoned at thirty...", "...martyrdom. And the king then took a little of his blood and laid it on his eye, and said: In the name of God and of St. Christopher! and was anon healed. Then the king believed in God, and gave commandment that if any person blamed God or St. Christopher, he should anon be slain with the sword. Ambrose saith in his preface thus, of this holy martyr: Lord, thou hast given to Christopher so great plenty of virtues, and such grace of doctrine, that he called from the error of Paynims <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> thousand men, to the honor of Christian faith, by his shining miracles.

And with that, one of the arrows smote out the eye of the tyrant, to whom the blood of the holy martyr re-established his sight, and enlumined him in taking away the...", "...said antiquarians--the one living example of the old days. Here were to be seen the ancient inconveniences, the insanitary horrors, the incarnation of a world given over to dreaming. The old Church pomp was back, too; the cardinals drove again in gilt coaches; the Pope rode on his white mule; the Blessed Sacrament went through the ill-smelling streets with the sound of bells and the light of lanterns. A brilliant description of it had interested the civilised world immensely for about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours; the appalling retrogression was still used occasionally as the text for violent denunciations by the poorly educated; the well-educated had ceased to do anything but take for granted that superstition and progress were irreconcilable enemies.

Indiscriminately, four hundred people of all sorts of beliefs--Republicans, trade unionists, Socialists, Free Masons, as well as Anarchists--had been cast into dungeons and tortured in the infamous \"zero.\" Is it a wonder that most of them came out Anarchists? There were twenty-eight in the first lot that we met at Euston Station that August afternoon,--homeless wanderers in the whirlpool of London, released without trial after months of imprisonment, and ordered to leave Spain in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours! They had left it, singing their prison songs; and still across their dark and sorrowful eyes one could see the eternal Maytime bloom. They drifted away to South America chiefly, where four or five new Anarchist papers have since arisen, and several colonizing experiments along Anarchist lines are being tried. So tyranny defeats itself, and the exile becomes the seed-sower of the revolution. And not only to the heretofore unaroused does he bring awakening, but the...", "...gang, as well as by French Canadians who had suffered from the robberies of Bigot and his like, decided to sacrifice everything but his indispensable fixed salary in order that even the most malicious critics could not bring any accusation, however false, against the man who represented Britain and her king. An interesting personal interlude, which was not without considerable effect on Canadian history, took place in the middle of Carleton's four years' stay in England. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> and still a bachelor. Tradition whispers that these long years of single life were the result of a disappointing love affair with Jane Carleton, a pretty cousin, when both he and she were young. However that may be, he now proposed to Lady Anne Howard, whose father, the Earl of Effingham, was one of his greatest friends. But he was doomed to a second, though doubtless very minor, disappointment. Lady Anne, who probably looked on 'grave Carleton' as a sort of amiable,...", "...about Miss Carew--that her play was so feminine she must have done it with crochet needles?

Although I had naturally discussed matters with others in the camp in an indefinite way I had not arranged any collaboration in the scheme, by which I succeeded. I told only one friend ten minutes before I took the first steps in the carrying out of the plan. When first we reached Schwarmstedt after our journey from Crefeld, there were several weak spots in the \"ring\" of precautions against escape which surrounded it. Within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours of our arrival three officers got out of the camp. They had very bad luck, being caught after eleven days' travel, about three-quarters of the way to the Dutch frontier. This loophole was of course closed to further attempts by the measures now adopted by the Boches. However, two more got away from the camp not long afterwards and had the same atrocious luck after going about the same distance.

In the meanwhile he was content to wait. The hours sped by and there was no news yet of that elusive Pimpernel. Of Marguerite he knew nothing save that she was well guarded; the sentry who passed up and down outside room No. 6 had heard her voice and that of the Abbe Foucquet, in the course of the afternoon. Chauvelin had asked the Committee of Public Safety for aid in his difficult task, but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours at least must elapse before such aid could reach him. Forty-eight hours, during which the hand of an assassin might be lurking for him, and might even reach him ere his vengeance was fully accomplished.

A portion of the Mount Nelson Light Horse, however, was still missing; but the brigadier did not worry about them, and felt himself complete, as he took the precaution to issue orders that he was about to proceed by rail to Jagersfontein Road. But, as the narrative of the next <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours is to show, the military system prevailing in South Africa was such that it was only by a miracle that the most sagacious of leaders were able to accomplish any exceptional result by strategy.

It must be borne in mind that the Boers at this period of the campaign had the most perfect system of intelligence.

YORK From a cabin back in the mountains of Tennessee, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> miles from the railroad, a young man went to the World War. He was untutored in the ways of the world. Caught by the enemy in the cove of a hill in the Forest of Argonne, he did not run; but sank into the bushes and single-handed fought a battalion of German machine gunners until he made them come down that hill to him with their hands in air. There were one hundred and thirty-two of them left, and he marched them, prisoners, into the American line. Marshal Foch, in...", "...as he had intended, an attack which should have defeated the Prussians before him, Wellington's error and delay would have paid a very heavy price. As it was, Napoleon's own delay in crossing the Sambre made Wellington's mistake and tardiness bear no disastrous fruit. The Duke failed to succour the Prussians. His troops, scattered all over Western Belgium, did not come up in time to prevent the defeat of his allies at Ligny. But he held his own at Quatre Bras; and in the final battle, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours later, the genius with which he handled his raw troops upon the ridge of Mont St Jean wiped out and negatived all his strategical misconceptions of the previous days. From this confusion, this partial delay and error upon Napoleon's part, this ignorance upon Wellington's of what was toward, both of which marked Thursday the 15th, we must turn to a detailed description of that morrow, Friday the 16th, which, though it is less remembered in history than the crowning...", "...to send another dispatch at daylight in the morning.' \"My audience will readily understand what cause for grief I had when the dispatch is read.

She had, indeed, the decided but tolerant temperament that goes with a good deal of profile, fair hair, and greenish eyes.

Indeed, that celebrated animal, owned as he was by a pillar of the turf, who had secretly laid many thousands against him, had not even started.

When a shipload of Maine timber was needed at the Portsmouth navy-yard, to be converted into a new man-of-war, to Capt. Fernald was assigned the task of bringing it down from Portland past the British frigates, that were ever on the watch for just such cargoes. When the preparations for the building of the seventy-four-gun ship \"Washington\" were making at the navy-yard, Capt. Fernald was sent to Portsmouth for a load of ship's-timber. His cargo was to consist of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> \"knees\" and the breast-hook of the seventy-four. Loaded down with this burden, the schooner \"Sally\" left Portland, and headed for her destination. Caution led her captain to keep his craft close to the shore, and for a day or two she crept along the coast without being discovered. But head-winds and calms delayed the \"Sally,\" and on her fourth day out she was sighted by the British frigate \"Tenedos.\" The \"Sally\" was not an imposing craft, and under ordinary circumstances...", "...the nomadic habits of our people, the alternations of climate, the vicissitudes of trade, the prevalence of spasmodic and superficial excitements, the boundless passion for gain, the local changes, the family separations, and the incessant fevers of opinion, scatter the holy fire of love, reverence, self-respect, contemplation, and faith.

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL Such is the conclusion of a history which I cannot expect everybody to believe, for some people will believe nothing against the testimony of their own experience. However, I am indifferent to their incredulity, and they may believe as much or as little as they please. The Stromboliotes received us kindly as shipwrecked mariners. They gave us food and clothing. After waiting <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours, on the 31 st of August, a small craft took us to Messina, where a few days' rest completely removed the effect of our fatigues. On Friday, September the 4th, we embarked on the steamer Volturno, employed by the French Messageries Imperiales, and in three days more we were at Marseilles, having no care on our minds except that abominable deceitful compass, which we had mislaid somewhere and could not now examine; but its inexplicable behaviour exercised my mind...", "...Stevenson's friendship had brought something into their lives they had never had before. Honolulu was the goal of the _Casco_ now, and all eagerly looked forward to the letters waiting for them there--the first word from home since leaving San Francisco. Bad weather attended the _Casco_ all the way. They were delayed by a succession of hurricanes and calms until the supply of food ran very low and they were reduced to a diet of \"salt-horse\" and ship-biscuit. The last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> hours of their run was made in the very teeth of a furious gale when the captain took big risks by carrying full sail, with the hope of making port before their supply of food and water was entirely exhausted. In spite of the danger, Stevenson enjoyed this daring run hugely.

As soon as Italy entered the war an attempt was made by the Teutonic Powers to establish the same sort of submarine blockade in the Adriatic which obtained in the waters around Great Britain.

There was a yacht called the _Eendracht_, and there was a merchantman called the _Hope_. The tonnage of the ships is not mentioned, but since there were only two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> men on the four ships, they must have been small even for that time. In a general way our meager information about the invested capital, the strange stories of the early lives of the commanders, and the very rough character of the crew show that we have to do with one of the many mushroom companies, an enterprise which was not based upon very sound principles, but was of a purely speculative nature.

Of these books, sixty-two were in Latin and three hundred in English. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-eight</span> folios and one hundred and twenty-one octavos. This was quite a bulky and heavy library for transportation to and through that new country. All were not imported at one time, as the succession of dates shows.
