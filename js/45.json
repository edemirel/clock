He did not possess his father's brilliant genius or power of personal influence, but was fondly devoted to the fine arts, himself a talented painter and composer.

Of rank and file, two hundred and seven were killed and seven hundred and fifty-eight were wounded. Total, ten hundred and fifty-four. The American loss was one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> killed and missing, and three hundred and four wounded. Total, four hundred and forty-nine.

Always a detriment to effective work, this lack of permanency is especially unfortunate in a country of such rapid growth and so transient a population.

In 1752 the Faculty of Advocates elected Hume their librarian, an office which was valuable to him, not so much for the emolument as for the extensive library which enabled him to pursue the historical studies upon which he had for some time been engaged. For the next nine years he was occupied with his _History of England_. The first volume was published in 1754, and the second volume, which met with a better reception than the first, in 1756. Only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> copies of the first volume were sold in a twelvemonth; but the subsequent volumes made rapid headway, and raised a great clamour, for in the words of Macaulay, Hume's historical picture, though drawn by a master hand, has all the lights Tory and all the shades Whig. In 1757 one of his most remarkable works, the _Natural History of Religion_, appeared. The book was attacked--not wholly to Hume's dissatisfaction, for he appreciated fame as well as success--\"with all the...", "...government even those portions of authority which a central government could administer so much more in her interest than she.

I am therefore convinced that the natural obstacles to the continuance of the American Union are not so powerful at the present time as they were in 1789; and that the enemies of the Union are not so numerous. Nevertheless, a careful examination of the history of the United States for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years will readily convince us that the federal power is declining; nor is it difficult to explain the causes of this phenomenon. *v When the Constitution of 1789 was promulgated, the nation was a prey to anarchy; the Union, which succeeded this confusion, excited much dread and much animosity; but it was warmly supported because it satisfied an imperious want. Thus, although it was more attacked than it is now, the federal power soon reached the maximum of its authority, as...", "...Rozier, and the criminals lost their chance. Rozier and d'Arlandes made a voyage lasting for twenty-five minutes, and, on landing, the balloon collapsed with such rapidity as almost to suffocate Rozier, who, however, was dragged out to safety by d'Arlandes. This first aerostatic journey took place on November 21st, 1783. Some seven months later, on June 4th, 1784, a Madame Thible ascended in a free balloon, reaching a height of 9,000 feet, and making a journey which lasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes--the great King Gustavus of Sweden witnessed this ascent. France grew used to balloon ascents in the course of a few months, in spite of the brewing of such a storm as might have been calculated to wipe out all but purely political interests.

The English had in this engagement forty-two men killed and one hundred and sixty-eight wounded; the French one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> wounded and twenty-six killed. The next morning the admiral, finding that three of his squadron were damaged in their masts, called a council of war, which decided to proceed to Gibraltar.

From this it appears that there are now in this admirable collection--for it is an admirable one--fifteen thousand distinct works (upwards, we believe, of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand volumes), comprising the best and most expensive works in every department of learning, which scholars and men of learning may have the use of in their own studies for the small subscription of two pounds a year.

As early as the 28th of May 1403, it is true, there had been held a university disputation about the new doctrines of Wycliffe, which had resulted in the condemnation of certain propositions presumed to be his; five years later (May 20, 1408) this decision had been refined into a declaration that these, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> in number, were not to be taught in any heretical, erroneous or offensive sense. But it was only slowly that the growing sympathy of Huss with Wycliffe unfavourably affected his relations with his colleagues in the priesthood. In 1408, however, the clergy of the city and archiepiscopal diocese of Prague laid before the archbishop a formal complaint against Huss, arising out of strong expressions with regard to clerical abuses of which he had made use in his public...", "...general words God speaks to the world, a true believer will make them his very own; and when Christ says, 'God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish,' faith translates it into 'He loved me, and gave Himself for me.'

The greater surges of the deeps when swept by the strongest winds move with the speed which, though not accurately determined, has been estimated by the present writer as exceeding forty miles an hour. As these surges often have a length transverse to the wind of a mile or more, a width of about an eighth of a mile, and a height of from thirty-five to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet, the amount of energy which they transmit is very great. If it could be effectively applied to the shores in the manner in which the energy of exploding gunpowder is applied by cannon shot, it is doubtful whether the lands could have maintained their position against the assaults of the sea. But there are reasons stated below why the ocean waves can use only a very small part of their energy in rending the rocks against which they strike on the coast line.

One said if I would come up to his office he would give me fifteen feet; another said he would add fifteen; the third said he would do the same. But I was going after an inquest and could not stop. A few weeks afterward they sold all their \"Overman\" at six hundred dollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about it--and also to urge me to accept of the next <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet of it that people tried to force on me.

Carson of London, Ont., stated that in his library the percentage of fiction ran from twenty to twenty-five per cent and he thought that was a fair average for other Canadian libraries. Mr. Carson said that the Ontario government bases the government grant on the amount of money expended on books and they give no grant on fiction if it exceed more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> per cent of the amount expended on other books, so in the majority of the small libraries, they do not expend more than thirty per cent on fiction for fear of losing a government grant on anything that exceeds that amount.

Dubourg then took cognizance of the contents of his cash-box; he found himself the possessor of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> hundred francs; that was more than he needed to win ten times as much. He trusted that the local ironmasters would make up the sum that the chevalier and the count with lace cuffs had filched from him. The next day, about noon, Dubourg and Menard prepared for their visit to Allevard, where they planned to arrive for dinner.

Twenty-one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> volumes were removed immediately.

This was approved by you and by the President of the United States and adopted as our formal military program. To carry this program into effect required the adoption by Congress of a change in the draft ages so as to include men between the ages of eighteen and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years, and also created a deficiency over the enormous appropriations already made by Congress of some $7,000,000,000.

She was buried with honor and affection; the pallbearers were old pioneers averaging a forty years' residence in the same place; D. T.

While our standing army is small, our military arrangements are such that we need have little anxiety on the score of the army. We have a large State Militia always at the service of the country, and we have the right to call on all able-bodied citizens between the ages of eighteen and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> for military service in case of need. This brings the number of men capable of bearing arms in our defense up to the number of ten millions. Our army, therefore, is on a satisfactory basis. With our navy, things are different. It has come to be a recognized fact among nations that countries who wish to be respected abroad must have a sufficient naval force to compel that respect when necessary. Our navy is not as large as the importance of our country demands, and it...", "...South was a military camp. The colored people, four million in number, were submissive, and worked in the field and took care of the families while the able-bodied white men were at the front fighting for a cause destined to defeat. The cause was popular, and was enthusiastically supported by the young men. The conscription took all of them. Before the war was over, further conscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age as junior reserves, and those between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> and sixty as senior reserves. It would have been an offence, directly after the war, and perhaps it would be now, to ask any able-bodied man in the South, who was between the ages of fourteen and sixty at any time during the war, whether he had been in the Confederate army. He would assert that he had, or account for his absence from the ranks. Under such circumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such a superiority of force in every battle fought. I know...", "...and at Ancona on the other side of the Adriatic.

When it was determined to rebuild the cathedral on a larger scale in 1402, the bishop and council of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> nobles made provision in various ways for the work. The territory of Vodizze was assigned for the purpose, the bishop gave half of the tithes, fines inflicted were to go to the fund, notaries were charged to remind testators to leave something to the fabric, &c.

That means very little baggage. One tropical suit and the...", "...might fairly assume that we did not get much to eat. But on our side there was the trouble and delay involved in the getting of it. To jostle about in a crowd for an indefinite period of time for sake of a scrap of flesh meat--and such meat! such flesh!--required rare ravenousness of appetite; and the bursting of a shell in the midst of a surging mass of humanity was so certain to be attended by fatal results that it was only the very healthy who bothered battling for so little. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes were of brief duration, and the assault was promptly renewed when the clock struck two. First came the boom; then the warning whistle; next the boom of a second gun almost before the bursting crash of the first shell had proclaimed its contact with _terra firma_.

The guns were fired at long range, and ten or fifteen seconds had...", "...have meant to give us the bracelet, Dot. The old one said so much about our being honest.

So they gave it to us.\" \"M-mm,\" considered Tess. \"But that doesn't explain it at all. Even if they wanted to get rid of the bracelet, they need not have given it to us in such a lovely basket.

He was a very short and extremely powerful man of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of age, and so sturdy and muscular as to have acquired the title of Thorer the Thick. He wore a shirt of scale armour, rather rusty, and somewhat the worse of having figured in many a tough battle by land and sea.

In the same gallery are also the series of reliefs which Luca began when forty-five years old for the balustrade of an organ in the cathedral. These reliefs represent boys singing, dancing, and...", "...* * * * HOW TO COOK YOUR FISH. There are many ways of cooking your fish. The usual way is to fry him in a hot frying-pan. A slit should be cut in each side of the fish, as otherwise the heat is likely to burst his skin. A little salt and a pinch of mustard put in with the butter in the pan will add to his flavour. But the simplest way, for you don't generally carry frying-pans with you when you go fishing, is to cut a long stick that bends at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees. Cut one arm to about one-third the length of the other. Trim the short arm with your knife till it is fine and pointed; pass this through the fish's mouth and then through the flesh near his tail, and toast him by the fire, back downwards, with a small lump of butter and a pinch of salt and mustard powder in his inside.

With Banks and his forty thousand now on Virginia soil at the foot of the Valley, and Fremont's army approaching the head, why should the Federal commander even think about this insignificant fragment of his foe?

The presence of Banks compelled Jackson to withdraw to...", "...commandant gave us orders to stand by. About noon the clouds began to break up, and both high and low patrols prepared to leave the ground. Drew, Dunham, and I were on high patrol, with Lieutenant Barry leading. Our orders were to go up through the clouds, using them as cover for making surprise attacks upon enemy _reglage_ machines. We were also to attack any enemy formations sighted within three kilometres of their old first lines. The clouds soon disappeared and so we climbed to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> hundred metres and lay in wait for combat patrols. Barry sighted one and signaled. Before I had placed it, he dived, almost full motor, I believe, for he dropped like a stone. We went down on his tail and saw him attack the topmost of three Albatross single-seaters. The other two dived at once, far into their own lines. Dunham, Drew, and I took long shots at them, but they were far outside effective range.

Any one of these could approach our solar system and annihilate it with its impact for, in passing the orbit of the earth on their way around the sun, they attain a regular velocity of 26-1/2 miles per second.

Let a solid nucleous collide with the earth and imagination would reel at the result. The earth moves over 18-1/2 miles every second, and this added to or subtracted from 26-1/2 makes 45 or 8.

But Lopez was a more difficult problem. Lopez had already declared war; he had attacked Brazilian ships and made preparations to invade Rio Grande do Sul. His main object was to crush the Brazilian troops in the Plate district before they could be reinforced. His plans were bold, but there appeared no reason why they should not be successful. He had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand infantry, ten thousand cavalry, and adequate artillery. Another fact in his favour was the friendship of Urquiza, now Governor of Corrientes, who was the enemy of Mitre. Both Brazil and Paraguay requested permission from Mitre to march their army through Misiones, but the President wished to remain neutral and refused both requests. Lopez, however, was dismayed by no obstacle, and directed General Robles with twenty-five thousand men to invade Corrientes. They soon...", "...British Government, despite most efficient laws and worthy efforts is unable to protect the birds of these wild regions to-day.

His sense of advantage made him tenderly apologetic. When he was near her he wanted to pet her. \"Rum deal women get.

At twenty-one we become men, but at forty-five we renew youth. Middle age and what you would have called old age are considered, rather than youth, the enviable time of life. Thanks to the better conditions of existence nowadays, and above all the freedom of every one from care, old age approaches many years later and has an aspect far more benign than in past times. Persons of average constitution usually live to eighty-five or ninety, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> we are physically and mentally younger, I fancy, than you were at thirty-five.

In New York City the average rate of suicide for the five years of the Civil War was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> per cent lower than the average for the five following years. In Massachusetts, where the statistics were gathered very carefully, the number of suicides for the five-year period before 1860 was nearly twenty per cent greater than for the five-year period immediately following, which represents the preliminary excitement over the war and the actual year of the war.

If the corner of the board is itself tattered, it can be stiffened by the use of paste or glue, thoroughly soaked in and left to dry. A little Spanish white might be added to the paste to give it more solidity.

To fasten this securely, the edge of the board should be cut across at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, then split, and the upper half cut away for a short distance back. The new triangular piece for the corner is also notched underneath to correspond so that the two patches will superimpose and exactly fit. Here one makes use of strong paste or glue.

In addition to these out-and-out expenditures, there were dozens of little leaks in all the departments of the business, all busily draining away not only possible profits, but the working capital, and, finally, the limit of the concern's credit. As a result of this kind of management, the final accounting showed the liabilities of the concern to be in the neighborhood of four hundred thousand dollars and its assets only about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand. No one could be found to take the business, even as a gift, and assume its obligations. The owner himself had his capital so tightly involved in other ventures that he was unable to save this concern, and it was therefore sold under the hammer. The creditors received their little eleven cents on the dollar. The owner's capital investment was, of course, a total and complete loss.

He found his patron and Tresham awaiting his landing, and a carriage ready to bear him away. The meeting was cordial. Twenty years had not affected his patron much. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of age, but looked perhaps a little younger. There was a dignity about his manner which Tom had never previously remarked; but there was no lack of kindness; on the contrary, it was obvious at a glance that his return was most acceptable to his friend.

A few days sufficed for that purpose: the demands of Henry were wholly pecuniary; and the king of Franco, who deemed the peaceable possession of Brittany an equivalent for any sum, and who was all on fire for his projected expedition into Italy, readily agreed to the proposals made him. He engaged to pay Henry seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand crowns, near four hundred thousand pounds sterling of our present money; partly as a reimbursement of the sums advanced to Brittany, partly as arrears of the pension due to Edward IV.

Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> pictures bearing Fiorenzo's name in the Pinacoteca of Perugia, the eight charming St Bernardino panels are so different from his well-authenticated works, so Florentine in conception and movement, that the Perugian's authorship is very questionable.

But portions of the corps did fight, and the entire corps would doubtless have fought well under favorable circumstances.

It has been called a German corps. This is not quite exact. Of nearly thirteen thousand men in the corps, only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> hundred were Germans. But it must be admitted that so many officers high in rank were of that nationality, that the general tendency and feeling were decidedly unlike the rest of the army.

The artillery of the corps did well. Those general officers who most severely rebuke...", "...of the drama. The plot of this delightful play is remarkable for the tact with which it is conducted; the language is elegant, without being too ornate or elaborate,--a very common defect in Sheridan's dramas;--and the songs are prettily versified, which is the highest praise we can accord them. In the year 1776, on the retirement of Garrick from the stage, Sheridan became one of the proprietors of Drury Lane Theatre. How, or by whose assistance, he obtained the large sum--upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand pounds--necessary to make this purchase, is a mystery which none of his numerous biographers, with all their research and ingenuity, have ever been able to fathom. We conclude it must have been by that winning address, and the strenuous exercise of those unrivalled powers of persuasion, which, at a later period, enabled Sheridan to work a miracle,--that is, to soften the soul of an attorney!

The infantry consisted of sixteen thousand Roman legionary or heavy infantry, and six thousand light infantry.

Occasionally one has to mark a child as doubtful. Thus, in defining abstract terms (XII. 4) Binet records that out of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> nine-year-old children, four passed, thirty-six failed, and five were doubtful. This test, however, gives an unusually large percentage of doubtfuls. =Method of Marking.=--The examiner should have a large sheet of paper or a note-book with the names of the tests written in column at the left-hand side. Opposite each in a second column he should enter a sign indicating his judgment. Binet recommends the use of the following signs: + ! excellent, + pass, + ? almost a pass, ?...", "...fright was lurking still, and every now and then it would clutch at her heart with an icy hand that almost stilled its beating.

Every man suffers because he desires the goods of this world, youth, health, life, and cannot keep them. All life is a suffering; all suffering is born of desire.

Notwithstanding the proposition was thus hampered, it received 216,987 votes, or nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> per cent of all the votes cast in the State. This result shows great progress in public sentiment since the adoption of the constitution of 1851, and inspires the friends of equal political rights with a confident hope that in 1871, when the opportunity is given to the people, by the provisions of the constitution, to call a constitutional convention, the organic law of the State will be so amended as to secure in Ohio to all the governed...", "...service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and the Union, and the consequent preservation of free government; and Whereas, for the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that all able-bodied male citizens of the United States, and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of twenty and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned), are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States when called out by the President for that purpose; and Whereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the ages specified in said act, who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the...", "...of the stomach are to be removed one hour afterward.

The students in Arts never formed part of the foundation, for the Treasurer almost immediately restricted his community to Theologians, and their tenure...", "...a bill was put through Parliament extending the English workhouse system to Ireland. Now, the workhouse system was devised to provide for tramps--for people who would not work, though work was plentiful; so there is a stigma about the workhouse which the Irish poor detest and which most of them do not deserve. They enter it only when driven by direst need--and how dire that need has been may be judged by the fact that, in 1905, for instance, the number of workhouse inmates exceeded <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand. Of these, about four thousand might be classified as tramps. The remainder were aged and infirm men and women, young children, and a sprinkling of starving middle-aged who could find no work--but the disgrace of the workhouse was upon them all.

Reading is a test which requires only a minute. One chooses a text which the children can understand easily, preferably a lively piece with dialogue, so that one may judge more easily whether the pupil can read with expression. One should avoid prolonging the reading for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> seconds, for a young child tires quickly and reads worse at the end of a minute than at the beginning. Instead of contenting oneself with judging that the child reads well or ill, which does not mean very much, it is a great advantage to adopt these five grades of reading, which are easy to distinguish with a little practice, and are less subjective than might be imagined, for two judges generally give the same mark.

This would be <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> pounds an hour; but allowing for the inferior power of the stream in the cooler periods of the day, and taking into consideration, on the other side, its increased power in rain, we may, I think, estimate its average hour's work at twenty-eight or thirty pounds, or a hundred weight every four hours.

There was also a jug of milk, and a silver mug, which Forester's mother had lent them for the excursion, to drink out of.

In the Senate, an amendment was passed making the duty on woolens an ad valorem rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> per cent., but retaining the minima. Various considerations induced some New England friends of Adams to support the measure. Webster defended his action in voting for the bill by declaring that New England had accepted the protective system as the established policy of the government, and after 1824 had built up her manufacturing enterprises on that basis. Nevertheless, in the final vote in the Senate, the five northern members who opposed were all from New England.

The main or primary coils D and E are wound for a different self-induction from that of the coils D' and E', the relations being so fixed that if the currents in D and E differ, for example, by a quarter-phase, the currents in each secondary coil, as D' E', will differ from those in its appropriate primary D or E by, say, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, or one-eighth of a period. Now, assuming that an impulse or alternation in circuit or branch E is just beginning, while in the branch D it is just falling from maximum, the conditions are those of a quarter-phase difference. The ideal resultant of the attractive forces of the two sets of poles B C therefore may be considered as progressing from poles B to poles C, while the impulse in E is rising to maximum, and that in D is falling to zero or minimum.

Some of the less upright growing varieties are difficult to form into pyramids, and such may be pruned in the ordinary bush or vase form. In growing dwarf pears commercially, as is sometimes done, it is probably best to give most varieties the bush form. The pyramid is rather harder to maintain. The pear succeeds well as a cordon tree. Perhaps the best form is the oblique cordon, one placed at an angle of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees with the horizon. The upright and horizontal cordons may also be used, though neither of these forms is specially well adapted to pears. All of the better types of espaliers are suited to pear trees. Probably the Palmette-Verrier is the best, although the old fashioned espaliers are often used. The U-form and the double U-form also succeed if well built. The pruning of the pear tree is substantially the same as that of the apple.

She loved her new home in the wilderness--the beautiful valley which her father had selected, possessed charms which she admired; and she had never wished to exchange it, though solitary and neighborless, for the more populous country in which she had once resided. There was also present in the room an ill-clad, stout-looking man, by the name of Guthrie, apparently about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of age. His countenance had a vulgar cast; and it wore, besides, an ill-natured expression, that repelled any attempt at an intimate acquaintance. This Guthrie had, during the war of the Revolution, been a Tory; and it had been suspected that he was one of the most active agents in inciting the Indians of this locality to revolt. He resided at some distance below, on the river, in a log shanty erected by him. He was a sort of squatter, and tilled a few acres which had...", "...should have been hers.

Of these 11,500 were in New York and its vicinity, 6000 in Philadelphia, 4000 in Boston, and 3500 in Baltimore. Meanwhile a movement was under way to federate the unions of a single trade. In 1835 the cordwainers attending the National Trades Union' formed a preliminary organization and called a national cordwainers' convention. This met in New York in March, 1836, and included <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> delegates from New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Connecticut. In the fall of 1836 the comb-makers, the carpenters, the hand-loom weavers, and the printers likewise organized separate national unions or alliances, and several other trades made tentative efforts by correspondence to organize themselves in the same manner.

Samuel Davies often preached to Mr. Waddell's congregation; as also did Whitefield several times. In the year 1776 Mr. Waddell removed from Lower Virginia, in very feeble health, to Augusta County. His salary was now only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> pounds, Virginia currency, per annum. In 1783 he came to reside at an estate purchased by him, and called Hopewell, at the junction of Louisa, Orange, and Albemarle--the dwelling-house being in Louisa.

As a rule she and Marise had a good deal to say to each other, because Mlle. Hasparren was the only person Marise knew who had any interest in America.

Otherwise, why should he be paying attention to Willy Croup, who, as everybody knew, was not a day under <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years old, and therefore at least ten years older than the gentleman at the hotel. In regard to the fortune which he was hunting, there was no difference of opinion; whatever Mrs. Cliff's fortune might be, this Mr. Burke wanted it.

Roquin, his uncle, it was proved from the registers of the customs of Lyons and Marseilles, that the said bale weighed no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> pounds, and had paid carriage according to that weight. I joined this authentic extract to the memoir of M, de Montaigu, and provided with these papers and others containing stronger facts, I returned to Paris, very impatient to make use of them. During the whole of this long journey I had little adventures; at Como, in Valais, and elsewhere.

This was the Chateau of Girard le Diable (Girard the Devil) the first of the \"monuments\" to be encountered if one arrives by the Southern railway station. This edifice, now completely restored and used as the depository of the provincial archives, dates from 1216. Apart from the exterior, however, which reproduces the original appearance of the castle, the only portion of interest to the visitor is the crypt which is over one hundred feet long and nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet in width, making it one of the largest in Flanders. The vaulted roof is supported by massive round columns and forms a notable example of the ogival style of architecture. We sought in vain to find what the noble Sir Girard did or did not do to receive his satanic appellation. From the records he appears to have been a tolerably worthy citizen, holding, as did his father before him, the position of Chatelain of Ghent.

But when the first volley of musketry came down from the top of the redoubt, they broke their silence and huzzaed with all their power. Then they rushed forward, charging with their bayonets as they ran, and in almost no time they were within the redoubt, with the defending officer and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> men their prisoners. Not a shot had been fired; and so swift was the action that few of the Americans were lost. The not ungenerous rivalry between the groups of men who took the two redoubts is one of the most picturesque incidents of the American Revolution.

I have had them on the shelf of my cupboard for a week, when the little ones have forced their way out Forty days is the time of incubation, so, naturally, those must have been already sat on for thirty-three days. With open wings these giant birds often manage to cover from twenty-five to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> eggs, although, I think, they seldom bring out more than twenty. The rest they roll out of the nest, where, soon rotting, they breed innumerable insects, and provide tender food for the coming young.

The woman who risks her happiness with a man many years younger than herself, violates a precept of life; and when her husband grows indifferent, or taunts her with her years, or seeks companions of more suitable age, she is reaping a harvest sown by her own hand. So commonly do such matches turn out badly, that in 1828 the kingdom of Wuertemberg prohibited unions where the woman was more than twelve years the senior, except by special dispensation.

Marriage in its full meaning has no longer an existence. The relative age of man and wife has another influence, and quite a curious one. It influences the sex of the children. But this point we reserve for discussion on a later page. The folly of joining a young girl to an old man is happily not so common in America as in Europe.

On the 4th of April Colonel Benson left his troops to be merged into the force of General Dixon (who had succeeded General Cunningham in command of the column south of the Magaliesberg), while he assumed a more important command on the eastern line.

As the Hoopstad garrison had yet to be withdrawn, the troops now under Lord Errol started thither on the 28th of March, a simultaneous movement being made by a mobile column from...", "...that _salmon, mackerel, herring, perch, tench_, and several others, are alike in both numbers, and ought never to be used in the plural form. I am not so fond of honouring these anomalies. Usage is here as unsettled, as it is arbitrary; and, if the expression of plurality is to be limited to either form exclusively, the regular plural ought certainly to be preferred. But, _for fish taken in bulk_, the singular form seems more appropriate; as, \"These vessels take from thirty-eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> quintals of _cod_ and _pollock_, and six thousand barrels of _mackerel_, yearly.\"--_Balbi's Geog._, p. 28.

It was no less than 360 stadia, or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> miles, in circumference, and was joined to the continent by an isthmus, twenty-three stadia, or three miles and a furlong, in breadth. On the west side projected a long tract of land, half a stadium broad; which shooting out into the sea, separated it from a lake, or morass, and was strongly fortified on all sides by rocks and a single wall. In the middle of the city stood the citadel of Byrsa, having on the top of it a temple sacred to AEsculapius, seated upon rocks, to...", "...his team would have to uncover it. The problem would belong to Gallifa. II The planet--as yet unnamed--had been surveyed by the spotting cruiser and pronounced suitable for colonization to nine-point-oh on a scale of ten.

That more difficult undertaking would fall to the lot of the pre-col crew. By the time the balance of the colonists arrived, in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> days, the survey party would have to have the initial focal point ready for occupancy, and be in a position to supply all the data the colony would need for survival. It was the biological team's specific job not only to classify the flora and fauna of the planet, but to determine the adaptability of the colonists to all existing conditions.

In other words, though sex is determined from the first, and though certain of its distinctive characters remain to the end, we may say that our study of womanhood is practically concerned with the years between twelve or thirteen, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> or fifty. Before this period, as we have suggested, the distinction between the sexes is of no practical importance so far as _regimen_ and education are concerned. After this period also it is probable that the difference between the two sexes is diminished, and would be still more evidently diminished were it not for the effects which different experience has permanently wrought in the memory.

On that fatal field the French left <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> cannon and 6,000 prisoners, besides the slain and wounded. The remainder with difficulty effected their escape to Liady, where Napoleon once more received them, and crossed the Dneiper.

Within easy reach of the person occupying the rear seat was a ratchet-lever, which, when pulled, threw the seat back to an angle of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees and jerked open the compressed-air reservoir. The opening of this reservoir put the release machinery into action, and this in turn threw out of the containing chamber the compactly folded parachute, which automatically, on being released, spread out and encompassed a great volume of resisting atmosphere.

Though these remains, including the prose of the Greek authors who cite and comment on them, occupy but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> pages of a book in small octavo,[2] the fragments suffice to prove that the lost epics are far apart as the poles from the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ in taste, tone, narrative art, descriptions of religious rites, customs, usages, and treatment of the heroic characters.

Besides, it was a novelty, which was a thing that a poor king of France could not always get, and especially Henri III., who, when he had gone through his processions, counted his dogs, and uttered his usual number of sighs, had nothing left to do. Therefore he became more and more pleased with the idea as he returned to his room. \"These men are doubtless brave, and will be perhaps very devoted,\" thought he; \"and forty-five swords...", "...gone far towards ruining both.[59] This example has been of the utmost value to South America, and arbitration is undoubtedly beginning to replace the appeal to arms.

When they walked, Marmaduke's short legs took one whole hour to reach it; Jehosophat's, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes; though the Toyman's long shanks could cover the ground in fifteen. But then he could go ever so fast. However, they usually rode, and horses can always go faster than men. Even Old Methusaleh could trot there in twelve, and he was spavined and a little wind-broke, while Teddy and Hal, who were young and frisky, could get there as quick as a wink. On this particular day Uncle Roger and Aunt Mehitable had a family party. It was a fine one, you may be sure, but we...", "...of providing catechists suitable for the work I was authorized by the Church Missionary Society to receive and educate some young men; and within a few months after we had taken up our residence on the Reserve I commenced to teach two young Indians, named Wilson Jacobs and William Henry, with the view of their becoming catechists. The great event of the summer was a visit we received from the Bishop of Huron and Mrs. Cronyn. The fact that twenty-five persons were confirmed, and that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> came forward afterwards to receive the Holy Communion, will show that our work among these poor Indians had already made some progress. Among the candidates for confirmation was poor old Quasind, who came up bare-footed, a great-grandfather, and, I suppose, about ninety years of age. In the evening our own child, Archibald Edward, was christened during the time of Divine service by the Bishop. The following day we had appointed to have a gathering of Indians, a sort of...", "...found, ascending spirally by at least twenty turns to the extreme peak of the mountain. The diameter of the crater was about one hundred feet at the bottom, about two hundred feet at the top--the diameter widening at each complete circuit of the gallery by from eight to twelve feet, the breadth of the gallery varying from four feet to six. Looking from below at the opening above, the spot of sky, says Peters, looked like the full moon. The length of the gallery, as its gradient is about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, must be about a mile and a half. Out of the gallery, at several points in the ascent, passes a small side-tunnel, communicating with the exterior. \"On still another island, about a hundred miles from Hili-li, but on about the same meridian--that is to say, in the same warm air-current, though the heat of the current was there much diminished by dilution--the party visited certain ruins which had always greatly puzzled the Hili-lites.

Twenty-five thousand two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> millions of dollars and more; actually as much, within a fraction, as the entire value of the personal and landed property of the United States!

But the \"Journal of Man\" has a still wider field, a task in which it may well claim the co-operation of all truly enlightened and philanthropic minds. It was the singular good fortune of the editor, over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years ago, to crown his long investigations of the constitution of man by the discovery and demonstration that all the powers of the soul were exercised by the brain in a multiform subdivision of its structure, every convolution and every group of fibres and cells having a function appreciably distinct from the functions of all neighboring parts, the vast multiformity and intricacy of its structure corresponding to the vast multiformity and intricacy of our psychic nature,...", "...He would have had matters of education to insist upon--perhaps of clothing and hygiene.

The Carmelite Friars had their origin in the East, and were introduced into England by Sir John de Vesey, on his return from the Crusade in the early part of the thirteenth century. It had ultimately about five houses in England. The Austin Friars, founded about the middle of the century, had about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> houses here. These make up the four orders, Black, Grey, White, and Austin. All smaller foundations were suppressed or included in the Austins, by the Council of Lyons, in 1370. The great difference between the monks and the friars was that the ideal of the monastic life was seclusion from the world for prayer and meditation with a view to the cultivation of one's own soul; that of the friar's life was devotion to active work. The great economical difference was that the...", "...he cried. Please write to me, although I deserve it so little, and show a Christian spirit.--Ever your faithful friend, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. TO SIDNEY COLVIN [_Edinburgh, August 1877._] MY DEAR COLVIN,--I'm to be whipped away to-morrow to Penzance, where at the post-office a letter will find me glad and grateful. I am well, but somewhat tired out with overwork. I have only been home a fortnight this morning, and I have already written to the tune of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> Cornhill pages and upwards. The most of it was only very laborious re-casting and re-modelling, it is true; but it took it out of me famously, all the same. Temple Bar appears to like my _Villon_, so I may count on another market there in the future, I hope. At least, I am going to put it to the proof at once, and send another story, _The Sire de Maletroit's Mousetrap_: a true novel, in the old sense; all unities preserved moreover, if that's anything, and I believe with...", "...slender resources recurred more than once that evening, but I knew that the authorities were trying to do all they could in the way of relieving general and individual distress, and that they were admirably seconded by private charity, which not only placed comparatively large sums at their disposal, but bestirred itself by means of specially appointed committees and visitors.

The first had already fallen to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> grammes per day per head, the second to three hundred and fifty grammes;[87] they were to fall much lower.

Nor did the croakers have long to wait. The second night after the drowning of the mate the little yacht was suddenly wracked from stem to stern. About one o'clock in the morning there was a terrific impact that threw the slumbering guests and crew from berth and bunk. A mighty shudder ran through the frail craft; she lay far over to starboard; the engines stopped. For a moment she hung there with her decks at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees--then, with a sullen, rending sound, she slipped back into the sea and righted. Instantly the men rushed upon deck, followed closely by the women. Though the night was cloudy, there was little wind or sea, nor was it so dark but that just off the port bow a black mass could be discerned floating low in the water. \"A derelict,\" was the terse explanation of the officer of the watch.

This was merely an inconvenience, not an obstacle. CHAPTER VI TO THE FALLS OF THE MISSOURI On the afternoon of April 7, 1805, winter quarters were abandoned. Of the original <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> men two had been lost; but three recruits had been gained,--Chaboneau, his squaw Sacajawea, and their infant son, born in February.

According to the latest trustworthy calculations, the population of the whole of Africa is represented by two hundred millions. Some place it at one hundred and seventy millions.

Even when he realised his vocation, forsook verse, and began to write novels, he for long gave no indication of his future powers; while, on the other hand, at the age of twenty, his views on most points were formed, and his judgments matured. Therefore, unlike most men, in whom, even if there be no violent changes, age gradually and imperceptibly modifies the point of view, Balzac, a youth in his garret, differed little in essentials from Balzac at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> or fifty, a man of world-wide celebrity. He never appears to have passed through those phases of belief and unbelief --those wild enthusiasms, to be rejected later in life--which generally fall to the lot of young men of talent. Perhaps his reasoning and reflective powers were developed unusually early, so that he sowed his mental wild oats in his boyhood. At any rate, in his garret in 1819 he was the same Balzac that we know in later life. Large-minded and...", "...us in mechanical engineering.

The Rustleford Manor Eleven went in to bat at one o'clock precisely, and were all dismissed in the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes for forty-nine runs. The pitch was almost unplayable; each bowler found a \"spot\"; and it was only some berserk slogging by Pip, who went in last and refused to allow any ball to alight on the treacherous turf at all, that this insignificant total was not halved.

In the fighting the East Lancashire Division, a territorial force, did heroic work and bore the brunt of the fighting. There were many individual feats of daring and bravery, yet one stands out conspicuously. A youthful Manchester schoolmaster, Lieutenant W. T. Forshaw, held his trench against attacks for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> hours. For forty-one of those hours he was continuously throwing bombs and only desisted when his arm became temporarily paralyzed. When, finally, the Turks swarmed into his trench, revolver in hand he led his wearied troops and drove them out. He richly deserved the coveted Victoria Cross which was conferred upon him. At dawn on the following day, the Australians began the attack at Sari Bair. The force at Anzac Cove had been reenforced with Indian troops and two...", "...nettled at the summary disposal of the matter.

Lax as Harry is, one hesitates to saddle him with such an egregious contradiction. If it were worth while to bring him to reasonable consistency, one might reject the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> couplet as an arithmetical exercise of the transcriber, with his nose on the preceding line and his mind vacant of all other considerations. Then Harry might be taken to say that Blair and Gray were intimate with Wallace from his sixteenth year till he was out twenty-nine. If he was in his thirtieth year in 1305, he would have been born in 1275.

The \"Duncan\" was a semi-speed boat, some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet over all, without cabin, and carrying only a sprayhood forward to protect its engine. Two men appeared in the boat--Mr Salisbury, the owner, and his engineer. The latter was steering at this time. Chug-chug-chug! came the fast craft.

The investigations showed, however, that it is composed of densely packed snow.

Not the least important part of the exploration was the discovery of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> miles of coast.

Well, I read on a little, and learned that a bench-show was not a bench-show --but dogs, not benches at all--only dogs.

There were banking houses which had stood for fifty years, and who did not know but what they were ruined. They rushed into the market to cover their shorts.

So furious was his charge and so utter the surprise of the Spaniards that nearly their entire party, consisting of one hundred and twenty-five of their best woodsmen and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> Indians, were either killed, wounded, or made prisoners. The few fugitives were pursued for several miles through the forest to an open meadow or savannah.

Thomas sent Schofield with the 4th and 23d corps, together with three brigades of Wilson's cavalry to Pulaski to watch him. On the 17th of November Hood started and moved in such a manner as to avoid Schofield, thereby turning his position. Hood had with him three infantry corps, commanded respectively by Stephen D. Lee, Stewart and Cheatham. These, with his cavalry, numbered about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand men. Schofield had, of all arms, about thirty thousand. Thomas's orders were, therefore, for Schofield to watch the movements of the enemy, but not to fight a battle if he could avoid it; but to fall back in case of an advance on Nashville, and to fight the enemy, as he fell back, so as to retard the enemy's movements until he could be reinforced by Thomas himself. As soon as Schofield saw this movement of Hood's, he sent his trains to the rear, but did not fall...", "...more ground upon which to deploy. The position which the enemy occupied next morning, is five or six miles from the river, and his advance camp was perhaps a mile southward of Shiloh Church. He had, as yet, established no line; the attack next morning took him completely by surprise, and he formed after the fight had commenced. General Johnson's effective strength, including all the forces available for that battle, was about thirty-five thousand men. That of the enemy was, perhaps, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand men. The advantages of attack and surprise would, General Johnson thought, more than counterbalance his numerical inferiority. If Buell brought reinforcements to his opponents, by forced marches, in advance of his army, he would feel their effect only in a stronger line, and more stubborn resistance upon the front--his flanks would be safe in any event.

Washington, Feb. 15, 1848. Dear William,--Your letter of the 29th January was received last night. Being exclusively a constitutional argument, I wish to submit some reflections upon it in the same spirit of kindness that I know actuates you. Let me first state what I understand to be your position. It is, that, if it shall become necessary _to repel invasion_, the President may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the...", "...or carry out the laws. It is also his duty to send what is called a message to each session of the General Assembly. The message is a letter or statement in which he communicates to the Assembly full information as to the condition of the State, and recommends such measures--that is, such new laws--as he thinks necessary. Militia is a body composed of citizens enrolled and trained as soldiers for the defence of the State. All able-bodied male persons between the ages of eighteen and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years may be called to serve in the militia. Naval forces are military forces or militia that serve on sea. Invasion is the entrance into a State of a military force from another country for the purpose of conquest. To repel invasion is to oppose it by force, to drive off the invaders. Insurrection is a rising or rebellion of people in a State against the government of their own State. It is the duty of the governor to suppress-- that is, to put down--insurrection, and to...", "...of incriminating one who may be innocent. Quite between ourselves, allow me to ask what your police surgeon has had to say regarding his examination?\" The inspector looked dubious, then brightened visibly. \"You being the man you are, Mr. Stanton,\" he said, sociably, over his third glass of old Scotch, \"I can't see that there'd be anything amiss in my answering you so far. Our surgeon, Mr. Potter, reported that the corpse was that of a well-nourished man of somewhere between forty and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of age, all the organs healthy, though there were traces of opium in the system--not, however, enough to have caused death. The head had been severed from the neck by a skilled anatomist, who knew exactly where to strike; but it had been separated after death, not before. Also the mutilation of the left hand had been done in the same way.

By standing in a sensible position with the chest high (but not forced up) the lung capacity of the average individual is quite surprising. A good position can be secured through the old Delsarte exercise which is as follows: I. Stand on the balls of your feet, heels just touching the floor. II. Hold your arms at your side in a relaxed condition. III. Move your arms forward until they form an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees with the body. Press the palms down until the chest is up comfortably. IV. Now let your arms drop back without letting your chest fall. Feel a sense of ease and freedom over the whole body.

Most people when called to this \"attention\" posture stiffen themselves so that they are in a position of resistance.

It's quoted at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> for sixty per cent concentrates, and you must have tons and tons on the dump.\" \"Yes, lots of it,\" admitted Wiley, \"and say, now that you mention it, I believe I'll take you up. I need a little money to install some machinery and get the old mill to running.

How, in fact, was it to be done? Where was the money to come from? He must have some new trousers, and pay a debt of long standing to the shoemaker for putting new tops to his old boots, and he must order three shirts from the seamstress, and a couple of pieces of linen. In short, all his money must be spent. And even if the director should be so kind as to order him to receive <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> or even fifty rubles instead of forty, it would be a mere nothing, a mere drop in the ocean towards the funds necessary for a cloak, although he knew that Petrovich was often wrong-headed enough to blurt out some outrageous price, so that even his own wife could not refrain from exclaiming, \"Have you lost your senses, you fool?\" At one time he would not work at any price, and now it was quite likely that he had named a higher sum than the cloak would cost. But although he...", "...to the Viceroy of India, `_I congratulate your Excellency on England and India being now connected by a submarine cable.

At that time Paraguay was at the height of one of the many revolutions that have continuously stained her history for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years, and Asuncion was like a tomb. Now since everything was tranquil I would enjoy myself more. It is now possible to travel from Buenos Aires to Asuncion without changing cars on a through vestibuled train with sleeping cars and a dining car.

Andrew Carnegie said he had noticed that after a man had accumulated a million dollars smiles were seldom seen on his face.

And a great many high-strung sensitive men are utterly cast down because they have failed to acquire wealth by the time they are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> or fifty years of age. I wish I could make all such poor, afflicted people see what goes to make up happiness and learn the only way to be happy. In order to get well the thing we have to do is to follow nature's simple rules--rules our Creator gave to us. We must get control not only of our appetites but of all such passions as anger, hate, and envy, which poison our bodies. And let us also cast suspicion out of our minds.

It was some time after noon when we pulled out from shore in our two-man canoe, a small craft, affording just room for two men to sit, and to carry their pack sacks and scant supplies. Soon it began to rain, and the wind commenced blowing.

In Massachusetts, where the statistics were gathered very carefully, the number of suicides for the five-year period before 1860 was nearly twenty per cent. greater than for the five-year period immediately following, which represents the preliminary excitement over the war and the actual years of the war.

This great wall, since known as the Dannevirke, took three years to build. There were strong watch-towers at intervals and only one gate, and this was well protected by a wide and deep ditch, crossed by a bridge that could readily be removed. For ages afterwards the Danes were grateful to Queen Thyra for this splendid wall of defense and sang her praises in their national...", "...or is even suspected of error, she is rigorously excluded from virtuous society, and, although her subsequent life may be irreproachable, the lapse is seldom forgiven.

He mapped 324, chose out nine, which he designated by the letters of the alphabet, to be standards of measurement for the rest, and ascertained the coincidence in position between the double yellow ray derived from the flame of burning sodium and the pair of dark lines named by him \"D\" in the solar spectrum. There ensued <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of groping for a law which should clear up the enigma of the solar reversals. Partial anticipations abounded. The vital heart of the matter was barely missed by W.A. Miller in 1845, by L. Foucault in 1849, by A.J. Angstrom in 1853, by Balfour Stewart in 1858; while Sir George Stokes held the solution of the problem in the hollow of his hand from 1852 onward.

The governor of Villefranche wrote in August 1717, that 'of two old prisoners of state for poison, the survivors of four who had been locked up there for thirty-six years, La Guesdon died on the 15th instant, leaving <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> livres in silver, which she had saved during that time out of her eight sous a day for food: of these she instructed her surviving companion to take what she needed for her personal use, and to use the balance in paying for prayers for her--this is one pensioner the less for the king.

Thus ended the school which had been first gathered by Smothers nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years before, and which, in that long period, had been continually maintained with seldom less than one hundred pupils, and for the most part with one hundred and fifty, the only suspensions being in the year of the Snow riot, and in the two years which ushered in the war.

In 1829 Mr. Haven moved to Shoreham, and there he remained until death, preaching there regularly thirty-seven years, and occasionally, every year, from Jan. 1, 1825, to Jan. 1, 1870,--in all <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years. Mr. Haven was an earnest and effective preacher. He was not especially noted for learning or eloquence, but was a plain, vigorous, and scriptural advocate of the Gospel. His preaching was a continuous stream of truth flowing forth in a strong and fervent delivery from the beginning to the close of his discourse. He possessed excellent judgment, sterling integrity, an amiable and Christian spirit, and unostentatious piety. He won and secured the respect of all men by...", "...which his ship was drifted twice round the island of Bornholm, was able to approach Carlshamn in March, and was cut into that harbour by the Swedes, who afforded him every assistance. The Swedish armed ships were lost by being carried by the ice on a sandbank in sight of the Salsette, which had then only four feet water to spare; the former, immediately they struck, turned bottom up, and all hands perished, being instantly covered with the ice. The thermometer, in January 1809, sank to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees below zero; the Sound and Belt were completely frozen over, and many passed between Sweden and Denmark on horseback over the ice. The Author did not escape the infection at Carlscrona, but was one of the first who recovered, and was sent for by the King to Stockholm; it was, however, the middle of February before he could undertake the journey. There were at one time nineteen packets due from England. Things in Sweden began to take a different turn. The...", "...1/4 teaspoon salt. 1 teaspoon vanilla.

Did the vegetable and animal kingdoms consist of a definite number of species adapted to peculiarities of soil and climate, and universally distributed, the fact would be in harmony with the idea of special exertion. But the truth is that various regions exhibit variations altogether without apparent end or purpose. Professor Henslow enumerates <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> distinct flowers or sets of plants upon the surface of the earth, notwithstanding that many of these would be equally suitable elsewhere. The animals of different continents are equally various, few species being the same in any two, though the general character may conform.

Dr. Pye Smith, 'separate and original creations, perhaps at different and respectively distinct...", "...its comfort and pleasantness of accommodation as for its ancient state and splendour.

It occupied the whole length of one of the wings; was one hundred feet long, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet broad, its walls hung with a collection of choice pictures rich in history; while the Axminster carpets, the cabinets, carved tables, and variety of easy chairs, ingeniously grouped, imparted even to this palatian chamber a lively and habitable air.

More extensive observation shows that the Black average is about four ounces below the White. The absence of very large brains among the Blacks comes out most distinctly. There were no Black brains weighing over fifty-six ounces, only five weighing so much as fifty-five; whereas, eight White brains weighed over sixty ounces, and forty weighed over fifty-five. Likewise of the twenty-four Whites, only one fell under <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> ounces, but forty-one of the 141 Blacks; also, only forty-seven of the 278 Whites; it is plain, then, that large brains predominate among the Whites and small ones among the Blacks. This, however, is not nearly all the evidence on this question. In the course of an elaborate article in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1868, pp. 505 sqq., Dr. J. Barnard Davis makes this remark: \"As a general conclusion, without analyzing the results of Tiedemann's gaugings of negro...", "...of the people who belonged to this society, when they heard of the affair, took it into their heads that Mr. Frank Wellington had done a very cruel thing in shutting so many cats up in a box together. It was a very good illustration of the way stories grow big in many times telling, the way the number of those cats went on growing bigger and bigger every time the story was told. At last they got it up as high as forty-five; and there really were some people in town who believed that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> cats had come from Mendon to Burnet in that box. \"Jerry says they haven't ever had it lower than twenty-five,\" said Mrs. Chapman. \"It runs all the way from forty-five to twenty-five, but twenty-five is the lowest, and there was one man in the town who really did threaten pretty seriously to enter a complaint against Frank Wellington with the society, but I guess he was laughed out of it.

It was a question of \"saving religion, property, and the family.\"--\"Save the flag!\" they exclaimed. The vulgar herd of terrified selfish interests threw themselves into the current. They coalesced, they made a stand, they formed in mass. They had a crowd around them. This crowd was composed of diverse elements. The landed proprietor entered it because his rents had fallen; the peasant, because he had paid the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> centimes; he who did not believe in God thought it necessary to save religion, because he had been forced to sell his horses. They extracted from this crowd the force it contained, and made use of it. They made everything contribute to repression: the law, despotism, the assemblies, the tribune, the jury, the magistracy, the police; in Lombardy the sabre, at Naples the convict prison, in Hungary the gibbet.

He restored, indeed, the estates of all Robert's adherents; but was secretly determined, that noblemen so powerful and so ill-affected, who had both inclination and ability to disturb his government, should not long remain unmolested in their present opulence and grandeur. He began with the Earl of Shrewsbury, who was watched for some time by spies, and then indicted on a charge, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> articles. This turbulent nobleman, knowing his own guilt, as well as the prejudices of his judges and the power of his prosecutor, had recourse to arms for defence; but, being soon suppressed by the activity and address of Henry, he was banished the kingdom, and his great estate was confiscated. His ruin involved that of his two brothers, Arnulf de Montgomery, and Roger Earl of Lancaster.

A few days after Rain surrendered, Aicha was carried by assault; and, following up his career of success, Marlborough advanced to within a league of Augsburg, under the cannon of which the Elector of Bavaria was placed with the remnant of his forces, in a situation too strong to admit of its being forced. He here made several attempts to detach the Elector, who was now reduced to the greatest straits, from the French alliance; but that prince, relying on the great army, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand strong, which Marshal Tallard was bringing up to his support from the Rhine, adhered with honourable fidelity to his engagements. Upon this, Marlborough took post near Friburg, in such a situation as to cut him off from all communication with his dominions; and ravaged the country with his light troops, levying contributions wherever they went, and burning the villages with savage ferocity as far as the gates of Munich.

Let us take, then, the beginning of the nineteenth century as our standing-point; and, assuming that labour was the sole producer then, compare its productivity per head with the productivity of industrial effort--of labour and ability combined--some eight or nine decades later.

How do I put in the first speed?\" Mr Vick, in what can only be described as a _moriturus-te-saluto!_ voice, gave the required information; and the car, after a dislocating jerk, moved off at a stately four miles per hour. Presently, with much slipping of the clutch and buzzing of the gear-wheels, the second, and finally the third speed went in, and the car proceeded with all the exuberance of its <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> horse-power down the long straight drive. Fortunately the lodge gates stood open, and the road outside was clear. Certainly Mr Vick behaved very well. Although every wrench and jar to which his beloved engines were submitted appeared to react directly upon his own internal mechanism, he never winced. Occasionally a muffled groan or a muttered exclamation of \"My tyres!\" or \"My differential!\" burst from his overwrought lips; but for the most part he sat like a graven image,...", "...in that evening, and offered me the good ministry of the church.

The boat, called the Senegal, took twenty-five; the pinnace thirty-three; and the yawl, the smallest of all the boats, took only ten.

The clique then in power at court looked among the possible pretenders for the one who seemed least likely to do anything, and their choice fell on the fifteen-year-old Shih Tsung, who was made emperor. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of his reign were filled in home affairs with intrigues between the cliques at court, with growing distress in the country, and with revolts on a larger and larger scale. Abroad there were wars with Annam, increasing raids by the Japanese, and, above all, long-continued fighting against the famous Mongol ruler Yen-ta, from 1549 onward. At one time Yen-ta reached Peking and laid siege to it.

Indeed, the immigration of the past six years more than outnumbers that of the forty years from 1820 to 1860. [Sidenote: A Startling Total of 23,000,000] Thus, from colonial days above twenty-three millions of aliens have been received upon these hospitable shores.

He dropped ten feet away and lay dazed and helpless as a knee crashed against his chest. Sammy Porter, his face working curiously with relief and rage, rolled him against the wall of the defile and struck him over the head with a rifle butt, first disarming him. Hopalong opened his eyes and looked around, dazed and sick. The foreman, bound hand and foot by a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> foot lariat, lay close to the base of the wall and stared sullenly at the sky. Sammy was coming up the trail with a dripping sombrero held carefully in his hands and was growling and talking it all over. Hopalong looked down at his thigh and saw a heavy, blood-splotched bandage fastened clumsily in place. Glancing at Sammy again he idly noted that part of the youth's blue-flannel shirt was missing. Curiously, it matched the bandage. He closed his eyes and tried to think...", "...terrible effect. Others began loopholing the walls.

Lieutenant Wynter, while behaving with distinguished gallantry, was shot through both legs at about 11.30. He was thus twice severely wounded within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> days. He now continued to command his guns, until he fainted from loss of blood. A native gunner then shielded him with his body, until he also was hit. The whole scene, the close, desperate fighting, the carcasses of the mules, the officers and men crouching behind them, the flaming stacks of bhoosa, the flashes of the rifles, and over all and around all, the darkness of the night--is worthy of the pencil of De Neuville. At length, at about midnight, help arrived....", "...In the afternoon, another party enjoyed the _wet_ evening papers; and (says Stephens) it was these whom I met. Dr. Buchan, author of _Domestic Medicine_, generally held a seat in this box; and though he was a Tory, he heard the freest discussion with good humour, and commonly acted as a moderator. His fine physiognomy, and his white hairs, qualified him for this office. But the fixture in the box was a Mr. Hammond, a Coventry manufacturer, who, evening after evening, for nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years, was always to be found in his place, and during the entire period was much distinguished for his severe and often able strictures on the events of the day. He had thus debated through the days of Wilkes, of the American war, and of the French war, and being on the side of liberty, was constantly in opposition. His mode of arguing was Socratic, and he generally applied to his adversary the _reductio ad absurdum_, creating bursts of laughter. The registrar or...", "...out for a walk?

And, leading him to where Dora was standing, he went through with an introduction. Sabaroff bowed, kissed Dora's hand respectfully, and addressed a few commonplace words to her to excuse himself for coming so late. General Ivan Sabaroff, Minister of War to his Majesty the Czar and Autocrat of all the Russias, was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of age, but, thanks to the military bearing which always rejuvenates a man's appearance by a few years, he looked scarcely forty. The ladies declared at once that he was a superb man, and indeed the General had a striking-looking appearance. In the streets of any town, people would have turned round to look at him, the women saying, \"What a fine man!\" the men, \"That is somebody!\" Six feet three in his stockings, broad of shoulder, admirably proportioned, with an...", "...askin' for showin' me where you found it?\" The farmer from the foothills cut his eyes down to crafty slits. \"I was 'lowing just tother day as how a house pattern would come in handy.

Care should be taken to see that the arms are not allowed to drop below the level of the shoulders or to rise more than forty-five degrees. The arms should be raised and lowered ten times. The caution in the \"Grate\" position is not to let the arms drop, even a fraction of an inch, below the horizontal, and not to let them go up above the angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, for in either of these cases there is a distinct rest given to the shoulder muscles. Most of the ordinary exercises of this kind carry the arms above the head; this always releases the effort of the shoulder muscle and is therefore nearly valueless as an exercise for these members. Another fault in this exercise is letting the head come forward. The neck should be kept back all the time.

The creation of this administration was due to the action of King William IV, in dismissing his advisers on the death of Earl Spencer, which removed Lord Althorp from the House of Commons. The king had grown to detest his cabinet for their reforming spirit, but his designs were thwarted by the failure of Sir Robert Peel to form an administration capable of facing the House of Commons. As a consequence, Viscount Melbourne again became premier, and a renewal of the...", "...something, as though there was something behind his door, waiting. He went into the inner offices, at a sudden summons. Hauk was at the table, gazing out of the window; Flaspoller worrying and fussing in the center of the rug, switching aimlessly back and forth.

God knows how much the firm will have to make good. Thirty-five, forty, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand, maybe more. Oh, we're stuck all right.\" \"Do you mean to say,\" said Bojo slowly, \"that he left nothing--no property?\" \"Oh, a house perhaps--mortgaged, of course; and then do we know what else he owes? No. A hell of a hole we've got in with your Pittsburgh & New Orleans.\" \"That's not quite fair,\" said Bojo quietly. \"I did give you a tip on Indiana Smelter and you made money on that. I never said anything about Pittsburgh & New Orleans. I distinctly refused...", "...So he set the basket on the ground and pulled, first on one side and then on the other side.

He was brought up there; he had gone back and forth by that piece of silver, rubbed it with his sleeve, and it seemed to say, \"Come now, now, now, here is a hundred thousand dollars. Why not take me?\" But he would not take it. There was no silver in Newburyport; it was all away off--well, I don't know where; he didn't, but somewhere else--and he was a professor of...", "...had been blameworthy or excusable became an immaterial issue, when they found that the terms of enlistment were soon to expire, and also that just when the war was at its hottest, the patriotism of the people seemed at its coldest.

Thereupon Congress passed an act \"for enrolling and calling out the national forces.\" All able-bodied citizens between twenty and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years of age were to \"perform military duty in the service of the United States, when called on by the President for that purpose.\"[50] This was strenuous earnest, for it portended a draft.

On emerging into the street the two boys parted company. It was time for Paul to go back to his business. Julius was more indifferent to employment. He had five dollars in his pocket, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> dollars deposited with Paul. Accustomed to live from hand to mouth, this made him feel very rich.

Miss Harrow was reticent concerning her brother-in-law; no one, however, had any reason to believe that she found life under his roof disagreeable.

A word of the family history. John, Alfred, and Edmund Yule were the sons of a Wattleborough stationer. Each was well educated, up to the age of seventeen, at the town's grammar school. The eldest, who was a hot-headed lad, but showed capacities for business, worked at first with his father, endeavouring to add a bookselling department to the trade in stationery; but the life of home was not much to his taste, and at...", "...Hotspur's birth to May 20, 1364.[318] The Author, however, is disposed to think that the Annals have antedated his birth by more than a year at least. In the Scrope and Grosvenor (p. 348) controversy,[319] the record of which supplied us with the ages of Glyndowr and his brother, the commissioners examined both Hotspur and his father. The father, usually called the \"aged Earl,\" gave his testimony on the 19th November 1386, as \"the Earl of Northumberland, of the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years, having borne arms thirty years.\" Hotspur, who was examined on the 30th of the preceding October, that is, in the year before Henry of Monmouth was born, gave his testimony as \"Sir Henry Percy, of the age of twenty years.\" Hotspur must, therefore, have been born between the end of October 1365 and the end of October 1366.

They had gone but a few miles when they came upon an Indian village, protected on three sides by swamps, and on the other by thickets and bushes. As the English charged the terrified Indians fled. Many were shot down, many others captured. The queen of the Pamunkeys escaped, and wandered through the woods for days, half starved. Bacon led his men back in triumph, bringing <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> prisoners, and stores of wampum, skins, furs, and English goods. But having broken the power of the Pamunkeys, Bacon had now to meet forces raised by the governor. Soon after the capture of the _Rebecca_ Captain Gardiner joined the little fleet with the _Adam and Eve_. So Berkeley, embarking 200 men on the ships and on six or seven sloops, crossed over to the Western Shore where another hundred joined them. Then they sailed up the James to Jamestown.

A want of acquaintance with the changes in the bar, occasioned probably by the sinking of four or five rafts, flatboats, and an old dry dock by the enemy, resulted in some delays, but the whole squadron at length, with the exception of the frigate Colorado, got safely over, and anchored twelve miles up the river at the head of the passes. The efficiency of mortars, elevated permanently at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, depends chiefly upon an accurate knowledge of the distance to the object to be fired upon. This distance determines the quantity of powder necessary for the discharge, and the length of the fuses to be employed. Captain Porter understood the impossibility of judging and estimating distances and bearings correctly, particularly when the objects are for the most part hidden from view, as was the case with the forts on the wooded and crooked Mississippi, and had...", "...and his book will be forgotten in ten years, while Voltaire's fame will last for ever.

Hence the _Percy Memoir_. He was only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> when he made this request; and he had not suffered much from illness during his life; so that there was apparently no grounds for imagining that the end was near. But at this time Goldsmith began to suffer severe fits of depression; and he grew irritable and capricious of temper--no doubt another result of failing health. He was embroiled in disputes with the booksellers; and, on one occasion, seems to have been much hurt because Johnson, who had been asked to step in as...", "...it tossed them high. Curlie gasped.

As sudden as their entrance into the cloud came their departure. Tossed forth like dust from a cart wheel, the boy found his plane tilting at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees. With a quick intake of breath, he righted the plane and headed her downward. Five minutes later, from out a mass of white they approached a second mass that somehow seemed solid. And so it was. They hit the lake with a force that set their teeth rattling. For a space of seconds it seemed that their ship might go on her nose.

It but little concerns the public whether a cargo of cotton, or beef or pork, or corn is one month or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> days between the United States and England, so that it is safe in the end. It is an annual production that must have an annual transit, and however unnecessarily fast we may become, we can not send more than one crop in the year. The world frequently becomes too fast in every thing; and crises, panics, and bankruptcies follow as legitimate consequences.

There was but one thing to prevent the success of this plan, and that was the presence in the bayous of five American gun-boats, manned by a hundred and eighty men, and commanded by Lieutenant Comdg. Catesby Jones, a very shrewd fighter. So against him was sent Captain Nicholas Lockyer with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> barges, and nearly a thousand sailors and marines, men who had grown gray during a quarter of a century of unbroken ocean warfare. The gun-boats were moored in a head-and-stern line, near the Rigolets, with their boarding-nettings triced up, and every thing ready to do desperate battle; but the British rowed up with strong, swift strokes, through a murderous fire of great guns and musketry; the vessels were grappled amid fierce resistance; the boarding-nettings were slashed...", "...liberty to the captive, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound,\" were diffused and received here, and were spread with no niggard hand, the prison of the Naam-Hoi magistrate, with its unspeakable horrors, would go the way of all our dungeons and bedlams.

Something I heard of a collision with the law and of a forced assignment of his interests.

The rear or driving-wheels were fifty-four inches in diameter on a crank-axle placed in front of the fire-box. The cranks were thirty-nine inches from centre to centre. The front wheels, which were simply carrying wheels, were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> inches in diameter, on an axle placed just back of the cylinders. The cylinders were nine and one-half inches in diameter by eighteen inches stroke, and were attached horizontally to the outside of the smoke-box, which was D-shaped, with the sides receding inwardly, so as to bring the centre line of each cylinder in line with the centre of the crank. The wheels were made with heavy cast-iron hubs, wooden spokes and rims, and wrought-iron tires.

The Great Western, on the contrary, had coal to spare. Two innovations in shipbuilding were soon introduced. These were the building of iron instead of wooden ships and the replacing of the paddle wheel by the screw propeller. The screw-propeller was first successfully introduced by the famous Swede, John Ericsson, in 1835. His propeller was tried in a small vessel, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet long and eight wide, which was driven at the rate of ten miles an hour, and towed a large packet ship at fair speed. Ericsson, not being appreciated in England, came to America to experiment. Other inventors were also at work in the same line. Their experiments attracted the attention of Isambard Brunel, one of the greatest engineers of the period, who was then engaged in building a large paddle-wheel steamer, the Great Britain.

This is the more strange, since their paths almost crossed in the year 1817, when the two men of identical name, title, and profession were within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> miles of each other, one being resident as pastor of the Stow's Square church, three miles north of Lowville in Lewis county, while the Otsego missionary was holding services at Verona in Oneida county.

If a pair of boots was sold at $8.00, the protection the wearer paid the manufacturer was $2.80. The law compels the farmer and laborer to pay that sum as a bounty to the manufacturer. On cotton goods, the consumer pays a duty of from thirty-five to sixty-three per cent. For almost every article of clothing worn by man, woman, and child, a duty must be paid. The average is about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> per cent on the value. Prices are nearly uniform for the same classes of goods, whether of foreign or domestic manufacture. On imported articles the tariff is paid to the government; on domestic manufactures the duty is paid to the manufacturer.

Between each pair of upright forked sticks was placed another cross-piece, thus forming two horizontal bars, parallel to each other, one only a few inches from the bottom of the boat and the other about a foot and a half above the gunwales.

Each pair of slabs was perforated by a longitudinal slit and they were joined firmly at their extremities by finely carved and richly painted end-pieces. The operator strikes the slabs with a wooden mallet or hammer, the head of which is wrapped with an inch layer of caoutchouc and then with a cover of thick tapir-skin. Each section of the wooden slabs gives forth a different note when struck, a penetrating, xylophonic, tone but devoid of the disagreeably...", "...harvested and stored! But that was in the past. For the present, a man was lost in the storm. Franz thought over the affair from every angle. It was probable that Hermann and his father had gone a considerable distance past the Widow Geiser's before they realized they were lost and turned back. On the return trip, they had set a reasonably accurate course. Hermann had left his father an estimated hour before nightfall. Soon after darkness descended, or approximately within the past <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes, a barking dog had guided him to Dornblatt. However, probably, since leaving his father his rate of travel had been that of an exhausted youngster. He had also broken a ski, which, by his own admission, was responsible for more delay. Emil Gottschalk, Franz decided, was approximately forty-five-minutes' skiing time from Dornblatt and the proper direction in which to seek him was toward the Widow Geiser's.

The main currents of the last period, covering <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years, are: victorious capitalism, militarism erected on a capitalist foundation, a political reaction resulting from the intergrowth of feudal and capitalist classes--a revolutionizing of the economic life, and a complete abandonment of revolutionary methods and traditions in political life.

They set him up in the road just outside the station, with his flat-hatted sailors in zealous attendance, where he held a day-long levee. The gun is a remarkable object among the rest of our artillery. Its barrel, immensely long but very slender, has a well-bred, aristocratic look compared with the thick noses of our field-guns. It drives its <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> pound shell about seven miles, and shoots, I am told, with perfect accuracy. It is an enlarged edition of the beautiful little twelve-pounders which we have hitherto been using, and which exceed the range of our fifteen-pounder field-guns by about a half. Why should naval guns be so vastly superior to land ones? I interviewed the sailors on the accomplishments of the new-comer, and on the effects especially of lyddite, about which we hear so much. One must allow for a...", "...so reduced it to a science that it required comparatively small armies to conquer the world. Sulla defeated Mithridates with only thirty thousand men, while his adversary marshalled against him over one hundred thousand. Caesar had only ten legions to effect the conquest of Gaul, and none of these were of Italian origin. At the great decisive battle of Pharsalia, when most of the available forces of the empire were employed on one side or the other, Pompey commanded a legionary army of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand men, and his cavalry amounted to seven thousand more, but among them were included the flower of the Roman nobility; the auxiliary force has not been computed, although it was probably numerous. In the same battle Caesar had under him only twenty-two thousand legionaries and one thousand cavalry. But every man in both armies was prepared to conquer or die. The forces were posted on the open plain, and the battle was really a hand-to-hand encounter, in which the...", "...procuring, etc., and being an incorrigible rogue.

Now the first objection to these punishments is that whether flogging is or is not to be administered depends altogether on the taste and fancy of the presiding Judge.

Out of a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> criminals convicted of robbery only three were flogged. An intending robber therefore who studies judicial \"form\" in the statistics will see that it is about fifty to one against the cat, and if he is the one unfortunate surely he has a distinct grievance against the forty-nine lucky blackguards who escape. When only three criminals receive this punishment in one year it is worth while considering whether it should be continued, or, if it is to be continued, whether it...", "...miles.

The list of pledged men grew, yet still Moore's outlay did not buy the United States senatorship for Robert Burroughs. \"Yes, the whole number of ninety-four,\" confided Moore, patiently, as Burroughs asked for the hundredth time how many members were in the Assembly. They were sitting before a large desk in the inner room of Burroughs' suite, and the Assembly had been in session nearly six weeks. \"I surely have <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> of 'em now?\" anxiously. \"That's the way I've got it figured,\" soothingly. \"Good men? Men who would vote for me anyway?\" Burroughs had lately developed an exasperating desire to believe that some man was his friend with no thought of reward.

The interest of the women was awakened, and ultimately the Society was increased to about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> persons, chosen for their devotion and their wealth. Among the women who founded the new colony was Mademoiselle Jeanne Mance, who was about thirty-four years of age when the Society was organized, and to whom we are told that Christ had appeared in a vision at the early age of seven years, and at the same tender age her biographer says she had bound herself to God by a vow of perpetual chastity. Mlle. Mance, by the divine inspiration, was filled with a longing to go to...", "...thence, that Abraham left his father Zerah[fn39] in Haran alive when he departed, and that he did not die till many ' years afterwards.\" On this Mr. Everett observes, \"The difficulty is this, that Zerah is said in Genesis ch. 11. to have been seventy years old when Abraham was born, and to have lived two hundred and five years. But Abraham is also said to have left Haran when he was aged seventy-five years [Genesis xii. 14.]; at which time of course; his Father was one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years old, and therefore must have lived sixty years after his son Abraham left Haran. But Stephen in the passage in question says, that Abraham left Haran after his Father was dead. Now this direct contradiction is quite cleared up by the Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch, which give the whole age of Zerah exactly 145 years: and confirm the account of Stephen, that Abraham waited till the decease of his father, and then immediately left Haran.

This protocol had the active opposition of the minority of the committee and in the Senate and, in addition, such conservative members as Senator Hale and other prominent Republicans opposed it.

Its success would liquidate the state debt and diminish the annual charges on the treasury, reducing the interest from eighty millions to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> or forty-eight millions. The annual charges from which the treasury was to be relieved were to be paid from the profits on the collection of the revenue and the contingent profits of commerce. The whole operation was to pay the creditors of the state 3 per cent. per annum, and the profits and monopolies heretofore granted to farmers of the revenue and commercial companies. This 3 per cent. interest, these profits, and these monopolies, as we shall soon see, might easily...", "...Reculver in Kent.

Characteristic of his most winning use of this light that he created for his own purposes is the portrait of Nicholas Bruyningh, Secretary of one of the divisions of the Courts of Justice at Amsterdam: one of the most salient and brilliant of the Rembrandts in the Cassel Gallery. This portrait belongs to the year 1652 when the artist was about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years old, and it is a superb example of matured genius. The subject offered an opportunity for daring handling and pictorial arrangement upon which Rembrandt seized with a full understanding of its possibilities.

If a stratum or bed of rock, instead of being quite level, be inclined to one side, it is said to DIP; the point of the compass to which it is inclined is called the POINT OF DIP, and the degree of deviation from a level or horizontal line is called THE AMOUNT OF DIP, or THE ANGLE OF DIP. Thus, in the diagram (Figure 60), a series of strata are inclined, and they dip to the north at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees. The STRIKE, or LINE OF BEARING, is the prolongation or extension of the strata in a direction AT RIGHT ANGLES to the dip; and hence it is sometimes called the DIRECTION of the strata.

During its progress no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> men were killed, and about 400 severely wounded. They were chiefly Roman Catholics, and were it not for the encouragement given by an energetic Roman Catholic priest, he hardly thinks the men would have continued the work.

Now, if this practice of opium smoking has existed, and does exist, throughout these eighteen provinces, over this large and mighty empire, as Mr. Storrs Turner admits, can it be urged for a moment that England has had anything to do with it more than that Englishmen, in common with other foreigners, have imported for the last forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years a quantity of the drug very much less than that actually grown in China itself? I say she has not. I say that opium smoking has existed for a thousand years or more, and that its use by the natives of China is simply limited by the extent of their purchasing power. But how is it that such divergent opinions can exist between Englishmen living in China and certain Englishmen here at home? My answer is, that the former, the English residents in China, derive their...", "...It is the signal.

The path runs along the upper part of a steep slope, which from a perpendicular weathered cliff drops some 400 feet down into a gorge. As the declivity of the slope is about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, and the track in some places only about a foot wide, there is no saving it if an animal loses its foothold, or if its pack slips.

He didn't see him, and he started for the gate. Just as he got outside the gate he saw his fellow townsman and guest stepping into a hack. His fellow townsman and guest looked pretty jaunty, but Busyday didn't notice it. \"Hey, there, old man,\" he called after his friend, and the latter looked around. \"Oh, here you are,\" said Busyday's friend, with an expensive cigar stuck at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees in one corner of his mouth. \"Trimmed?\" \"Nope,\" said Busyday. \"I landed on a few little good things that occurred to me after I got to looking at the program, and I win 'bout a thousand.

The berries are first green, but they afterwards become of a dark purple, and are covered with a fine bloom. The Juniper berries are very fragrant, and the glands in their stones contain a kind of oil. These berries when crushed are used in making gin and hollands. There are a great many species of Juniperus, but one of the most remarkable is the Red Cedar (_J. virginiana_). This is a tree forty feet or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet high. The leaves, when young, are scale-like; but when older they become loose and feathery, so that there are two kinds of leaves on the same tree. The male and female flowers are very small, and the berry is only two-seeded. The sap-wood of this tree is quite white, but the heart-wood is red, and it is used occasionally for making black-lead pencils, particularly those of the commoner kinds, though the Bermuda Juniper is preferred for the superior ones. This last...", "...in turn opposed by the Gothic Society or Scandinavian School, among whom were Ling and Geijer. Franzen and Wallin devoted themselves to religious poetry. The most famous of all modern Swedish poets was Esaias Tegner, whose \"Frithiof's Saga\" achieved an international reputation. Politically, he was conspicuous for his inveterate hostility to the \"Holy Alliance\" and its reactionary spirit in state, church and literature. [Sidenote: Oscar I. of Sweden] Bernadotte's son, Oscar I., was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years old when he ascended the throne. Like his father, he was a patron of the fine arts. Upon his accession several important reforms were at once enacted by the new Riksdag. It was decided that this assembly should meet every third instead of every fifth year; the liberty of the press was extended, and equal rights were accorded to women in certain matters of inheritance and of marriage. This last reform aroused so much criticism that a powerful opposition was organized in...", "...each one foot high and two wide, leading to another gallery, which ran north twelve yards. At the end there came another gallery on the left which ran west ten yards, and at the end of this another on the right, running north about sixty feet.

At the distance of four yards a gallery crossed this at right angles, running north and south, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet long, and walled up at both ends; and three or four yards farther on another gallery crossed it, also running north and south. This last was walled up at the south, and on the north led to still another gallery, which ran east, three yards long. This was stopped by another gallery crossing it, running to the south three yards, when it was walled up, and to the north eight yards when it turned to the west.

To prove this assertion I shall not have recourse to any remote occurrences, but to circumstances which I have myself witnessed, and which belong to our own time. An attentive examination of what is going on in the United States will easily convince us that two opposite tendencies exist in that country, like two distinct currents flowing in contrary directions in the same channel. The Union has now existed for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years, and in the course of that time a vast number of provincial prejudices, which were at first hostile to its power, have died away. The patriotic feeling which attached each of the Americans to his own native State is become less exclusive; and the different parts of the Union have become more intimately connected the better they have become acquainted with each other.

This contract was entered into with M.C. Mordecai of Charleston, who agreed to furnish steamships suitable for war purposes, and to perform a monthly service.[GG] Several other propositions for steamship service to various foreign countries were made to the postmaster-general at this time, but none was accepted.[GH] The pioneer Bremen-Havre line began its service on the first day of June 1847, with two steamers.

The sentiment of De Tocqueville, to which I am in some sense called upon to respond, is one which those of you who have read his work on \"Democracy in America,\" written <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years ago, must know has reference to a much smaller body of judges than now existing. Perhaps I shall entertain you a little by telling you about what are the Federal judges, and how many of them there are. We have fifty-seven or fifty-eight district judges who are Federal judges. We have nine judges of the Circuit Court of the United States; we have five judges of the District of Columbia; we have five judges of the Court of Claims; and we have nine judges of the Supreme...", "...is now made in America, is obtained by skimming the froth from mash while it is in active fermentation.

Precisely the same grades are not produced in the American process of milling, but Dr. Horsford thinks that good, fresh middlings flour will compare favorably with the average Hungarian flour. _The Milling._--A peculiar mode of milling wheat has grown up in Austria and Hungary, which is almost the antipodes of the old and crude methods of grinding.

At last she gave him instructions to draw up the deed and returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if she had drunk four jugs of new cider. When Chicot came again to receive her answer she declared,...", "...corresponding to that which court patronage procured him. He is not to be confounded with a contemporary artist, John Hayter, who produced illustrations for the _Book of Beauty_, &c. HAYTON (HAITHON, HETHUM), king of Little Armenia or Cilicia from 1224 to 1269, traveller in western and central Asia, Mongolia, &c., was the son of Constantine Rupen, and became heir to the throne of Lesser Armenia by his marriage with Isabella, daughter and only child of Leo II. After a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years he abdicated (1269) in favour of his son Leo III., became a monk and died in 1271. Before his accession he had been \"constable,\" or head of the Armenian army, and \"bailiff\" of the realm. Throughout his reign he followed the policy of friendship and alliance with the overwhelming power of the Mongols. In about 1248 he sent his brother Sempad, who was now constable in his place, on a mission to Kuyuk Khan, the supreme Mongol emperor. Sempad was well received and returned...", "...Montcalm had not yet met his match. Bradstreet, however, with seven hundred Massachusetts men and eleven hundred New Yorkers, crossed Lake Ontario and took Port Frontenac, the garrison fleeing at their approach. Amherst, on hearing of Abercrombie's cowardice, embarked for Boston with over four thousand men, marched thence to Albany and on to the camp; Abercrombie was sent to England, and Amherst took his place as chief. The capture of Fort Duquesne was the first thing planned. Over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> hundred men were raised in South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia; Joseph Forbes commanded them as brigadier-general; Washington led the Virginians; John Armstrong and the boy, Anthony Wayne, were with the Pennsylvanians.

Brask, in writing to Abo, told the bishop that his quota was three thousand marks, but did not name to him the individual amounts to be contributed by the other bishops. Gustavus, in a letter to the members of his Cabinet in Finland, was even more unfair. He told them that Abo was to pay three thousand marks, and added that Linkoeping and Skara were to pay the same. Brask's letter is particularly important in that it puts the balance of the debt to Lubeck at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> thousand Lubeck marks, equivalent to ninety thousand Swedish marks, of which amount the archbishop and bishops were expected to raise fifteen thousand marks. Brask, with his usual shrewdness, urged the king to pay the debt that autumn, and thus get rid of Lubeck before the winter came. Gustavus doubtless shared with him this view, but there were several grave difficulties in the way. Early in October the monarch held a conference with the Lubeck envoys, and found the...", "...within his grasp. Five seconds more--then three--then two. Now the spar with its deadly torpedo was almost touching the _Huascar's_ side-- _Crash_! A rending sound of ripping and tearing timber and another awful crash came immediately afterward, and every man in the _Blanco Encalada's_ launch was hurled off his feet, and thrown either into the bottom of the boat or overboard, while the little steamer's bows rose bodily out of the water until her keel reached an angle of almost <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees, and there she stuck, still quivering in every timber from the shock. In a second Jim realised the terrible truth. By some means or other the Peruvians had got wind of the intended attack, and had placed a stout boom of timber all round the ship, and it was upon this obstacle that the Chilian launch had charged at full speed, running right up on to it with the force of the blow, and remaining there immovable and almost a wreck. Jim's first thought was of how to...", "...in the tower. The first man to sight the object called it a parachute; others said ice cream cone, round, etc. All of these descriptions fit a balloon. Buried deep in the file were two more references to balloons that I had previously missed. Not long after the object had disappeared from view at Godman AFB, a man from Madisonville, Kentucky, called Flight Service in Dayton. He had seen an object traveling southeast. He had looked at it through a telescope and it was a balloon. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> an astronomer living north of Nashville, Tennessee, called in. He had also seen a UFO, looked at it through a telescope, and it was a balloon. In the thousands of words of testimony and evidence taken on the Mantell Incident this was the only reference to balloons. I had purposely not paid too much attention to this possibility because I was sure that it had been thoroughly checked back in 1948. Now I wasn't sure. I talked with one of the people who had been in on the...", "...been deposed by the great mogul, who placed Anaverdy Khan in his room, ha resolved to recover his government by force, and had recourse to the French general at Pondicherry, who reinforced him with two thousand sepoys, or soldiers of the country, sixty caffrees, and four hundred and twenty French troops, on condition that, if he proved successful in his enterprise, he should cede to the French the town of Velur, in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, with its dependencies, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> villages.

This is often a great advantage, but such free kick does not produce a goal unless the ball touches one of the other players on its way to the post. Ordinarily a goal is scored when the ball goes between the goal-posts and under the cross-bar, not being thrown, knocked on or carried. The regulation duration of a game is an hour and a half, and ends are changed at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes. The side winning the toss has the choice of ends or kick-off, and the one obtaining the majority of goals wins. A goal cannot be scored from a free kick except when the free kick has been allowed by the referee as a penalty for certain infringements of the rules by the opposite side; and if such infringement take place within the penalty area on the part of a player on the side then defending the goal, and in the judgment of the referee be intentional, a \"penalty...", "...outweighed the odds against them.

Their victory had cost them dear, for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> of their comrades lay dead, and nearly all the remainder were more or less seriously wounded; but there was no time for regrets. The victorious cavaliers rushed to the sanctuaries to find that the cross and the image of the Virgin had disappeared from the one they had appropriated, and that in the other, before the grim figure of Huitzilopochtli, lay the usual offering of human hearts, possibly those of their own countrymen!

Henry was much displeased with the ill success of this enterprise; and it was with difficulty that Dorset, by explaining the fraudulent conduct of Ferdinand, was at last able to appease him.

Sir Thomas Knevet, master of horse, was sent to the coast of Brittany with a fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> sail; and he carried with him Sir Charles Brandon, Sir John Carew, and many other young courtiers, who longed for an opportunity of displaying their valor.

On the other hand, the enemy might discharge a volley into his force, placed about six feet apart, with comparatively little effect.

Then she saw a gentleman standing in the middle of the room, from which her aunt had discreetly retired. She would never have known him. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years old, and his figure was not that of the straight, slim young man she remembered. But it was a very fine person, and a fair and lustrous beard, spreading itself upon a well-presented chest, contributed to its effect.

He stood in a deeply deferential attitude, with his eyes on her face. \"I have ventured--I have...", "..._Content_, nor was the slightest clue obtained as to what became of her.

Sawtell felt no pain in the heat of battle. Instinctive gunman that he was, he fell flat upon his belly, jerking out a second revolver with his left hand.

One of the conspicuous results of cheapened transportation and the facility with which the products of field, forest, mine, and factory can be transferred to the consumer has been the rapid increase in population of all our cities. In 1890 over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> per cent of the population of New York State (nearly six millions) was concentrated in four cities, while it is estimated that the greater city of New York contains at present not less and probably more than fifty per cent of the State's population. Nor is this tendency characteristic only of American cities, though the general impression seems to be that it is more conspicuous with us. In fact, many European cities (notably those of Germany) have outstripped ours in growth....", "...his temperament was not one to be depressed by the quick step of stressful events. The arrival in town of men a-gallop and inflamed by liquor was not in those days unusual, and was regarded with a certain tolerance. The law was accustomed to let youth have its fling and later, under circumstances more auspicious, to serve a writ on the offender and hale him in a spirit of contrition before the magistrate. This, however, was no ordinary day. Had Newt Spooner timed his demonstration for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> minutes earlier, his coming would have set such a large storm thundering that no peace-maker could have averted battle. Newt had waited, hoping to placate the Deacon, and had failed. Now, in desperation, he was running amuck. For a moment, Micah French, loitering at the curb in front of the court-house, failed to grasp the significance of the matter. He followed the course of usage, and allowed Newt to pass by. But the Deacon, standing in a doorway which McAllister and...", "...has rendered. We can easily imagine the present Machine, without the phonograph, but not without the telephone. And we cannot imagine the present Machine to exist without the gas engine, invented the same year by Dr. Otto, that made possible the use of large units of mechanical power, without the need of boilers or condensers or other external appliances; for the combustion of the fuel was carried on inside the engine itself. This invention has been followed by many others during the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years that have since gone by, in which oil has taken the place of gas. Petrol or gasolene has been the oil (or spirit) most used; but engines of the Deisel type, employing heavy oils, have now come into being in large numbers. It is easy to underestimate the influence of the gas-engine, or oil-engine (usually called the internal combustion engine), as is proved by the fact that most people do so; despite the evidence of its importance on all sides, in the shape of...", "...us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided answer.

It is true that he is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> years old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.

His external balloon, which had the dimensions given above, contained a less one of the same shape, which was only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> feet in horizontal, and sixty-eight feet in vertical diameter. The capacity of this interior balloon was only sixty-seven thousand cubic feet: it was to float in the fluid surrounding it.

In the single tuft, about as large as the palm of one's hand, we counted <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> green fronds. Their lower surfaces, in many cases, were covered with confluent fruit-dots. The plant had much the effect of a rather small specimen of the Mountain Spleenwort. The short, broad fronds were somewhat leathery, with only a few pinnae.

There were to be eighty, besides Paris; and as they were designed to be as nearly as possible equal to a square of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> miles, they differed widely in population and property. They were to have an average of nine deputies each: three for the superficial area, which was invariable; three, more or less, for population; and again three, more or less, according to the amount which the department contributed to the national income. In this way territory, numbers and wealth were represented equally. Deputies were to be elected in three degrees.

His dark hair, mixed at intervals with thin lines of silver, was cut short behind, contrary to the usage of the times, and his neck was bare, the collar of his superbly laced shirt being folded broadly back over the cape of his pourpoint.

It ran at the rate of two knots per hour, its general set being about north-east. The weather falling calm, we were several days within its influence. When it had drifted us as far to the northward as I desired to go, I was obliged to let go a kedge in fifty fathoms water to prevent further drift.

THE CHARACTER OF ADMIRAL FARRAGUT. The brilliant and victorious career which has secured for Farragut a leading place among the successful naval commanders of all time was of brief duration, and began at an age when men generally are thinking rather of relaxing their efforts than of undertaking new and extraordinary labors. The two great leaders of the United States armies during the civil war--Grant and Sherman--were not over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> when the return of peace released them from their cares; while Nelson and Napoleon were but a year older than these when Trafalgar and Waterloo terminated their long careers.

Though not unprecedented, the display of activity and of sustained energy...", "...the Books of the Bible, p. 75. In the latter part of the seventeenth century, Allix first observed the older writing under the works of Ephraem.

Although many of the militia were killed during the flight, this account is probably exaggerated. It would seem too, that while the continental troops kept the field, the loss on both sides, in that part of the action, must have been nearly equal.

The first cause was the union of Scotland with England, in 1707, which struck a heavy blow at the Scotch aristocracy. By it, the legislature of the smaller country was absorbed in that of the larger, and the hereditary legislators suddenly sunk into insignificance.

The woodpecker sat on his perch with wings held tightly against his sides, \"humped\" up as though he were high-shouldered. The plumage of his breast was puffed out so broadly that it came over the wings, and in a front view completely hid them, while the feathers of his shoulders were erected till he resembled a lady with a fur shoulder cape.

The tones were delivered in a sharp staccato style, like \"picking\" the strings of a violin very softly, several notes uttered with queer sidewise jerks of the head, and eyes apparently fixed on the goldfinch.

HOW TO CALCULATE THE POWER APPLIED.--In a previous chapter reference was made to a plane at an angle of forty-five degrees, to which two scales were attached, one to get its horizontal pull, or drift, and the other its vertical pull, or lift. PULLING AGAINST AN ANGLE.--Let us take the same example in our aeroplane. Assuming that it weighs 900 pounds, and that the angle of the planes is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> degrees. If we suppose that the air beneath the plane is a solid, and frictionless, and a pair of scales should draw it up the incline, the pull in doing so would be one-half of its weight, or 450 pounds. It must be obvious, therefore, that its force, in moving downwardly, along the surface A, Fig. 60, would be 450 pounds. The incline thus shown has thereon a weight B, mounted on wheels a, and the forwardly-projecting cord represents the power, or propeller pull,...", "...throughout, of a glaucous hue, covered with four or five sheaths which closely embrace it.

CHAPTER XI THE ROMANCE OF VARNISH A separation of six months makes in the middle years of a man's life little break in a relationship. Human life was compared over two thousand years ago by a Greek philosopher to the stream that is never the same from one moment to another. And though, indeed, nothing is permanent, though everything is in flux, the stream during the later stages of its passage flows quietly through soft meadows to the sea. A man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> who has been married for several years may leave his family to go abroad and returning at the end of the year find his wife, his home, his friends, to all appearances, exactly as he left them.

This process in some degree corresponds to the manner in which English magistrates dismiss a case or commit the prisoner to quarter sessions or assizes, but the powers of the _juge d'instruction_ are more arbitrary and absolute. The highest tribunal in France is the _cour de cassation_, sitting at Paris, and consisting of a first president, three sectional presidents and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> _conseillers_, with a ministerial staff (_parquet_) consisting of a _procureur-general_ and six advocates-general. It is divided into three sections: the Chambre des Requetes, or court of petitions, the civil court and the criminal court. The _cour de cassation_ can review the decision of any other tribunal, except administrative courts. Criminal appeals usually go straight to the criminal section, while civil appeals are generally taken before the Chambre des Requetes,...", "...one that the French were expelled from the little town, which they had strongly barricaded; and on the hither side of the Braye they renewed their resistance in the numerous hamlets and farmsteads. A long fire fight was kept up in the thick fog; but at length, at about four o'clock, the 12th Brigade pushed forward to the edge of the valley. The 9th Brigade took possession of Savigny without meeting any serious opposition, and Sarge was stormed in the dusk. The IIIrd Corps had lost <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> men and had taken 200 prisoners. It found quarters behind the Braye, but threw forward outposts on its western bank. The IXth Corps found shelter in and about Epuisay, and thus, as a matter of fact, two corps were now crowded on one of the few available roads.

The fears and apprehensions of the Carthaginians now increased to such a degree that they thought it necessary to recall Hannibal from Italy, and at the same time they sued for peace.

The Carthaginians, however, whose only object was to gain time, made no objections to the conditions, but only concluded a truce of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> days, during which an embassy was to be sent to Rome. Before this truce was at an end, the Carthaginian populace plundered some Roman vessels with provisions, which were wrecked off Carthage, and even insulted the Roman envoys who came to demand reparation.

The Coteau du Lac Rapid, six miles above the former, is two miles long, equally intricate in channel, and in some places only sixteen feet wide. Long Sault, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> miles above the preceding, is nine or ten miles long, with generally the same depth of water throughout. It is intersected by several islands, through whose channels the water rushes with great velocity, so that boats are carried through it, or on it, at the rate of twenty-seven miles an hour; at the foot of the rapid the water takes a sudden leap over a slight precipice, whence its name.

The participles can be made into nouns and adverbs by changing the final _-a_ into _-o_ and _-e_ respectively: thus _tenonto_, \"the future holder,\" _perdinte_, \"through having lost.\" The table of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-five</span> correlative pronouns, adjectives and adverbs is also elaborate and ingenious. Much ingenuity is displayed in the syntax, as well as some happy simplifications.

From the first discharge of the \"Epervier\" two round shot struck the \"Peacock's\" foreyard nearly in the same place, which so weakened the spar as to deprive the ship of the use of her foresail and foretopsail; that is, practically, of all sail on the foremast.

Her loss in men was eight killed, and fifteen wounded; the \"Peacock\" had two wounded. In extenuation of this disproportion in result, James states that in the first broadside three of the \"Epervier's\" carronades were unshipped; and that, when those on the other side were brought into action by tacking, similar mishaps occurred. Further, the moment the guns got warm they drew out the breeching bolts.
