For a moment he did not answer, and in the soft light it seemed to her that a shadow of pain passed over his face. Again she put out her hand and touched his. \"What are you going to do?\" she asked, below her breath. At last he raised his head and looked fully at her. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> going back to the East. The hardest task of my life is awaiting me there.

Its theme is the evening of life, and it was written when Lyte felt the shadows of death gathering about his own head. We catch his meaning in the second stanza: Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away. Lyte was always frail in health.

'Communism was never preached by Christ, although it was practised under His very eyes by the Essenes. This absolute silence is equivalent to an implicit condemnation.'[3] [Footnote 1: _Histoire du...", "...you called me Philip,\" said d'Avranche, smiling. \"We were lads together.\" \"It's different now,\" answered Delagarde. \"Nothing is different at all, of course,\" returned d'Avranche carelessly, yet with the slightest touch of condescension, as he held out his hand.

Much, again, from a different cause, comes from our own absurd want of self-respect, which has accrued in this confusion of etiquette in a republic, as for instance, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> a lady--as much a lady as anybody--and I want to be called a lady,\" remarked a nurse who came for a situation to the wife of one of our presidents. \"I have just engaged a colored _lady_ as a cook,\" remarked a _nouveau riche_.

As they walked away together, Mr. Fenwick had just a word to say to Mr. Puddleham. \"My friend,\" he said, \"you were quite right about his lordship's acres.\" \"Those are the numbers,\" said Mr. Puddleham. \"I mean that you were quite right to make the observation.

Now there was only one more little test for him to undergo. \"If you can bring me what I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> thinking about by to-morrow noon, then you may have me and keep me.\" The youth felt as though he had been condemned to death; for it seemed altogether impossible for him to know of what the princess was thinking, and still more impossible to bring her the thing in question. And when he came to his room his comrade could scarcely quiet him. He said he would take the matter in hand, as he had done on the other occasions, and at last the youth grew calmer, and lay down to sleep. In...", "...\"Certainly, sir, if you desire it,\" replied Paul, giving the necessary order. \"May I ask for a few moments' private conversation with you?\" added the professor, as he led the way aft.

'I'd not dare to take a false oath, when I might die in a couple of days,' groaned Dalton. Dr Tom thought this probable. Even if Abe Dalton recovered, he might, for once in a way, keep his oath; at anyrate he would risk it, and Jim Dennis would be safe from the gang.

The young man picked up his hat. He was still hot with anger. Maraton pointed to the room on the threshold of which the girl was still standing. \"If you wish to speak to me,\" he said, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> quite at your service. Only it is a little late for a visit, isn't it? And yours seems to be a rather unceremonious way, of insisting upon it. Who are you?\" The young man stood and stared at his questioner. He was wearing a blue serge suit, obviously ready-made, thick boots, a doubtful collar, a machine-knitted silk tie of vivid colour. He had curly fair hair, a sharp face with narrow eyes, thick lips and an indifferent complexion. \"Are you Maraton?\" he demanded. \"I am,\"...", "...something fiendish in its fine mockery;--moved with a quick revulsion of feeling I turned the pistol downwards and held its muzzle firmly against the table near me. \"_You_ say that!\" I exclaimed in acute anguish,--\"_you_ say it--seeing me thus!

Something lurid and unearthly in his expression appalled me, ... I trembled and grew cold with fear. Mechanically I replaced the pistol in its case,----then I gazed up at him with a vacant wonder and wild piteousness, seeing that his dark and frowning figure seemed to increase in stature, towering above me like the gigantic shadow of a storm-cloud!

Three days ago I was in condition--during one horribly long night--to sympathetically roast with you in your \"hell of troubles.\" During that night I was back again where I was in the black days when I was buried under a mountain of debt. I called the daughters to me in private council and paralysed them with the announcement, \"Our outgo has increased in the past 8 months until our expenses are now 125 per cent....", "...one solution applicable to both. It is not the case that there is a science of abstract Physics corresponding to the science of Mathematics and sharing in the same character of necessity. In Mathematics we have truths which we cannot but accept, and accept as universal and necessary: in Physics we have no such truths, nor has Kant even endeavoured to prove that we have. The very question therefore that we are asked to solve in regard to Mathematics does not present itself in Physics. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> constrained to believe that two and two are four and not five; I am not constrained to believe that if one event is followed by another a great many times it will be so followed always. And the question is, why, without any constraint, I nevertheless so far believe it that I require special evidence in any given case to convince me to the contrary. And Kant's answer is irrelevant.

He was not a man who easily showed emotion, but there were traces of it now in his face. The hand which rested on the back of his chair shook. There was in his eyes the look of a man who sees evil things. \"It is too late, Blanche,\" he said. \"You cannot be in earnest?\" \"Why not?\" she murmured, dropping her eyes. \"I am tired of my life. What you owed me then you owe me now. Why should it be too late? I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not an old woman yet, nor are you an old man, and I am weary of being alone.\" Mannering walked to the window. His hand went to his forehead. It was damp and cold. He was afraid! If she were in earnest! And she spoke like a woman who knew her mind. She was always, he remembered, a creature of caprice.

So I will say at once, without further procrastination, that Liza, from the very first day, fell passionately in love with the Prince, and the Prince fell in love with her--partly for the lack of anything to do, but also partly because Liza really was a very charming creature. There was nothing remarkable in the fact that they fell in love with each other. He, in all probability, had not in the least expected to find such a pearl in such a wretched shell (I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> speaking of the God-forsaken town of O***), and she, up to that time, had never beheld, even in her dreams, anything in the least like this brilliant, clever, fascinating aristocrat.

Of this she took the fullest advantage. \"If I am not allowed to receive visits from a man of the Duke of Richmond's rank, who comes with honourable intentions, then I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> a slave in a free country.

On his knees he begged her forgiveness for the injury he had done her....", "...at all. As she sat there patiently, her eyes darted from one to the other as they consulted and only came to rest on Senator Jones when he spoke directly to her again. \"And what steps can you take to undo, hum, this?\" \"So far, none,\" admitted Miss Francis, \"but since this thing has happened I have given all my time to experiment hoping in some manner to reverse the action of the Metamorphizer and evolve a formula whereby the growth it induced will be inhibited.

I cannot say I am even optimistic of success, but it is not for want of trying--be assured of that.\" Another semisilence while the committee conferred once more. Finally Senator Jones spoke in...", "...poverty.\" \"Yes, sir, and I won't pretend that it is not a hard trial to me, but if I can get a chance to earn my own living, I will not complain.\" \"Goodnow, a word with you,\" said the Englishman, and he drew his friend aside. \"Can't you make room for this boy in your establishment?\" Otis Goodnow hesitated. \"At present there is no vacancy,\" he said. \"Make room for him, and draw upon me for his wages for the first six months.\" \"I will do so, but before the end of that time I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sure he will justify my paying him out of my own pocket.\" There was a little further conference, and then the two gentlemen came up to where Rodney was standing with Mr. O'Connor. \"My boy,\" said Mr. Mulgrave, \"my friend here will give you a place at five dollars a week. Will that satisfy you?\" Rodney's face flushed with pleasure. \"It will make me very happy,\" he said. \"Come round to my warehouse--here is my business card--tomorrow morning,\" said the merchant. \"Ask to see...", "...Nancy was flattered, as who would not have been over this frank compliment. A rosy flush spread over her face and the dimple deepened in her cheek. \"You see, you are an unusual type in this country, Miss Brown,\" continued the Japanese. \"You must expect to arouse comment wherever you go. Hair with so much color to it, like polished copper and curling, too, causes much admiration. You are very different from the Japanese.\" Again Nancy felt flattered. \"I really believe I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> rather pretty,\" she thought. What she said was: \"You are very kind, Mr. Ito, but I am sure I think the Japanese girls are just as pretty as American girls. Little Onoye, our maid, is charming. She is a perfect picture.\" For the rest of the day, however, vain Nancy was enveloped in a rosy cloud of self-satisfaction. It was pleasing to be admired and still more pleasing to feel that the admiration was justified. The truth is, that admiration was quite as stimulating to Nancy as...", "...then her pride and anger got the better of her. 'I fail to see why it is impossible, nor why you should persist in wishing to read a letter which I tell you I did not wish my sister to write to you.

Mrs. Stokes rejoiced too, and pledged her own sons as playfellows for the little visitors. And when the appointed time came, Bessie did as she had said, and made a journey to Norminster, taking Mrs. Betts with her to bring the children over. Their father and pretty young mother consented to their going with the less reluctance because it seemed the first step towards...", "...to you, so you would understand. I am so sorry.\" \"You and your father are already forgiven. If there were a grain of ill-feeling against him this afternoon, it all completely vanished when I heard him talk at the services.\" \"You were there?\" \"Yes.

One evening, in Kansas City I stopped to listen to two young men preaching on the street. They were just boys, and they did not have the appearance of preachers.

Austin had not known of any such debt and now inquired of his caller until he had the man's side of the story. Later he investigated the matter until he was satisfied that it was a just debt. His father had left in his care a few hogs, and their sale would pay the debt and leave a little over. Austin was confident that his father would never come back and had intended not to pay the debt at...", "...Faithful to this principle, he always kept some one near, whose mission it was to enjoy himself at his expense.

Moreover, I had lived in two haunted houses--both abroad. In one of these, an old Italian palace, which bore the reputation of being very badly haunted indeed, and which had recently been twice abandoned on that account, I lived eight months, most tranquilly and pleasantly: notwithstanding that the house had a score of...", "...her, to that degree, lest the King should be put in the opposers' hands, that they determined to buy my Lady H- off; and they gave her 4000 pounds to desist, which she did, and my Lord Fanny bought a good house with it, and furnished it very well.

And since you can like such sort of accounts as I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> able to give you, I will continue to do it. I think it is very plain now that Sir Robert don't think it worth his while to make any proposals where it was once suspected he would. And his wedding was celebrated as if he had been King of France, and the apartments furnished in the richest manner: crowds of people of the first quality being presented to the bride, who is the daughter of a clerk that sung the psalms in a church where Dr. Sacheverell was. After the struggle among...", "...not whose life must be the sacrifice, were not my children, and the dynasty which I have founded, dearer to me than the welfare of the whole realm? Thou, Psamtik, thou art the man, branded by the gods, feared by men--the man to whose heart love and friendship are strangers, whose face is never seen to smile, nor his soul known to feel compassion! It is not, however, through thine own sin that thy nature is thus unblessed, that all thine undertakings end unhappily. Give heed, for now I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> forced to relate what I had hoped long to keep secret from thine ears. After dethroning my predecessor, I forced him to give me his sister Tentcheta in marriage. She loved me; a year after marriage there was promise of a child.

Bending down, I beheld a cypress-tree springing from her heart. It grew larger...", "...me his hand. \"Good day to you, Allan,\" he said effusively. \"I have just heard from my uncle that I have to congratulate you, about Marie I mean, and, believe me, I do so with all my heart.\" Now, as he spoke these words, remembering what I had just heard, my blood boiled in me, but I thought it wise to control myself, and therefore only answered: \"Thank you.\" \"Of course,\" he went on, \"we have both striven for this prize, but as it has pleased God that you should win it, why, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not one to bear malice.\" \"I am glad to hear it,\" I replied. \"I thought that perhaps you might be.

Then he made a movement to go, but half-way to the door stopped irresolutely. I thought he was about to speak again, but after a pause of a second or two he went on, opened the door with an unsteady hand, and went out without closing it behind him. The man I had told to wait outside must have been upon the watch, for I heard his voice at the very instant at which Brunow set foot in the narrow passage. \"Well, sir?\" he said. \"Well?\" said Brunow. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sorry to press this claim, sir,\" said the man, \"but I have my instructions, and I can't help it.

He immediately ordered his carriage, and had barely time to hear that Reilly had been sentenced to transportation for seven years. His...", "...did.

No matter how sure I may feel of my own goodness, I have no certainty of faith, such as that which Mary Magdalen had, or that which was vouchsafed to the penitent thief on the cross, that I am justified.

The poor man was sweating, and passing his hand over his forehead. He seemed unable to utter a word. \"How is it, Santiago?\" asked Aunt Isabel, anxiously. He answered her with a sigh and dried away a tear. \"For God's sake, speak! What has happened?\" \"What I had already feared!\" he broke out finally half crying. \"All is lost! Father Damaso orders that the engagement be broken. If it is not broken off, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> condemned in this life and in the next.

I told the Fathers so, but they would take no notice of it. 'Which do you prefer to lose,' they said to me, 'fifty thousand pesos, or your life and your soul?' Alas! Ay! San Antonio!

Never again, she knew, would she see the love-light in them. He plucked himself from the spot where he had stood looking at her and walked to the window. When he wheeled round there was no anger on his face, only a pathetic wonder that he had been deceived so easily. It was at himself that he was smiling grimly rather than at her, and the change pained...", "...\"Well,\" said Rupert pondering, \"perhaps whatever is hidden is tied to a string or a chain and is dropped down the trunk of one of the four trees--or perhaps in the stump.\" \"Not in the stump,\" said Olivia quickly, \"for then the line would be visible, while in the other trees it would be concealed in the thick foliage. I fancy the line must be down the copper beech trunk, as there is but one red bead.\" \"There is but one tree though--one copper beech you know,\" said her husband. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> inclined to think that to make things safer, the hiding place must be in one of the green trees signified by the jade beads. The question is, which tree is it?\" Olivia looked at the fan again, and as she did so started. Rupert also raised his head. They heard the sound of wheels scrunching the gravel outside, and wondered who was arriving so late. The clock pointed to half-past ten. The servants had gone to bed, so Rupert followed by his wife, who was rather nervous, went to the...", "...purchaser. You might, perhaps, for forty thousand dollars, or even less, get a mortgage that would bring you in five per cent. on forty-five thousand dollars.\" \"I have thought of that,\" replied the baron; \"but the security for such mortgages as these, which come into the hands of you brokers, is exceedingly poor, and I can not rely on it.\" Ehrenthal waived off this reproach, and said, in a tone of virtuous indignation against all dealers in insecure mortgages, \"For my own part, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> very shy of mortgages altogether, and such as are in the market are not fit for the baron, of course. You must apply to a trustworthy man; your own lawyer, for instance, may be able to procure you a good mortgage.\" \"Then you really know of none?\" said the baron, secretly hoping that he did. \"I know of none,\" was the positive reply; \"but if you wish, I can inquire; there are always some to be had. Your lawyer can tell you what he would consider good security; only you would have...", "...I. 'Got to pay an indemnity? or what?'

But Asako asked the question,-- \"Why is the choice so small?\" \"You see,\" he said, \"there are not many girls in Japan who can speak both English and French, and as I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> going into the Diplomatic Service and shall leave Japan again shortly, that is an absolute necessity; besides, she must have a very good degree from her school.\" Geoffrey could hardly restrain himself from laughing. This idea of choosing a wife like a governess for her linguistic accomplishments seemed to him exceedingly comic. \"You don't mind trusting other people,\" he said, \"to arrange your marriage for you?\" \"Certainly not,\" said the young Japanese, \"they are my own...", "...since you are so desirous,\" he said, in an indulgent tone. Max came hurrying in. \"We can go up now, papa,\" he said; \"the others have come down.\" Edward and Zoe were just behind the boy. \"Oh, you ought all to go up,\" cried the latter; \"the view's just splendid.\" \"Mother,\" said Edward, \"the view is very fine, but there are sixty steps, each a foot high; a pretty hard climb for a lady, I should think. Will you go up? may I have the pleasure of helping you?\" \"Yes,\" she answered; \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> quite strong and well, and think the view will probably pay for the exertion.\" They took the lead, the captain following with Lulu, and Max bringing up the rear. Having reached the top and viewed the great light (one of the finest on the coast) from the interior, Elsie stepped outside, and holding fast to Edward's hand made the entire circuit, enjoying the extended view on all sides. Stepping in again, she drew a long breath of relief. \"I should not like to try that in a...", "...a man to show it you, I pray God put you some day in my hand That you may take that too. DARNLEY.

Darkness came on, creeping in a blue haze across the water. Shortly after nightfall there was a faint, weird moaning away on the surface of the sea, which glowed like liquid fire under the rail of the yacht. \"It's the auld nick av a blow we'll have,\" declared Barney to Frank. \"Oi don't loike it at all, at all.\" \"You like it quite as well as I do,\" admitted Merriwell. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not familiar with these waters, and I do not fancy the idea of piling up on lea shore.\" The moaning arose to a shrill cry, and then the wind came with a sudden rush, catching the _Greyhound_ and knocking her on beam ends in a twinkling. Frank assisted Barney at the helm, shouting: \"Hold fast, everybody!\" The little vessel righted, and then away she leaped, laying hard over to port, with the rail awash. Like a frightened race horse the _Greyhound_ sped away, with the...", "...his leisure; here he robbed his nights of sleep in ceaseless and indefatigable study. Leo felt as if he must make sure of a weapon, but in this peaceful little kingdom there was nothing of the kind in evidence. Silently he sat down, and confronted his friend with mute hostility.

Something is wrong with you ... No; don't contradict me.

At all events, you are concealing something from me, and I have been wondering for a long time what it...", "...sir.

He had no difficulty in finding the Governor, a greatly perturbed man, for an escape is a very serious matter. The official was inclined to be brusque in his manner, but again the magic card produced a soothing effect. \"I am rather rattled,\" said the Governor. \"One of my men has got away. I suppose you know that?\" \"And I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> afraid another of your men is going away, sir,\" said T. X., who had a curious reverence for military authority. He produced his paper and laid it on the governor's table. \"This is an order for the release of John Lexman, convicted under sentence of fifteen years penal servitude.\" The Governor looked at it. \"Dated last night,\" he said, and breathed a long sigh of relief. \"Thank the Lord!--that is the man who escaped!\" CHAPTER VIII Two years after the events just...", "...gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 46:012:029 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 46:012:030 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 46:012:031 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. 46:013:001 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 46:013:002 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 46:013:003 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 46:013:004...", "...very wonderful to see; and there was a big fish, all gilt, where they sold herrings; but, in the town-hall there seemed something more than usual going on, for great crowds were there, and dragoons were galloping in and galloping out, and all was confusion. \"What's this?\" said I. \"Are the dykes open?\" But not one would mind me; and then suddenly I heard some one call out my name. \"Where is Van Hoogendorp?\" said one; and then another cried, \"Where is Van Hoogendorp?\" \"Here <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> I,\" said I; and the same moment two officers, covered with gold lace, came through \"the crowd, and took me by the arms. \"Come along with us, Monsieur de Hoogendorp,\" said they, in French; \"there is not a moment to lose; we have been looking for you every where.\" Now, though I understand that tongue, I cannot speak it myself, so I only said \"Ja, Ja,\" and followed them.

Spinozism itself, as such, as well as Oriental pantheism, contains this doctrine: that the divine in all things is no more than that which is universal in their content, their essence; and in such sense that this essence is conceived of as a determinate essence. When Brahma says, \"In the metal I am the brightness of its shining; among the rivers I am the Ganges; I am the life of all that lives,\" he thereby suppresses the individual. He says not, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> the metal, the rivers, the individual things of various kinds as such, nor in the fashion of their immediate existence.\" Here, at this stage, what is expressed is no longer pantheism; but rather that of the essence in individual things.

The unusual delay of the post deprives me of the pleasure of hearing from you this evening. This I regret the more, as your last makes me particularly anxious for that which I expected by this post.

From the commencement of the year 1785 until the year 1788, Colonel Burr took but little part in the political discussions of the day. In the year 1787 the opinion had become universal that the states could not be kept together under the existing articles of confederation. On the second Monday in May, 1787, a convention met in Philadelphia for the...", "...preferred before me: for He was before me. For of His fulness we all received, and grace for grace.

And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou? And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not the Christ. And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet. And they had been sent from the Pharisees.

Is there no voice within you that says I speak truly, and that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> indeed your brother?\" The Pope made no reply, but gazed with troubled look at the angel's unruffled face. Then the Emperor Valmond laughed and said: \"Brother, methinks you have strange taste to keep a madman for your court-jester!\" It seemed quite evident to the bystanders that what the Emperor said was very true, and once more, baffled and disgraced, the poor jester was roughly thrust back among the wondering crowd.

He has written lately a number of Poems (thirty-two in all), some of them of considerable length (the longest one hundred and sixty lines), the greater number of these, to my feelings, very excellent compositions, but here and there a daring humbleness of language and versification, and a strict adherence to matter of fact, even to prolixity, that startled me.

Well, you know which is the common extreme in such cases; and at all events we shall avoid the usual pitfall.

Rachel felt very angry, without knowing that she was most angry with herself for not feeling angrier still.

Burke soon had ample...", "...there, Mr. Jukes?\" asked Captain MacWhirr. This unusual form of address, though mumbled rather than spoken, caused the body of Mr. Jukes to start as though it had been prodded under the fifth rib.

Our dog is very ill again, poor fellow, looks very ill too, only sleeps at night because of morphine; and we do not know what ails him, only fear it to be canker of the ear. He makes a...", "...of the House is conscious from the beginning that he is only an earthly vicegerent, who must give an account of his labour to a higher King and Master, and show that he has been a faithful executor of the high commands laid upon him.\" One finds exactly the same idea expressed three months later when talking to his \"Men of Brandenburg.\" \"You know well,\" he reminded them, \"that I regard my whole position and my task as laid on me by Heaven, and that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> appointed by a Higher Power to whom I must later render an account. Accordingly I can assure you that not a morning or evening passes without a prayer for my people and a special thought for my Mark Brandenburg.\" To the Anglo-Saxon understanding, of course, the theory of divine right has long appeared untenable, obsolete, and, as Macaulay says, absurd. Many people to-day would go farther and argue that there is no such thing as a divine right at all, since \"rights\"...", "...to her lip, whispered, \"Talk to Papa, do,--and cheerfully; he is sad.\" She escaped from him as she said this, and appeared to busy herself with watering the flowers arranged on stands round the awning. But she kept her swimming lustrous eyes wistfully on her father. \"How fares it with you, my dear friend?\" said the parson, kindly, as he rested his hand on the Italian's shoulder. \"You must not let him get out of spirits, Mrs. Riccabocca.\" \"I am very ungrateful to her if I ever <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> so,\" said the poor Italian, with all his natural gallantry. Many a good wife, who thinks it is a reproach to her if her husband is ever \"out of spirits,\" might have turned peevishly from that speech, more elegant than sincere, and so have made bad worse; but Mrs. Riccabocca took her husband's proffered hand affectionately, and said with great /naivete/,-- \"You see I am so stupid, Mr. Dale; I never knew I was so stupid till I married. But I am very glad you are come. You can get...", "...Your friend, ELINORE STEWART. XIV THE NEW HOUSE _December 1, 1911._ DEAR MRS. CONEY,-- I feel just like visiting to-night, so I am going to \"play like\" you have come. It is so good to have you to chat with. Please be seated in this low rocker; it is a present to me from the Pattersons and I am very proud of it. I am just back from the Patterson ranch, and they have a dear little boy who came the 20th of November and they call him Robert Lane. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sure this room must look familiar to you, for there is so much in it that was once yours. I have two rooms, each fifteen by fifteen, but this one on the south is my \"really\" room and in it are my treasures. My house faces east and is built up against a side-hill, or should I say hillside? Anyway, they had to excavate quite a lot. I had them dump the dirt right before the house and terrace it smoothly. I have sown my terrace to California poppies, and around my porch, which is six...", "...born.' 'To that, I am sure, she does not give a thought.' 'Not Rose? Oh!' An exclamation, properly lengthened, convinces the feelings more satisfactorily than much logic. Though Evan claimed only the hand-kerchief he had won, his heart sank at the sound. Miss Bonner watched him, and springing forward, said sharply: 'May I tell you something?' 'You may tell me what you please.' 'Then, whether I offend you or not, you had better leave this.' 'I am going,' said Evan. 'I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> only waiting to introduce your tutor to you.' She kept her eyes on him, and in her voice as well there was a depth, as she returned: 'Mr. Laxley, Mr. Forth, and Harry, are going to Lymport to-morrow.' Evan was looking at a figure, whose shadow was thrown towards the house from the margin of the stream. He stood up, and taking the hand of Miss Bonner, said: 'I thank you. I may, perhaps, start with them. At any rate, you have done me a great service, which I shall not...", "...without her. When he inquired at the hotel, he was told that the Rexhills were in, and he presently found himself shaking hands with the Senator, who greeted him with effusive warmth. \"Helen is changing her gown and will be in shortly,\" the big man explained. \"I'm mighty glad to see you, Gordon. Only this morning we were talking of looking you up. How are you? Sit down, my boy, sit down!\" \"Senator,\" Wade began, after they had exchanged commonplaces for a few moments. \"Glad as I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> to see you, on my own account, I am more than glad in behalf of my friends, who have not yet had the pleasure of meeting you. Your arrival in Crawling Water could not possibly have been more opportune. You have come just in time to save us, most likely, from an internecine strife which might have ruined us all. I was more glad than I can tell you to learn that you were here.\" \"Indeed, Gordon? I--I am much interested. Perhaps, you will....\" While Wade succinctly sketched the...", "...Pl. 21. * * * * * SPECIFIC CHARACTER. _P. corpore, collo, pectore nigro cucullata; tergo fusco, alis caudaque nigris; tegminum apice, pectoris lateribus, et corpore subtus flavis; capite subcristato._ Head, neck and fore-part of the breast hooded with black; back brown, wings and tail black; tip of the wing-covers, sides of the breast and body beneath yellow; head subcrested. * * * * * I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> indebted for this new bird to Miss E.

What's in the letter, Flo? If you are too tired to read it just now, I will open it for you.\" \"No, thank you, mother; I know what it contains: it is a message from Miss Keys. I met her on the sands this morning and--and she said she would write.\" With a wild fluttering at her heart, Florence popped the sealed packet into her pocket and sat down near the door. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> thoroughly tired,\" she said, \"and my head aches.\" Mrs. Aylmer appeared to be annoyed and disappointed. \"I do declare,\" she exclaimed, \"I don't think any of the girls of the present day have health worth mentioning. There's Kitty: she's been fretting and fuming because you went out without her; she's a nice, refined sort of little thing, but she has a headache, and now after preparing the very nicest little dinner out of the scraps which that young man ought to have eaten last...", "...his moral manhood were being sapped. The glitter of the Count's eyes fascinated him, and while under their spell he saw as the Count saw, felt as he felt. And yet he was afraid. There was something awesome in all this--something unholy. \"Look here!\" and Dick started to his feet. \"What do you mean by coming to me in this way? Why should you so coolly assert that the moralities of the centuries are nonsense? Who are you? What are you?\" Again the Count laughed. \"Who am I? What <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> I?\" he repeated. \"You remember Napoleon Bonaparte's famous words: 'I am not a man. I am a thing. I am a force. Right and wrong do not exist for me. I make my own laws, my own morals.' Perhaps I could say the same, Faversham.\" \"Napoleon found out his mistake, though,\" protested Dick. \"Did he? Who knows? Besides, better taste the sweets of power, if only for a few years, than be a drudge, a nonentity, a poor, struggling worm all your days.\" \"But what do you want? What have you...", "...vagabond, Grant--the envy rests with me,\" he said. \"It's all very well to have large estates, but I feel like degenerating into a sort of head gamekeeper and farm bailiff combined. Of course, I'm proud of Cairn-corrie, yet I pine sometimes for the excitement of a life that does not travel in grooves.\" The other shook his head. \"Don't tempt fate,\" he said. \"My life has been spent among the outer beasts. It isn't worth it. For a few years of a man's youth, yes--perhaps. But I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> forty, and I live in a club. There, you have my career in a nutshell.\" \"There is a fine kernel within. By Gad! Grant, why don't you pretend I meant that pun? I didn't, but I'll claim it at dinner. Gad, it's fine!\" Colonel Grant laughed. His mirth had a pleasant, wholesome ring. \"If you bribe me with as good a berth to-morrow,\" he said, \"I'll give you the chance of throwing it off spontaneously during the first lull in the conversation.

God knows I have need enough to be left altogether alone for some considerable while (_forever,_ as it at present seems to me), to get my inner world, and my poor bodily nerves, both all torn to pieces, set in order a little again! After much vain reluctance therefore; disregarding many considerations,-- disregarding _finance_ in the front of these,--I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> off; and calculate on staying till I am heartily _sated_ with country, till at least the last gleam of summer weather has departed. My way of life has all along hitherto been a resolute _staying at home:_ I find now, however, that I must alter my habits, cost what it may; that I cannot live all the year round in London, under pain of dying or going rabid;--that I must, in fact, learn to travel, as others do, and be hanged to me! Wherefore, in brief, my Friend, our address for...", "...then feasted on honors. Stanley has received a snuff-box and I have received considerable snuff; he has got to write a book and gather in the rest of the credit, and I am going to levy on the copyright and to collect the money. Nothing comes amiss to me\u0097cash or credit; but, seriously, I do feel that Stanley is the chief man and an illustrious one, and I do applaud him with all my heart. Whether he is an American or a Welshman by birth, or one, or both, matters not to me. So far as I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> personally concerned, I am simply here to stay a few months, and to see English people and to learn English manners and customs, and to enjoy myself; so the simplest thing I can do is to thank you for the toast you have honored me with and for the remarks you have made, and to wish health and prosperity to the Whitefriars' Club, and to sink down to my accustomed level.

He proved too hard for Montagu, and drove him so far backward that he fell into a ditch, and dropt his sword, but with honour would take no advantage over him; but did give him his life: and the world says Mr. Montagu did carry himself very poorly in the business, and hath lost his honour for ever with all people in it, of which I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> very glad, in hopes that it will humble him. I hear also that he hath sent to my Lord to borrow L400, giving his brother Harvey's' security for it, and that my Lord will lend it him, for which I am sorry.

They were not speaking, but they were thinking over all the good things they were going to say, for everything had to be thought out. 'Hullo!' bawled Blockhead-Hans, 'here I am!

I shall give it to the Princess!' 'Do so, certainly!' they said, laughing loudly and riding on. 'Slap! bang! here I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> again! Look what I have just found! You don't find such things every day on the road!' And the brothers turned round to see what in the world he could have found. 'Blockhead!' said they, 'that is an old wooden shoe without the top! Are you going to send that, too, to the Princess?' 'Of course I shall!' returned Blockhead-Hans; and the brothers laughed and rode on a good way. 'Slap! bang! here I am!' cried Blockhead-Hans; 'better and better--it is really famous!' 'What have...", "...swords, and instinctively ran their fingers down the blades in the darkness. The movements of the two men were plainly visible to the watchers, for the moonlight streaming in through the open door showed their outline very distinctly as they moved to and fro. Immediately the men began to saddle several horses belonging to the Prince, and then they led them out. \"There is a move of some sort, Wulfhere, and I warrant mischief is in it, for there are snakes about.

You stay here,\" said Badger--he, at the same time, stealing noiselessly out at the opposite end of the building. As soon as he reached the open air, he saw, across the enclosure, that there were lights in the dwelling; so he nimbly dodged round, keeping in the shadow of the buildings, until he reached the rear of the house. There, peering through a crazy, patched window, he not only saw what was going on inside, but he overheard this conversation...", "...home. The first person to whom I communicated my intention was Colonel Clive. He was at first astonished, and told me so. \"Why do you mean to leave me now, when all our affairs are prospering, and you have nothing to do but to stay on and enrich yourself? I have had it in my mind to promote you; indeed, I think you know that I am your good friend.\" \"I do, indeed, sir,\" I answered, \"and I am most grateful for all your kindness to me. But it is right that I should tell you I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> here in consequence of wrong-doing, which has, as I can now see, pursued my steps and caused me to be harassed with troubles and misfortunes from the very beginning to this hour.\" \"Why, what wrong have you been guilty of?\" asked the Colonel, much interested. \"I could have sworn you were the most honest young man in my company.\" \"I have run away from my home, sir. I have deceived and disobeyed my father and, I fear, caused great sorrow to my loving mother. I allowed myself to...", "...why you are making haste to build your house? I am very glad. I congratulate you.\" \"Do not; do not,\" he stammered earnestly. \"I speak of a possible wife, because I hope to have a wife some day. I am not engaged.

I have done so; I am at peace with all; I am at peace with _thee_--But I cannot give thee my hand.\" The cavalier Don Francisco received this rejection of his good-will with no sign of dissatisfaction, that was distinguishable by others, beyond a smile or sneer; but inclining his head towards Lerma, he muttered in his ear-- \"The strife is unequal; but I accept thy defiance. Thou art but a broken-legged wolf, and wilt fight a fatted tiger--I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> content.\" So saying, or rather whispering, for his words were only caught by the ears of Juan, the cavalier turned upon his heel, and without condescending to exhibit his mortification in the vain air of pride and scorn, assumed by ordinary men on such occasions, he began to walk towards the city. He was presently followed by the senor Camarga; who, having fastened upon Juan, for a few moments, a look of intense curiosity, flung, when he had satisfied himself, his cloak over the...", "...kind of an opportunity,\" said Zenas. \"Boys, you are recklessly exposing your lives!

It is necessary, professor.\" Zenas gasped and hesitated. \"Do come in!\" he urged. \"What can I tell your brother if anything serious happens to you?\" \"Tell him the truth, and he will be satisfied. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> doing what my brother would wish me to do.\" \"Dear! dear!\" muttered Gunn. \"I regret that we ever came here. I fear we'll all be murdered before we get away.\" Mumbling to himself, he hastened tremblingly back to the inn. \"His courage has all oozed out,\" said Dick. \"Waugh!

The Stadholder calmly demanded the disbandment and the Synod. The Hollanders spoke of securing first the persons and rights of the magistracy. \"The magistrates are to be protected,\" said Maurice, \"but we must first know how they are going to govern.

The hand he gave me was the hand I had bitten.

Wulf then related at length his interview with Edith. Harold listened in silence. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> right glad at your news,\" he said, when the latter had finished. \"It is just what I thought she would do.

As we stood, behold, up came the lady, and with her a slave-girl. When she saw the young man, she said to him, \"Art thou here?\" And he answered, \"Yes, O my lady.\" Quoth she, \"To-day I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> bidden by this man. Wilt thou go with us?\" And he replied, \"Yes.\" Then said she, \"Thou hast brought me [hither] against my will and perforce. Wilt thou go with us in any event?\"[FN#184] \"Yes, yes,\" answered he and we fared on, [all three,] till we came to Er Rauzeh and entered the pavilion.

On the contrary, rest assured that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> living in contentment, and regret only that I am separated so far from you. In time, however, this will be different.\" But communications from the young man are not many, and Schindler's rebukes and complaints in the Conversation Books about his undutifulness are probably only a reflex of Beethoven's moods and utterances. One cause of dissatisfaction was the fact that a letter to Smart had been sent to him for translation and was not promptly returned.

DYKE ROUSES UP. That was months before the opening of our story, when Dyke was making his way in disgust toward the moist shade of the kopje, where, deep down from cracks of the granite rock, the spring gurgled out. Only a part ran for a few yards, and then disappeared in the sand, without once reaching to where the sun blazed down.

'Do you believe, Miss Fanny, there is such a wretch on earth?' I answered, with an assumed coldness, I did not believe there was. He then took me gently by the hand, and, with a look so tender that I cannot describe it, vowed he was himself that wretch. Then starting, as if conscious of an error committed, he cried with a faltering voice, 'What <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> I saying? Pardon me, Miss Fanny; since I beg only your pity, I never will ask for more.--' At these words, hearing my father coming up, I betrayed myself entirely, if, indeed, I had not done it before.

He was willing. Then she made herself ready to start. As soon as Osongo knew that his brother Obengi was going away, he began to cry at the thought of separation. He said, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not going to stay alone. I have to go too, for I am not willing to be separated from my brother.\" And Obengi said the same: \"If Osongo does not go with us, then I will not go at all.\" Then Ngwe-vazya thought to herself, \"No, it will not do for me to take Osongo along with me, for his mother and I are not friendly.\" And she told Osongo that he must stay.

As the procession of conquerors moves away from the entrance, an officer approaches Jasper Lamotte. \"Mr. Lamotte, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> very sorry, sir, but you must consider yourself my prisoner.\" Jasper Lamotte bows coldly, and signals the man that he will follow him. The officer turns to Frank, but before he can open his lips, the miserable young man steps back, makes one quick movement; there is a flash, a loud report, and Frank Lamotte falls forward, to be caught in the arms of a by-stander.

'Oh, perfectly well, thank you,' answered Tommaso, increasing his speed. 'I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sorry that I am in such a hurry, my friend, but it cannot be helped.'

Unfortunately this was not the case. It had been left to a friend of the late heir, as was indubitably...", "...it was proposed to form a military police force for Lower Burma. The Karens were placed on the same footing as the Indians, and British officers were appointed to command them. In drill, endurance in the field, and courage, the Karen showed himself a good man.

There has been more success, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> told, with the Kachins, who are showing themselves trustworthy. They are certainly a strong race, probably the strongest we have in Burma. Another direction in which the change from the sword to the plough and the pen was showing itself was in the prominence given to the administration of the civil police.

But even whilst I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> writing these words it occurs to me that they are no longer true, for the German of to-day is no longer the German of yesterday, \"standing peaceful on his scientific watch-tower; and to the raging, struggling multitude here and elsewhere solemnly, from hour to hour, with preparatory blast of cow-horn emit his 'Hoeret ihr Herren und lasst's euch sagen' ...\" as Carlyle pictures him; he is most certainly not like the Lutheran German with a child's heart and a boy's rash courage....", "...that. _Max._ O let my Prayers prevail too, Here like a tree, I dwell else; free me, Mother, And greater than great Fortune, I'll adore thee. _Del._ Be free again, and have more pure thoughts in ye. _Dio._ Now I believe your words most constantly, And when I have that power ye have promis'd to me. _Del._ Remember then your Vow, my Niece _Drusilla_, I mean to marry her, and then ye prosper. _Dio._ I shall forget my life else. _Del._ I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> a poor weak woman, to me no worship. _Enter_ Niger, Geta, _and Souldiers_. _Get._ And shall he have as you say, that kills this _Aper_? _Del._ Now mark and understand. _Nig._ The Proscription's up I'th' Market place, 'tis up, there ye may read it, He shall have half the Empire. _Get._ A pretty farm i' faith. _Nig._ And the Emperours Sister, bright _Aurelia_, Her to his wife. _Get._ Ye say well, Friend, but hark...", "...to compose such discourses as that.

A large percentage of the teacher failures belongs to this class. I am often interviewed by candidates who are seeking positions. When I ask them the kind of work they can do the best, I occasionally receive the reply, \"In what grades do you have the greatest number of openings?\" Others will say, \"I am prepared to teach any of the grades. I have no preference, for I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> as good in one as I am in another.\" In the case of some candidates the last statement is likely to be true. Boards of education usually grade applicants on three main points: personality, preparation, experience. The first two, every candidate who has completed a normal school or college course possesses to a greater or less degree. The third must be gained by actual work in teaching. A pleasing yet forceful personality is one of the leading factors in any teacher's success and...", "...her--\"He knows nothing.\" \"Taddeo,\" said she, giving him her hand, \"I pardon you, for I am myself guilty, very guilty in still preserving my old sentiments in the face of my new obligations, voluntarily contracted.

Jemima was again at her elbow, and the restraint of her presence did not prevent an animated conversation, in which love, sly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.

Thence he repaired to Pont de Ce, where lived a certain Sieur Leclerc, an innkeeper, who had formerly been a cook in the household of Louis XVI. To this man he paid a visit, and demanded if he recognised him. The innkeeper said he did not, whereupon he remarked on the strangeness of being forgotten, seeing, said he, \"that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> Louis XVII., and that you have often pulled my ears in the kitchen of Versailles.\" Leclerc, whose recollections of the dauphin were of quite a different character, ordered him out of his house as an impostor.

As I passed the passage on my way I saw an elderly lady coming toward the main corridor.

I protest you know everything. My lord thinks I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> there now.\" \"My lord will be there as surely as my lady,\" answered the other. \"But it was not to learn his lordship's movements that your ladyship came here!\" \"Fie, Doctor!\" she replied; \"what woman of fashion cares to know the doings of a husband? I have a crow to pluck with you. Do you remember what you promised me the last time I was here?\" \"Triumphs by the hundred,\" said he; \"compliments by the thousand; conquests and flatteries innumerable.

I rose and directed her to be admitted. She brought two letters from her mistress, and was told to wait for an answer. Jane traversed her room, half distracted and sleepless during most of the night. Towards morning she...", "...but, of course, each of these writers was precluded from using the discoveries of the other. The present Life is the first in which the fresh matter brought forward by Mr. Edwards and by Mr. St. John has been collated; Mr. Edwards, moreover, deserved well of all Raleigh students by editing for the first time, in 1868, the correspondence of Raleigh. I hope that I do not seem to disparage Mr. Edwards's book when I say that in his arrangement and conjectural dating of undated documents I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> very frequently in disaccord with him. The present Life contains various small data which are now for the first time published, and more than one fact of considerable importance which I owe to the courtesy of Mr. John Cordy Jeaffreson. I have, moreover, taken advantage up to date of the _Reports_ of the Historical MSS. Commission, and of the two volumes of _Lismore Papers_ this year published. In his prospectus to the latter Dr. Grosart promises us still more about Raleigh in later...", "...He showed her the thing he had brought with him. It was a very slender chain of gold with a plain gold ring hung on it. He put the chain around her neck but slipped the ring on her finger and kissed it again and again. \"Wear it when we are together,\" he whispered. \"I want to see it. It makes you mine as much as if I had put it on in a church with a huge organ playing.\" \"I should be yours without it,\" answered Robin. \"I _am_ yours.\" \"Yes,\" he whispered again. \"You are mine.

Nor make I the least doubt but that, if I lived at Newhaven, Seaford, Brighthelmstone, or any of those towns near the chalk cliffs of the Sussex coast, by proper observations, I should see swallows stirring at periods of the winter, when the noons were soft and inviting, and the sun warm and invigorating. And I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> the more of this opinion from what I have remarked during some of our late springs, that though some swallows did make their appearance about the usual time, viz., the 13th or 14th April, yet meeting with a harsh reception, and blustering cold north-east winds, they immediately withdrew, absconding for several days, till the weather gave them better encouragement.

They were rough-looking fellows, and James Allen said, \"I do not like the look of...", "...with his head bent over to the side and the blood oozing from his neck-wound. When I came near he raised his eyes and saw me. A gleam of something came into them; it may have been mere recognition, but I thought it pleasure.

All this had been explained to Nancy, who at last consented to Jemmy being added to the crew of the smuggler, and Moggy had gone off to the cutter to persuade Jemmy to desert, and to join the smugglers. Now, as to joining the smugglers, Jemmy had not the least objection: he was tired of the cutter, and being separated from his wife had been to him a source of great discontent; but, as Jemmy very truly observed, \"If I desert from the vessel, and <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> ever seen again, I am certain to be known, and taken up; therefore I will not desert, I will wait till I am paid off, unless you can procure my discharge by means of your friends.\" Such had been the result of the colloquy, when interrupted by the arrival of Vanslyperken, and the case thus stood, when, on the next morning, at daylight, the cutter weighed, and steered her course for the Texel.

I may say to the fair painter[60] who does me so much honour, as Dr. Beattie says to Ross, the poet of his muse Scota, from which, by the by, I took the idea of Coila: ('tis a poem of Beattie's in the Scottish dialect, which, perhaps, you have never seen):-- Ye shak your head, but o' my fegs, Ye've set auld Scota on her legs; Lang had she lien wi' beffs and flegs, Bumbaz'd and dizzie, Her fiddle wanted...", "...for my disappearance.

But, when the particulars come to be inquired into, it will be found that the mind and health-destroying exactions now so extensively made on the energies of the American clergy, particularly on these two classes I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> now considering, are attributable, almost entirely, to an appetite for certain novelties, which have been introduced within a few years, adding greatly to the amount of ministerial labour, without augmenting its efficiency, but rather detracting from it.

From the _Journal_ of the Institute.] BY COMMANDER F.M. BARBER, U.S.N. In commencing my paper this evening I desire to call your attention to the fact that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> dealing with a subject which, though not theoretical, is still hardly practical, for as a matter of fact high explosives cannot be said to have yet been regularly used in warfare, and I hope you will pardon me if in consequence my statements appear in some respects unsatisfactory and my theories unsound. My subject, however, is no more obscure than future naval warfare generally. All civilized nations are spending millions of money for fighting purposes directly in opposition to the...", "...were to be found, prevailed throughout the cool recesses of the grove. The girl flung herself down under an oak tree, idly watching the impatient tapping of a squirrel in the branches above at the still resisting acorns. The monotony of the soulless sunshine became irksome. The spirit of the furred and feathered folk of the woods was stealing into her. Like them she was heartily tired of the summer, and half stifled in the wornout atmosphere of the sleepy silent August day. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> glad that tomorrow is the first day of September,\" she exclaimed, sitting up and speaking aloud. \"It is so hot. I want a change!\" At this moment a bright bit of color fluttered through the air and dropped in the grass by her side. \"It's a butterfly,\" cried Bee. \"A poor little butterfly that has come to the end of its life.\" She bent over the dainty insect and lifted it gently. A cry of delight escaped her lips as she looked at it. The insect moved its wings slightly,...", "...him, and linked his arm within that of his old companion, walking with him along the pleasant green pathway of the Abbey mead, not content till he had heard every detail of that which had befallen Paul, from the moment they had parted up till the present, and listening with intense excitement to his account of what had befallen him in the robbers' cave, and how he had escaped from thence, and had been tended and protected at Figeon's by the kindly and honest folks there. \"When I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> king,\" said young Edward, with flashing eyes, \"I will go thither again, and reward them royally for all they have done for you and me. I am glad they loved me still, Lancastrian though they knew me at last to be. Oh, if they were willing to follow my fortunes and own me as their king, methinks others will not be far behind! And, God helping me, I will try to show them what manner of man a king should be.\" For it had been fully recognized upon all hands now that the prince's...", "...Those are well-constructed verses, my dear sir--equal to Dryden. 'On purple pinions borne,' sounds well. The alliteration is pleasing. Note the effect, also, in the phrase 'Manhood's morn,' and the last line is poetical, 'Flush the pale cheek, and goad the tender heart.' Or this, suggesting how love and sympathy causes affinities which-- 'Melt into Lymph or kindle into gas.' There are those who contend that scientific truths cannot be stated poetically; but here, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sure, science and sentiment are at one. Am I not right?\" \"Doubtless your judgment is correct,\" assented Chester, uncertain whether Blennerhassett was speaking in earnest or in irony. \"I confess I am not a literary student. Pardon the interruption and my inquisitiveness, but am I correctly informed that the young lady to whom I was introduced, a few weeks ago, when I called here, is related to Mr. Hale of whom we were speaking?\" \"Quite right; she is his daughter, Miss Evaleen,...", "...subject will agree that the ideas I have tried to sketch are interesting and valuable; but they suggest scores of questions. Alike in the account of tragedy in general, and in that of the differences between ancient and modern tragedy, everyone will find statements to doubt and omissions to regret; and scarcely one of Hegel's interpretations of particular plays will escape objection. It is impossible for me to touch on more than a few points; and to the main ideas I owe so much that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> more inclined to dwell on their truth than to criticise what seem to be defects. But perhaps after all an attempt to supplement and amend may be the best way of throwing some part of Hegel's meaning more into relief. And I will begin with the attempt to supplement. He seems to be right in laying emphasis on the action and conflict in tragedy rather than on the suffering and misfortune. No mere suffering or misfortune, no suffering that does not spring in great part from human...", "...operation. I have constructed a pair of metal disc-electrodes which clamp tightly to my head and press upon my temples. This device will pick up the thought impulses from my brain, feed them directly into the radio-frequency amplifier, where they will be amplified, and then radiated in a tight directed beam. My two ants were in their little enclosure under the microscope when I threw the switch to the \"send\" position. I pictured myself as I looked as a man, and sent the thought, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> a man.\" Hastily, I threw the switch to the \"receive\" position. I looked through the microscope. The ants were lying on their sides. Somehow, I felt that the power was too great, and had stunned them. Keeping my eye to the microscope, I again threw the switch to \"send,\" and cut the power to half. \"Get up, friends ... get up,\" I thought, as I pictured them rising. Sure enough ... the ants slowly regained their feet. They looked about in apparent bewilderment. Back again, in...", "...taken to the hospital. \"Did any one see the man fall?\" he inquired. \"This man did,\" the keeper replied, indicating me. While I was explaining, the doctor eyed me curiously. Presently he asked my name. \"Oh, the celebrated case,\" he smiled. \"I know Mr. Frick quite well. Not such a bad man, at all. But you'll be treated well here, Mr. Berkman. This is a democratic institution, you know. By the way, what is the matter with your eyes? They are inflamed. Always that way?\" \"Only since I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> working in this shop.\" \"Oh, he is all right, Doctor,\" the officer interposed. \"He's only been here a week.\" Mr. Rankin cast a quizzical look at the guard. \"You want him here?\" \"Y-e-s: we're short of men.\" \"Well, _I_ am the doctor, Mr. Hoods.\" Then, turning to me, he added: \"Report in the morning on sick list.\" III The doctor's examination has resulted in my removal to the hosiery department.

Catharine Parr is hailed by the Protestants of England as the new patroness of the persecuted doctrine, and already the Romish priests hurl their anathemas against you, and execrate you and your dangerous presence here. And you ask me, whether I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> an adherent of that church which maligns and damns you? You ask me whether I believe in the pope, who has laid the king under an interdict--the king, who is not only my lord and master, but also the husband of my precious and noble Catharine? Oh, queen, you love me not when you can address such a question to me.\" And as if overcome by painful emotion, Lady Jane sank down at Catharine's feet, and hid her head in the folds of the queen's robe. Catharine bent down to raise her and...", "...which reasonings are composed can be the expression of nothing but the process of dividing things into classes, and referring everything to its proper class. This theory appears to me a signal example of a logical error very often committed in logic, that of [Greek: hysteron proteron], or explaining a thing by something which presupposes it. When I say that snow is white, I may and ought to be thinking of snow as a class, because I am asserting a proposition as true of all snow: but I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> certainly not thinking of white objects as a class; I am thinking of no white object whatever except snow, but only of that, and of the sensation of white which it gives me. When, indeed, I have judged, or assented to the propositions, that snow is white, and that several other things are also white, I gradually begin to think of white objects as a class, including snow and those other things. But this is a conception which followed, not preceded, those judgments, and therefore...", "...another moment, and Winston still sat at the foot of the table and Barrington at the head, while the rest of the company were scattered, some wonderingly silent, though others talked in whispers, about the room. As yet they felt only consternation and astonishment. CHAPTER XXV COURTHORNE MAKES REPARATION The silence in the big room had grown oppressive, when Barrington raised his head and sat stiffly upright. \"What has happened has been a blow to me, and I am afraid I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> scarcely equal to entertaining you tonight,\" he said. \"I should, however, like Dane and Macdonald, and one or two of the older men to stay a while. There is still, I fancy, a good deal for us to do.\" The others turned towards the door, but as they passed Winston, Miss Barrington turned and touched his shoulder. The man, looking up suddenly, saw her and her niece standing close beside her. \"Madam,\" he said hoarsely, though it was Maud Barrington he glanced at, \"the comedy is...", "...\"You had every right--\" He stopped short, for he was reluctant to admit that she had been justified in her behaviour towards him. \"Thanks,\" she said, with an attempt to laugh. \"It is pleasant to find magnanimous people now and then. I do not want you to think that I was capricious. That is all.\" \"I certainly do not think that. You were most consistent. I called three times and always got the same answer.\" He fancied that he heard her sigh, but she tried to laugh again. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not imaginative,\" she answered. \"I daresay you found that out long go. You have much more imagination than I.\" \"It is possible, Madame--but you have not cared to develop it.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"What does it matter? Do you remember what you said when I bade you good-night at the window of your carriage after Del Ferice's dinner? You said that you were not angry with me. I was foolish enough to imagine that you were in earnest. I came again and again, but you would not see...", "...that she shall, if possible, make at least a brief sojourn at the sea-side.

He struggled in vain, and was surprised to find how easily he was overcome; for he forgot that with a mortal form he possessed only the strength of a mortal, and had at first supposed that he could drive them off with as much ease as he would have done had he retained the form of Borasco. The Princess hurried forward. \"Oh, spare him! spare him!\" she exclaimed; \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> certain he will do no harm. See how amiable and gentle he looks!\" The islanders loved their Princess, and therefore refrained from offering further violence to the stranger, but still they held him tight, and insisted on carrying him into the presence of King Zaphor. Now, Serena, as she felt that she might more successfully plead his cause before her indulgent father than any one else, gladly consented to this arrangement. King Zaphor sat in state, with his wise men and...", "...sure he knows nothing,\" she said. \"What is it, Mr. Folliot?\" \"Why, you know what happened last week,\" continued Folliot, glancing knowingly at her. \"The accident to that stranger. This Mrs. Deramore, who's nothing but an old chatterer, has been saying, here and there, that it's a very queer thing Dr. Ransford doesn't know anything about him, and can't say anything, for she herself, she says, saw the very man going away from Dr. Ransford's house not so long before the accident.\" \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not aware that he ever called at Dr. Ransford's,\" said Mary. \"I never saw him--and I was in the garden, about that very time, with your stepson, Mr. Folliot.\" \"So Sackville told me,\" remarked Folliot. \"He was present--and so was I--when Mrs. Deramore was tattling about it in our house yesterday. He said, then, that he'd never seen the man go to your house. You never heard your servants make any remark about it?\" \"Never!\" answered Mary. \"I told Mrs. Deramore she'd far better...", "...got out of that rather neatly.\" \"You like to skate on thin ice, don't you, Manto? Just as you did when you changed your height. You had no business shrinking right out in public like that.\" \"I did it skillfully. Not a single person noticed.\" \"_I_ noticed.\" \"Don't quibble.\" \"I don't intend to. Some of these children have very sharp eyes. You'd be surprised at what they see.\" Manto said tolerantly, \"You're getting jittery, Palit. We've been away from home too long.\" \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not jittery in the least.

Wise--people--simply don't take unnecessary chances.\" \"I'll grant that you're my superior in such...", "...On this side of the hills. The end of July was approaching, and the season was drawing to a close.

I am not the keeper of your conscience.\" \"But you are, and you must be.

Pierre Lamont examined the portrait with admiration. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> proud of you, Fritz,\" he said; \"you have the true artist's touch.\" Fritz was busy with the pencil again. \"Who may this be?\" he asked, holding another sketch before Pierre Lamont. \"The Advocate.

Of this, however, I (speaking for myself) may be sure: that the artist who so represents vulgar life that I am more in love with my kind, the satirist who so depicts vice and villainy that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> strengthened in my moral fibre, has vindicated his choice of material. On the contrary, those novelists are not justified whose forte it seems to be to so set forth goodness as to make it unattractive.

I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me; whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend.

On the steps stood an old man,--a very old man,--holding a little girl by the hand. He took off his greasy cap as they passed, and wished them good day. His teeth were gone; he could hardly articulate a syllable. The Baron asked him how old the church was. Hegave no answer; but when the question was repeated, came close up to them, and taking off his cap again, turned his ear attentively, and said; \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> hard of hearing.\" \"Poor old man,\" said Flemming; \"He is as much a ruin as the church we are entering. It will not be long before he, too, shall be sown as seed in this God's-acre!\" The little girl ran into a house close at hand, and brought out the great key. The church door swung open, and, descending a few steps, they passed through a low-roofed passage into the church. All was in ruin.

However, if you wish it, I will write to him.

After the frequent debates between us you will not be surprised at my saying that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not convinced by your arguments on those subjects on which we have long differed. Our differences may in some respects, I think, be ascribed to your considering my book as more practical than I intended it to be.

But, as subsequent experience showed me that judgments of distance in such cases are almost always below the mark, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> of opinion that here, as sometimes in politics and religion, seeming moderation may be less accurate than seeming excess.

He next desired to have the other Sacraments of the church proper to his condition administered to him: on which the Benedictine asked if he desired to receive the Eucharist; eagerly he replied, \"If I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> worthy pray fail not to let me have it.\" Then Father Huddleston, after some exhortation, prepared to give him the Sacrament; when the dying man, struggling to raise himself, exclaimed, \"Let me meet my heavenly Lord in a better posture than lying in bed.\" But the priest begged he would not move, and then gave him the Communion, which he received with every sign of fervour.

Out they came into the cool, blessed night. It was very late, and only starlight. To their surprise, three paces away they saw, seated upon a stone, an old country-woman, in a cloak which they took for black. When they came close up to it, they saw it was red. 'Good evening!' said Peter. 'Good evening!' returned the old woman, in a voice as old as herself. But Curdie took off his cap and said: 'I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> your servant, Princess.' The old woman replied: 'Come to me in the dove tower tomorrow night, Curdie--alone.' 'I will, ma'am,' said Curdie. So they parted, and father and son went home to wife and mother--two persons in one rich, happy woman.

The princess had not appointed an exact time for him to be there;...", "...\"but how do you propose to accomplish it?\" \"My father,\" answered Scheherazade, \"it is you who have to provide the Sultan daily with a fresh wife, and I implore you, by all the affection you bear me, to allow the honour to fall upon me.\" \"Have you lost your senses?\" cried the grand-vizir, starting back in horror. \"What has put such a thing into your head? You ought to know by this time what it means to be the sultan's bride!\" \"Yes, my father, I know it well,\" replied she, \"and I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not afraid to think of it. If I fail, my death will be a glorious one, and if I succeed I shall have done a great service to my country.\" \"It is of no use,\" said the grand-vizir, \"I shall never consent. If the Sultan was to order me to plunge a dagger in your heart, I should have to obey. What a task for a father!

He saw us, as we took leave of each other. Poor fellow! he little thinks we have parted. This will be a blow to him, I am much afraid!' She hurried on, without resting, and hurried on until they had passed under the gatehouse into the street; once there, she asked: 'Has he followed us? You can look without seeming to. Is he behind?' 'No. Yes, he is! He has just passed out under the gateway. The dear, sympathetic old fellow likes to keep us in sight. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> afraid he will be bitterly disappointed!' She pulled hurriedly at the handle of the hoarse old bell, and the gate soon opened.

There was a grin on his face and a look of delight; he rubbed his hands gleefully as he watched what transpired. The Spanish officer glared at his prisoners sternly. Clif's bearing was quiet and dignified. \"So you are the officer who commanded the Yankee pigs?\" growled the man. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> an American naval cadet,\" was the response.

What concern is that of yours?\" \"All your concerns are mine,\" she answered tranquilly. \"I am your mother.\" \"And I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> your king!\" he answered, banging the table. \"And I mean to be king!\" \"By the grace of God and the favour of Monsieur de Coligny,\" she sneered, with unruffled calm. \"What's that?\" His mouth fell open, and his eyes stared.

For my own part, I wish to be at peace with all the world, and <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> now going to have a pipe. Who will join me?\" Several big fellows, as well as Spiller and Julian Langley, said they would, and soon the room was filled with tobacco smoke, which not a little increased its unpleasantness. \"Swipes, swipes!\" sung out Scarborough in a short time, and from some secret recess bottles of ale and porter were produced, the contents rapidly disappearing down their throats. Then they sang, and insisted on all the other fellows coming round and singing in...", "...thirst. \"You must have patience,\" repeated the mother. \"That comes from your condition.

A lady came up to him, and asked him if these were not his chickens he was gathering under his wings, after which she joined conversation with us; and in a little time asked us, if we had any acquaintance of the ladies of the court, and if we should not be glad to know their names.

But don't interrupt me, Tom, now I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> on the subject of ghosts. Among the manifest advantages of being a ghost is one which above all others is deserving of especial consideration. A ghost can see a person's thoughts. Being fond of sweet things, ghosts experience great pleasure in watching the thoughts of ladies who are meditating upon their absent lovers. When a young maiden is thinking about her lover who is far away, her thoughts wander off to him and return, looking as sweet as little bees with their legs laden with...", "...am I, all forlorn, set down alone in this great town, and must take care of myself as I best can.

A windlass and a donkey-engine controlled the big rope which held us captive. We went aloft in a series of disagreeable and upsetting jerks. This may be an unusual experience, but it was ours. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> a bad sailor, and so is Ajax. Neither of us smiled when Thorpe addressed the veteran as--\"Steward!\" Suddenly there came a still sharper jerk, and the cable split. The balloon seemed to leap upwards, swerved like a frightened bird, and then, caught by the wind, sailed upward and seaward, swooping on with a paradoxically smooth yet uneven flight. \"Jeeroosalem!\" ejaculated our aeronaut.

She knew that a good woman should be sorry for a man in such extremity, and should endeavour to spare his feelings by softening her refusal as much as possible, little as he might deserve such consideration. But man is impatient and jumps at conclusions. Before she was half-way through the first sentence he leaned forward and took her hand. \"Oh, good-bye,\" she said, turning to him, with a pleasant smile. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not going,\" said Hardy, quietly; \"I am never going,\" he added, as he took her other hand. Captain Nugent, anxious for his supper, found them there still debating the point some two hours later. Kate Nugent, relieved at the appearance of her natural protector, clung to him with unusual warmth.

He was very angry, but he said nothing. \"It is much better to be honest about it,\" said Joe, still very pale; and when she had spoken, her little mouth closed tightly. \"Oh, yes,\" said Ronald, who was serious by this time; \"it is much better to be honest, now that you have brought me...", "...cat. \"Enjoy that satisfaction, M. de Berault. Is that all?\" \"Once I was of service to your Eminence,\" I said desperately. \"Payment has been made,\" he answered, \"more than once. But for that I should not have seen you, M. de Berault.\" \"The King's face!\" I cried, snatching at the straw he seemed to hold out. He laughed cynically, smoothly. His thin face, his dark moustache, and whitening hair, gave him an air of indescribable keenness. \"I am not the King,\" he said. \"Besides, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> told you have killed as many as six men in duels. You owe the King, therefore, one life at least. You must pay it. There is no more to be said, M. de Berault,\" he continued coldly, turning away and beginning to collect some papers. \"The law must take its course.\" I thought he was about to nod to the lieutenant to withdraw me, and a chilling sweat broke out down my back. I saw the scaffold, I felt the cords. A moment, and it would be too late! \"I have a favour to ask,\" I stammered...", "...therefore prearranged the sign of the gloves. Perhaps he had expected that another enemy, not the police, would be watching. Yet even there, in the train, Dawnay had expressed fear lest we be observed together. It was a point the full meaning of which I failed to grasp. At Taunton we stopped again, and I assumed my attitude just as before, with my back to the window, when of a sudden the carriage door was flung open unceremoniously, and a man's voice exclaimed-- \"Alfred Dawnay, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> a police-officer and I hold a warrant for your arrest!\" I roused myself slowly and, facing the man who had addressed me, remarked in a cool voice-- \"I think you've made a slight mistake--eh? My name is not Dawnay.\" The man in the straw hat uttered an ejaculation of surprise and stood staring at me dumbfounded, while a man at his side, evidently one of the Taunton police in plain clothes, looked at us both in wonder. \"If you are not Dawnay, then where is Dawnay?\" demanded...", "...my fiery-haired Irish groom seized the bees by the handful, of course there was no denying the fact. There is a row of large old acacia-trees near the house, inhabited by some most curious ants, who are gradually hollowing the trees out.

Not once yet had her eye rested on Mr. Vernon. She felt that she was sounded. \"Yet I am sure you have a taste for the pomps and vanities. Aha! there is ambition under those careless curls,\" said Mr. Vernon, with his easy, adorable impertinence. Lucretia winced. \"But if I were ambitious, what field for ambition could I find in London?\" \"The same as Alexander,--empire, my cousin.\" \"You forget that I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not a man. Man, indeed, may hope for an empire. It is something to be a Pitt, or even a Warren Hastings.\" Mr. Vernon stared. Was this stupidity, or what? \"A woman has an empire more undisputed than Mr. Pitt's, and more pitiless than that of Governor Hastings.\" \"Oh, pardon me, Mr. Vernon--\" \"Charles, if you please.\" Lucretia's brow darkened. \"Pardon me,\" she repeated; \"but these compliments, if such they are meant to be, meet a very ungrateful return. A woman's...", "...doing so, it turned out that during my absence, the voices within me became just the more silent, the further I went from home, and became more clearly again, the closer I came to my home again. It was as if those dark characters resided there and could only attack me, whenever I was so imprudent to go there. I decided to put this to the test. I took the pay for my stories and made a longer trip abroad. Where I went, I will have to tell in the second volume of this work, in which I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> planning to devote more space to my travels and their results than I could spare here. During this journey, these images disappeared entirely; I became completely free of them. But instead, an very unusual compulsion to return home came over me. This was no healthy, but a sick urge; I felt this very well, but it grew so strong that I lost my power to resist and gave in to it. I returned home, and as soon as I was there, everything I thought I had done away with came over me...", "...over them all. A like shower came from the other side; for Joseph had hastened to the head-gardener's, and the hose was now used with effect. The stream from either side rose high into the air, and they all went off, grumbling, laughing, and cursing. The men were still standing on the steps, and Eric was the first to speak, saying:-- \"Mother, you here? And from your sick-bed? This may cause your death.\" \"No, my son, it has given life to me, to you, to all, and purity to all. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> ill no longer; a great and beautiful and fortunate deed has saved me.\" Sonnenkamp, taking off his cloak, wrapped the Professorin in it, and they led the old lady, whose eyes shone wonderfully, into the great hall, where she sat down, while they all stood around her as about a saint. Manna, kneeling before her, took her hands, and wept copious tears upon them. \"Now I only beg for quiet,\" said the Professorin. \"I am calm; give me no further excitement now. I heard it, I know...", "...the destruction, perhaps, more interesting. I feel disinclined to abandon the things I loathe.

Goliath watched him in silence as he moved from pedestal to pedestal from which, like a company of inert monsters, arose figures in clay and bronze. The first of them was a man four feet in height but massive-seeming beyond its dimensions. Mallare had entitled it \"The Lover.\" Its legs were planted obliquely on the pedestal top, their ligaments wrenched into bizarre muscular...", "...her,' he said. 'These cursed doctors say I shall die. But I sha'n't. I want her. Why hasn't she come? I must go and find her.' \"Then he fell across the bed exhausted. He was dying. I had rung for help, but no one had come, and I ran out of the room to call on the landing. When I came back he was sitting up in bed, all dressed, and still with his hat on.

The day! His brow clouded, and he turned away. \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> glad you are coming,\" said Mrs. Linchmore, \"as Frances does not ride.\" Frances not ride! For a moment Amy felt glad, then sorry. Would they think she had come purposely to prevent a tete-a-tete? \"I did not know Miss Strickland was not to be of the party,\" said Amy, as her husband lifted her to the saddle. \"Nor I,\" he replied. \"You are not sorry I am going with you, Robert?\" He looked at her in surprise. \"Sorry, Amy?\" \"I mean; that is, I thought yesterday that perhaps...", "...ad all, only he is a man of high rebudation.\" And on completing this sentence the baron replaced his pipe, and delivered several rapid puffs. \"I took the liberty of enclosing a letter from a friend explaining who I am, and that the questions I should entreat you to answer are not prompted by any idle or impertinent curiosity; perhaps, then, you would be so good as to say whether you know anything of a person named Yelland Mace, who visited Paris some twenty years since?\" \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> in London, Sir, ubon my business, and no one else's.

I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> neither chemist nor meteorologist, and therefore I am not able to say much about radiation; but my idea of it is, that its effects in water would be much greater in still pools than in rapid streams, and that, therefore, if radiation was the cause of bottom-ice, there ought to be more of it in the pools than in the rapid streams. But the contrary is the fact, for after a severe night's frost, I can frequently find the streams filled with this bottom-ice, when none can be observed in...", "...cometh unto it, shall be put to death. 3:39.

Adriance himself entirely approved of her in this new role. He liked her dark-blue suit with its relieving white at...", "...ended for the crown of Spayne, if the King should have died before him.

Thus the ceremony becomes a sacrifice of praise. And the Fathers, indeed, speak of a twofold effect, of the comfort of consciences, and of thanksgiving, or praise. The former of these effects pertains to the nature [the right use] of the Sacrament; the latter pertains to the sacrifice.

Hear Him when He says, John 6, 35: I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> the Bread of life; he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst. This passage testifies that in the Sacrament the remission of sins is offered; it also testifies that this ought to be received by faith. Infinite testimonies to this effect are found in the Fathers, all of which the adversaries pervert to the _opus operatum_, and to a work to be applied on behalf of others; although the Fathers clearly require faith, and speak of the...", "...great trouble to you,\" said Will. \"Yes, indeed! a dreadful trouble.

Each concept means a particular _kind_ of thing, and as things seem once for all to have been created in kinds, a far more efficient handling of a given bit of experience begins as soon as we have classed the various parts of it.

Let me know, for I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> determined to form my taste upon yours. I hear that the situations and incidents are well brought on, and the catastrophe unexpected and surprising, but the verses bad. I suppose it is the subject of all conversations at Paris, where both women and men are judges and critics of all such performances; such conversations, that both form and improve the taste, and whet the judgment; are surely preferable to the conversations of our mixed companies here; which, if they happen to rise...", "...on the other hand, he amused him by his naiveness. \"The dew is yet on him, and since I had the bright idea of giving him a room in the house and having him at meals I feel less withered myself.

Of course I guess there is something--some awful little scrape--which you know all about--but if I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sure that it is terribly heinous, I fancy one could manage to forgive it. For my part, I declare I am unable to imagine him guilty of anything much worse than robbing an orchard. Is it much worse? Perhaps you ought to have told me; but it is such a long time since we both turned saints that you may have forgotten we, too, had sinned in our time? It may be that some day I shall have to ask you, and then I shall expect to be told. I don't care to question him myself till I have some...", "...for it. But is the V.C. enough'? If it's enough for the instinctive heroes, is it enough for him? That is my question.

All I will say is that it is comparable to the glorious feat of Lieutenant WARNEFORD, who bombed the Zeppelin from above and sent it crashing down. My friend is an aviator too, and since I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not allowed to describe his great performance in detail let us pretend that it was an exact replica of the WARNEFORD triumph. Armed with his bombs he saw the approaching Zepp and flew high, six or seven thousand feet, to get above it. So far he had merely obeyed the dictates of his brave impulsive nature. He had given no thought to the chances of danger or death, but had flown direct to his duty. So far he was instinctive. But my friend, as well as being unusually brave, is a...", "...news of the princess, \"Her Imperial Highness is very well, and must be happy in the tender attachment her august husband feels for her, which he has shown in my presence in so touching a manner.

I am the more strongly against the Bill, because, from all that has been said on both sides of the House, and from all that I can learn from the public papers, and even from the organs of the Government, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> convinced that there is no argument which has been used in defence of this measure, which would not be just as valid for the defence of further measures, not for the payment of Catholic priests of the College of Maynooth only, but for the payment of all the priests in Ireland or in England. I admit that the principles and the arguments which have justified the original vote are good to some extent to justify this vote. The right hon. Baronet in his opening speech has stated that the...", "...your defence that occurs to you,\" said the judge. The prisoner stood for a moment with his eyes cast down, in an attitude of deep thought. The flush died out of his face, leaving it whiter than before; presently he passed his hand across his forehead with a convulsive movement, and raised his head. \"This is it,\" he began in a low tone. \"I--I----\" but again his voice failed; then, suddenly clenching his fists, he turned towards the lawyer, and burst out in a voice of thunder: \"But I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> innocent! I tell you I am innocent!\" The lawyer hastily motioned with his hand to quiet him; the judge raised his eyebrows, as though to say: \"And suppose he had said so a hundred times, is it our fault that we are not convinced?\" And a woman's sob was heard through the courtroom. Giovanna had broken down, and Aunt Bachissia at once dragged her towards the door, reluctant and tearful. Every one but the public prosecutor watched the struggle between the two women. A little...", "...which she enjoyed. Let me become Sophie Botta in reality, and let me wash clothes with the washerwomen at the brook. If Sophie and I exchanged lives, let the exchange become real. Let me learn what it is to live, or--let me learn what it is to die.\" In speechless astonishment Count Vavel had listened to this passionate outburst. It was the first time he had ever heard the gentle girl speak so excitedly. \"Madame,\" he said with peculiar intonation, when she had ceased speaking, \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> now convinced that I am the guardian of the most precious treasure on this terrestrial ball. Henceforward I shall watch over you with redoubled care.\" \"That will be unnecessary,\" proudly returned the young girl. \"If you wish to feel certain that I will patiently continue to abide in this Nameless Castle, then make a home here for me--bring some happiness into these rooms. If I see that you are happy I shall be content.\" \"Marie, Marie, the day of my perfect happiness only awaits...", "...immediately retired. \"Champfort, whom do you want--or what do you want?\" said her ladyship. \"Miladi, c'est que--I did come from milord, to see if miladi and mademoiselle were visible. I did tink miladi was not at home.\" \"You see I am at home, though,\" said her ladyship. \"Has Lord Delacour any business with me?\" \"No, miladi: not with miladi,\" said Champfort; \"it was with mademoiselle.\" \"With me, Monsieur Champfort? then you will be so good as to tell Lord Delacour I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> here.\" \"And that _I_ am not here, Champfort; for I must be gone to dress.\" She rose hastily to leave the room, but Miss Portman caught her hand: \"You won't go, I hope, Lady Delacour,\" said she, \"till I have finished my long story?\" Lady Delacour sat down again, ashamed of her own embarrassment. Whether this be art, innocence, or assurance, thought she, I cannot tell; but we shall see. Lord Delacour now came in, with a half-unfolded newspaper, and a packet of letters in his...", "...He contrasted with all this the tremendous fervour of the Balkan League, and described a picture he had recently seen in a French illustrated paper. Two French officers were shown looking at a Bulgarian regiment on their knees, their priest praying for them and blessing them before they went into action. \"What would one of our generals get,\" said one of the French officers to his friend, \"if he ordered such a thing as that?\" \"He would get the victory,\" quietly said the other. I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> expecting great things from Russia, and for us through Russia, for civilization and for GOD, and what I have written is being ever more and more widely felt by others also, and even expressed in daily papers, where at one time we should not have expected such a thing to be thought of in the midst of a great war. \"That Russia is one of the most truly religious countries in the world is proved by the crowds which filled and overflowed in all the churches yesterday when thanksgiving...", "...if they allowed them to be violated. I do not recall having seen two more intensely excited, radiant women in my life than Elsie and Betty Billy. They were in an ecstatic state of mind. Their husbands, but little less excited, offered to help us in every way possible, and, to prove their earnest, turned the prow of the motor-boat down-stream, abandoning the trip up the river in order to be in Vienna in case I should need them for any purpose whatsoever. \"You may rest easy so far as I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> concerned, Mrs. Titus,\" said the young diplomat. \"As a representative of the United States government I can't become publicly involved in this international muddle. I've just _got_ to keep my lips sealed. If it were discovered that I knew of all this, my head would be under the snickersnee in no time at all. Swish! Officially suicided!\" At ten o'clock the next morning I was called to the telephone. Smith had startling news to impart. Count Tarnowsy and Baron Umovitch had engaged...", "...boy's mind. \"You two, who claim the right to be called soldiers, although never having marched in the ranks until the day we left Watuga, know full well that the Britishers are within thirty or forty miles of us at this moment.\" The colonel paused as if for reply, and Evan said: \"We have heard it so spoken among the men, sir.\" \"You understand, also, that we are like to measure strength with them before many hours?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"While I cast no discredit on your courage, I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> free to say that men who have had more experience in this business will be of greater service to us in time of battle than you lads.\" \"But surely, father, you won't say that we shall not bear our share in the combat,\" Evan cried, suddenly forgetting the fears of which he had made mention to his comrade. \"It is not my purpose to prevent you from bearing your full share of danger, and in fact I now propose to place you in a position more perilous than, perhaps, would be your...", "...to let her think that the most important thing in the world just then was the proper adjustment of the wings of his necktie. \"There!\" she said, and patted him on the cheek, to show that the task had been successfully accomplished. \"Better come along for a little spin,\" he said, readjusting the tie with man-like ingenuousness. \"Do you good, Lou.\" \"Very well,\" she said. \"Can you wait a few minutes?\" \"Long as you like,\" said he graciously. \"Ask Maud if she wants to come, too.\" \"I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> sure she will enjoy it,\" said his wife, and then Mr. Blithers descended to the verandah to think. Somehow he felt if he did a little more thinking perhaps matters wouldn't be so bad. Among other things, he thought it would be a good idea not to motor in the direction of Grandby Tavern. And he also thought it was not worth while resenting the fact that his wife and daughter took something over an hour to prepare for the little spin. In the meantime, Prince Robin was racing over the...", "...in and let us prepare supper. We must skin the game and cook it.' They began to skin the game, but by the time the devi had skinned one beast, Asphurtzela had finished all the game, thrown it into the pot and cooked it. The devi gazed on Asphurtzela in unfeigned astonishment. When the food was cooked, and they sat down to supper, the devi, according to his custom, put the question to his guest: 'Art thou an eater of bones or of flesh?' 'Pass me over the flesh, why should I eat bones? <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> I a dog that I should do this?' answered Asphurtzela. The devi gave him flesh, and inquired: 'Wilt thou drink out of a qantsi or out of a doki?' 'Pass over the doki, why should I take a qantsi?' The devi gave him the doki, and sank into deep thought. When it was time to go to bed, the devi inquired: 'Wilt thou sleep in the stable or in a bed?' 'I am a man, what should I do in the stable? Give me a bed,' said Asphurtzela. So it came to pass that Asphurtzela slept in the bed, and...", "...Henry Harrod did to your father I'd have behaved as your father behaved; I'd never have budged from this spot; I'd have hunted where I chose; I'd have borne an implacable hatred against Henry Harrod and Harrod Place, and every soul in it!\" The girl, silenced, looked at him without belief. He said: \"I am not surprised that you distrust what I say. But the man you are going to marry was a junior officer in my command. I have no closer friend than Jack Stormont. Ask him whether I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> to be believed.\" Astounded, the girl turned a flushed, incredulous face to Stormont. He said: \"You may trust Darragh as you trust me. I don't know what he has to say to you, dear. But whatever he says will be the truth.\" Darragh said, gravely: \"Through a misunderstanding your father came into possession of stolen property, Eve. He did not know it had been stolen. I did. But Mike Clinch would not have believed me if I told him that the case of jewels in his possession had...", "...here, a certain little cottage where I could enjoy the quiet I so much need, while awaiting that day in which a greater quiet--that which can be never broken--shall come to wrap me all about. I dream of a bench before the threshold, and of fields spreading away out of sight. But I must have a fresh smiling young face beside me, to reflect and concentrate all that freshness of nature. I could then imagine myself a grandfather, and all the long void of my life would be filled.... I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> not a violent man, and yet I become easily vexed, and all my works have caused me quite as much pain as pleasure. And I do not know how it is that I still keep thinking about that very conceited and very inconsiderated impertinence which my young friend of the Luxembourg took the liberty to utter about me some three months ago. I do not call him \"friend\" in irony, for I love studious youth with all it temerities and imaginative eccentricities. Still, my young friend certainly went...", "...by; God knows why the useless are spared to live while the faithful are called to die, But the form that had sheltered me shivered, and seemed to shrivel away, And when I had raised it clear of my face I looked into lifeless clay. . . . And darkness fell, and the world was black, and the last of my reason fled, And when I came to myself again I was back at the ranch, in bed. That was back in the Eighties, and still I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> living here; I built this shanty on the spot; her grave is lying near; And when at nights my nostrils sense the smoke-smell in the air I seem to feel her form again, and hear again her prayer; And then the darkness settles down and wild night-creatures cry, But stars come out in heaven and there's comfort in the sky. WHO OWNS THE LAND? Who owns the land? The Duke replied, \"I own the land. My fathers died...", "...his great age had weakened his frame, but he walked about the grounds with his staff, as erect as when I first saw him, and evinced nothing in his general manner that could excite a suspicion that his hours had so nearly run their course. We had been talking of the time when peace on earth should be universal; 'My time, dear baittie[33] (daughter), is drawing to a quick conclusion. You may live to see the events foretold, I shall be in my grave; but remember, I tell you now, though I <span class=\"clocktext\">am</span> dead, yet when Jesus Christ returns to earth, at His coming, I shall rise again from my grave; and I shall be with Him, and with Emaum Mhidhie also.' This was the substance of his last serious conversation with me, and within one short week he was removed from those who loved to hear his voice; but he still lives in the memory of many, and those who knew his worth are reconciled by reflecting on the 'joy that awaits the righteous'.
