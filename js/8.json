And with one accord the oars of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> great ships smote the water, and bent, and tore the waves into foam--and London Bridge was broken! The memory of that sight will never pass from my mind or from the mind of any man of us who saw all that the lifted hand and shout of Olaf the king brought about.

From the western head, I saw that the bay extended six or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> miles above the ship, to the southward, and that the southern outlet, beyond Winchilsea Island, was about one mile wide; but the whole seemed to be too shallow for any thing larger than boats.

Keep at about fifty-five degrees and repot as frequently as required. If they are to be grown in a bed or bench, have the soil ready by the first part of June. The distance apart will be determined by the method by which they are to be grown--six or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> inches if to \"single stems\" with the great big flowers one sees at the florist's; about eight, ten or twelve if three blooms are to be had from each plant. Of course that will be determined by individual taste; but personally I prefer the \"spray\" form, growing a dozen or more to each plant. They should be syringed frequently and given partial shade. A good way is to spray onto the roof a mixture of lime-water, about as thick as milk, or white lead and naphtha in solution.

The vase, with the metal thus prepared, is exposed to the light of the sun, between the hours of seven and <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> in the morning. The power of the prepared metal is great, and so strongly attracts and retains heat, that it renders the surrounding atmosphere quite cold. One hour in the sun is sufficient to bring leaves from the Luania.

Lefty, the gambler who had yelped about psi powers at the game, dealt the tenth hand. He gave me the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> of spades in the hole. By the fourth card I had three other spades showing, which gave me four-fifths of a rare flush in stud poker. But by the fourth card Lefty had given himself a pair of jacks.

By digesting this orange-flower pomatum in rectified spirits in the proportions of from six pounds to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pounds of pomade to a gallon of spirit, for about a fortnight at a summer heat, we obtain the extrait de fleur d'orange, or extract of orange-flowers, a handkerchief perfume surpassed by none.

I wanted that myself.\" \"I am not at all sure that my performance will be one of glory,\" smiled Darrin. \"It won't, if Cantor can manage to queer you in any way,\" murmured Denton to himself, as he moved on. In the ward-room that evening the \"impertinence\" of two new ensigns in capturing such prized details was commented upon with a great deal of chaffing. Even Lieutenant Cantor was declared to be much too young to be entrusted with such important work. At <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock the fortunate lieutenant and ensigns were once more sent for, to go over the map and instructions with Captain Gales. At nine o'clock, just before the \"_Long Island_\" was abreast of the Alvarez mill, the first launch was cleared away and lowered, falling behind and lying to. Then Darrin, with his own crew, went down over the side to the launch towing alongside. It was Coxswain Riley who stood by to catch the young commanding officer's arm. \"Hullo, Coxswain,\" was...", "...The new head of the English Church, if he found his interest in assuming himself the spiritual supremacy, was, like a true despot, averse to any further revolution than was necessary to his purposes. Some superstitious regrets too for the old establishment which, by a fortunate caprice, he abandoned and afterwards plundered, may have urged the tyrant, who persecuted the Catholics for questioning his supremacy, to burn the enemies of transubstantiation. Shortly before this enactment, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> persons had been hanged at Tyburn, not so much for sorcery as for a disagreeable prophecy.

Even if two lads happen to be reciting in the same place, they have no more connection with each other than any other two pupils. Of such a thing as classification the teacher has never heard, and the irregular attendance of the scholars would, he tells you, prevent it, even were it otherwise possible. Owing to the time required to hear so many recitations, an ordinary school does not contain more than <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten pupils, and twenty are regarded as beyond one teacher's capacity. There is very little which is really intellectual in any part of the early schooling of an ordinary Chinese boy. As a rule, the teacher does not concern himself with his pupils further than to drag them over a specified course, or at least to attempt to do so. The parents of the lad are equally indifferent, or even more so. If the father himself can read, he remembers that he learned to do so by a long and...", "...Atlantik Oshun.

We do not profess to give any lengthened history of his remarkable career, because to do so would be to exceed the limits and intention of a work of the character of the present; but the following, we believe, will be found to be a faithful, though necessarily short, narrative of the chief circumstances of his life. While in Bath Mr. Hunt formed an acquaintance with the son of a brewer, who deluded him into a partnership; and it appears that he absolutely lost <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> thousand pounds in a brewing concern at Bristol, which was the first occasion of his becoming acquainted with the people of that city. In 1804 he first attended a public meeting, which was held at Devizes, respecting the conduct of Lord Melville; and, in the next year, he first affixed his name to a public address, calling on the inhabitants of Wiltshire to oppose the corn laws. Having once embarked in politics, he was ever restless, and on every possible occasion he forced...", "...Boone, \"declaring it was their orders, from Governor Hamilton, to take us captives, and not to destroy us; but if nine of us would come out and treat with them, they would immediately withdraw their forces from our walls, and return home peacably.\" Transparent as the stratagem was, Boone incautiously agreed to a conference with the enemy; Callaway alone took the precaution to guard against Indian duplicity. After a long talk, the Indians proposed to Boone, Callaway, and the seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pioneers who accompanied them that they shake hands in token of peace and friendship. As picturesquely described by Daniel Trabue: \"The Indians sayed two Indians must shake hands with one white man to make a Double or sure peace at this time the Indians had hold of the white men's hands and held them. Col. Calloway objected to this but the other Indians laid hold or tryed to lay hold of the other hand but Colonel Calloway was the first that jerked away from them but the...", "...for gone; but on a sudden he let go his hold, turned from her as if he were nauseated, then gave her a lash with his tail; after which she returned to the gallery, not the least out of countenance: and this, it seems, was the usual treatment of coquettes. \"I thought we had now seen enough, but my friend would needs have us go and visit one or two lions in the city.

He must ride into Bradford, forty miles from the foothills before <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock next morning. He must telegraph MacNelly to be in Val Verde on the twenty-fifth. He must ride back to Ord, to intercept Knell, face him be denounced, kill him, and while the iron was hot strike hard to win Poggin's half-won interest as he had wholly won Fletcher's.

The remaining fifty-seven churches, therefore, were being served by forty regular ministers, and two resident social workers who take care of a Baptist...", "...Stair continued with a smile to prepare for that part of the work which is the curse of every bachelor menage--the washing-up after. \"I think,\" he said quietly, \"that you will have enough to do with your correspondence--I take everything upon me for to-day. Your pardon, Mr. Wemyss, but I am afraid you have dropped something!\" \"Ah, so I have--it is nothing--I am much obliged to you.\" He spoke the truth. It was nothing to him--what, indeed, could be anything in comparison with those <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> closely written sheets of large letter paper from his Princess--only the half of which he had yet mastered. Elsa of Saxe-Brunschweig had never written him so long a letter since the day when they agreed, long ago in Vienna, that for the good of her house and country she must marry the old duke-elector. So it came to pass that Julian Wemyss was grateful to Patsy for bringing him such good fortune. Nor was he surprised out of measure when he heard that his niece had the offer of...", "...a pint of boiling water; cover and let stand until cold; then strain and serve. APPLE TOAST WATER.--Break a slice of zwieback into small pieces, and mix with them two or three well-baked tart apples. Pour over all a quart of boiling water, cover, and let stand until cold, stirring occasionally. When cold, strain, add sugar to sweeten if desired, and serve. BAKED MILK.--Put a quart of new milk in a stone jar, tie a white paper over it, and let it stand in a moderately heated oven <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten hours. It becomes of a creamy consistency. BARLEY LEMONADE.--Put a half cup of pearl barley into a quart of cold water, and simmer gently until the water has become mucilaginous and quite thick. This will take from an hour to an hour and a half. The barley will absorb most of the water, but the quantity given should make a teacupful of good, thick barley water. Add to this two teaspoonfuls of lemon juice and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let it get cold before serving. By...", "...means at work to discover who he was and from whence he came. Croisenois said that he had taken him into his service on the recommendation of an English baronet of his acquaintance, a certain Sir Richard Wakefield. The man was a Frenchman, but he had resided for some time in England, for he spoke that language with tolerable fluency. Andre knew nothing of these details, but he had heard of the existence of the valet from M. de Breulh, when he had asked where the Marquis lived. At <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock on the morning after he had surreptitiously left his home in the manner described, Andre took up his position in a small wine-shop not far from the abode of the Marquis de Croisenois. He had done this designedly, for he knew enough of the manner and customs of Parisian society to know that this was the hour usually selected by domestics in fashionable quarters to come out for a gossip while their masters were still in bed. Andre had more confidence in himself than...", "...by them to the French minister of the interior, is as follows: In bread, every one hundred pounds is found to contain eighty pounds of nutritious matter; butcher's meat, averaging the different sorts, contains only thirty-five pounds in one hundred; French beans (in the grain), ninety-two pounds in one hundred; broad beans, eighty-nine pounds; peas, ninety-three pounds; lentils (a species of half pea little known with us), fifty-four pounds in one hundred; greens and turnips only <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pounds of solid nutritious substance in one hundred; carrots, fourteen pounds; and one hundred pounds of potatoes yield only twenty-five pounds of nutriment. I will just affix to the foregoing one more table.

And mind, not a word of this to anyone.\" CHAPTER XIII The Raid At exactly ten minutes to eleven on the following night, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> police cars rolled swiftly down the boulevard. In a congested portion of the city they drew up to the curbing, waiting for Christopher Nichols who rode with his daughter in a dark sedan. Jerome Davis, in charge of the raid, came over to speak to the detective. \"Everything is all set, Mr. Nichols. We have the entire neighborhood bottled up. Every alley and street guarded.\" \"Good. And the Hamilton building?\" \"It is surrounded. At exactly eleven my men will raid both...", "...these devils offered their services to him; they proposed that they be sent out to reconnoitre the land. Joshua refused the offer, but formed their appearance so frightfully that the residents of Jericho were struck with fear of them. (11) In Jericho the spies put up with Rahab. She had been leading an immoral life for forty years, but at the approach of Israel, she paid homage to the true God, lived the life of a pious convert, and, as the wife of Joshua, became the ancestress of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> prophets and of the prophetess Huldah. (12) She had opportunity in her own house of beholding the wonders of God. When the king's bailiffs came to make their investigations, and Rahab wanted to conceal the Israelitish spies, Phinehas calmed her with the words: \"I am a priest, and priests are like angels, visible when they wish to be seen, invisible when they do not wish to be seen.\" (13) After the return of the spies, Joshua decided to pass over the Jordan. The crossing of the...", "...was made at the evening lock up, this man was found missing. As he had not been seen since the prisoners were taken from the mines, it was believed, correctly, that he had remained below. There was nothing done about the matter that night, the officers knowing there would be no opportunity of effecting his escape during the night-time, as they had carefully closed the shafts at the top. They did not set any watch until the next day. During that Saturday night this convict climbed <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred feet to the top of one of the shafts. The wooden beams running across the shaft are about five feet apart. Standing erect on one of these beams he threw his arms over the one above his head, and would swing up to it. In this manner he worked his way to the top of the shaft. When he reached the surface how great was his disappointment, for instead of finding the shaft open, as he supposed it would be, he found that the cover was down and that he was unable to get out of...", "...her happiness even above the wishes and welfare of the tribe.\" \"Terry, you said this girl is 'different.' How different?\" Terry shrugged his shoulders, rose and secured their hats before answering. \"You will probably see her to-night, Major.

The huge monolith rose some <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred feet above the tableland on which the village was built. Its symmetrical slopes were smooth and steep. A goat could not have found footing anywhere upon its precipitous sides. A winding shelf had been cut out of the rock to serve as a trail. It wound round the cone a dozen times in an ascent of several hundred feet where it terminated, high above where they stood, in a niche twenty feet square. Niche and trail had been chipped out of solid rock and were worn smooth by...", "...legged ones are compelled to double-quick to keep up, and then there will be a halt of perhaps fifteen to thirty minutes when you are kept standing in the broiling sun; then start again and stop five minutes later.

If you met a colored man and asked how far it was to Manassas he would reply \"'Deed, boss, I don't know, 'spec 'tis a right smart distance.\" Another would say it was <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> miles, and after going a mile or two you would ask again and would be told it was ten miles and a \"bit.\" NOTHING LIKE HARDTACK. I found on the second day's march that the sutler's \"goodies\" which I had stocked up with had absorbed a little too much of the flavor of my haversack to be palatable, so I returned to Uncle Sam's ration of hardtack, salt junk and coffee, which cannot be beaten for a steady diet when campaigning.

From the foregoing some idea of the gigantic nature of the task will be obtained, and we can pass on to a more detailed account of the actual work. Minesweeping may be divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> well-defined sections, as follows:-- (1) _Fleet Sweeping._--Keeping clear the sea routes of the battle fleet. (2) _Exploratory Sweeping._--Searching the sea for isolated groups or fields.

The cost of production of hogs depends rather more upon the price of corn than upon any other factor. Investigation showed that owing to the violent fluctuations in demand for corn and hogs during the war, there had been five periods between the beginning of the war and September, 1917, in which it had been more profitable to sell corn than to feed it to swine at the price of hogs then prevailing, while there were only three periods when the reverse was true. In the preceding <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years there had been only two periods in which the direct sale of corn was more profitable than feeding it to swine. The results of these periods of unprofitable feeding was to retard hog production, as the grower was discouraged from breeding during those periods. Hoover therefore decided that the maintenance of a proper relation between the price of corn and the price of hogs was the best method of assuring an increased production of pork. Furthermore, the violent...", "...to accomplish it. The disturbing presence of the policy of relying on a preponderance in power over England, to be gained by a great navy, to the side of which the smaller navies would be attracted, imposed on England the necessity of guarding against what was menacing the national life. As the outcome of this situation she was compelled, so long as Germany insisted on developing her naval policy, to sit down and take thought. The result of her deliberations may be summed up in <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> propositions: 1. It was necessary, if the safety of England by sea was not to be put in jeopardy that she should enter into real and close friendships with other nations. 2. The great attraction to these other nations would lie in the maintenance of British sea power. 3. While the power of the British Navy was of the first importance to France, she might also, through no fault of her own, be placed in such peril as made it desirable that we should be able...", "...thought that the rays he saw formed the Greek initials of Christ, and he therefore ordered these initials, _forming a six-rayed wheel_, to be set up on the standards of his soldiers. The only difference between his \"Labarum\" and the symbol of the Gaulish sun-god was that his upper spoke was looped to form the letter P. No doubt whatever, that his Keltic soldiers hailed the new standard as that of their national god, and that when they marched against Maxentius and met him at Saxa Rubra, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> miles from Rome, they thought that they, as Gauls, were marching to a second capture of the capital of the world, under the protection of their national god. Among men of note that have been associated with Nimes is Fl\u00e9chier, born at Pernes in Vaucluse in 1632, who became Bishop of Nimes in 1687. He was the son of a tallow-chandler.

But Francis was not a thoughtless or inattentive child; on the contrary he observed on his way _to_, and _from_ School, and when he walked out with his Papa, everything that workmen did.

In the escort were numerous prominent friends and kinsmen or vassals of the house of Ferrara, lords of Correggio and Mirandola; the Counts Rangone of Modena; one of the Pio of Carpi; the Counts Bevilacqua, Roverella, Sagrato, Strozzi of Ferrara, Annibale Bentivoglio of Bologna, and many others. These gentlemen, magnificently clad, and with heavy gold chains about their necks, mounted on beautiful horses, left Ferrara December 9th, with thirteen trumpeters and <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> fifes at their head; and thus this wedding cavalcade, led by a worldly cardinal, rode noisily forth upon their journey. In our time such an aggregation might easily be mistaken for a troop of trick riders. Nowhere did this brave company of knights pay their reckoning; in the domain of Ferrara they lived on the duke; in other words, at the expense of his subjects. In the lands of other lords they did the same, and in the territory of the Church the cities they visited were...", "...the _Argus_ who does not know how the war has affected me. I have tried to believe, and to persuade others to believe, that Sabinsport need not concern herself with the war. I tried to talk and act as if we could go on with our daily lives here as if it were not loose on the earth. I thought that was our duty--at least, I wanted to think that was our duty. My persistency has been due mainly to the program I had laid out for myself for this town. \"I came to Sabinsport <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years ago with a plan for her regeneration.

He had a plan for making what he thought would be a perfect world;...", "...brought out the \"spread\" and for an hour longer the gathering munched delectable cookies and drank ginger ale and talked.

Cumner was a nearby town of some <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or nine thousand inhabitants set in the middle of a prosperous farming community. The Cumner teams were made up largely of very hefty sons of the soil, averaging slightly older than Parkinson's representatives and invariably out-weighing them. As a rule Parkinson won because of better knowledge of the game and greater speed. She called Cumner's players The Farmers, but she did it with much respect and liking, knowing which Cumner took no exception to the title. In fact, the...", "...an immediate resort to this extreme measure, which, he declared, \"should not be used by just and generous nations, confiding in their strength for injuries committed, if it can be honorably avoided,\" but, in a spirit of forbearance, proposed that another demand be made on Mexico for that redress which had been so long and unjustly withheld. In these views committees of the two Houses of Congress, in reports made to their respective bodies, concurred. Since these proceedings more than <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years have elapsed, during which, in addition to the wrongs then complained of, others of an aggravated character have been committed on the persons and property of our citizens. A special agent was sent to Mexico in the summer of 1838 with full authority to make another and final demand for redress. The demand was made; the Mexican Government promised to repair the wrongs of which we complained, and after much delay a treaty of indemnity with that view was concluded between the...", "...lost two more of their number whose horses failed, and having slain four of the Guard who pursued incautiously ahead of the rest, they reached the spurs of the hills, and there scattered, every man by himself, and found refuge, some in the woods, some in shepherds' huts; so they came off with their lives.

Then he cried aloud to his men, and <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> of them, hearing him, checked their horses, but could not understand what he desired of them till he cried aloud again, and pointed with his hand towards where the ten, Tommasino leading and Bena in the rear, had gained the hill-road and were riding up it as swiftly as their horses could mount. Then the Lieutenant, cursing his own folly, gathered them, and they rode after Tommasino and Bena. \"Be of good heart,\" said the Lieutenant. \"They are between us and the company of my...", "...huge and high carged [Footnote: From the French, _carguer_ to furl.] was the Spanish ship, being of a thousand and fiue hundreth tuns.

The total population of the province is not now more than three per cent. of the total population of Argentina, but its comparative importance was much greater in the middle of the nineteenth century (nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> per cent. at the census of 1861). The departments of Loreto, Atamisqui, and Salavina on the Rio Dulce, which live mainly on the estates of the _banados_, comprised 46,000 inhabitants in 1861, and only 43,000 in 1895. The Woodbine Parish map and Hutchinson's description clearly give one an impression of a dense population in the area of the _banados_. I refer elsewhere to the antiquity and constancy of the streams of temporary immigration which spread the population of the...", "...archives of the crown.

There are, however, various herbs for this seasoning, though all of them have a similar flavour. I confess, myself, I do not much like the flavour; it is, like that of olives, an acquired taste.

Under a sky of rosy apples we dreamt of roaming as freely and happily as we had chased the cloud shadows on the Dakota plains. We had...", "...character possessed by Mr. Kennedy was economy; the frequent use of the rods as he raised himself on tiptoe to make his protest the more emphatic--split and frizzled them--the immersion of the tips in water would prevent this, and add to the severity of the castigation, while diminishing the expense.

In this way sixteen spheres become formed, of which eight are large and are formed mainly of the yolk material of the inner part of the ovum, and eight are small and entirely composed of the granular protoplasm. The <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> small spheres form a ring on the formative surface of the large spheres (fig. 82 D). The small spheres now increase very rapidly (fig. 82 E), partly by division _and partly by the formation of fresh cells from the large spheres_; and spread over the large spheres, forming in this way an epibolic gastrula. They constitute a layer of epiblast. (fig. 83 A.) The large cells in the meantime remain relatively passive, though during the process they divide, in some cases more or less...", "...nets, live more in society than the natives to the southward, and are much better lodged.

The river was as wide as the Thames at Greenwich, with a very rapid current. They saw in some of the quiet reaches fishing-boats at work, some with nets, others with lines, and at night saw them spearing salmon and sturgeon by torch-light. Across the river they made out several of the yourts or summer tents of the Ostjaks, but it was not until the fourth day that they came upon a group of seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> of these tents on the river bank. The men were all away fishing, but the women came out to look at the strangers. As Luka spoke their dialect he had no difficulty in opening the conversation with them. He told them that he and his companion wanted to go down the river to Yeneseisk, and wished to buy a boat, a good one. The women said that some of the men would be in that evening, and that the matter could be arranged. \"They will be glad to sell us a boat,\" Luka said to...", "...in the ripe ooegonium (_L_, _O_) is surrounded by five, spirally twisted cells, and crowned by a circle of five smaller ones, which become of a yellowish color when full grown.

If the boats tried for Acapulco they would get out of the doldrums when half-way there--in case they ever got half-way--and then they would be in lamentable case, for there they would meet the north-east trades coming down in their teeth, and these boats were so rigged that they could not sail within <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> points of the wind. So they wisely started northward, with a slight slant to the west. They had but ten days' short allowance of food; the long-boat was towing the others; they could not depend on making any sort of definite progress in the doldrums, and they had four or five hundred miles of doldrums in front of them yet.

However, we were in a happy frame of mind, for we imagined we had really made the desired discovery. Nothing of moment happened until we reached the valley of the River. Then we found we were treed. We had been travelling all the time among hills and valleys, to be sure, but on a high elevation. Even the bottom lands, in which lay the lakes, were several hundred feet above Superior. Now we emerged from the forest to find ourselves on bold mountains at least seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred feet above the main valley. And in the main valley we could make out the River. It was rather dizzy work. Three or four times we ventured over the rounded crest of the hill, only to return after forty or fifty feet because the slope had become too abrupt. This grew to be monotonous and aggravating. It looked as though we might have to parallel the River's course, like scouts watching an army, on the top of the hill. Finally a little ravine gave us hope. We scrambled...", "...Dr. Waldo, the famous American evangelist, gave me of his work under Mr. Charrington's banner, were told me in my private study at the Manor House, while the tall, handsome man with the twinkling eyes of merriment was staying in the mansion.

But these savage monsters did not content themselves with what was thrown away; they were so bold as to come before our faces and take bites out of the whale's body. Some of these sharks were <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> and nine feet long, and when I saw them open their horrid jaws, armed with three rows of glistening white sharp teeth, I could well understand how easily they could bite off the leg of a man, as they often do when they get the chance. Sometimes they would come right up on the whale's body with a wave, bite out great pieces of the flesh, turn over on their bellies, and roll off.

One ingenious inventor planned to build a wheel with a rim wide enough to pass the tollgates free. The model was a wagon which had the rear axle four inches shorter than the front, making a track <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> inches in width. Nine horses were hitched to this wagon, three abreast. The team caused much comment, but was not voted practicable. The loads carried on the mountain ships were very large.

However, we are able to single out some features of importance and compare them in a general way. It has been noted that the Norwegian pupils begin school at seven years of age, while the American children commence at five or six. Many prominent educators believe that our American children start to school too young. They are of the opinion that their development, physical and mental, would be better if they did not begin formal school work until at least seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years of age.

When she was dressed, she came down, and they brought her the mule which had not drank for eight days, and was mad with thirst, so much salt had it eaten. When she was mounted, the cavaliers went first, making their horses caracole, and thus did all the company pass through the town into the country, and on till they came to a defile through which the great river Rhone rushes with marvellous swiftness. And when the mule which had drank nothing for <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days saw the river, it sought neither bridge nor ford, but made one leap into the river with its load, which was the precious body of Madame. All the attendants saw the accident, but they could give no help; so was Madame drowned, which was a great misfortune. And the mule, when it had drunk its fill, swam across the Rhone till it reached the shore, and was saved. All were much troubled and sorrowful that Madame was lost, and they returned to the town.

The said reflector is contained within two regular polygonal planes twelve inches apart, each having ninety-six sides, the perimeter of the upper plane corresponding with a circle of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet diameter, that of the lower plane being six feet. The corresponding sides of these planes are connected by flat taper mirrors composed of thin glass silvered on the outside. When the reflector faces the sun at right angles, each mirror intercepts a pencil of rays of 32.61 square inches section, hence the entire reflecting surface receives the radiant heat of an annular sunbeam of 32.61 x 96 = 3,130 square inches section.

The privateer sheered off at once, and took to her heels, followed by an incessant fire of grape and musketry from those whom she had recently pursued. This awkward position, which carried the chance of a disabling shot and consequent capture, lasted till eight, when the speed of the schooner took her out of range, having had in all <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> men killed and fifteen wounded; two round shot in the hull, and spars and rigging much cut up. It was afterwards ascertained that her opponent was the \"Volcano\" bombship, convoying the transport \"Golden Fleece,\" on board which were two hundred and fifty troops from Chesapeake Bay for Jamaica. The \"Volcano\" lost an officer and two men killed, and two wounded; proving that under somewhat awkward circumstances the \"Saucy Jack\" could give as well as take.[235] A little later in...", "...by their context to represent Lakhnau in Oudh, others inferentially and by the verbal agreement of the Haidarabad Codex and Kehr's Codex to stand for Lakhnur (now Shahabad in Rampur).

This they did on different grounds, but in each case their agreement has behind it a defective textual basis.--Mr. Erskine, as is well known, translated the 'Abdu'r-rahim Persian text without access to the original Turki but, if he had had the Elphinstone Codex when translating, it would have given him no help because all the eight instances occur on folios not preserved by that codex.

From seven to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> thousand persons, with all their portable property, thus obstructed the mouth of the Tagus, protected by the English fleet; on the 28th a favorable wind permitted them to sail.

I have consumed my life in laboriously doing nothing.\" And to another, that inquired of his wisdom and learning, what course to take, he solemnly answered, \"Be serious.\" Such was the sense he had, how much a serious life excelled, and was of force towards a dying hour.

The increased cost of maintenance--6,250,000_l._--was accounted for, he said, mainly by increased pay, wages, and victuals (2,140,000_l._), oil reserve (1,500,000_l._), and air service (900,000_l._). Apart from these two last items, the whole increase was either automatic or proportioned to the increased size and strength of the Fleet, which again was proportionate to that of other Powers.

In some of these the custom permitted the student to keep what are called \"short terms;\" that is, the four terms of Michaelmas, Lent, Easter, and Act, were kept severally by a residence, in the aggregate, of ninety-one days, or thirteen weeks. Under this interrupted residence, accordingly, it was possible that a student might have a reason for going down to his home four times in the year. This made <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> journeys to and fro. And as these homes lay dispersed through all the shires of the island, and most of us disdained all coaches except his majesty's mail, no city out of London could pretend to so extensive a connection with Mr. Palmer's establishment as Oxford.

There was weakness, soreness and numbness in the arms, hands, back and hips; the bladder was irritable, urine being passed frequently, or occasionally scanty, dark, thick, with a brick-dust deposit. There was a dragging sensation in the region of the womb. Menstruation was irregular, and she had frequent trembling spells lasting for hours. There was difficulty in fixing the...", "...and for almost every kind of fraud. One young woman, with a babe in her arms, was hanged for stealing a piece of cloth worth one dollar and twenty-five cents! Another was hanged for taking food to keep herself and little child from starving. It was no uncommon thing to see women hanging from the gibbet at Newgate, because they had passed a forged one-pound note (five dollars). George Cruikshank in 1818 was so moved at one of these executions that he made a picture which represented <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> men and three women hanging from the gallows, and a rope coiled around the faces of twelve others. Across the picture were the words, \"I promise to perform during the issue of Bank-notes easily imitated ... for the Governors and Company of the Bank of England.\" He called the picture a \"Bank-note, not to be imitated.\" It at once created a great sensation. Crowds blocked the street in front of the shop where it was hung. The pictures were in such demand that Cruikshank sat up...", "...deal with barracks apart from fortifications.

Though sitting at the open window, with the sharp sea-breeze blowing in upon her--it happened to be a sunless and gloomy day--Agatha had answered that she was \"quite warm.\" Nevertheless her heart felt cold. Not positively sad, yet void.

Wanting this--yet scarcely conscious of her need--the young wife sat, in her secret soul all shivering and a-cold. At last, wearied with the long grey sweep of undulating sea, she closed the window. \"I thought the breeze would be too keen for you,\" said Mr. Harper, whom her lightest movement always seemed to attract. \"Oh no; but I am tired of watching the waves.

They were practically mashed into hamburger. I guess you'd call this pounded steak.\" I ate some of the meat and settled back to rest again. Presently I dozed off. When I awakened it was dark and Kazu was back. Martin had started a big campfire outside, evidently with Kazu's aid, for it was stoked with several logs fully <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet in diameter and was sending flames fifty feet into the sky. Kazu himself was squatting directly over it, staring down at us. When I came to the door, he spoke. \"Ah, little brother Bill. I am so sorry that you were hurt. I am afraid I forgot to be gentle, and that is not forgiveable in Buddha.\" I made an appropriate reply, and then waited. Evidently he had as yet told nothing of his day's expedition. Finally he plucked a roasted bullock from the fire and popped it into...", "...The beauty of the morning and the romantic scenery was unnoticed: his thoughts were directed solely to contemplating the depth and the width of my stocking of powder, which seemed to afford him infinite satisfaction.

The poet, like his father before him, held a court...", "...able by direct experiments to show that a sheath of liquid set between two solid cylinders tends, when one of the cylinders is subjected to a slight rotation, to return to its original position, and gives a measurable torsion to a thread upholding the cylinder. From the knowledge of this torsion the rigidity can be deduced. In the case of a solution containing 1/2 per cent. of gelatine, it is found that this rigidity, enormous compared with that of water, is still, however, one trillion <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred and forty billion times less than that of steel. This figure, exact within a few billions, proves that the rigidity is very slight, but exists; and that suffices for a characteristic distinction to be founded on this property. In a general way, M. Spring has also established that we meet in solids, in a degree more or less marked, with the properties of liquids. When they are placed in suitable conditions of pressure and time, they flow through orifices, transmit...", "...either by day or by night; the vistas are peculiarly satisfying and charming.

For what seemed almost half an hour there was silence. Then suddenly came the far-off, long-drawn howl of a coyote, immediately followed by another.

They were Onondagas, on their reservation near Syracuse, New York. They were big boys of from sixteen to twenty years old, and the game they were playing was \"snow-snakes.\" The earth was covered with snow, and by dragging a stout log through this covering they had made a narrow gutter or trough about 500 or 700 feet long. Each youth had his snow-snake, which is a stick about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet long, and shaped something like a spear. All the snow-snakes were alike, less than an inch wide, half an inch thick, flat on the under side, rounded on top, and with a very slight turn upward at the point to suggest a serpent's head. The \"snakes\" were all smoothed and of heavy hard wood. The game was to see who could send his the farthest along the gutter in the snow. The young men grasped their snakes at the very end, ran a few steps, and shot the sticks along the trough....", "...and at length he succeeded. While he was doing this Stephenson was patiently building new locomotives, and trying to induce the mine-owners along the Tyne to replace their horse-cars with his engines. In 1819 the owners of the Hetton Colliery decided to make this change, and asked Stephenson to take charge of the construction of their line. He obtained the consent of the Killingworth owners, and began work. On November 18, 1822, the Hetton Railway was opened. Its length was about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> miles, and five of Stephenson's locomotives were working on it, under the direction of his brother Robert. In building this line George Stephenson was thoroughly practical. Although he knew that his name was becoming more and more identified with the locomotive engine, he did not hesitate to use stationary engines wherever he considered that they would be more economical. In the Hetton Railway, which ran for a part of its distance through rough country, he used stationary engines...", "...of health, lay upon a bed in a sleigh drawn by his favorite black horses, the same that he had driven to Albany to witness the execution of Strang.

By this arrangement there is no loss of time in withdrawing the types from under the cylinder to be again inked, but they move round from one fixed cylinder to another, receiving their ink between each, and thus producing eight impressions in succession during one complete revolution.

One man can, as a rule, chime three bells, with a rope in each hand and one foot in the loop of another; but by the use of an \"Ellacombe\" or other chiming apparatus one man can work six, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten bells. Some prefer the quieter sound of chiming as an introduction to divine service, but where a band of ringers is available and change-ringing is practised the bells as a rule are rung. The practice of \"clocking\" a bell, in which the clapper, by means of a cord attached to it and pulled from below, is allowed to swing against the bell at rest, is often employed to save trouble; but the jar is very likely to crack the bell. In ringing, or in true chiming, the bell is in...", "...eyes and hearts of Adams and his large family. Besides assuring himself of the truth of Brace's statements, the Captain obtained additional proof of the truth of Adams's account of himself and his community in the form of the chronometer and azimuth compass of the _Bounty_. \"How many did you say your colony consists of?\" asked Folger. \"Thirty-five all told, sir,\" answered Adams; \"but I fear we shall be only thirty-four soon.\" \"How so?\" \"One of our lads, a dear boy of about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years of age, is dying, I fear,\" returned Adams, sadly. \"I'm sorry to hear it, and still more sorry that I have no doctor in my ship,\" said Folger, \"but I have a smatterin' of doctors' work myself. Let me see him.\" Adams led the way to the hut where poor James Young lay, tenderly nursed by Mary Christian.

We played <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> games in all and he beat me six of them. Perhaps I was not at my best that night. But I never played against such a cold-blooded feller. He took a positive joy in winning his games and on the whole acted like a bum winner, making the most of his unusual good luck. I hold no grudge for that, however.

In the great sacristy and treasury of the cathedral we saw a rich collection of magnificent vestments for priests, bishops, and other church officials, costly gold and silver chalices, cruets, fonts, goblets, church vessels, &c.

One of these was of silver, weighing <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pounds and a half, adorned with rubies and diamonds, with a superb diamond cross hanging from it, and around it a collar of turquoises, amethysts, and sapphires; there was another of solid silver, much heavier, the gift of Pope Pius IX., and still a third, which far outshone all the rest in magnificence. This last was a foot and a half in height, was of solid gold, and weighed ten pounds and two ounces; it was studded with large jewels, and the gold beautifully enamelled.

The loss, which it is said falls partly upon the Parkesburg Building Association, cannot fall much below <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred dollars. Next was Charles Hennings's residence; the east end of it was destroyed, with the loss of between one and two hundred dollars. Vincent Rice, who came next in order, and had a house in course of erection, sustained a loss of probably two hundred dollars. This includes, I believe, most, if not all the destruction within the immediate limits of Parkesburg.

No one of the alleged actors, no one of the facts, and no one of the causes of the supposed quarrel can be true. Sir John Butler's death occurred before the Earldom of Derby had been conferred on Lord Stanley; when King Henry visited Lathom, the Earl's sister, Sir John Butler's widow, was sleeping her last sleep, and at the time of Sir John's death Piers Legh was a mere child of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years, so that unless he was very precocious his share in the outrage is purely mythical, and we may therefore dismiss the story of his being sentenced, as a penance for his participation in the murder, to build Disley Church. And yet the story has, doubtless, a foundation in fact, though the _actores fabulae_ may be phantoms. Sir John Butler died on the 26th of February, 1463; the cause of his death is shrouded in mystery, but that he died by violence is not altogether...", "...a dish and kept for future use. If quantities are well gauged and each Scout eats all that she takes on her plates, there should be very little waste from the table. There are two ways of clearing a table, washing the dishes, and so forth, which are used in camps. One is considered easier than the other because it divides the work among the entire group, but there is a question as to whether it is as sanitary a way as the other, or as helpful to the Scout. It is the method of having <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> campers scrape their dishes, stack them, fall in line, dishes in hand, and in succession wash, rinse and wipe them in pans and with towels common to that one group. As can readily be seen this methods breaks the rules being taught to Scouts as to the proper way of washing dishes: namely, to wash glass, first, silver next, change the water and wash saucers, cups, plates and so forth.

At the ringing of the _second_ bell the watch for the night is set, and our servants are prohibited from being abroad after that hour without a permit from their masters; the first bell subserves no purpose, and is merely rung in conformity to ancient usage.

Skunk and opossum are two animals that do not travel much in extreme cold weather, so that an island in a lake or large river, could be used with no fencing.

He grew to be a tall and comely boy, quick and bright, and inclined to be of a sweet and cheerful disposition. But the school of his upbringing was a hard one. A Jewish child in Morocco might know from his cradle that he was not born a Moor and a Mohammedan. When the boy was <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years old his father married a second wife, his first wife being still alive. This was lawful, though unusual in Tangier.

Why had he brought her here? They had no food. How would they live if a blizzard blew up and snowed them in? And even if they had supplies, how could she live alone for days with this man in a cabin <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> by ten?

The young men seated themselves on a pleasant knoll under some tall pines, there to wait a quarter of an hour or so, while the _bonde_ went forward to prepare Thelma.

At one side of the large sanctuary, which is about one hundred and thirty feet deep, and seventy-five feet broad, an ascent of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten steps leads to a broad platform visible to all. On this platform attendants move about, preparing all that is necessary for the next portion of the ceremony, the _mandatum_, or washing of feet. Soon a line of thirteen figures, dressed as pilgrims in long white woollen robes reaching to the instep, ascend to the platform, and the attendants conduct them to the seats that are prepared.

When the egg leaves the ovary the nucleus disappears, leaving behind it this rudiment of the blastoderm, which rapidly grows and increases in size. The blastoderm of the chick before incubation is found to be composed of spherical anucleate bodies which Schwann considers to be cells, because they almost certainly develop into the cells of the incubated blastoderm, which are clearly recognisable as such after <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hours' incubation. The serous and mucous layers can be distinguished after sixteen hours' incubation, and it is found that the cells of the serous layer contain definite nuclei, though such seem to be absent in the cells of the mucous layer. Between the two layers other cells are formed belonging to the vessel layer, which is, however, in Schwann's opinion not a very definitely individualised layer. Schwann's next step is a detailed demonstration of the origin of each tissue...", "...We were as much heroes as anybody else, except Peter, and were so recognized; we were taken with Peter and the populace to Peter's mother's cottage, and there we ate bread and cheese, and drank milk and beer with everybody, and had a most sociable good time; and when we left we had a handshake all around, and were receiving and shouting back LEB' WOHL's until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and kindly new friends forever.

The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se. This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents, but from different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly or perfectly fertile.

He obviously cites from some second-hand contemporary accounts of the transactions there this statement, that 'about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> persons were killed,' because, as it happens, we have a full precise and official Report of the killing of all these persons, with their names and details of the massacre, drawn up on September 8, 1792, by the municipal authorities of Reims and signed by all the members of the Council General.

He was the American product of the \"canny\" Scotchman, a Scotch American. Along one side of the public room ran the rude bar counter with a...", "...and so it happened. Hence the first man got his other name _Kumu-uli_, which means a fallen chief, _he 'lii kahuli_.... With the Hawaiians, Kanaloa is the personified spirit of evil, the origin of death, the prince of Po, or chaos, and yet a revolted, disobedient spirit, who was conquered and punished by Kane. The introduction and worship of Kanaloa, as one of the great gods in the Hawaiian group, can be traced back only to the time of the immigration from the southern groups, some <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred years ago. In the more ancient chants he is never mentioned in conjunction with Kane, Ku, and Lono, and even in later Hawaiian mythology he never took precedence of Kane. The Hawaiian legend states that the oldest son of Kumuhonua, the first man, was called Laka, and that the next was called Ahu, and that Laka was a bad man; he killed his brother Ahu. \"There are these different Hawaiian genealogies, going back with more or less agreement among themselves to the first...", "...you,\" answered several of the college youths.

But, with the deck cleared of passengers, the crew had a better chance to fight the flames. \"Captain, what can we do?\" demanded Dick, as he climbed on deck, followed by Stanley and by Allen Charter, who owned the second launch. \"I don't know,\" answered the master of the vessel, almost helplessly. \"That oil burns like fury.\"...", "...Penitentiary; which I briefly notice because I may offer a few general remarks in another place, on the important subject of prison discipline. The Refuge is an asylum for juvenile delinquents, founded on the just and benevolent principle that offences against society, committed by very young persons, should be disciplined by training and education, rather than by punishment. In this establishment there are from eighty to ninety boys, and from forty to fifty girls, of ages varying from <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> to twenty-one years. The former are employed in various light handicraft trades, and the latter in domestic services, and both spend a portion of their time in school. They remain from six months to four years.

Fifteen cents, the sum laid on Jamaica spirits, is about one-third part of its value: now <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> cents on molasses is considerably more: the former is an article of luxury, therefore that duty may not be improper; but the latter cannot be said to partake of that quality in the substance, and when manufactured into rum is no more a luxury than Jamaica spirits._\" The Senate in the First Congress sat with closed doors, and was thus more open than the House to the influence of interested petitions which soon began to pour in upon it, asking for amendments to the House bill in...", "...continued for the next two years, and Dawson city grew up with mushroom haste as the metropolis of this Arctic region. Gold discoveries in both Canadian and American territory brought to a crisis the long-pending dispute over the international boundary in the far North-west. In 1898 a joint High Commission was created, whose duties were to settle a number of questions which had long caused friction between Canada and the United States. The sessions of this Commission extended over <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> months without accomplishing anything. No formal ending was made to the work of the Commission, but it never re-assembled after its adjournment in February, 1899. It was not until 1903 that an agreement was reached between Great Britain and the United States concerning the Alaskan boundary line. In that year a treaty was concluded by which this long-disputed question was relegated to a Commission of six jurists, three British and three American, who by a majority vote were...", "...at the end of the twelfth century. They had the liberty of being ransomed, but only distinguished captives could be saved in that way from being sold. The price ranged from one to three marks. It is difficult to tell from this how valuable a man was considered, for the relation of the mark to other merchandise, or, in other words, the value of the currency, cannot be represented by modern sums, which are only technically equivalent,--as a mark, for instance, was then held equal to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> ounces of silver.[7] That was not exorbitant, however, for those times, and shows that men were frequently exposed for sale. The merchants of Bristol used to sell a great many captives into Ireland; but it is recorded that the Irish were the first Christian people who agreed at length to put a stop to this traffic by refusing to have any more captives brought into their country. The Church had long before forbidden it; and there are no grounds for supposing that any other motive...", "...rise before the boat could be headed in the right direction. But then the average Indian is much more observant than the average white man. If a beaver is caught in a steel trap, he will do his utmost to plunge into water and remain there even though he should drown, yet his house may not be in that river or pond; but if he is wounded, he will either try to reach his house or take to the woods. When in pursuit of beavers it is advisable to watch for them on moonlight nights about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or nine o'clock, and it is best to be in a canoe, as then there is less danger of the beaver sinking before he can be removed from the water. The hunter, while waiting for a shot, makes a noise with the handle of his knife against a stick in imitation of a beaver cutting wood--a sound somewhat similar to that of the boring of a large auger. It is astonishing how far, on a still night, beavers will hear such a sound and come to help their friends at work.

The danger to be feared was not so much from the invaders' shooting as from the possibility of their carrying out their threat to fire the house.

Fortunately we could at least prevent their surrounding the house; for by closing and...", "...and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 7:4 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:5 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 7:6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 7:7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 7:8 And four wagons and <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 7:9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. 7:10 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar. 7:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer...", "...of the matter rests with England. If this country does not lead the way, if she hesitates to enforce it in the face of the competition of American, Asiatic, and soon, perhaps, of African labour, the experiment of a general eight hours day for the rest of Western Europe is not to be thought of. But in England it is precisely the aristocratic portion of the labouring classes--the \"old trades' unionists,\" the skilled labour--that has not not yet been won over to the side of the legal <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hours day, and it is doubtful whether it will yield to the leaders of unskilled labour: Burns, Tillett, and the rest. At the September Congress at Liverpool, in 1890, the Trade Unionist party brought forward in opposition to the general legal eight hours day, the eight hours optional day fixed by contract, in the motion of Patterson, if I have rightly understood the proposal. The motion was defeated by a majority of only eight (181 to 173).[12] If the legal eight hours day is...", "...occasionally heard to mutter, when my presence gave her additional trouble, something about beggar's brats and foundlings.

About the same time another dispute arose about the cornage, commonly called noutgeld, and serjeant oats or bailiff corn throughout the barony of Westmorland. In 1634 it was decreed that these duties were due to the Earl of Cumberland, and were to be paid according to the following agreement: the cornage was to be paid in money, and Sir John Lowther, escheator-general for the North, regulated the measure of oats. Instead of the old pecks containing <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> and ten quarts being up-heaped, they were to pay thirteen quarts straked measure.[10] There is a list also of pout-hens collected by the land serjeant.

On the 16th of July, Corrao again passed the same spot, and he found that a small island had been formed, twelve feet high, with a crater in the centre, from which immense columns of vapour and masses of volcanic matter were ejected. The island was afterwards visited by several scientific gentlemen, and is said to have been two hundred feet high, and three miles in circumference, on the 4th of August.

To make quite sure at last, he took with them a pocket full of apples, one of which was eaten in each field, and so they came to know for certain that the number of meadows was either eight or nine, I forget which; and so you see this great experiment did not fix the faith of mankind.

In color, specimens from the northern part of the valley of the Rio Tepalcatepec (10 mi. S, 1 mi. W Apatzingan) in Michoacan resemble paratypes of _allex_. Intergradation probably occurs to the north with _analogous_. In the eight specimens from 13 mi. E and 1 mi.

The median part of the belly of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> specimens is buff-colored rather than whitish-gray as in typical _allex_; the mid-dorsal region also averages darker than in any other specimens referred to _allex_. Additional specimens are needed from this and closely adjacent areas, especially to the west on the coastal plain, in order to determine more accurately the taxonomic status of the mice there. At present, it seems best to refer them to _allex_. Possibly the population represented by the eight specimens is an...", "...said Allan, vaguely but hopefully. \"Maybe,\" answered Pete, thoughtfully. \"Meanwhile----\" \"Meanwhile I've got to find some way of making a little money; enough to pay my board, at any rate.

What's the sense in your paying as much as I do, who eat twice as much? That's plumb foolish!

The change in the character of the river separated us finally from our flotilla. From Nimule to Gondokoro we must again proceed by land, and the swift and easy progress of the last few days must be exchanged for the steady grind of marches. It was this stage which had always been painted to me as the most dangerous and unhealthy in our whole journey, and I had pictured to myself <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days of toil through swamp and forest amid miasma and mosquitoes. These anticipations were not sustained. Of the disadvantages of the track along the river bank I cannot speak; but the upper road over the hills is certainly excellent and healthy, and runs throughout over firm dry undulations of a bright, breezy, scrub-covered country. At Nimule we touched the telegraph wire again, and from the Reuter's accumulations which I studied, I learned that Parliament would not meet...", "...the infidels were defeated; but amid the disorder of his troops Saladin remained on the plain without lowering his standard or suspending the sound of his brazen kettle-drums; he rallied his forces, retired upon Ramleh, and prepared to defend the mountain passes leading to Jerusalem.

On Monday, September 9th, the christian forces moved on in battle array to Jaffa, the ancient Joppa, about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> miles from Arsoof. The Templars brought up the rear of the army; and after marching about five miles, they reached the banks of the Nahr el Arsoof, or river of Arsoof, which empties itself into the sea, about three miles from Jaffa, and pitched their tents in a beautiful olive grove on the sea-shore.

Demetrius, however, opposing to these sixty ten of his galleys, which were a sufficient number to block up the narrow entrance of the harbor, and drawing out his land forces along all the headlands running out into the sea, went into action with a hundred and eighty galleys, and, attacking with the utmost boldness and impetuosity, utterly routed Ptolemy, who fled with <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> ships, the sole remnant of his fleet, seventy having been taken with all their men, and the rest destroyed in the battle; while the whole multitude of attendants, friends, and women, that had followed in the ships of burden, all the arms, treasure, and military engines fell, without exception, into the hands of Demetrius, and were by him collected and brought into the camp.

Benedict XIII reopened the question later, and ruled upon each article of de Tournon's decision, and a Brief was issued to that effect in 1734. Into this question the Jansenists of France injected themselves so vigorously that even the bibliography for and against the Rites is bewildering in its extent. One contribution consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> volumes in French and seven in Italian. In his history of Jansenism in \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" Dr. Forget of the University of Louvain says: \"The sectaries [in the middle of the eighteenth century] began to detach themselves from the primitive heresy, but they retained unabated the spirit of insubordination and schism, the spirit of opposition to Rome, and above all a mortal hatred of the Jesuits. They had vowed the ruin of that order, which they always found blocking their...", "...again to-morrow.\" Nathalie got the old woman's tea herself, and made the toast with her own white hands. Mrs. Leroy wished her to share the meal, but Nathalie could not eat there; the steaming and fetid atmosphere of that close chamber made her sick and faint.

She removed the tea-tray, and turned to leave the room. \"I am going out for a walk in the grounds,\" she said, \"but I will be back by <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> to give you the sleeping draught; and, for fear you might be taken ill again in the night, I will ask one of the Nettlebys to sleep here.\" Without hat or mantle, she ran down-stairs and out into the hot twilight.

A TIME of great excitement amongst the Natives now prevailed. War, war, nothing but war was spoken of! Preparations for war were being made in all the villages far and near. Fear sat on every face, and armed bands kept watching each other, as if uncertain where the war was to begin or by whom.

From the time when he set out for France in his fifteenth year, with the exception of a short sojourn in Willoughby seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years after, he lived by his wits and by the strong hand. His purse was now and then replenished by a lucky windfall, which enabled him to extend his travels and seek more adventures.

The boy did not wish to sleep, nor could he have slept had he wished. But he saw that Carossa soon slumbered, and the sentinels by the doorway seemed, at least, to doze. He turned slightly on his side, and looked at Obed who lay about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet away. He could not see the man's face, but his body did not stir. Perhaps Obed also slept. A wind was now rising and it made strange sounds among the vast ruins. It was a moan, a shriek and a hoarse sigh. Perhaps the peons were not so far wrong! The ghosts did come back to their old abodes. Ned was glad that he was not alone. Even without Obed the company of brigands would have been a help. He lay still a long time.

His friends also read other letters to him, of more cheering character. Thus the conversation was turned into a different channel, he thought of several friends and acquaintances, and even uttered a few words in jest. His friends conversed with him until about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock, and entertained the best hopes in regard to his condition. Before retiring to rest, he ate a few preserved cherries, and drank a little wine, to strengthen himself for sleep. It was his last night, for the _19th of April_ was the day of his death. His sleep was very much disturbed. At two o'clock at night, he rose in the bed, and said to the physician who was present, that he had slept very little.

It must be remembered however that each is writing from a different point of view. Luke is a historian recording only the most salient facts and passing over the mention of many events. We see this in the compression in <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> and a half short chapters of the events of the three missionary journeys. Paul writing to the Galatians is anxious to establish the fact that he received his commission, as an apostle, not from man, but from Christ himself (Gal. 1:1); hence he enters more into details and we get from him the inside view.

After the husband's death the widow eats only every second day for a month; after that she is free to eat, but for a year she weeps twice a day, morning and evening,--though sometimes she forgets. The father, mother, and sister of the deceased also take part in the one-year period of wailing twice a day. After that period has elapsed the widow may remarry.

Neither Macpherson nor his friends anticipated the tremendous sensation these fragments were destined to make, not only in Scotland and England, but on the whole continent of Europe. But Macpherson was not the man to underestimate the position which he had suddenly attained, and accordingly, emboldened by his initial success, he published in 1761 _Fingal_, an epic poem in six books, and in 1763 _Temora_[17] in <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> books. With the dispute over the authenticity of the poems we are not here concerned. The researches of modern Celtic scholars have cast much light upon the long-disputed question. They have accorded Macpherson the place that in justice belongs to him, the place of a 'skillful artificer,'[18] who took a few crude scattered fragments of Irish--not distinctively Scotch--folk-songs as his foundation, and not only lengthened them into more elaborate and refined poems, but built up...", "...number of things which do not concern his passions.

When what is termed the Westmoreland Revival of domestic industries was begun <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten years ago, the greatest difficulty was found in obtaining a hand-loom. No one knew how to set it up, and it was a long time before a weaver could be found to run it and teach others its use.

Of all the plays, seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> in number, that he wrote between 1889 and 1894, only two were actually seen upon the stage. The first of these was a dramatic version of The American, produced by Edward Compton (who played the principal part) at Southport in January 1891. The piece had a fairly successful provincial life, but it failed to make good its hold upon London, where it was given for the first time on September 26, 1891, at the Opera Comique, by the same company. It ran for about two months, after which...", "...The only one who would listen to no accommodation was Mackenzie of Pluscardine.

Towns were largely self-sufficient, but salt and iron came from a distance. The King's established in every shire at least one town with a market place where purchases would be witnessed, and a mint where reliable money was coined by a moneyer, who put his name on his coins. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> moneyers in London. Coins were issued to be of value for only a couple of years. Then one had to exchange them for newly issued ones at a rate of about 10 old for 8 or 9 new. The difference constituted a tax. Roughly 10% of the people lived in towns. Some took surnames such as Tanner, Weaver, or Carpenter. Some had affectionate or derisive nicknames such as clear-hand, fresh friend, soft bread, foul beard, money taker, or penny purse. Craftsmen in the 1000s included goldsmiths,...", "...managed to keep his young men in check.

There were no specimens of sedimentary rocks which, by possibly containing fossils, might have contributed to the determination of the age of these mountains.

The distance from Mount Betty to Scott's Nunatak is between seven and <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> degrees of latitude. I have examined the specimens microscopically. From Mount Betty there are several specimens of white granite, with dark and light mica; it has a great resemblance to the white granites from Sogn, the Dovre district, and Nordland, in Norway.

It was something infernally splendid. The abominations of the banquets of Belshazzar and Cleopatra were re-enacted there. Good God, what age are we living in?

Until the time of the Dissolution the corporate body of the hospital, and the staff for attendance upon the patients, were identical, and consisted of a master, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> brethren, and four sisters, all living in obedience to the Augustinian rule. Unfortunately no record is preserved of the grant of the site, or of the deed of endowment; but a Charter granted by Henry I in 1133 is extant, conferring certain privileges on the church, prior, canons, and poor of the hospital.

This, of course, increased the difficulty of Miss Miner's task but her faith was abiding and her courage unabated. Miss Miner realized fully that the lot of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> thousand free people of color of the District of Columbia was but little better than that of the 3,000 slaves, for the former, though free according to the letter of the law, in actual life had no rights that a white man was compelled to respect.

Although Lord John was sixty, and burdened with the cares of State, if not with the cares of office, he cheerfully accepted the task. Though it must be admitted that he performed some parts of it in rather a perfunctory manner, the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> volumes which appeared between 1853 and 1856 of the 'Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore' represent a severe tax upon friendship, as well as no ordinary labour on the part of a man who was always more or less immersed in public affairs.

Ghumbeer Singh's orders were always implicitly obeyed, so I am afraid that the sentence was carried into effect. The army consisted of about 5000 men at the outside, in <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> regiments of infantry and an artillery corps.

All Potsdam was in the streets; the Soldiers, of their own accord, formed rank, and followed the hearse; many a rugged face unable to restrain tears: for the rest, universal silence as of midnight, nothing audible among the people but here and there a sob, and the murmur, 'ACH, DER GUTE KONIG!' \"All next day, the Body lay in state in the Palace; thousands crowding, from Berlin and the other environs, to see that...", "...dry in touch, but the atmosphere (as in a fine summer sunset) rich with colour and with perfume.

Between them lay, however, an extremely difficult country with a narrow defile, and Braddock determined to ford the Monongahela, and then cross it again lower down. The garrison of Fort Duquesne consisted of a few companies of regular troops, some hundreds of Canadians, and 800 Indian warriors. They were kept informed, by the scouts, of the progress of the English, and, when the latter approached the Monongahela, a party under Captain Beaujeu set out...", "...Many of the streets are \"concrete,\" and a run over them is sure to be attended with boundless pleasure, and often a race.

Six or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pieces are coiled upon the feed-roller, and they are neither pasted nor stitched together, but the ends are merely overlapped half a yard or so. The workman is careful not to enter the second piece till one third or one half of the first one has passed through on the other side, to prevent his being engrossed with two ends at a time. He must, no doubt, go sometimes to the one side and sometimes to the other of the machine to see that no folds or creases occur, and to be ready for...", "...we had a larum that the Regulars were gone to Concord.

At that time Ireland was filled with storm and anger, with revolt against English rule, with strife among the Irish nobles themselves. Spain also was eagerly looking to Ireland as a point from which to strike at England. War, misery, poverty were abroad in all the land. Yet amid the horrid sights and sounds of battle Spenser found time to write. After <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years spent in the north of Ireland, Spenser was given a post which took him south. His new home was the old castle of Kilcolman in Cork. It was surrounded by fair wooded country, but to Spenser it seemed a desert. He had gone to Ireland as to exile, hoping that it was merely a stepping-stone to some great appointment in England, whither he longed to return. Now after eight years he found himself still in exile. He had no love for Ireland, and felt himself lonely and...", "...in search of the expected ship. A large bark, which very much resembled her, was, to my dismay, riding at anchor within the breakwater, her sails furled, and everything made snug for the night.

This date being established, we will conduct the reader to Bicetre. This immense establishment, founded for the treatment of the insane, serves also as a place of refuge for seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred poor old men, who are admitted when they have reached the age of seventy, or are afflicted with any very serious infirmity. On arriving at Bicetre, the visitor enters at first a vast court planted with large trees, and divided into grass plots, ornamented in summer with flower borders. Nothing could be more cheerful, more peaceful, or more salubrious than this promenade, which was specially designed for the indigent old men of whom we have spoken. It surrounds the...", "...gold brocade lined with crimson satin, behind whom were six tambourine players and a couple of running footmen.

Crassus undertook to satisfy the most importunate and unrelenting of the creditors, and having become security for Caesar to the amount of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred and thirty talents, thus enabled him to set out for his province. There is a story that as Caesar was crossing the Alps, he passed by a small barbarian town which had very few inhabitants and was a miserable place, on which his companions jocosely observed, \"They did not suppose there were any contests for honors in such a place as that, and struggles for the first rank and mutual jealousy of the chief persons:\" on which Caesar earnestly remarked, \"I would rather be the...", "...her presence.

He said that whenever a man goes blind, or deaf, or is afflicted in any other way, he is sent to a hospital for treatment, and that this prison is a sort of hospital, and that some of us are so blind that we cannot tell the difference between our own and other peoples' horses.

I wanted to see, and if possible speak in secret with the girl who bore such a striking resemblance to the dead Gabrielle Engledue.

As it was, he had no choice but to use another way. He threw himself full on the point of the scintillating vibroblade. A vibroblade is a nasty weapon. Originally designed as a surgeon's tool, its special steel blade moves in and out of the heavy hilt at speeds from two hundred to two thousand vibrations per second, depending on the size and the use to which it is to be put. Make it <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> inches long, add serrated, diamond-pointed teeth, and you have the man-killing vibroblade. Its danger is in its power; that shivering blade can cut through flesh, cartilage, and bone with almost no effort. It's a knife with power steering. But that kind of power can be a weakness as well as a strength. The little gadget that Mike the Angel carried did more than just detect the nearby operation of a vibroblade. It was also a defense. The gadget focused a high-density magnetic...", "...the morning.

The truth is that silver in 1873, and during a generation before that date, was worth more to its owner in the form of bullion than in the form of coin. In 1872 the silver requisite to coin a dollar at the established ratio was worth $1.02. For years, therefore, nobody thought of bringing his silver to the mint for coinage; he sold it in the commercial markets. The total silver-dollar coinage of the United States, between 1789 and 1873, was barely <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> million dollars, and when, in 1873, the law provided that except for the so-called trade dollar coined for export, \"no deposit of silver for other coinage shall be received,\" no one had interest enough in the matter to offer criticism.

This is how this system arrived at an agreement between the solar and the lunar periods: 8 solar years containing 2922 days, while 8 lunar years only contain 2832 days, there was a difference of 90 days, for which Cleostratus compensated by intercalating 3 months of 30 days each, which were placed after the third, fifth and eighth year of the cycle. Hence these years had an extra month each.

The number of squares in each line of a checkered field or ordinary is also another important matter. Six or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> form the usual basis for the division of a field, but the seven on the seal of the earl of Warenne and Surrey attached to the Barons' Letter of 1300-1 is not without its artistic advantages.

Emboldened by his discovery, the gold-hunter crept nearer and nearer, and then could see that the men were all masked. This struck him as being a very remarkable circumstance, indeed, since they were clad like miners, some of them wearing beards that came below their masks. All were armed thoroughly.

We found the camp we had appropriated was a favorite stopping-place of the carmen who hauled in supplies for the gang of two hundred road-builders. One rainy day near nightfall no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> carts drew up at the old stable, and the rain-soaked drivers, after picketing and feeding their horses, came down to our fire. We were away, and Joe met us on our return with the unwelcome news. We kept open house so far as the fire was concerned; but our roof was a narrow one at the best, and one or two leaky spots made it still narrower. \"We shall probably sleep out-of-doors to-night,\" said my companion, \"unless we are a match for this posse of rough teamsters.\" But the...", "...blinked away several large bright tears; and while he was blinking them the telephone bell rang.

At three o'clock, they changed ramrods,--the old doppel-gangers going away, and two new ones fulfilling their functions. CHAPTER X. AFTER THE VICTORY. The two ramrods were still pacing to and fro, when I aroused in the gray of the morning; but they looked very misty and moist, as if they were impalpables that were shortly to evaporate. The Major poked his head between the flaps at <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock, and said that breakfast was ready; but the ramrod nearest me kept vigilantly alongside, and I thought he had been invited also. The other ramrod guarded the empty tent, and I think that he believed me a doppel-ganger likewise. I wondered what was to be done with me, as the hours slipped rapidly by. The guards were relieved again at ten o'clock, and Quartermaster's men commenced to take down the tents.

To Ellsworth is to be credited largely the authorship of the great Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, the essential features of which still remain after 130 years in full force and effect. This famous measure created a chief justiceship and five associate justiceships for the Supreme Court; fifteen District Courts, one for each State of the Union and for each of the...", "...these are the alternatives. Naturally enough, my young friends were somewhat startled at my determination to call upon so great a man; a letter, they fancied, would be a better mode of application. I, however, who did not adopt the doctrine that no man is a hero to his valet, was of opinion that very few men indeed are heroes to themselves. The cloud of external pomp, which invests them to the eyes of the _attoniti_ cannot exist to their own; they do not, like Kehama, entering the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> gates of Padalon at once, meet and contemplate their own grandeurs; but, more or less, are conscious of acting a part. I did not, therefore, feel the tremor which was expected of a novice, on being ushered into so solemn a presence. II. OXFORD.

For from the beginning of his ministry to his death, he reckoned the day ill spent if he stayed not seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hours in prayer; and this the boy did not forget even to old age. An old man of the name of Ewart in Selkirk, who remembered Mr. Welch's being in that place said, He was a type of Christ; an expression more significant than proper, for his meaning was, That he was an example that imitated Christ, as indeed in many things he did: He also said, That his custom was to preach publicly once every day, and to spend his whole time in spiritual exercises, that some in that place waited...", "...points draw lightly, the lines for the stripes, covering the _whole_ flag. 3.

CHAPTER NINTH When the commissioner awoke one morning <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days later after a night of perfect rest, his first clear thought was that he must leave the skerry, go anywhere to be alone, collect himself, find himself again. The preacher's arrival had the desired effect in one way, namely to \"scare the mob,\" so that the tumult and rudeness ceased; but on the other hand the commissioner had not been able to enjoy the newly gained peace, for the exalted condition of his betrothed obliged him to keep her always in his sight. So he had...", "...with 'em. Smiley's a man to take his own way pretty much, too.\" \"I wish you had warned him,\" sighed Mrs. Smiley, and turned wearily away.

Bartholomew with <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> of the other Spaniards was wounded, and one was killed; and it was at this point that Tristan's boat arrived at the settlement. Having seen the fight safely over, he went on up the river to get water, although he was warned that it was not safe; and sure enough, at a point a little farther up the river, beyond some low green arm of the shore, he met with a sudden and bloody death.

He gets on wonderfully in all branches of his education, and the extent of his reading, and of the knowledge he has derived from it, are truly astonishing in a boy not yet <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years old. He is at the same time as playful as a kitten. To give you some idea of the activity of his mind I will mention a few circumstances that may interest you and Colin. You will believe that to him we never appear to regard anything he does as anything more than a schoolboy's amusement.

The fires were fiercely glaring from a long row of furnaces, and over them were <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> huge boilers! This was unutterable pomp. The mighty engines--but enough of this.

It usually consisted of forty members, eight bishops, eight peers, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> county members, eight borough members, and eight officers of state. The manner in which they were chosen was as anomalous as their powers. First the bishops chose eight peers. Then those peers chose eight bishops; and those sixteen chose the county and borough members. Eight officers of state, nominated by the King or his Commissioner, were added, and the Committee on Articles was complete.

The decreases from 1840 to 1850, 13.2 per cent, and from 1850 to 1860, 7.5 per cent, were probably due to the unfavorable sentiment against the Negroes which arose during the abolition agitation of these periods and which had its effect on the Negro's movements to and from the city.

When the Spanish officer came out to receive them, Dabao struck him on the head with his sword, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> men, immediately releasing themselves, unexpectedly attacked the people in the fort. They made such carnage, that only one friar and five soldiers escaped, by throwing themselves from the wall, and retiring to the convent, where they fortified themselves. The Indians immediately forsook the town and fled to the mountains, when the friar, and the Spaniards who were in the convent, built a boat, and retired along the coast to another town, to which the insurrection had not...", "...A cant term for smuggled spirits.] CHAPTER VII _THE BOROUGH_ (1809-1812) The immediate success of _The Parish Register_ in 1807 encouraged Crabbe to proceed at once with a far longer poem, which had been some years in hand. _The Borough_ was begun at Rendham in Suffolk in 1801, continued at Muston after the return thither in 1805, and finally completed during a long visit to Aldeburgh in the autumn of 1809. That the Poem should have been \"in the making\" during at least <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years is quite what might be inferred from the finished work. It proved, on appearance, to be of portentous length--at least ten thousand lines. Its versification included every degree of finish of which Crabbe was capable, from his very best to his very worst. Parts of it were evidently written when the theme stirred and moved the writer: others, again, when he was merely bent on reproducing scenes that lived in his singularly retentive memory, with needless minuteness of...", "...cut in different parts of the place, and redeemed his promise to Amy, showing her the fruit germs, either green, or rather of a delicate gold-color, or else blackened by frost.

The right whale furnishes the bone (baleen) so much in common use, and called \"whalebone.\" This bone is taken from the mouth and upper jaw of the whale, and is set along laterally, in the most exact order, several inches apart, decreasing in length from the centre of his mouth, or the arch of his palate, and becoming shorter farther back, while towards the lips the bone tapers away into mere bristles, forming a loose hanging fringe or border.

They obtained samples by driving to within 460 meters of ground zero in a tank specially fitted with rockets to which retrievable collectors were fastened in order to gather soil samples from a distance. This group made several sampling excursions on 16 and 17 July. The tank carried two personnel (a driver and a passenger) each trip. No member of this party received a radiation exposure of more than 1 roentgen (1).

As we pass the desolate sand heaps near the disconsolate little old town of Wallula, we can recall the old Hudson's Bay fort, the Indian wars, the struggle for possession, the missions, the incoming immigrants, all the tragedy and striving which marked the century just closed. Below Wallula the Umatilla highlands throw a barrier <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred feet high athwart the course of the stream, and the bold escarpments of rock, palisades grander than those of the Hudson, attest the energy with which the River fulfilled his mission of cleaving the intercepting barrier in two.

We went to the house of the English vice-consul, whilst the long train of horses was preparing to start, but after a few minutes' stay there Gladstone became irrepressibly restless, and insisted on setting off to walk--I of course walked too. The old steward also went with us, and a guard of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> white-kilted palikari on foot. The rest of the party rode, and from a slight hill which we soon reached, it was very pretty to look back at the long procession starting from Sayada and proceeding along the narrow causeway running parallel to our path, the figures silhouetted against the sea.

At about 9.40 she grew bolder, and at 9.45 reached the street in front of M. Gibert's house. There she met him, but did not notice him, and walked into his house, where she rushed hurriedly from room to room on the ground floor. M. Gibert had to take her hand before she recognised him. She then grew...", "...Mrs. Bates. My little home and the piano were sold up, and I soon found eighteen shillings a week did not go far with four hungry children to clothe and feed, and rent beside. I tried to get back in my old profession, but I had been out of it too long, no one would look at me, and I could only get cooking and charing to do--very exhausting work when you haven't been brought up to it.

He asked about the Schuylers, and spoke most warmly of them--said Schuyler was one of the few perfectly intelligent men he had ever met, \"knew everything about everything,\" I must write it to them. The supper was very well arranged, small tables of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten. Almost all the Royalties were there, but not the Hawaiian Queen.

Arrived next at Bayreuth, at <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock in the evening; it is a town of considerable size, said to contain 10,000 inhabitants. On the diligence driving up to the inn door we found the space in front of it completely covered with a military band, and a large concourse of people listening to their music; this band belonged to a cavalry regiment that was on its march through the town. We next started for Nuremberg, where we arrived at half-past eight o'clock the following morning. September 4th. On our arrival...", "...invited to meet me, did not come.

So one of the Herrschaft, rashly coming to her assistance, assured her it would be impossible for her at least to forget the name of Pfalzen. Somebody had told her of a certain tailor of Pfalzen who, within memory of man, returning from a wedding at Percha, and having passed St. George on his homeward way at <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock of the evening, suddenly saw the road divide before him. This made him stop in astonishment, and before he could decide which way to take it had grown dark. Then he became sore afraid, especially when he espied a group of ladies dressed in white, who came up to him, and, addressing him in playful tones, encompassed and stopped him.

We will now bid farewell to winter, for with returning summer comes the open sea, and the vessels leave their wintry bed. This, however, is attended with much difficulty and danger. Canals have to be cut in the ice, through which to lead the ships to a less obstructed ocean; and, after this had been done in Sir James Ross's case, the ships were hemmed in by a pack of ice, fifty miles in circumference, and were carried along, utterly helpless, at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten miles daily, for upwards of 250 miles--the navigators fearing the adverse winds might drive them on the rocky coast of Baffin's Bay. At length the wind changed, and carried them clear of ice and icebergs (detached masses of ice, sometimes several hundred feet in height) to the open sea, and back to their native land.

At any rate, at the time of my coming aboard, the report was, that Captain Guy was resolved upon retrieving the past and filling the vessel with oil in the shortest space possible. With this intention, we were now shaping our course for Hytyhoo, a village on the island of St. Christina--one of the Marquesas, and so named by Mendanna--for the purpose of obtaining <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> seamen, who, some weeks before, had stepped ashore there from the Julia. It was supposed that, by this time, they must have recreated themselves sufficiently, and would be glad to return to their duty.

The middle room was destined for reading, prayer, and meditation; all its furniture consisted of a large chair with a praying-desk and a back, from six to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet high, let into and fixed in the wall. The room to the right of this was the friar's bed-room; at the farther end of it was situated the alcove, very low, and paved above with flags like a tomb.

The uncomfortable feeling in the region of the left kidney never disappeared completely; it became especially painful when pressing upon that place, when riding on horseback or in a carriage, when taking exercise or turning the body. It seems to me that the whole pelvis of the kidneys must have been full of gravel and calculi. I now took 1/2 grain at intervals of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days; the result was that I passed gravel and small calculi at every micturition. On the 30th of November my condition got worse, and I continued to take 1/2 grain of _Calc. ren. praep._, at longer or shorter intervals, until October 18th, 1840. After this period I ceased to pass any gravel, and I felt entirely well. On the 3d of February I passed some more gravel. Another dose of 1/2 grain of _Lapis renalis_; another dose on June 3d.

A predecessor of mine at Dalnawillan assured me that many were got up to 3lb. and 4lb.; it is marvellous the falsehoods men will commit themselves to as to size of fish--men perfectly reliable in other ways. The gillies talked a good deal about a loch in Sutherland, not far off our march, where the fish were nearly as large and good, and very free to rise. That sounded very nice, and needed to be experimented, and my son Douglas...", "...a tough wallet which opens a breach of its own accord, long after the mother has ceased to exist.

He was not tired, but very nervous, and after he had disposed of his letter, he set off for a stroll along the river front, and walked for two miles up the quiet road on the east side, listening to the lap of the water, and pausing to watch the superb effect of the moonlight on the bright ripples and on the wooded heights of Long Island.

In both, the antennae are simple. The remaining cephalic organs are too little shown by the specimen from the Middle Cambrian to allow detailed comparison. The mandibles, maxillulae, and maxillae of _Nebalia_ are, however, of types which could be derived from the trilobite. In three of the genera of the Nebaliidae, the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pairs of thoracic limbs are all similar to one another, though those of the genera differ. All are biramous. The limbs of _Hymcnocaris_ can apparently be most closely correlated with those of _Nebalia antarctica_, in which the endopodite consists of short flattened segments, and the exopodite is a long setiferous plate. Epipodites are present in both _Nebalia_ and _Hymcnocaris_.

For a long time his election was in doubt. Of the one hundred and twenty-eight assemblymen, one hundred and four belonged to the Jackson party, and of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> senators elected Tracy alone represented the opposition. It was certainly not an encouraging outlook, and the leaders, after full consultation, virtually declared the anti-masonic party dissolved.

Along the high-road to the left six guns of Winder's division were soon afterwards deployed, reinforced by four of Hill's.

The Britannica, Edinburgh, Metropolitana, English, Penny, London, Oxford, and that of Kees, are most elaborate works, extending respectively to about a score of heavy volumes, averaging <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or nine hundred pages each. Such publications must necessarily be expensive. They are, moreover, to be regarded rather as a collection of exhaustive treatises,--great prominence being given to the physical and mathematical sciences, and to general history.

His inexhaustible improvisations, which almost made up the whole of the evening's entertainment, were particularly admired by the audience, which knew as well as a gathering of artists how to appreciate the composer's merits.

And in the Gazette musicale of March 25, 1838, there is a report by M. Legouve of Chopin's appearance at a concert given by his countryman Orlowski at Rouen, where the latter had settled after some years stay in Paris.

Another objection was that, even when the tunnel should be made to that point, the exit of any escaping party must be made through an arched wagon-way...", "...some would breed one large squab and the other very thin; and some would breed nice twelve-pound squabs, but we could not get a proportionately high price for them to warrant the extra food required and extra time required for them to mature.

These birds breed squabs the marketable size: eight, nine and ten pounds to the dozen. Less than 15 per cent. ran under <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> pounds to the dozen last year. They breed plump, broad-breasted squabs and do not eat more than the average homer.

Thynne's edition of 1532. He calls it 'A goodly balade of Chaucer'; but it is manifestly Lydgate's. Moreover, it is really a triple Balade, with an Envoy, on the model of Chaucer's Fortune and Compleynt of Venus; only it has seven-line stanzas instead of stanzas of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> lines. An inspection of Thynne's volume shews that it was inserted to fill a gap, viz. a blank page at the back of the concluding lines of The Legend of Good Women, so that the translation of Boethius might commence on a new leaf. It is obvious that the third stanza of the second Balade was missing in Thynne's MS. He did not leave it out for lack of space; for there is plenty of room on his page.

Then calling out some Highlanders in his service, he desired them to go before the soldiers and do their best, according to their own mode of warfare, to clear the ground of such lurking parties, so that the troops might advance in safety.

It is very desirable that all children up to the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> who are learning an instrument should do so in a _class_ for the first year, rather than in individual lessons. Much of the fundamental work at an instrument can become wearisome to a young child unless taken in company with others of the same age.

Twenty days later he landed in Liverpool. His arrival was opportune, for all England was watching the closing scene in the drama of West India Emancipation. He was an eye-witness of the crowning triumph of the English Abolitionists, viz., the breaking by Act of Parliament of the fetters of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred thousand slaves. He was in time to greet his great spiritual kinsman, William Wilberforce, and to undeceive him in respect of the Colonization Society, before death claimed his body, and to follow him to his last resting-place by the side of Pitt and Fox, in Westminster Abbey. A highly interesting incident of this visit is best told in Mr. Garrison's own words. He said: \"On arriving in London I received a polite invitation by letter from Mr. Buxton to take breakfast...", "...her horse. Patches of vivid green moss crept confidingly to the foot of the oaks, and a bit of arbutus, as pink as the palm of a baby's hand, peered from under its leathery cover.

Leaning over the right side of the horse she dexterously pulled apart the top rails where they crossed, and Johnny cleverly stepped back in time to avoid their hitting his legs in their fall.

An order from the captain, who came up from his cabin just then and caught me mooning, to go forward and \"make it <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> bells,\" stopped my reflections at this interesting point; and the next moment I was more interested in a most appetising odour of lobscouse emanating from Ching Wang's galley than in poetical dreams of Atlantic isles and ocean wonders!

Out of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> volumes published by this poet, five are fully-wrought plays, and one is a tragic love-story told in duologue. That, of course, is a larger proportion of actual drama than most of these poets give; but if an analysis were made, it would probably be found that the dramatic impulse is strong in the work of nearly all of them. There are very few of those who are making genuine poetry, who are content simply to sing. Indeed, it hardly seems to be a matter of choice, but an...", "...would have sacrificed him to their vengeance. The chief had also dismounted.

In like manner Pope Adrian commissioned Henry II. to enlarge the bounds of the church, and plant the faith in Ireland, when it had already been evangelized for <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred years.

His father, Captain Richard Derby, born in 1712, had dispatched his small vessels to the West Indies and Virginia and with the returns from these voyages he had loaded assorted cargoes for Spain and Madeira and had the proceeds remitted in bills of exchange to London or in wine, salt, fruit, oil, lead, and handkerchiefs to America.

To a vivid imagination it might have suggested a body and a head. \"It's worth investigating, anyway,\" decided the major; \"we'll look at the face of the cliff directly beneath it. Maybe there is an opening there.\" But this decision was more easily arrived at than carried out. Thorny brush and thick, tall weeds shrouded the base of the cliff for a height of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten feet. But the Boy Scouts had their field axes with them, and before long the blows of the steel were resounding. In a few minutes they had cleared away a lot of the brush directly beneath the two poised stones.

Now Tasso's is a religious subject, and in my opinion, a most happy one; but I am confidently of opinion that the _movement_ of Tasso's poem rarely corresponds with the essential character of the subject; nor do I think it possible that written in _stanzas_ it should. The celestial movement cannot, I think, be kept up, if the sense is to be broken in that despotic manner at the close of every <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> lines.

Their average voyages may be taken at sixteen days each, with six or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> to stop at Halifax, which would bring the full voyage to forty days.

An original little play similar to one which the kindergarten children could work out is given below. This play is based on the _pourquois_ tale, _Why the Evergreen Trees Never Lose Their Leaves_.[4] It affords much play of originality because familiar trees may be used; and the talk of the Trees to the Bird may have some relation to the characteristics of the Trees. It could be used by children of six, seven, or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years of age. It could serve as a Christmas play because of its spirit of kindness. North Wind might wear a wig and the Frost King wear a crown and carry a wand. Little Bird could have wings, one of which is broken, or simply carry one arm sleeveless.

But although the fox is generally so clever he sometimes does the most stupid things possible. Charles Waterton tells us of a fox which visited a poultry-yard and carried off <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> young turkeys. He could not eat them all, of course, so he buried five in the ground, meaning no doubt, to come and fetch them away on the following evening. But apparently he thought that if he buried them entirely he might not be able to find them again. So he carefully left one wing of each bird sticking up above the surface to serve as a guide, and never seemed to reflect that others would be able to see it as well as himself! So the farmer recovered his turkeys, and when...", "...the eyes of the public. He succeeds eventually, but not until he has encountered every sort of contemptible opposition and hypocritical evasion of the plain truth. The social satire of the piece is subtle and sharp; what the author really aims at is to illustrate, by a specific example, the repressive forces that dominate the life of a small people, and make it almost impossible for any sort of truth to triumph over prejudice. Since the production of \"A Glove,\" twenty years ago, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> more plays have come from Bjoernson's prolific pen. Of these by far the most important are the two that are linked by the common title, \"Beyond the Strength.\" The translation of this title is hopelessly inadequate, because the original word means much more than strength; it means talent, faculty, capability, the sum total of a man's endowment for some particular purpose.

Another conservatism of the colonial clock-makers was the sharp division which they made between the use of wood and brass in the manufacture of the movements. The one-day clocks were made of wood throughout, and this prevented their use on water or even their exportation, because the works would swell in the dampness and render the clock useless. The eight-day clocks were made of brass, but the extra cost of the movements sufficient to make the clock run <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days excluded many people, who had to remain content with the one-day clock. It was not till 1837 that it occurred to any of these ingenious makers of timepieces to produce a one-day clock out of brass.

One, of such weight that it required <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> men to move it, was found standing upright, and a child's coffin had been violently dashed against the wall. A carefully drawn up report with accompanying drawings was sent home, but no explanation has ever been discovered. Scientific men were disposed to ascribe the disturbance to earthquakes, but the annals of the island report none during those years; there remains, however, the possibility that the examination of the vault was after all imperfect, and that the sea might have...", "...been stewed with proper care in a very gentle manner, and be taken up at \"the critical moment when it is just tender,\" you will obtain an excellent and savoury meal for eight people for fivepence; _i. e._ for only the cost of the glass of port wine.

He began to write at <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years when a little prose piece called \"The Council of the Stars,\" found its way into print, out in California. His next was in verse, written at ten years on \"The Oak.\" That was also published and copied. A \"Ballad\" followed \"A Scottish Battle Song,\" written in dialect, which was published also.

From the huge fruit of this Pandanus, a species of bread is prepared, very similar to apple-marmalade, which is eaten by the natives along with the soft white kernel of the ripe cocoa-nut. The leaves are prepared as mats of every sort and description, and are occasionally used for the manufacture of sails. The Bread-fruit tree (_Podocarpus incisa_), which furnishes such excellent nutriment, that, according to Cook,[18] three trees suffice to support a man during <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> months, is found on the islands in single individuals, and we never happened to see its fruit used by the natives.

We found there <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten young fellows, sitting around, smoking tobacco, with the smoke of which the room was so full, that you could hardly see; and the whole house smelt so strong of it that when I was going up stairs I said, \"It certainly must be also a tavern.\"[425] We excused ourselves, that we could speak English only a little, but understood Dutch or French well, which they did not.

To be sure, we were mere animals, and, had this life lasted a year instead of a month, we should have been little better than the ropes in the ship. Not a razor, nor a brush, nor a drop of water, except the rain and the spray, had come near us all the time; for we were on an allowance of fresh water; and who would strip and wash himself in salt water on deck, in the snow and ice, with the thermometer at zero? After about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days of constant easterly gales, the wind hauled occasionally a little to the southward, and blew hard, which, as we were well to the southward, allowed us to brace in a little, and stand on under all the sail we could carry.

As has been said, he came on duty at <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> every morning punctually, but he would not allow himself to be intruded upon before that hour. Mr Stannard tells one story that furnishes striking evidence to this effect. Early in the morning the men were brought to a standstill in their work until Colonel Gordon arrived to decide some doubtful or disputed matter. It was noticed that his bedroom window was wide open, and the contractor's manager was induced to go up and knock at his door for instructions. Gordon opened his door...", "...with as much incivility as possible. \"Turn out, you lobsterbacks!\" one would say. \"Crowd them off the sidewalks!\" another would cry. \"A redcoat has no right in Boston streets!\" \"O, you rebel rascals!\" perhaps the soldiers would reply, glaring fiercely at the young men. \"Some day or other we'll make our way through Boston streets at the point of the bayonet!\" Once or twice such disputes as these brought on a scuffle; which passed off, however, without attracting much notice.

The Grisons, also, fought with no less glory. Witness the Malserhaide in Tyrol, where fifteen thousand men, under Austrian banners, behind strong intrenchments, were attacked by only <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> thousand Grisons.

Only by the use of vegetable food, particularly farinaceous, can a permanent cure be assured. The editor of the Clarion, Mr. R. Blatchford, or \"Nunquam,\" has lately adopted a vegetarian diet. He remarks with surprise, that although he has been a heavy smoker for more than 30 years, using not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> ounces of tobacco a week, often two ounces in a day, he has found his passion for tobacco nearly gone. He has had to get milder tobacco, and is now not smoking half-an-ounce a day.

There were no rails except those in use.

Canadian schooners had been seized on account of alleged violations of the revenue and embargo regulations of the United States. The resentment of the sufferers was aroused, and they only awaited a suitable opportunity to retaliate. The opportunity soon came, in the form of the declaration of war; and a body of Canadian volunteers attacked <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> American schooners, near the Thousand Isles, and burned two of them.

The sky was charged with large and heavy clouds; and a broad, deep, and as it were stormy, tint of dark purple ... mantled every mountain which we saw--with the exception of our old gigantic friend, of...", "...faith in any strict mathematical sequence. The same brood forming the string of cocoons in a bramble-stem contains both males and females; and the two sexes are divided in the series indiscriminately. Now it is the rule among the Bees for the males to issue from the cocoon a little earlier than the females. In the case of the Three-pronged Osmia, the male has about a week's start. Consequently, in a populous gallery, there is always a certain number of males, who are hatched seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> days before the females and who are distributed here and there over the series. This would be enough to make any regular hatching-sequence impossible in either direction. These surmises accord with the facts: the chronological sequence of the cells tells us nothing about the chronological sequence of the hatchings, which take place without any definite order. There is, therefore, no surrender of rights of primogeniture, as Leon Dufour thought: each insect, regardless of the...", "...tour, and he was rejoiced to find evidences that his own state was gradually perceiving the value and blessings of the Union. At Richmond he was entertained at a public dinner, and escorted far on toward Petersburg by a cavalcade of gentlemen. Having been much incommoded by dust, and finding an escort of horse was preparing to accompany him from Petersburg, Washington caused inquiries as to the time he would leave the town to be answered, that he should endeavor to do it before <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> o'clock in the morning. He managed to get off at five, by which means he avoided the inconvenience above-mentioned. At Wilmington, in North Carolina, he was received by a military and civic escort, entertained at a public dinner, and attended a ball given in his honor in the evening. At Newbern he received like homage, where the dinner and the ball were given at the palace built by Governor Tryon about twenty-five years before.

Among the Creek Indians of Georgia, Morgan recounts a somewhat different mode of communal dwelling as formerly being practised. In 1790 they were living in small houses, placed in clusters of from four to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> together; and each cluster forming a _gens_ or clan, who ate and lived in common. The food was prepared in one hut, and each family sent for its portion. The smallest of these \"garden cities\" contained 10 to 40 groups of houses, the largest from 50 to 200.[59] These communistic dwelling-houses are so interesting and so important that I would add a few words. Here, we have among these maternal peoples a system of living which appears to be identical with the improved conditions of...", "...had plundered it of every portable article worth carrying away.

The like had not been heard of for years. In a twinkling, <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten men were mustered, lanterned, and bludgeoned; and, headed by a sergeant, were on their march to the scene of robbery. On arriving at Mr. Thomson's door, they found it fast, and all quiet within. What was to be done? Force open the door? Perhaps some of the villains were still in the house. At any rate, it was proper to see what state things were in. A smith was accordingly sent for, the lock picked, and the door thrown open, when, headed by the sergeant with a pistol...", "...before it, with great gates, and a garden behind.

The west side contains the cathedral and the bishop's palace; the north side is the president's palace, the royal court, the council house, and the prison; the south side is a row of piazzas, the whole length of which are shops, and over it a gallery to see the bull-feasts; the east side has some large houses belonging to people of distinction; and in the middle is a large fountain, with a brass bason. The houses have, in general, only a ground floor,...", "...dart, where it is nearly on an equipoise. They hold the dart between the thumb and remaining fingers, which serve only to give it direction, the velocity being communicated by the becket and fore-finger. The former flies off from the dart the instant its velocity becomes greater than that of the hand. But it remains on the finger ready to be used again. With darts they kill both birds and fish, and are sure of hitting a mark, within the compass of the crown of a hat, at the distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> or ten yards; but, at double that distance, it is chance if they hit a mark the size of a man's body, though they will throw the weapon sixty or seventy yards. They always throw with all their might, let the distance be what it will. Darts, bows and arrows are to them what musquets are to us. The arrows are made of reeds pointed with hard wood; some are bearded and some not, and those for shooting birds have two, three, and sometimes four points.

That the constitutional government--consisting of nobles and of the vroedschaps of chartered cities--should have been in existence four hundred and seventeen years before the first charter had ever been granted to a city, was a very loose style of argument. Thomas Wilkes, in reply; might as well have traced the English parliament to Hengist and Horsa. \"For <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred years;\" they said, \"Holland had been governed by Counts and Countesses, on whom the nobles and cities, as representing the States, had legally conferred sovereignty.\" Now the first incorporated city of Holland and Zeeland that ever existed was Middelburg, which received its charter from Count William I. of Holland and Countess Joan of Flanders; in the year 1217. The first Count that had any legal recognized authority was Dirk the First to whom Charles the Simple...", "...of colloquial Chinese, it is necessary for the student to consider in what part of China he proposes to put his knowledge into practice. If he intends to settle or do business in Peking, it is absolute waste of time for him to learn the dialect of Shanghai. Theoretically, there is but one language spoken by the Chinese people in China proper,--over an area of some two million square miles, say twenty-five times the area of England and Scotland together. Practically, there are about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> well-marked dialects, all clearly of a common stock, but so distinct as to constitute eight different languages, any two of which are quite as unlike as English and Dutch. These dialects may be said to fringe the coast line of the Empire of China.

LONG WOOL. The most valuable of the long-woolled fleeces are of British origin. A considerable quantity is produced in France and Belgium; but the manufacturers in those countries acknowledge the superiority of the British wool. Long wool is distinguished, as its name would import, by the length of its staple, the average of which is about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> inches. It was much improved, of late years, both in England and in other countries. Its staple has, without detriment to its manufacturing qualities, become shorter; but it has also become finer, truer, and sounder. The long-woolled sheep has been improved more than any other breed; and the principal error which Bakewell committed having been repaired since his death, the long wool has progressively risen in value, at least for curling purposes. Some of the breeds have staples...", "...man struck the blow. Both sang during the operation. The blows were in the rhythm of the music, and a quick \"rebounding\" stroke was said to be essential to good success.[217] A \"lad\" in Michigan made arrowheads in imitation of Indian work, from flint, glass, and obsidian, with a piece of oak stick five inches long as a tool.[218] Sophus Mueller[219] says of modern attempts to imitate stone-implement making that an average workman can learn in fourteen days to make five hundred to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> hundred arrowheads per day, but that no one of the best workmen has been able to equal the fine chipping on the neolithic stone weapons, although many have made the small implements on the types of the old stone age. +131.

Their arrival at the Briganza river affords Dr. Vincent an opportunity of conjecturing the probable draught of a Grecian vessel of fifty oars. At ebb-tide, Arrian informs us, the vessels were left dry; whereas at high tide they were able to surmount the breakers and shoals. Modern travellers state that the flood-tide rises in the upper part of the Gulf of Persia, nine or ten feet: hence it may be conjectured that the largest vessel in the fleet drew from six to <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet water. The next day's sail brought them from the Briganza to the river Arosis, the boundary river between Persis and Susiana, the largest of the rivers which Nearchus had met with in the Gulf of Persia. The province of Persis is described by Nearchus as naturally divided into three parts. \"That division which lies along the side of the Gulf is sandy, parched, and sterile, bearing little else but palm-trees.\" To the north and north-east, across the range of mountains, the...", "...window frames. Some flexible poles are nailed around the top and about halfway up the side, so that the walls of the hut are firmly fastened together. Longer poles are then used as rafters, these being firmly fastened to the walls and nailed together at the top. Small, flexible ones are also used as lath to fasten the rafters together and upon which to tie the grass in thatching. The grass used for this purpose grows in abundance among these rocks, and sometimes reaches the height of <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> feet. The women cut this and bring it in bundles, glad to exchange it for a little salt. It is first combed by means of spikes driven through a board. It is then divided into small bundles; the lower ends being placed evenly together, and the bundles tied closely together on the lath with tarred rope. The next layer is placed over this like shingles, so as to cover the place of tying. When completed the thickness of grass on the eaves of the roof is from four to ten inches.

At the center of our system is the sun, a huge ball of fiery matter 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and as large as 330,000 worlds like ours. Circling around the sun like maddened horses around a race course are <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> planets. These planets, with the sun and some comets, constitute our solar system; _our_ system, for how many solar systems there are in space no one knows. These planets, in their order outward from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, our Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Of these, Mercury is the smallest and Jupiter is the largest. The following table shows some interesting facts about the planets:...", "...elimination of a market in the true sense of the word, furnished the principal impetus for the organization of the New York Coffee Exchange. At that time, the Havre market was the only one with an exchange. The local body was organized in December, 1881, and started business in March, 1882. _The Cable Break of 1884_ The second noteworthy movement, embracing an advance of four to four and one-half cents and a recession of slightly more than three cents, covered a period of about <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> months shortly after the Exchange was organized. Various local and out-of-town firms were interested in the bulge which carried Rio coffee in this market from about seven cents in July, 1883, up to eleven and one-half cents late in November.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> years my enthusiasm had to struggle with military discipline; but a passion for poetry is strong and ardent as first love.

On reaching our observation post and seeing no sign of a Monitor in the vicinity, I remarked to Gye: \"It certainly is a very fine afternoon for a ride, but I don't see much appearance of that 'strafe' you promised to show me.\" \"I think it will be all right,\" replied Gye, \"there is the Monitor away out at sea,\" pointing to a speck close over to the Imbros shore, some seven or <span class=\"clocktext\">eight</span> miles away--a mere cockleshell in the distance. On looking from the speck to the redoubt I said: \"It is not a 'strafe' you have brought me out to see but a miracle,\" because it looked to me that it would be little short of a miracle to hit that small redoubt which, of course, could only be faintly seen from the tops of the Monitor by telescope. However, I hadn't to wait long for the wonderful sight. Punctually to the moment when it was expected, we saw the Monitor enveloped...", "...it.
