I learn that their price averaged <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> pounds apiece in English currency--two hundred and eighty dollars altogether in Moorish money, that they were all bred in Marrakesh by a dealer who keeps a large establishment of slaves, as one in England might keep a stud farm, and sells the children as they grow up.

Richard II. began, it is well known, to reign in the year 1377, when ten years of age, and, of course, the year 1397 was the twentieth of his reign. It follows from this, that for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years at least before his death Gower had been _senex et cecus_, helpless through old age and blindness. The 'Confessio Amantis' is the only work of Gower's which is printed and in English.

Finally, in despair, we remembered a card that had been handed into the cars by some hotel-runner, and finding it was of an English and French hotel, we drove there, and secured very comfortable accommodations. We did not get to bed until after two o'clock. The next morning I sent a messenger to find Mme. Borione, and...", "...with the purpose of getting it done.

The _Journal Officiel_, by an innovation which attracted some notice, had given the list of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> groups composing the Chamber. It was decided that, instead of members seating themselves wherever they individually pleased, they must sit in the sections assigned to their respective groups.

It might be hoped that the change would facilitate the work of the President of the Chamber.

As the summer seemed to be fast advancing, I thought it not advisable to lose time by the way, nor to stray far from the road, in the early part of the tour, but only to observe attentively what readily presented itself, that I might reach Lapland with all possible dispatch. _May 13._ By <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock I arrived at Gefle, where I was obliged to stay all that day, for it was evening before I received from the governor of the province (of Gestrickland) the requisite passport, which was accompanied by orders to all the public officers in his district to give me all requisite assistance to penetrate, if possible, into Asila Lapmark. _May 14._ Owing to the above delay, and my attending morning service the next day at Gefle church, I could not quit that place till one...", "...It is not improbable that it will rain, and it is possible that it may snow. Worse than all, the hawthorn-trees are behind time, and are as obstinate as the head-nurse in not thinking the weather fit for coming out. The May is not in blossom on May-day. And yet May-day used to be kept in the north of England as well as in warmer nooks and corners. The truth is that one reason why we find the weather less pleasant, and the flowers fewer than our forefathers did, is that we keep May-day <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days earlier in the year than they used to do. To explain how this is, I must try and explain what Old Style and New Style--in reckoning the days of the year--mean. First let me ask you how you can count the days. Supposing you wish to remain just one day and night in a certain place, how will you know when you have stayed the proper time? In one of two ways. Either you will count twenty-four hours on the clock, or you will stay through all the light of one day, and all the...", "...of the Atlantic. The third largest number of votes were given to the aeroplane and since the birdmen played such a part in the world war these scientists were correct in giving the flying machine a place among the wonders of the modern world. The fourth place was given to Radium, the fifth to Antiseptics and Antitoxines, the sixth to Spectrum Analysis, and the seventh to the marvelous X-Ray. Had eight subjects been called for the Panama Canal would have had a place, for it lacked but <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> votes of tie for seventh place. It can, therefore, be called the eighth wonder of the modern world. How different were the ideas of men during the days of ancient Greece. It is a remarkable fact that among the seven wonders of the ancient world only one of them was of any real service to humanity. True, one or two of them served as tombs for the dead and one of them was a sort of a pleasure resort, but it proved a curse rather than a blessing. The one of real service was the...", "...I cannot place it.

And for the first time Mirza Nuruddin could remember, he had smelled fear. Mirza Nuruddin had sensed no fear in the Portuguese eight years before, when an English captain named Lancaster had attacked and pillaged a Portuguese galleon in the seas off Java.

And a mere five years ago the Viceroy himself led a fleet of twelve warships to Malacca boasting to burn the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> Dutch merchantmen lading there. And the Dutch sank almost his entire fleet. Now the pirates of Malabar daily harassed Indian shipping the length of the western coast and the Portuguese patrols seemed powerless to control them.

This movement of the French XVIth Corps compelled General von Tann, at the very beginning of the engagement, to despatch the 2nd Brigade, which had constituted his reserve, to prolong his right wing northwards towards Champs, and thus obtain touch with the 4th Cavalry Brigade. The Bavarian Cuirassiers, retiring according to orders from St. Peravy to the southward, about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock encountered Reyau's cavalry, which, however, restricted itself to a mere cannonade. Meanwhile, after a stout resistance, the advanced posts of the Bavarians had been driven in by the enemy's superior strength. The 1st Rifle Battalion, after having retarded the advance of the French horse-batteries through Champdry for a long time, retreated from Baccon to La Riviere,[41] where it expected to be received by the 2nd (Rifle Battalion).

The facts of the case are briefly as follows: Mr. Van Ness, whose relations with the Wharton family had been extremely intimate for many years, was a bank-clerk, but during the spring and early summer of 1871, besides attending to his regular duties, was employed in settling a large estate. He habitually rose early, often at 5 A.M., and generally worked until <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock at night. During this period he suffered from severe nervous headaches, and probably from other symptoms of an overworked nervous system, but on this point the testimony disagreed. His stomach is at all times so sensitive that brandy nauseates him. On the 19th of June, after taking some claret on an empty stomach at Mrs. Wharton's, he felt very badly, suffering from lightness of the head or giddiness and general wretchedness, with stiffness and numbness in the back of...", "...ruined both, destroyed French hopes in India, and for the present saved those of England from almost certain annihilation.

The Philadelphia lay within one-half gunshot of the Bashaw's castle and of the principal battery; two of the enemy's cruisers were only a couple of cables' length away on the starboard quarter, and their gunboats were within one-half gunshot on the starboard bow. All the guns of the frigate were mounted and loaded. Although it was only three miles from the entrance of the harbor to the frigate, the wind was so light that the Intrepid did not get within hail until <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock. At the distance of two hundred yards, the frigate hailed the ketch and ordered her to anchor under threat of being fired into. Decatur's Maltese pilot, by his direction, replied they had lost their anchor in a gale of wind off the coast and were unable to do as commanded. When within fifty yards Decatur sent a small boat with a rope to make fast to the frigate's fore-chains. This was done and the Americans began warping the ketch alongside.

A learned man has since sought to explain the thing to me, by saying that the little part of black blood in this man was doubtless descended from a cannibal; and those instincts would at times come to the fore.

The fort saluted me with <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> guns, and the Dutch commodore with thirteen, which I returned; we were saluted also by the English ship. We worked down to Prince's Island, in the strait of Sunda, and came to an anchor there on the 14th. In this passage, the boats came off to us from the Java shore, and supplied us with turtle in such plenty, that neither of the ship's companies eat any thing else.

When Dr. Staines heard she had been for her box, but left no address, he sent Pearman to hunt for her. He could not find her. She avoided the house, but sent a woman for her diurnal love letters. Dr. Staines sent the woman back to fetch her. She came, received her box, her letters, and the balance of her wages, which...", "...witnesses were called. Each of them swore, point blank, that, upon a certain day and at a certain place, they saw the prisoner pay over the money, and saw the prosecutor execute the deed. To rebut this, the prosecutor called eleven witnesses who swore, point blank, that, upon the day and at the hour mentioned as the day and hour on which the deed was executed, they met the prosecutor at a village forty miles distant from Bijnore. In short, if their testimony was to be relied upon, the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> witnesses had proved an alibi. This was one of those cases which happen continually in courts of justice in India; where the magistrate or judge must not be, and is not, guided by the oaths of the witnesses, but entirely by circumstances. It is one of those cases, too, in which it would be dangerous to consult the native officers of the court; for having received bribes from both parties, their advice would be dictated entirely by pecuniary considerations. With them the...", "...description was written almost two and a half centuries ago. The \"Spanish wrack\" was handed down from one chief of the Campbell clan to another, as part of the estate, until in 1740, John, the second Duke of Argyll, decided to try his luck, and employed a diving bell, by which means a magnificent bronze cannon was recovered. It has since been kept at Inverary Castle, the seat of the Dukes of Argyll, as an heirloom greatly esteemed. This elaborately wrought piece of ordnance, almost <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet in length, bears the arms of Francis I of France (for whom it was cast at Fontainebleau) and the fleur-de-lis. It was probably captured from Francis at the battle of Pavia during his invasion of Italy, and the Spanish records state that several of such cannon were put on a vessel contributed to the Armada by the state of Tuscany. At the same time a large number of gold and silver coins were found by the divers, and the treasure seeking was thereby freshly encouraged....", "...amongst our followers, than from any well-founded anticipation of it; their fears were not totally groundless, as it must be confessed that to a needy and disorganized population the bait of a lac of rupees was very tempting.

At about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> at night the European sergeant in charge of the horses burst into our tent in some consternation, stating that a large band of robbers were descending from the adjacent hills to attack the treasure. Sturt immediately jumped up, and mounting his horse gallopped off to the supposed scene of action. All was quiet _without_ the camp; _within_ there was a terrible bustle, which Sturt at last succeeded in allaying by sending out patrols in various direction, who reported that nothing...", "...perverse in the House of Braganza that they can hardly be said to respect in any way the natural family ties. _A propos_ of Pretenders and curious manners, Lord Burghersh yesterday told me a great deal about the Countess of Albany, whom he knew at Florence. There she had as _cavaliere servente_ M. Fabre, the painter, who had lived with her since the death of Alfieri. They used to walk out alone, with only M. Fabre's big dog to keep them company. They also dined alone. From eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> the Countess received all Florence. While this was going on M. Fabre retired to a mistress of an inferior order. At eleven he reappeared at the Countess's, and his arrival was the signal for the whole company to disperse in order that they might sup _tete-a-tete_. The one was never asked out without the other; this is the etiquette in Italy, and is carried to a naive extreme. Here is an example: Lord Burghersh, who was British Minister at Florence, opened his house with a great...", "...this decree included imprisonment, destruction of stock, and a whipping at the cart's tail. The twenty printers appointed by this decree were the subject of much investigation by Sir John Lamb, whose numerous notes and lists concerning them, as reprinted in the third volume of Professor Arber's transcripts from documents at the Record Office, are an invaluable acquisition to the history of the English press. It will be seen that four of the chief offenders of the previous ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years, namely William Jones, Nicholas Okes, Augustine Mathewes, and Robert or Richard Raworth, were absolutely excluded, their places being taken by Marmaduke Parsons, Thomas Paine, and a new man, Thomas Purslowe, probably the son of Widow Purslowe.

Sanin had carried out this intention, and had fitted things in to such a nicety that on the day of his arrival in Frankfort he had only just enough money left to take him back to Petersburg. In the year 1840 there were few railroads in existence; tourists travelled by diligence. Sanin had taken a place in the '_bei-wagon_'; but the diligence did not start till <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock in the evening. There was a great deal of time to be got through before then. Fortunately it was lovely weather, and Sanin after dining at a hotel, famous in those days, the White Swan, set off to stroll about the town. He went in to look at Danneker's Ariadne, which he did not much care for, visited the house of Goethe, of whose works he had, however, only read _Werter_, and that in the French translation. He walked along the bank of the Maine, and was bored as a...", "...the ages of seven and fifteen. I looked at them in astonishment. They all had fair skins, red cheeks, and clear eyes; they were all broad-shouldered, straight, and sturdy; the younger ones were more than sturdy,--they were fat, from the ankles up. But perhaps the most noticeable thing of all was the quiet, sturdy, unharassed expression which their faces wore; a look which is the greatest charm of a child's face, but which we rarely see in children over two or three years old. Boys of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> or twelve were there, with shoulders broader than the average of our boys at sixteen, and yet with the pure, childlike look on their faces. Girls of ten or eleven were there who looked almost like women,--that is, like ideal women,--simply because they looked so calm and undisturbed. The Saxon coloring prevailed; three-fourths of the eyes were blue, with hair of that pale ash-brown which the French call \"_blonde cendree_\" Out of them all there was but one child who looked...", "...acceptability. At the age of thirty-five, Mr. Sherman was made by the Ohio Legislature a Judge of the Supreme Court. It was an honorable position, and offered prospect of a brilliant future. He did not occupy it long, however. While on the bench at Lebanon he was stricken with sudden illness, and died on June 24th, 1829, being then only forty-one years old. His salary had been small and he had been able to save almost nothing. His widow therefore, was left practically penniless, with <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> children to care for, the oldest eighteen years of age, and the youngest six weeks. This was a desperate situation indeed. But Mary Hoyt Sherman was not the woman to be daunted. She addressed herself to the training and education of her children with energy, patience and prayer, and was remarkably successful in her arduous work. From four of her children she was for a time partially separated in order that they might enjoy the advantages offered to them by kind relatives and...", "...cheering to the philanthropist is this extravagance than the miserable frugality of want, and the barbarous virtues of ignorance, which at that time oppressed nearly the whole of Europe! The Burgundian era shines pleasingly forth from those dark ages, like a lovely spring day amid the showers of February. But this flourishing condition tempted the Flemish towns at last to their ruin; Ghent and Bruges, giddy with liberty and success, declared war against Philip the Good, the ruler of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> provinces, which ended as unfortunately as it was presumptuously commenced. Ghent alone lost many thousand men in an engagement near Havre, and was compelled to appease the wrath of the victor by a contribution of four hundred thousand gold florins.

The next day the wind abated, and hauling away to the east, we stood northward again, and then north-west in three days more, and we made land, which appeared to be the head island of Port St. Julian, on the north side of the port, where we ran in, and about an hour before sunset came to an anchor in <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> fathom good holding ground, latitude 49 deg. 18'. We wanted fresh water, otherwise we would not have made any stay here, for we knew we were a little too far to the south; however, we were obliged to fill fresh water here for three days together, the watering-place being a good way up the river, and the swell of the sea running very high.

She sobbed as...", "...he said, slowly. \"We'll look in some time and take our chance of catching him awake.\" Mrs. Scutts bowed them out, and in some perplexity returned to Mr. Flynn. \"I don't like the look of 'em,\" she said, shaking her head. \"You'd better stay in bed till Bill comes 'ome in case they come back.\" \"Right-o,\" said the obliging Mr. Flynn. \"Just step in and tell my landlady I'm 'aving a chat with Bill.\" He lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking until a knock at the front door at half-past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> sent him off to sleep again. Mrs. Scutts, who was sitting downstairs, opened it and admitted her husband. \"All serene?\" he inquired. \"What are you looking like that for?

But a big hand was clapped unceremoniously across the young officer's mouth, silencing the half-spoken suicidal order.

The funeral oration was pronounced by Maboul, Bishop of Aleth, and pleased; M. de Metz, chief chaplain, officiated; the service commenced at about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock. As it was very long, it was thought well to have at hand a large vase of vinegar, in case anybody should be ill. M. de Metz having taken the first oblation, and observing that very little wine was left for the second, asked for more. This large vase of vinegar was supposed to be wine, and M. de Metz, who wished to strengthen himself, said, washing his fingers over the chalice, \"fill right up.\" He swallowed all at a draught, and did not perceive until the end that he...", "...was crying and smiling both at once.

The felicity of such a meeting is not to be described, and it can only be conceived by those who have experienced similar sensations. At length, in August 1781, Captain Nelson was appointed to the command of the Albemarle of twenty-eight guns.

The appointment was not a very important one, carrying only between Rs. 500 and Rs. 700 a month; but, as the Viceroy said, it was the principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained, and it was more than likely that a boy so well supplied with special information would be worth translating. So they translated him. They must have suspected him, though he protested that his information was due to singular talents...", "...but it would have answered no good purpose: We could not afterwards have procured wood and water here without risking the loss of our own people, and I still hoped that refreshment might be procured upon friendly terms at the town, which, now I was in a condition to defend myself against a sudden assault, I resolved to visit. The next morning, therefore, as soon as it was light, I sailed from this place, which I called _Deceitful Bay_, with a light land-breeze, and between ten and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock we got off the bay or nook, at the bottom of which our boats had discovered the town and fort. It happened however that just at this time the weather became thick, with heavy rain, and it began to blow hard from a quarter which made the land here a lee-shore; this obliged me to stand off, and having no time to lose, I stood away to the westward, that I might reach Batavia before the season was past.

She dreaded the very sight of Captain Fennel. In the morning she saw that the paper had disappeared from the mantelpiece. He was quite jaunty at breakfast, talking to her and Nancy about Pontipette; and things passed pleasantly. About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock he began brushing his hat to go out. \"I'm going to have a look at Griffin, and see how he's getting on,\" he remarked. \"Perhaps the old man would enjoy a drive this fine day; if so, you may not see me back till dinner-time.\" But just as Captain Fennel turned out of the Place Ronde to the Rue Tessin, he came upon Charles Palliser, strolling along. \"Fine day, Mr. Charles,\" he remarked graciously. \"Capital,\" assented Charles, \"and I'm glad of it; the old gentleman...", "...a filthy existence under the name of the Washington Canal. But there was a greater misfortune than any of these. Slavery need only be mentioned. More of Washington's present defects are attributable to it in one way or another than to all else. Yet under this crowning calamity, added to the others, the undulating plain before us, which appears so sluggish from the height to which we have climbed, has within seventy-five years passed from a wilderness into a city of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> thousand inhabitants. Although the general government kept the breath of life in it during a period when perhaps nothing else could have done so, yet such a growth, under all the circumstances, cannot be accounted for without recognizing an inherent strength that has never been acknowledged by the multitudes who come to \"see\" Washington. It proves that she may have a significance of her own.

We sighted lights on the left bank about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock the same evening. Rain was still falling in torrents; but the noise of gongs and drums in the distance announced that we had nearly arrived at the end of our journey.

He often came to eat rice with me, and I often went to his house; we were like brothers. At a village about six miles away, there lived a man who was a breeder of cattle. He and his wife were very partial to me, and it was arranged between us that I should marry their daughter when she was old enough--she was then <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years of age. All went well for two years, and then I was married to the girl and took her to my house. My friend, 'Allagappen,' used to come and visit us and eat rice as before. Things went on very well for five or six years: my wife and I were very happy together, and never quarrelled; we had only one child.

The corporate line is described by a radius of a mile and three-quarters. In two places this circle is expanded to take in suburban communities which had been formed with irregular boundaries before the circular corporation line reached them. These are Inman Park and West End, which extend from half a...", "...are degraded, but that they are lifted up, not that they go to the gutter, but that they escape the gutter and glimpse the stars. But if the two stories are thus variations upon the same sombre theme, if each starts from the same place and arrives at the same dark goal, if each shows a woman heartened by the same hopes and tortured by the same agonies, there is still a vast difference between them, and that difference is the measure of the author's progress in his craft during the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years between 1900 and 1911. \"Sister Carrie,\" at bottom, is no more than a first sketch, a rough piling up of observations and ideas, disordered and often incoherent. In the midst of the story, as I have said, the author forgets it, and starts off upon another.

I observed that all domestic animals, the goats especially, attain a very diminutive size in these oases, the nourishment for them being but scanty. In this oasis the palm-groves are much more dense than in any other I have seen. They almost merit the name of forests, both from their size and wild luxuriant appearance.

From these the clergy only were freed (having bought of the crown a perpetual exemption). Two twentieths and four sous in the livre of the first twentieth, or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> per cent., was the regular rate in the reign of Louis XVI., and was expected to bring in from fifty-five to sixty million livres a year. A third twentieth was laid in 1782, to last for three years after the end of the war of the American Revolution, then in progress. This twentieth brought in twenty-one and a half millions only, on account of various exemptions that were allowed. The liability to the twentieths was not joint but individual; so that when a deduction was made from...", "...we all discovered that this man had been on the road for a long time, with no object, apparently, except to evade laundries.

When Acton appeared first, and it was seen that he was wearing the pink cap of Biffen's on his head there was more than astonishment, there was consternation. Whatever did it mean? Acton smiled good-naturedly at the school as they cheered him to the echo, and hurried unconcernedly along.

I did write the letter saying I was coming, but I forgot to mail it and found it in my bag when I got off the train and was looking for my trunk check. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock and nobody around but some train people who looked at me and said nothing. And then a young man who had got off the same train came up and took off his hat and asked if he could not do something for me, and I told him I hoped he could and I certainly would be obliged if he would do it as quick as possible, as it was getting later every minute and Mother would be terribly worried if she knew I hadn't been met. \"But where are you going?\" he asked, and his eyes, which are...", "...either written on the sheet, or on a ticket pasted down; and the time of collection, the locality, the color of the flowers, and any other information which the specimens themselves do not afford, should be duly recorded upon the sheet or the ticket.

Her cold but ingenuous beauty, her touching expression, her freshness and purity, prevented Birotteau from thinking of her defects, which moreover were more than compensated by a delicate sense of honor natural to women, by an excessive love of order, by a fanaticism for work, and by her genius as a saleswoman.

The order was that the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> brothers should be taken into the depths of the forest and chained to great beams and left there. This was done with the eleven sons of Volsung. The next day one who had watched and who was faithful to Signy came, and Signy said to him: \"What has befallen my brothers?\" And the watcher said: \"A great wolf came to where the chained men are, and fell upon the first of them and devoured him.\" When Signy heard this no tears came from her eyes, but that which was hard around...", "...I came away with everything ruined.

The whole valley of the Fatal River had been laid bare to them, and now La Salle thought the time had come to take formal possession for his sovereign. Near the mouth of the river, the party came together on the ninth of April, 1682, and a ceremony took place that was very similar to the one at the Sault Ste.

It did not rival that in the magnificence with which it was conducted, though the ceremonial was, perhaps, a little more elaborated, but it seemed to have a better basis of fact, for La Salle had actually passed through the heart of the region which he now claimed.

Thus during 1866, 809 male colts and 816 female colts were born, and 743 mares failed to produce offspring.

[This paper, as giving the impressions of a first visit to the soil of Herzegovina, during an early stage of the war, has been reprinted, with the change of a few words, as it was first written.] The first step which any man takes beyond the bounds of Christendom can hardly fail to mark a kind of epoch in his life. And the epoch becomes more...", "...here appears to have been a Mr. John West, who had been a student at Northampton in Doddridge's academy; for though we have no account preserved of the period when he commenced or when he closed his ministry, yet we find that he entered the academy at Northampton in the year 1740. If immediately on the close of his studies he became the pastor of the Church at Ashley, according to the usual term this would not take place until 1745 or 1746; and as we find another pastor chosen within <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> or twelve years from this time, and have no further account of Mr. West, it is probable that he closed his life and his ministry at a comparatively early age. In the year 1757, Mr. Samuel Bacon was chosen pastor of the Church at Ashley, in which office he continued for 32 years. The residence of Mr. Bacon's family was Sutton-in-Ashfield; he studied for the ministry at the academy at Mile End, when Dr. Conder and Mr., afterward Dr., Gibbons were the tutors. It is supposed...", "...for Christmas on that day, and the country people thronged into the town. A band used to play before the shop in which the Grand Duke was, and move as he moved. We gave an extra long performance at the opera, \"Goetterdaemmerung,\" or some such serious business, but the Grand Duke never could honour us with his presence, as every one in town would have felt cheated if he had. The shopping in Darmstadt was really quite remarkable. We always thought it an excellent thing that after <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock in the morning not a scrap of meat was visible in the white-tiled butcher shops, everything being put away on ice. Food is taken very seriously, of course, and asparagus is honoured above any other vegetable by having its own subscription season.

While in power, she always sided with extravagance and the court, against economy and the nation.

Even Teona and Waola, active boys of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> and twelve, and already daring hunters, would be ashamed to draw upon themselves by word or motion the reproving looks of their mates.

My father's name was Christopher Fox; he was by profession a weaver, an honest man, and there was a seed of God in him. In my very young years I had a gravity and staidness of mind and spirit not usual in children. When I came to <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years of age I knew pureness and righteousness. The Lord taught me to be faithful in all things, inwardly to God and outwardly to man, and to keep to \"Yea\" and \"Nay\" in all things. Afterwards, as I grew up, I was put to a man, a shoemaker by trade, who dealt in wool, and was a grazier, and sold cattle, and a great deal went through my hands. I never wronged man or woman in all that time; for the Lord's power was with me, and over me to preserve me. While I was in that...", "...a very steady guard over his wicket.

The two first returned to France, the one after thirteen, the other after <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years in Canada. In 1645, we find the Venerable Mother relieved from the burden of Superiority, which consistently with the Constitutions of the Ursuline Order cannot be borne by the same individual for more than six consecutive years.

The pair, with veils down, each looking a plagiarism of the other, slipped out of the servants' entrance, through the gate of the low iron fence, and arm clutching arm hastened eastward to University Place. Thus far no one had challenged them.

All the passengers, however, were in perfectly good humour, and amused each other during the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hours spent in this painful way. At an average speed of six miles an hour we travelled over roads of various descriptions, plank, corduroy, and sand; up long heavy hills, and through swamps swarming with mosquitoes. Every one has heard of corduroy roads, but how few have experienced their miseries! They are generally used for traversing swampy ground, and are formed of small pine-trees deprived of their branches, which are laid across the track alongside each other. The wear...", "...a lot of trouble, as they swam and dived with great speed, but all three were eventually secured. There was still an hour before dark, and seeing no signs of my friend I went on shore and bagged three pheasants before returning to the boat. Next morning, after passing a cold and miserable night in the tiny cabin of the dirty little sampan, I started with gun and dog at about eight o'clock--fully expecting that the house-boat would turn up during my absence--and shot all day, killing <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> pheasants, two deer, three woodcock, seven duck and one pigeon. As by dark there were still no signs of my expected host I had no choice but to return home. It was a lovely night, bright, frosty and star-light, with a nice, crisp breeze, which, the river being there about two miles wide, raised quite a sea.

Then comes a rush of carriages, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock the line stretches away half round Grosvenor Square, and moves at a foot's-pace towards the lights, and the music, and the shouting street.

Well, anyhow, she was paying dearly for her folly, and perhaps other women could profit by it. And all that literary material wasted. \"But it is a good thing I am not leaving <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> children motherless,\" she concluded philosophically.

The eleven eldest went out with their father to field and forest, but Esben preferred to stay at home with his mother, and so he was never reckoned at all by the rest, but was a sort of outcast among them.

On hearing the charge, the man seemed enlightened, and, saying not another word, resigned himself with preternatural civility to the search- party, who, with their staves in their hands, surrounded him on all sides, and marched him back towards the shepherd's cottage. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock by the time they arrived. The light shining from the open door, a sound of men's voices within, proclaimed to them as they approached the house that some new events had arisen in their absence.

I had come to take it frequently, but not stronger than one might take it for pleasure. I wrote a great deal out here, it was so quiet, and in this room. I used to sit up very late, and it became a habit with me to sip my tea--green tea--every now and then as my work proceeded. I had a little kettle on my table, that swung over a lamp, and made tea two or three times between <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock and two or three in the morning, my hours of going to bed. I used to go into town every day. I was not a monk, and, although I spent an hour or two in a library, hunting up authorities and looking out lights upon my theme, I was in no morbid state as far as I can judge.

In fact, I shouldn't let Flexen interview you again at all. In an affair of this kind you can't be too careful.\" \"I won't let him interview me again,\" said Helena with decision. Mr. Flexen did not try to interview her again. But at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> the next morning he called on Mr. Manley. He had very little hope of effecting anything by the call, though he meant to try. But he had the keenest desire to scrutinize him again and carefully in the light of the new facts he had discovered.

The fighting qualities of men were seldom more severely tested. It was easy to get away, but to hold the enemy on the right, or so obstruct them that the other regiments posted to the left could get out, was a serious problem. The line was rallied and re-formed, from one stone fence to another. In the darkness the men sometimes became intermingled with the enemy, a Union officer, at one time, assuming command of a rebel regiment. About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, in the outskirts of the city, the contest was finally given up, all the left getting away but a detachment of the Tenth, which got lost in the darkness, and a few men of the Fifteenth and Fourth, surrounded unawares.

Jacob, with his <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> sons and their families, settled in Egypt at the invitation of Pharaoh, and after the death of their father his sons continued to live there, and became prosperous.

These districts were then grouped into an eastern, a middle, and a southern circuit, in accord with the geographical grouping of the States.

There is no independent evidence that Jeremiah returned to London and reached his office by <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock. We have only his word for it. Had Miss Farebrother not visited Parksides on that night, suspicion would have fallen upon the Pamfletts, and the hour of the scoundrel's return to London would have been a vital point.

War, incessant war, was all he cared for. No tribe or nation he met was able to stand against his army. In all his career he never met a reverse in the field. He was as daring as Darius had been cowardly, exposed his life freely, and was more than once seriously wounded, but recovered quickly from his hurts. At length, after <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years of almost incessant war, the conqueror returned to Babylon, and here, while preparing for new wars in Arabia and elsewhere, indulged with reckless freedom in that intoxication which was his principal form of relaxation from warlike schemes and duties. As a result he was seized with fever, and in a week's time died, just at the time he had fixed to set out with army and fleet on another great career of conquest.

An honest man should be ashamed of such an argumentum ad ignorantiam. The mortality of a hospital depends not merely on the treatment of the patients, but on the class of diseases it is in the habit of receiving, on the place where it is, on the season, and many other circumstances. For instance, there are many hospitals in the great cities of Europe that receive few diseases of a nature to endanger life, and, on the other hand, there are others where dangerous...", "...king, her husband, and never meddled with any court intrigues; she was charitable, beneficent, pious, a good wife and a good mother, and fully deserved to be called a model of feminine virtues.

A ship of 1300 tons was then a monster rarely seen, and a fleet, numbering from 130 to 150 sail, with an aggregate tonnage of 60,000, seemed sufficient to conquer the world, and to justify the arrogant title, by which it had baptized itself, of the Invincible.

The eleven headmen also had requests to make: they too would like to be of the party. As each of the eleven would have brought two friends, and each friend two cousins, Captain Ravenhill was advised by Mr. Lawes to make stern discrimination.

More than a hundred of her people were killed--a severe loss, yet small compared to what it must have been, from the crowded state of her decks, and the unprecedented length of the action, if the darkness, the heavy gale, and the consequent motion of the ships, had not made the firing slow, and the aim uncertain. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hours from the commencement of the action, when Lieutenant Bell, who was quartered on the forecastle, and who had kept the ship's reckoning through the night, satisfied himself that they were near the French coast, and ordered one or two sailors to keep a good look-out.

A still lower part of the Llandeilo rocks consists of a black carbonaceous slate of great thickness, frequently containing sulphate of alumina, and sometimes, as in Dumfriesshire, beds of anthracite. It has been conjectured that this carbonaceous matter may be due in great measure to large quantities of imbedded animal remains, for the number of Graptolites included in these slates was certainly very great. In Great Britain <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> genera and about 40 species of Graptolites occur in the Llandeilo flags and underlying Arenig beds.

The immense natural strength of the position and the strategical ability of its lord-abbot, Kosa, enabled it to defy all the assaults of the Owari chief, and it was not until 1588--six years after Nobunaga's death--that, through the intervention of the Emperor, peace was finally restored. After <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years of almost incessant struggle, his Majesty's envoy, Konoe Sakihisa, succeeded in inducing the Ikko priests to lay down their arms.

One season's play convinced all captains that the centre section of the forward line must be heavy, and if any light-weights were to be used among the rushers they should be near the wings. Quarter-back has, from the very outset, been a position in which a small man can be used to great advantage. The half-backs and backs have usually been men of speed coupled with skill as kickers. The number originally adopted for matches in this country was <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> on a side. From some silly notion that it would increase the skill displayed, this number was changed to fifteen, although the Englishmen were moving in the other direction by reducing their numbers from twenties to fifteens. A year or two of fifteen on a side drove the American players back to elevens, and there the number has rested. [Illustration: D. S. DEAN.

The removal of the court to Jerusalem provided a suitable opportunity, and an element of jealousy even may not have been wanting. If Geshur be the district in Josh. xiii. 2, 1 Sam. xxvii. 8, it is significant that the scene of Absalom's exile lay to the south, that Ahithophel was a south Judaean, and that Amasa probably belonged to the Jezreel[27] with which David was connected through his wife Ahinoam. The <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years which elapsed between the murder of Amnon and the revolt would seem to disprove any connexion between the two; the chronology may rest upon the tradition that Solomon was twelve years old when he came to the throne.

Walter Watson was the son of a handloom weaver in the village of Chryston, in the parish of Calder, and county of Lanark, where he was born, on the 29th March 1780. Having a family of other two sons and four daughters, his parents could only afford to send him two years to school; when at the age of eight, he was engaged as a cow-herd. During the winter months he still continued to receive instructions from the village schoolmaster. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> his father apprenticed him to a weaver; but he had contracted a love for the fields, and after a few years at the loom he hired himself as a farm-servant. In the hope of improving his circumstances, he proceeded to Glasgow, where he was employed as a sawyer. He now enlisted in the Scots Greys; but after a service of only three years, he was discharged, in June 1802, on the reduction of the army, subsequent to the peace of Amiens. At Chryston he resumed his earliest occupation,...", "...in other words, why does the delay of impregnation render queens incapable of laying the eggs of workers? This is a problem on which analogy throws no light: nor in all physiology am I acquainted with any fact that bears the smallest similarity. The problem becomes still more difficult by reflecting on the natural state of things, that is when fecundation has not been delayed. The queen then lays the eggs of workers forty-six hours after copulation, and continues for the subsequent <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months to lay these alone: and it is only after this period that a considerable and uninterrupted laying of the eggs of drones commences. When, on the contrary, impregnation is retarded after the twentieth day, the queen begins, from the forty-sixth hour, to lay the eggs of males, and no other kind during her whole life. As, in the natural state, she lays the eggs of workers only, during the first eleven months, it is clear that these, and the male eggs, are not indiscriminately...", "...call forth marks of unequivocal approbation from the government at home; returning to England in 1800, resuming my labours here, suffering, during these twenty-nine years, two years of imprisonment, heavy fines, three years self-banishment to the other side of the Atlantic, and a total breaking of fortune, so as to be left without a bed to lie on, and, during these twenty-nine years of troubles and of punishments, writing and publishing, every week of my life, whether in exile or not, <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> weeks only excepted, a periodical paper, containing more or less of matter worthy of public attention; writing and publishing, during _the same twenty-nine years_, a grammar of the French and another of the English language, a work on the Economy of the Cottage, a work on Forest Trees and Woodlands, a work on Gardening, an account of America, a book of Sermons, a work on the Corn-plant, a History of the Protestant Reformation; all books of great and continued sale, and the...", "...\"I, too, have a rifle,\" I said boldly.

He had slept from about half-past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> the night before till he was called at half-past eight--slept uninterruptedly and dreamlessly, without those incessant wakings from agonised dreams of desire which had so obsessed him during the last week. No doubt this change from the sedentary and cramped life of the ship to the wider activities of the land accounted for that, and he felt that the place and the air both suited him. Yesterday had passed pleasantly, too. He, Maud, and Cochrane had been for a long sleigh-drive in...", "...his trunks more than three or four times during the whole fortnight. On his promise to return in a year with larger and finer stones, he was allowed to leave for India. Before he left, however, the Court Treasurers had deposited to his credit, in American banks, the sum of fifteen million dollars--under four different aliases. He returned to America in 1868, having been gone a little over two years. He had visited the capitals of twenty-two countries and talked with five emperors, <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> kings, three princes, a shah, a khan, and a sultan. At that time Fitz-Norman estimated his own wealth at one billion dollars. One fact worked consistently against the disclosure of his secret. No one of his larger diamonds remained in the public eye for a week before being invested with a history of enough fatalities, amours, revolutions, and wars to have occupied it from the days of the first Babylonian Empire. From 1870 until his death in 1900, the history of Fitz-Norman...", "...I was going to dash across to school. Not much in it. Here it is, if you want to read it.\" \"Thanks.

We went through all the Terrace, the Roman Planting,[108] over by the Stiel and Haxellcleuch, and so by the Rhymer's Glen to Chiefswood,[109] which gave my heart a twinge, so disconsolate it seemed. Yet all is for the best. Called at Huntly Burn, and shook hands with Sir Adam and his Lady just going off.

Converting, therefore, his (or her) individual tax in a tontine, the money he shall receive after fifty years is but little more than the legal interest of the net money he has paid; the rest is made up from those whose circumstances do not require them to draw such support, and the...", "...I am beginning to learn the ways of the life of Compi\u00e8gne. At nine o'clock our tea, coffee, or chocolate (as we choose) is brought to our rooms by a white-stockinged and powdered valet. If you are very energetic, you can go for a walk in the park, or (as I did to my sorrow) a visit to the town. But you are not energetic more than once, because you do not find it worth your while, as you must hurry back, and change your dress and shoes before appearing in the salon a little before <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, the hour for breakfast.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock we hear a great roar ahead, and approach it very cautiously. The sound grows louder and louder as we run, and at last we find ourselves above a long, broken fall, with ledges and pinnacles of rock obstructing the river. There is a descent of perhaps 75 or 80 feet in a third of a mile, and the rushing waters break into great waves on the rocks, and lash themselves into a mad, white foam.

She would be so much the stronger, she thought, to resist any--any strain--if she could be quite certain how much Elfrida cared--cared about her personally.

She had dined in Kensington Square the night before, and this was <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock in the morning. It looked very much as if she had deliberately intended to leave them in the dark as to her movements. People didn't go out of town indefinitely \"for the present,\" on an hour's notice.

The palaver was in progress, and there against a blank wall outside the Sanchez house squatted eleven very glum-faced Navajos, while on the ground opposite to them in the strong morning light sat Don Nepomuceno and three of his relations who had come to give him their support. The <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> Indians were the first Navajos Stephens had ever seen, and he eyed them with no little curiosity. \"Call these wild Indians?\" he felt like saying: \"why they look as civilised as the Pueblos.\" This was because of their dress mainly.

Madame Boche would take Claude and Etienne with her for the bridal night. The children were sound asleep on chairs, stuffed full from the dinner. Just as the bridal couple and Lorilleux were about to go out the door, a quarrel broke out near the dance floor between their group and another group. Boche and My-Boots were kissing a lady and wouldn't give her up to her escorts, two soldiers. It was scarcely <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock. On the Boulevard de la Chapelle, and in the entire neighborhood of the Goutte-d'Or, the fortnight's pay, which fell due on that Saturday, produced an enormous drunken uproar. Madame Lorilleux was waiting beneath a gas-lamp about twenty paces from the Silver Windmill.

Through this passage-way he went for a long, long time, until at last he stumbled upon a door. He opened the door and stepped into a room, but it was pitch dark there too; so he groped all about until at last he stumbled upon another door and entered another room. So on he went through <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> rooms, and finally reached the twelfth, where at last he found a lighted candle upon a table. The room was beautifully fitted up, and he thought within himself, \"Come what come may, I shall make myself at home in this room.\" So he stretched himself upon a couch. He lay there for a while lost in thought, when, lo and behold! the table began to lay itself. When the cloth was spread, all sorts of good cheer began to appear upon it. \"Come what come may,\" he thought to himself...", "...they was paid every week, and I hadn't any kick there, either. As for the business that dinin'-room done, it was surprisin', particularly Saturdays and Sundays, when there'd be twenty or more autos in the front yard and more a-comin'.

And our bills with the \"Sign of the Windmill\" kept gettin' bigger and bigger. But though the auto parties was thick and the patronage good, still there was some dissatisfaction, I found out.

Mrs. Holmes and myself join in, and our worthy trustee, bachelor and Quaker though he be, laughs merriest of all. Aye! but this laughter was sweet music, but somehow it brought tears to my eyes.

For she is five feet <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> inches in height, and weighs sixteen stone. I call her \"The Queen,\" for when she stands up she is erect and queenly with a noble head and pleasing countenance. She makes no secret about her age; \"I am sixty, and I have been here four times, and, please God, I'll come forty-four more times,\" and she looks like it.

They are egg-shaped, rather more than half an inch in length, and four-tenths of an inch in width and depth. From the time of ripening, the soft, flesh-like tint gradually loses its freshness, and finally becomes cinnamon-brown; the variegations growing relatively duller and darker.

It is hardy and productive, but is liable to deteriorate when...", "...Look sharrup, now!\" But there was no need to tell him to look sharp, for he sprang toward me eagerly, his face alight with joy at the prospect of earning a few pennies--maybe sixpence--perhaps even a shilling! \"Where is it you'd be wantin' to go, sir?\" he asked, and touched his cap.

Almeda Champney had never wanted the blessing of a child, and, contrary to her young husband's wishes--he was her junior by twelve years--she had had her way.

He scouted the idea that she would enter the house as an assistant. None was needed; and, moreover, those small hands could accomplish little in the next ten years. She meant to adopt her then! An alien was to inherit the Champney property! Octavius actually shivered at the thought. Was it,...", "...I have not heard of him.\" \"His name is accursed in France.

The priests were in procession.

The exhibition began about nine o'clock in the evening, and was introduced by 'a grand overture of warlike instruments composed by Mr. Handel.' About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock the whole building was illuminated, in which state it continued till between two and three in the morning; His Majesty and the royal family retiring about twelve.

Again, both male and female, old and young were ruthlessly slaughtered, with the obvious result--the extermination of the species. If supervision had been exercised and restrictions imposed, there is no doubt that the island would still have been used by the fur seal as a breeding-ground. During our stay none were seen, but Mr. Bauer, who acts as sealing herdsman and who had visited the island in that capacity each summer for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years, stated that he had seen odd ones at infrequent intervals. Associated as the island has been since the year 1812 with sealing and oil ventures, it follows that a history has been gradually developed; somewhat traditional, though many occurrences to which we shall refer are well authenticated. It might be supposed from the foregoing, that a good deal is known about the place, but such is not the case, except in a general sense.

It was not without infinite labor that I felled this tree; I was twenty days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head cut off, which I hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labor; after this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion, and to...", "...to indulge in, Courtecuisse entered to pay his respects to his master and to bring his own account of eleven hundred francs, the sum to which his promised commission now amounted.

It is even settled who is to be secretary of State.

He had gone to bed at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock the night before and had awoke feeling quite fresh and gay. As soon as he was dressed he entered the adjoining room which Pierre occupied; but the young priest, who had not returned to the hotel until past one in the morning, with his blood heated by insomnia, had been unable to doze off until daybreak and was now still slumbering.

The return march was perhaps hastened by the determination and spirit of the Indians, who, notwithstanding their defeat, attacked Floyd's rear within a mile of their burned town on the day of the battle. The attack was made with spirit, but the numbers of the Indians were not sufficient to enable them to maintain it long. In this battle of Autosse Floyd lost <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> white men killed and fifty-four wounded, besides some losses among his friendly Indians.

The intimation that he was to rule over them made them angry, and they hated him. Soon after Joseph's sleep he was disturbed by another dream. The sun, moon, and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> stars, rendered homage to him. The interpretation of this was the same as that of the other, with the addition of his father and mother, who also bowed before him. It may seem strange that Joseph should relate any thing so complimentary to himself. But he evidently did it in no boasting mood. He simply narrated the extraordinary dreams, without the least idea of what was before him.

The making of a telephone was like the trick of Columbus standing an egg on end. Nothing was easier to those who knew how. And so it happened that, as the crude little model of Bell's original telephone lay in the Patent Office open and unprotected except by a few phrases that clever lawyers might evade, there sprang up inevitably around it the most costly and persistent Patent War that any country has ever known, continuing for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years and comprising SIX HUNDRED LAWSUITS. The first attack upon the young telephone business was made by the Western Union Telegraph Company. It came charging full tilt upon Bell, driving three inventors abreast--Edison, Gray, and Dolbear. It expected an easy victory; in fact, the disparity between the two opponents was so evident, that there seemed little chance of a contest of any kind. \"The Western Union will swallow up the telephone people,\" said public opinion, \"just as...", "...no danger of the shaking sickness, and built ourselves a house like unto the one we had helped make for Captain Smith.

His family had rich and powerful relations, who were quite ready to help the boy, and so, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years old, he left the quiet castle of Chavaniac and went to a school for young noblemen, the College du Plessis at Paris. Lafayette's mother's uncle, taking a liking to the boy, had him enrolled as a cadet in one of the famous regiments of France, \"The Black Musketeers,\" and this gave the boy a proud position at school, and many a day he took some of his new friends to see the Musketeers drill and learn something of the Manual of Arms. The company of other boys, both at the...", "...in the Pouter, and comparatively so in the others. There are great differences, too, in the size of the female and the male, the shape of the body, the number and width of the processes of the ribs, the development of the ribs, and the size, shape, and development of the breastbone. We may notice, too,--and I mention the fact because it has been disputed by what is assumed to be high authority,--the variation in the number of the sacral vertebrae. The number of these varies from <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> to fourteen, and that without any diminution in the number of the vertebrae of the back or of the tail. Then the number and position of the tail-feathers may vary enormously, and so may the number of the primary and secondary feathers of the wings. Again, the length of the feet and of the beak,--although they have no relation to each other, yet appear to go together,--that is, you have a long beak wherever you have long feet.

Although the occurrence can easily be explained by arithmetic, I still believe it to have been a miracle. Yet why did this conviction take such a hold upon me at the time, and remain with me ever since? Previously, I had thought of the idea, not as an occurrence which was ever likely to come about, but as something which NEVER could come about. The time was a quarter past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock when I entered the Casino in such a state of hope (though, at the same time, of agitation) as I had never before experienced. In the gaming-rooms there were still a large number of people, but not half as many as had been present in the morning. At eleven o'clock there usually remained behind only the real, the desperate gamblers--persons for whom, at spas, there existed nothing beyond roulette, and who went thither for that alone. These gamesters took little note of...", "...that make a nice mistress? Candidly, he did not think she had. He'd have to risk that. Anyhow, she wasn't common like the others....

The total amount paid Marshall for his <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months' absence upon the French mission was $19,963.97,[854] which, allowing five thousand dollars for his expenses--a generous estimate--was considerably more than three times as much as Marshall's annual income from his law practice.

If we observe all the eclipses in a period of eighteen years, or nineteen years, then we can predict, with at least an approximation to the truth, all the future eclipses for many years. It is only necessary to recollect that in 6,585-1/3 days after one eclipse a nearly similar eclipse follows. For instance, a beautiful eclipse of the moon occurred on the 5th of December, 1881. If we count back 6,585 days from that date, or, that is, eighteen years and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days, we come to November 24th, 1863, and a similar eclipse of the moon took place then. Again, there were four eclipses in the year 1881. If we add 6,585-1/3 days to the date of each eclipse, it will give the dates of all the four eclipses in the year 1899. It was this rule which enabled the ancient astronomers to predict the recurrence of eclipses, at a time when the motions of the moon were not understood nearly so well as they now are.

At that point objections and questions became general and exceedingly difficult. Probably we gave some ground. There was, as we remember it, the admission that there were times in which a spanking might seem a very tempting solution of a difficult problem, although we did qualify it by urging that no moral interpretation be introduced into the punishment. We once knew a mother who used to say, \"Gladys, you have been a bad girl, and so to-morrow at half-past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> I'm going to spank you.\" That pose of cool and calm deliberation, of even-handed justice, of godlike inflexibility, has always seemed to us unbecoming in a parent. If he spanks a child he ought to be frank enough to say that he does it because he is angry and can't think up anything better. However, it is probable that we were too much flustered to develop our position at any great length. We felt uncomfortably as if we had agreed to talk to a G. A. R.

She generally spent the summer at Saint Cloud and the winter at the Tuileries. At Saint Cloud, where the park was a great attraction to her, she slept in a room on the first floor, which had been occupied by Marie Antoinette and Josephine. (In the time of Napoleon III. it was the Council Hall of the Ministers.) At the Tuileries, her rooms were on the ground floor, between the Pavilion of the...", "...is intolerable.\" \"Vile,\" snapped Mrs. Butler, in response.

The theory of Gama, that the intercalation was still more exact, namely, 12-1/2 days instead of 13, seems to be erroneous. Our reckoning only became more exact than this when we adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, and the people marched about the streets in procession, crying \"Give us back our <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days!\" Perhaps this is not quite a fair way of putting the case, however, for the new style would have been adopted in our country long before, had it not been a Romish institution.

At fifteen he could write Greek verse, and his tutor once remarked, \"That boy could harangue an Athenian mob better than you or I could address an English one.\" He lost his father at the age of seven, and his mother seems to have given little personal attention to him.

The locomotive must stand no more than fourteen or sixteen feet high and from nine to <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet wide; in length the problem only meets the genius of the designer. But it is altogether possible that the limit of the size of the locomotive would have been reached long ago if it had not been for the coming of the air-brake. This most important assurance of the safety of the railroad passenger came into its being in 1869, when George Westinghouse, its inventor, was permitted to try it on a Panhandle train. From the beginning of railroads the necessity for brakes was...", "...dinner progressed, something more deferential than the mere civility of a guest to a host, something which implied his acceptance of Mr. Collingwood as a man to be considered. It was, on the whole, a most successful dinner.

When, at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, they all walked down to the beach with the Commissioner and the Captain, regrets and good-byes were as hearty as they would have been if the acquaintance had been of long duration. As he was pulled out to the steamer, the Commissioner remembered that, on the way down, Barton had given him a hint of an odd situation, to which he had paid but a cursory attention. Well it was for the old gossip that he was safe ashore under the tent. \"But I'll have it out of him going...", "...whose ancestors lived in one of these historic homes, tells me that the Southern matrons were great housekeepers, and these white wood walls were thoroughly scrubbed at least three times yearly, from top to bottom. In Part II of the history of the Carters of Virginia, we read that the duties of Robert Carter as councillor brought him to Williamsburg for a part of the year, and in 1761 he moved, with his family, from \"Nomini Hall\" to the little Virginia capital, where he lived for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years. We know, from the invoices sent to London, how the Councillor's home in the city was furnished. The first parlor was bright with crimson-colored paper; the second had hangings ornamented by large green leaves on a white ground; and the third, the best parlor, was decorated with a finer grade of paper, the ground blue, with large yellow flowers.

In none of the pure Italian forms are lines ending in _agudos_ or _esdrujulos_ permissible. (1) The _redondilla mayor_ consists of four 8-syllable lines with the rime-scheme _abba_ (pp. 149, 167), or, less commonly, _abab_ (p. 136). It is a common and characteristic Spanish meter. The _redondilla menor_ has the same form expressed in lines of less than eight syllables. The same rime-schemes are found with lines of seven or of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> (pp. 117, 207) syllables, and with combinations of eleven and seven (p. 134), or eleven and five (p. 86) syllables; but they are not properly called _redondillas_. (2) The _quintilla_ is a 5-line strophe, usually of 8-syllable lines. Only two rimes are used in one stanza, and not more than two lines having the same rime should stand together (pp. 26, 114). _Quintillas_ are sometimes written with lines of other lengths.

It was seven in the evening when the removal to the Temple took place; and then there was so much disputing about where the family should be accommodated, whether in the tower of the building or another part of it, that poor Louis, though overcome with sleep, had to sit up while his father and mother supped.

SECOND NIGHT When the next night drew on the actions of the boy were almost enough to show that he was thinking of the meeting he had witnessed, and of the promise wrung from the lady that she would come there again. As far as the sheep-tending arrangements were concerned, to-night was but a repetition of the foregoing one. Between ten and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock the old shepherd withdrew as usual for what sleep at home he might chance to get without interruption, making up the other necessary hours of rest at some time during the day; the boy was left alone. The frost was the same as on the night before, except perhaps that it was a little more severe. The moon shone as usual, except that it was three- quarters of an hour later in its course; and the boy's condition was much the same, except that he felt no sleepiness...", "...The words were not much, but they were uttered in the old kind voice; they rung in my ears all the evening, and I went to bed happier than I ever thought I could have been after such a day. CHAPTER XXI. The Sunday at Scamperley, I am sorry to say, was hardly observed with that degree of respect and strictness which is due to the one sacred day of the week. Very few people went to morning service, as indeed the late hours overnight kept most of us in our rooms till <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> or twelve o'clock, when we dawdled down to a breakfast that seemed to lengthen itself out till luncheon-time. To be sure, when the latter meal had been discussed, and we had marked our reverence for the day by a conversation in which we expressed our disapproval of the personal appearance, faults and foibles, and general character of our friends, some of us would declare an intention of attending afternoon church; on which subject much discussion would arise, and the...", "...sheriffs' fines, no less than sixteen individuals being mulcted for refusing to serve as sheriff in less than two months.(400) It was no difficult task to find men unwilling to serve such a thankless office at so critical a time.

Few of its members could have served in the last parliament of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years before, but although so long a time had elapsed since the Commons had met, they had not forgotten their old constitutional claims to have the country's grievances redressed before proceeding to grant supplies. An offer to relinquish ship money proved insufficient, and after three weeks the \"short parliament\" was dissolved (5 May, 1640). (M157) For some days before parliament was dissolved every effort had been made by the king to get the mayor and aldermen to lend him...", "...she was received with delight. She was the most beautiful young lady at the ball, and the Prince would dance with no one else. But she made haste to leave before the hour fixed and had time to undress before her sisters came home. They told her a beautiful Princess had been at the ball, with whom the Prince was delighted. They did not know it was Cinderella herself. Three times Cinderella went to royal balls in this manner, but the third time she forgot the Fairy's command, and heard <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock strike. She darted out of the ball-room and ran down stairs in a great hurry. But her dress all turned to rags before she left the palace and she lost one of her glass slippers. The Prince sought for her everywhere, but the guard said no one had passed the gate but a poor beggar girl. However, the prince found the slipper, and in order to discover where Cinderella was gone, he had it proclaimed that he would marry the lady who could put on the glass slipper.

In October I took account of expenditures for machinery, grass seed, and fertilizer, and found that I had invested $833. I had also, at an expense of $850, built a large shed or tool-house for farm implements. It is one of the rules at Four Oaks to grease and house all tools when not in actual use. I believe the observation of this rule has paid for the shed. In October 1896 I had a good offer for my town house, and accepted it. I had purchased the property <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years before for $22,000, but, as it was in bad condition, I had at once spent $9000 on it and the stable. I sold it for $34,000, with the understanding that I could occupy it for the balance of the year if I wished. After selling the house, I calculated the cost of the elementary necessities, food and shelter, which I had been willing to pay during many years of residence in the city. The record ran about like this:-- Interest at 5% on house valued at $34,000 $1700.00...", "...feasts.

As a matter of course, their playing soon showed the effects of all this tippling. One man particularly, one of the flageolets, became quite unmanageable,--or rather the instrument on which he was performing,--so that it usually was the space of a second or two ahead of the others.

A formation such as this plainly indicated that at some remote epoch Cape Bon had been connected with Cape Furina, the extremity of Sicily, in the same manner as Ceuta has doubtless been connected with Gibraltar. Lieutenant Procope was too well acquainted with the Mediterranean to be unaware of this peculiarity, and would not lose the opportunity of ascertaining whether the submarine ridge...", "...sire; for I have spent forty years in continual study, thirty of which have given me much experience in matters of justice and legal pleading, and this is well known in Mexico. If the records of the past be examined in the Council, it will be seen that in the ten or twelve months while I was fiscal of that royal Audiencia I accomplished more than did my predecessors for twenty years. Besides all this, I am a man of good repute. I was an advocate for the Inquisition during more than <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years, namely, from the time when your Majesty established it in Mexico. My uncles and the relatives of Dona Maria de Sandoval, my wife, won Nueva Espana, as can be seen by the records of the royal Council of the Yndias; and no one is more worthy to receive the remuneration for his services than are my wife and I. By virtue of a decree ordering me to remove my entire family and household, the royal exchequer of Mexico lent me for the space of two years two thousand pesos to aid...", "...alone with you.\" He bent toward her, as he sat behind the tea table. \"You know how vital this is to me, don't you?\" he said. \"You're not going to cut me off, are you?\" He stood over her, big, compelling, dominant, and put his hand under her chin. \"I am insane about you,\" he whispered, and waited. Slowly, irresistibly, she lifted her face to his kiss.

He went for two reasons. First, after his initial call at the dreary little house, he began to realize that something had to be done in the Boyd family. The second reason was his dog. He began to realize that something had to be done in the Boyd family as soon as he had met Mrs. Boyd. \"I don't know what's come over the children,\" Mrs. Boyd said, fretfully. She sat rocking persistently in the dreary little parlor. Her chair...", "...at once issued an invitation to visit it. \"You come over some time and I'll show you some stock that'll open your eyes.

You wouldn't think to look at me that the doctors came mighty near giving me up ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years ago, eh? Did, though. That was just after I finished college. They said the only thing would save me was hiking out to Colorado or Arizona or New Mexico. Some said one place and some said another. Seeing that they couldn't decide, I settled the question myself. Came out here, bought ten acres of land--I've got nearly forty now--and lived in a tent one Summer while my house was building. Doctors said it wouldn't do, but I fooled them. Slept out of doors every night, worked...", "...an incomparable era in the history of the United States. Despite the loss of life on the part of both North and South the Republic steadily gained in population for the entire period, at the rate of nearly a million each year; and each year there was added to the permanent wealth of the people $1,500,000,000;--a fact made all the more surprising when it is remembered that they were at the same time burdened with the interest on the National debt, of which they discharged more than <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hundred millions of dollars of the principal within the period named. Such progress is not only unprecedented but phenomenal. It could not have been made except under wise laws, honestly and impartially administered. It could not have been made except under an industrial system which stimulated enterprise, quickened capital, assured to labor its just reward. It could not have been made under the narrowing policy which assumes the sovereignty of the _State_. It required...", "...before they were back, and had five nice fat fowl, which they proceeded at once to dress for us, and by the time we had finished our supper, which we greatly relished, the fowl were ready, the feathers burned, and the floor carefully swept, so that every trace of the transaction was removed. I had a silver quarter in my pocket which I gave to aunty, and which she received with profuse expressions of joy and gratitude. We staid with them until eleven o'clock, and although we only walked <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> miles after that, I was completely used up the next morning when we went into camp again. I cooked three of the chickens that day, and we eat one for dinner and one for supper. That night we walked twenty miles on the railroad, crossing four long iron covered bridges, and went into camp in a large piece of woods some distance back from the railroad, as daylight again warned us to seek shelter.

Mr. Lenthal was suspected of being poisoned with the Anne Hutchinson heresies, and he also \"opposed the way of gathering churches.\" Hence his ordination over the church in the new settlement was bitterly opposed by the Boston divines, though apparently desired by the Weymouth congregation. One Britton, who was friendly towards Lenthal and who spoke \"reproachfully\" and slurringly of a book which defended the course of the Boston churches, was whipped with <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> stripes, as he had no money to pay the imposed fine. John Smythe, who \"got hands to a blank\" (which was either canvassing for signatures to a proxy vote in favor of Lenthal or obtaining signatures to an instrument declaring against the design of the churches), for thus \"combining to hinder the orderly gathering\" of the Weymouth church at this time, was fined L2. Edward Sylvester for the same offence was fined and disfranchised. Ambrose Martin, another friend of Lenthal's, for...", "...head from behind with a rattle. In the midst of the \"scrap\" that followed this graceful rebuke, which two unmounted members of the Blackhampton Constabulary regarded from a strategic distance with the utmost detachment, a cry of \"'Ere they come!\" was loosed from at least thirty-five thousand throats, and such a roar rent the heavens as must have disturbed Zeus considerably just as he was settling down for the afternoon. \"Play up, Rovers!\" Blackhampton might well be proud of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> wearers of the chocolate and blue. A finer-looking set of warriors would have been hard to find. And it did not lessen the pride of their friends that among the eleven only the goalkeeper could claim to be representing the place of his birth. \"Play up, Sailor!\" The slender, handsome boy, looking rather fine-drawn, but with something of the turn of limb of a thoroughbred racehorse, came into the goal and was duly greeted by his admirers. \"'E plays for England,\"...", "...choose, in obedience to the higher law, to set aside, temporarily, the ordinary judicial procedure, it would serve as a warning and an example to the vicious elements of the community, of the swift and terrible punishment which would fall, like the judgment of God, upon any one who laid sacrilegious hands upon white womanhood.

At Lewiston, Maine, the fall in the Androscoggin River is about fifty feet; its systematic development was commenced about 1845, and with the improvement of the large natural reservoirs at the head waters of the river, now in progress, it is expected that a minimum power, during the usual working hours, of about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> thousand horse power will be obtained. At Birmingham, Connecticut, the Housatonic Water Co. have developed the water power of the Housatonic River by a dam, giving twenty-two feet fall, furnishing at a minimum about one thousand horse power during the usual working hours.

None were ever paid their arrears of wages, the king being with difficulty made to find L10 towards the passage money of the doctor.

James was very sick. About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock witness helped undress him and put him to bed, and about half-past one he was called up by Mrs. James Wilson. Next morning the news came that Smith had got a licking. Mrs. Henry Wilson's testimony was a confirmation of her husband's, and was the last given on Wednesday. More evidence was promised for the next day, and the court adjourned till the following morning at ten o'clock. The first witness on Thursday was Peter McGettrick, Canadian Pacific Railway agent at...", "...dinner there was a slight fit of solemnity, which I soon dissipated by taking up my work as usual. The Prince thanked me cordially for doing so. Then every one grouped and arranged themselves naturally. A little later M. de Talleyrand took his usual evening walk, and when he came back he found Lady Clanricarde, the Prince, Henry Greville and me playing whist gaily together. Music was playing in the vestibule, and in a word the ice was broken. After tea the Prince vanished, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> everybody went to bed. _Valencay, October 28, 1834._--Here is an account of yesterday. After breakfast M. le Duc d'Orleans went over the Chateau and its immediate neighbourhood, my son and I acting as his guides. All our guests who had not already seen what there is to see followed.

Next morning I got M. Bono to give me a bill of exchange on M. Querini's order, and at dinner-time Marcoline handed it over to her new protector, who wrote her a formal receipt. M. Morosini gave me the letters he had promised, and their departure was fixed for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock the next day. The reader may imagine that our dinner-party was not over gay. Marcoline was depressed, I as gloomy as a splenetic Englishman, and between us we made the feast more like a funeral than a meeting of friends.

The loss of Ciudad Rodrigo was a stunning blow to the French. They could not understand it at all. Herrasti and his Spaniards had held out the place a month against Ney and Massena, with thirty or forty thousand veterans, and that in fine weather, a great advantage to the besiegers--in <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days, and in the depth of winter, Wellington reduced it, with twenty thousand men and opposed by a French garrison. The contrast was great, and quite inexplicable to the French. \"On the 16th,\" wrote Marmont to Berthier, \"the English batteries opened their fire at a great distance. On the 19th the place was taken by storm, and fell into the power of the enemy. There is something so incomprehensible in this event, that I allow myself no observation.

Without any service at all, therefore, save what may have been rendered by the tears and muttered words of those who stood by, the coffin was deposited, about three o'clock in the afternoon, in the vacant space in the vault. A kind of scarf or scroll of lead, about five inches broad, had been soldered to it, bearing this inscription in capital letters: \"KING CHARLES, 1648.\" At the time of his death, King Charles was forty-eight years, two months, and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days old, and he had reigned twenty-three years and ten months.

The lord-mayor however received warning from the privy-council to look well to his charge, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> the gates were closed and strongly guarded. The earl, though a good deal disconcerted at observing no preparations for joining him, made his way to the house of sheriff Smith; but this officer slipped out at his back door and hastened to the lord-mayor for instructions.

It was a glorious night, with a moon and bright stars, the sky and the water looked a deep dark blue, and from vessels here and there lights shone out that sent twisting, flickering reflections into the harbor.

The building at present contains <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> apartments, among which are two large parlors, wherein, twice a month, there is a social gathering of the church and congregation, for conversation with the pastor and with one another. Perhaps, by and by, these will be always open, so as to furnish club conveniences to young men who have no home. Doubtless, this fine social organization is destined to development in many directions not yet contemplated.

Mr. Brent, however, had an Air-Tumbler (not short-faced) which had in both wings eleven primaries. Mr. Corker, the eminent breeder of prize Carriers, assures me that some of his birds had <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> primaries in both wings. I have seen eleven in one wing in two Pouters. I have been assured by three fanciers that they have seen twelve in Scanderoons; but as Neumeister asserts that in the allied Florence Runt the middle flight-feather is often double, the number twelve may have been caused by two of the ten primaries having each two shafts to a single feather. The secondary wing-feathers are difficult to count, but the number seems to vary from...", "...camera outfit. So it happened that, one evening after supper, Jack and Hal, carrying their outfit, set out on a walk of more than two miles. They had secured an order to go to a wealthy man's summer \"cottage,\" as the great, handsome pile was called, there to make some flashlight photographs of some of the large, expensively furnished rooms. Time flew, and the owner of the cottage caused many delays by wishing furniture shifted about before the photographs were made. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock at night when the two submarine boys left the cottage to tramp back to Dunhaven. As they neared the village they heard the town clock striking midnight. That was the only sound they could hear besides the movement of their own feet. Dunhaven was wrapped in sound slumber. Their way led the boys close to Farnum's boatyard. As they came around a corner of the fence, Hal, who was slightly in the lead, stepped back quickly, treading on his friend's toes. \"Sh!\"...", "...nor a thorn, nor a bramble; but a FIG-TREE.

This mood was interrupted by an imperative communication from Stephen--he must be in the other's office at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock to-morrow. Nothing more definite was said; but Jasper Penny was not wholly surprised to see Essie Scofield huddled in a chair at the lawyer's table. She had made an attempt at the bravado of apparel, but it had evidently failed midway; her hair hung loosely about a damp brow, the strings of her bonnet were in disarray, a shawl partially hid a bodice wrongly fastened. Her face was apathetic, with leaden shadows and dark lips ceaselessly twisting, now drawn into a petulant...", "...'But you are their equal; you are not obliged to get your living by teaching.

Lucina laid her to rest in the same cemetery of Generosa, by the side of her brothers. This touching story is related in contemporary documents. Pope Damasus, who in his younger days had been notary and stenographer of the church of Rome, and was acquainted with every detail of the last persecution, raised a small oratory to the memory of the three martyrs, and sanctified the ground which for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> centuries had been the seat of the worship of the Dea Dia. The chapel lasted until the pontificate of Leo II., when it became evident that the only way of saving the remains of Beatrix, Simplicius, and Faustinus from profanation and robbery, was to remove them from a place so conspicuous for many miles around, and directly in the path of pirates and invaders from the sea, and to place them under the protection of the city walls. The translation took place in 682; the bodies...", "...think I could put it?\" \"I don't know.\" said the captain, as soon as he understood. \"That's what I'm curious about.

Why not own up the truth before you scald yourself?\" Instead of going upstairs the charwoman went to the back door and sat on the step to get her breath, and, giving way to a sense of humour which had survived the two husbands and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> children, wound up with a strong fit of hysterics. Captain Sellers, who watched through the window as she was being taken away, said that perhaps it was his fault for putting temptation in her way. Mrs. Chinnery tried to keep her door fast next morning, but it was of no use. The captain was in and out all day, and, having found a tin of green paint and a brush among his stores, required constant watching.

Then, when her youngest child, a boy, was barely a year old, the blow fell.

Now, though old Mr Derwent was still living, the only close sympathy and affection she could count upon was that of her little girls, Blanche and Anastasia, <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> and nine years of age respectively, when this first and grievous sorrow overtook them. For some months Mrs Derwent was almost totally crushed by her loss. Then by degrees her spirits revived. Her nature was not a very remarkable one, but it was eminently healthy and therefore elastic.

And her life, both as...", "...of the revolution_.\" Three days after, that is, on the last day of May, 1821, followed the victory of Doliana, in which the Kihaya, anxious to recover his lost ground, was encountered by Nikitas. The circumstances were peculiarly brilliant. For the Turkish general had between two and three thousand men, besides artillery; whereas Nikitas at first sustained the attack in thirteen barricaded houses, with no more than ninety-six soldiers, and thirty armed peasants. After a resistance of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hours, he was supported by seven hundred men; and in the end he defeated the Kihaya with a very considerable loss. These actions raised the enthusiasm of the Morea to a high point; and in the mean time other parts of Greece had joined in the revolt.

The insurgents first appeared near Livadia, one of the best cities in northern Greece. On the thirteenth, they...", "...a mast and sail to the motor-boat.

I have said that we all more or less joined in my mother's fishing mania at Weybridge; but my sister, then a girl of about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years, never had any liking for it, which she attributed to the fact that my mother often employed her to bait the hook for her. My sister's \"tender-hefted\" nature was horribly disgusted and pained by this process, but my own belief is that had she inherited the propensity to catch fish, even that would not have destroyed it in her. I am not myself a cruel or hardhearted woman (though I have the hunter's passion very strongly), and invariably baited my own hook, in spite of the...", "...Kitty put on a suit of Andy Buckton's clothes.

The French allowed him to do so without any serious opposition. Inactivity so utter caused General von Kettler the suspicion that the main body of the enemy had probably withdrawn by Auxonne to the support of the Army of the East, and he determined to bring it back on Dijon by a renewed attack. On the 23rd at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, by a flank march along the enemy's front, after his advanced guard had routed a detachment of Gardes-Mobiles, he reached the farm of Valmy on the Langres road, and advanced with his two batteries against the walled and strongly-held village of Pouilly.

The result was that it was all they could do not merely to hold their own, but to avoid a very serious disaster. The movements of De la Rey were directed towards turning the right of the position. On February 9th and 10th the mounted patrols, principally the Tasmanians, the Australians, and the Inniskillings, came in contact with the Boers, and some skirmishing ensued, with no heavy loss upon either side. A British patrol was surrounded and lost <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> prisoners, Tasmanians and Guides. On the 12th the Boer turning movement developed itself, and our position on the right at Slingersfontein was strongly attacked. The key of the British position at this point was a kopje held by three companies of the 2nd Worcester Regiment. Upon this the Boers made a fierce onslaught, but were as fiercely repelled.

He was by this time one-third owner in the business of Charles L. Webster & Co., as well as its general manager. The business had been drained of its capital one way and another-partly by the publication of unprofitable books; partly by the earlier demands of the typesetter, but more than all by the manufacturing cost and agents' commissions demanded by L. A. L.; that is to say, the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> large volumes constituting the Library of American Literature, which Webster had undertaken to place in a million American homes. There was plenty of sale for it--indeed, that was just the trouble; for it was sold on payments--small monthly payments--while the cost of manufacture and the liberal agents' commissions were cash items, and it would require a considerable period before the dribble of collections would swell into a tide large enough to satisfy the steady outflow of...", "...Togo opened the battle by sending the following signal from the _Satsuma_: \"To-day must avenge Kanagawa. As Commodore Perry then knocked with his sword at the gate of Nippon, so will we to-day burst open San Francisco's Golden Gate.\"[1] The signal was greeted with enthusiasm and loud cries of \"_Banzai_!\" on board all the ships. Then the battle began, and by the time the sun had reached its zenith, Admiral Perry's squadron had disappeared in the waves of the Pacific. The first <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> minutes, before the Americans could bring their guns into action, had determined the outcome of the battle. The ultimate outcome of the battle had, of course, been accelerated by the fact that the first shells had created such fearful havoc in the fore-parts of three of the American ships, quantities of water pouring in which caused the ships to list and made it necessary to fill the compartments on the opposite side in order to restore the equilibrium.

The crop has had to last thirteen months and a half. The present crop will have to last only <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months, or less. The crop of barley, last year, was so very bad; so very small; and the crop of the year before so very bad in quality that wheat was malted, last year, in great quantities, instead of barley.

These too were carried before halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce their advance guards. But it was not without loss on both sides. This movement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one we occupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had occupied up to this time. The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the other way. During the following night they were made strong. We lost in this preliminary action about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hundred killed and wounded, while the enemy probably lost quite as heavily, including the prisoners that were captured. With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up from Missionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended the fighting for the first day.

This child was well muffled up in a pair of man's trousers, but he did not get them from his father, and a woman's chemise, but he did not get it from his mother. Some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father and a mother.

The thrust of the polygonal frames is resisted by wrought-iron tie-bars at the level of the roadway beams. All the tie-rods in this bridge are double, with one bar on each side of the timbers, to avoid the necessity of making large bolt-holes.[90] The viaduct at Newport consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> spans with queen trusses, resting on piles. The main span, over the river Usk, is 100 feet, and was constructed with timber trusses very similar to those at Landore. Shortly before it was finished, the viaduct was burnt down.

The first land explorer of the territory now called Queensland, was, in point of time, Allan Cunningham, botanist, explorer, and collector for the Royal Gardens at Kew, who arrived in New South Wales in 1816. After many journeyings on sea along the coasts of Australia, and inland to the Liverpool Plains through the Blue Mountains, he left the Hunter River in 1827 with a party of six men and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> horses, discovering the Darling Downs, and thus opening the way to settlement in Queensland. He named Canning Downs on this trip, and returned the same year. In the following year, 1828, he went by sea to Brisbane, and connected that port with the Darling Downs by discovering a gap in the coast range, still known as Cunningham's Gap. He spent most of his life collecting and exploring, and died at the early age of 48 in Sydney.

Anacreon had a reputation as a composer of hymns, as well as of those bacchanalian and amatory lyrics which are commonly associated with his name. Two short hymns to Artemis and Dionysus, consisting of eight and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> lines respectively, stand first amongst his few undisputed remains, as printed by recent editors. But pagan hymns, especially when addressed to such deities as Aphrodite, Eros and Dionysus, are not so very unlike what we call ``Anacreontic'' poetry as to make the contrast of style as great as the word might seem to imply. The tone of Anacreon's lyric effusions has probably led to an unjust estimate, by both ancients and moderns, of the poet's personal character.

The country is nearly similar to that of Port Desire, but perhaps rather more sterile. One day a party accompanied Captain Fitz Roy on a long walk round the head of the harbour. We were <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hours without tasting any water, and some of the party were quite exhausted.

As the two divisions of the enemy advanced, Kirk threw forward the Forty-fourth Illinois to support the skirmish line, and called on Willich's brigade for help. This brigade being without an immediate commander, no effort was made to support Kirk. The contest was too unequal to be maintained for any great length of time, and Johnson's division, after a sharp and spirited but fruitless contest, crumbling to pieces, was driven back with a loss of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> guns. Kirk was mortally wounded and Willich was captured, returning to his command as it was driven back. Kirk's brigade lost 473 killed and wounded, and had 342 captured. Willich's brigade had a few less killed and wounded, but more than twice that number captured.

Our traps contained shrews of two species, meadow voles, Asiatic white-footed mice, spiny mice, rats, squirrels, and tree shrews. The small mammals were exceedingly abundant and easy to catch, but after the first day we began to have difficulty with the natives who stole our traps. We usually marked them with a bit of cotton, and the boys would follow an entire line down a...", "...cried Dick. \"That problem is solved.\" The wireless apparatus was brought out, the small balloon inflated, and it carried aloft the aerials.

In justification of the method pursued, I may say that it is not only the method generally followed by chronologists, but it is the method authorized by the Bible. See 2 Kings xvii, 1; 2 Kings xvii, 6. Also 1 Kings xv, 9, 10; 2 Chron. xvi, 13. Its adoption simplifies the form without increasing the number of solutions. To reconcile other discrepancies, some Bible chronologists have assumed an interregnum of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years between the reigns of Jeroboam II. and Zachariah, and another of nine years between Pekah and Hosea. The language of the Bible utterly precludes these assumptions. \"And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel, and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead\" (2 Kings xiv, 29). \"And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead\" (2 Kings xv, 30).

It had, apparently, not 'been cool'd a long age in _that_ deep-delved earth,' but it did very well. I was perfectly happy. This old-fashioned _al fresco_ entertainment had the local colour which I look for when I travel and which is getting rarer year by year. Our Colosseum moonlight was more weird than ever. At <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> we had our moon. It was a large, battered, woeful, waning old moon, that looked in at us through the broken arch.

In that year, 1850, there were six hundred and eighty-one wrecks: the loss of life was about seven hundred and eighty-four, including a crew of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> men, whose boat upset one stormy November night, they having put off to the assistance of a vessel in distress. It was evident that the life-boat system was not sufficiently developed or general, and there was, moreover, no universally approved model of a boat in which all boatmen might have confidence; this latter consideration was especially brought before the notice of the public by an accident which occurred to the Newcastle life-boat, the sad particulars of which are...", "...delightful on a summer afternoon, of that hovering softness, half-cloud, half-sun, which the London sky has the patent of.

For years past the house had led on the cricket and football field and off it.

Other houses had their ups and downs, were very good one year and very bad the next; but Seymour's had always managed to maintain a steady level of excellence.

To give an idea of the numbers of fish and the extent of the fishing, in a few words, we may state the fact that, in 1834, one shoal of great depth, and nearly a mile broad, extended from Hayle River to St. Ives, a distance of two and a half miles. A seine was shot into this mass, and 3,600 hogsheads were carried to the curing cellars. As there are 3,000 pilchards in each hogshead, the catch amounted to nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> million fish! The value of these might be 3 pounds a hogshead, and the clear profit about 1 pound a hogshead, so that it is no wonder we hear of fortunes having been made in a few hauls of the pilchard seines. At the same time, losses are sometimes very heavy, owing to gales arising and breaking or carrying away the nets. Such facts, combined with the uncertainty of the arrival or continuance of the fish on any particular part of the coast, tend to induce that spirit of...", "...brevity data as to temperature, respiration and the like.

The expedition was intrusted to Fernando Cortez, a man peculiarly well calculated by his courage, his perseverance, and other qualities, for an enterprise like this, full of danger and difficulty. The expedition consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> vessels and six hundred and seventeen men. The object was to make war upon a monarch whose dominions were more extensive than all the kingdoms subject to the Spanish crown. Arriving at the island of Cozumel, Cortez had there the good fortune to redeem Aguilar, a Spaniard, who had been eight years a prisoner among the Indians, and who proved extremely useful as an interpreter. In March, 1519, Cortez landed in Tabasco, a southern province of Mexico, where, though the Indians met...", "...the State, and Venice, under his rule, was one of the Great Powers of Europe--as the league of Cambrai formed against him sufficiently shows.

In his capacity of State painter to the Republic it was Bellini's duty to execute the official portraits of the Doges. During his long life he saw no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> Doges, and was State painter during the reigns of four. This, however, is the only portrait of a Doge by Bellini which has been preserved (Richter's _Lectures on the National Gallery_, p. 42).

What if the girl's eyes should be permanently injured? The mere thought of such a catastrophe horrified him. In the morning he bathed his eyes again, as Doctor Borden had directed. He had been excused from his classroom, and so sat around where he could readily be called to the telephone if any message came in for him.

Nevertheless, it might have been noticed that he glanced at the clock every few minutes, and grew more and more fidgety. It was after <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> when Elsie came in. She hurriedly and with some confusion apologized for being so late, and thanked the Captain for sitting up for her. She made no offer to explain her long absence and, as she went upstairs, Captain Eri noticed that her face was, if anything, paler than when she went out, and her eyes looked as if she had been crying.

Two rode in front with rifles unslung, leisurely scanning every bush which might shelter an enemy. The main body kept about fifty yards behind them, while a solitary horseman brought up the rear.

If, then, they are all messengers of the one Lord Christ, who would be so foolish as to say that so great a lord, in a matter of such great importance for the whole world, sends but one messenger, and he, in turn, sends other messengers of his own? Then St. Peter would have to be called, not a _Zwolfbote_ (one of the twelve messengers), but an only-messenger, and none of the others would remain _Zwolfboten_, but they would all be St. Peter's _Elfboten_ (i. e., his <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> messengers). But what is the custom at court? Is it not true that a lord has many messengers? Aye, when does it happen that many messengers are sent with the same message to one place, as now we have priest, bishop, archbishop and pope, all ruling over the same city, not to mention other tyrants, who shove in their rule somewhere between the rest?

With respect to the allied feeling of sympathy, this was clearly shown at six months and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days by his melancholy face, with the corners of his mouth well depressed, when his nurse pretended to cry. Jealousy was plainly exhibited when I fondled a large doll, and when I weighed his infant sister, he being then fifteen and one half months old.

During his college course, and later, he taught school several terms in order to increase his slender finances. He was admitted to the bar in Boston in 1805. For the next <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years, he practiced his profession in his native state. In 1812 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and at once took his place as one of the most prominent men of that body. In 1816 he removed to Boston; and in 1827 he was elected to the United States Senate, where he continued for twelve years.

The records show that in 1867 and 1868 133 members were received after examination and 80 by letter. In November, 1868, Mr. Lyle was deposed by Presbytery. He died in 1881. Edward Hopper came in 1868 and on June 29, 1869, he was installed as pastor. [Illustration: Edward Hopper] Mr. Hopper was born on February 17, 1816, graduating from Union Seminary in 1842. He was pastor at Greenville, N. Y., eight years, at Sag Harbor, L. I., <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years. After a short time at Plainfield, N. J., he accepted the call to New York. In 1871 Lafayette College conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on him. Dr. Hopper wrote a number of poems that were publisht in three volumes. During his Sea and Land ministry he was brought in contact with seamen and this finds expression in his later works taking character from life on the sea. Many of his verses have found place in Christian hymnology, notably such a lyric as \"Jesus,...", "...of the Army? That such self-reproaches for past mistakes, and such questionings as to the course of future duty, had become universal in the Army before the outbreak of the Second Civil War, is proved by very abundant evidence, but nowhere more strikingly than in the record of the famous Prayer- meeting of the Officers, with Cromwell among them, held at Windsor Castle in March or April 1648. Adjutant-general Allen, the writer of this record, had a vivid recollection of this meeting <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years afterwards, and could then look back upon it as an undoubted turning-point in the history of the Army and of the nation. At that time, he says, the Army was \"in a low, weak, divided, perplexed condition in all respects\" and there were even some who, in the prospect of the Scottish invasion and a new war at such vast odds, argued that the Army ought to resist no longer, but break up, and change the policy of collective action into one of individual passive endurance....", "...of that term, she was then to proceed down the coast to Pisco, or Nasca, where she would be certain to meet with Mr. Anson. The Commodore likewise ordered Lieutenant Suamarez who commanded the Centurion's prize, to keep company with Captain Saunders both to assist him in unloading the sloop, and also that, by spreading in their cruise, there might be less danger of any of the enemy's ships slipping by unobserved. These orders being despatched, the Centurion parted from them at <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> in the evening on the 27th of September, directing her course to the southward, with a view of cruising for some days to the windward of Valparaiso.

Seeing that all their attempts to appease the dragon were utterly fruitless, and being afraid to attack it in its lair, they finally implored Beowulf to deliver them as he had delivered the Danes, and to slay this oppressor, which was even worse than the terrible Grendel. Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and in spite of his advanced years Beowulf donned his armor once more. Accompanied by Wiglaf and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> of his bravest men, he then went out to seek the monster in its lair. At the entrance of the mountain gorge Beowulf bade his followers pause, and advancing alone to the monster's den, he boldly challenged it to come forth and begin the fray. A moment later the mountain shook as the monster rushed out breathing fire and flame, and Beowulf felt the first gust of its hot breath, even through his massive shield. \"First from his lair Shaking firm...", "...February we again commenced to plough for spring crops, while I had the happiness to behold the tender blade of my wheat and rye clothing a few acres with a beautiful green, pleasingly contrasted with the gray, wild, wormwood and other traits of our dreary solitude; while similar pleasing sights stretched away in the distance, marking the bounds of agriculture as possessed by my neighbors. _March 25th_--My oldest son Parley celebrated his birthday with a family party--being then <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years of age.

I reminded him that he was my first born--my heir, both to estate and priesthood.

I rehearsed to him my own...", "...I remember that supper! We put the untouched cake away in a sort of buffet, and poured the cold coffee out of the window, in order that the servants might not take offence at the apparent fancifulness of sending down for food I could not eat. I was so anxious for all to be in bed, that I told the footman who served that he need not wait to take away the plates and dishes, but might go to bed. Long after I thought the house was quiet, Amante, in her caution, made me wait. It was past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> before we set out, with cat-like steps and veiled light, along the passages, to go to my husband's room and steal my own letter, if it was indeed there; a fact about which Amante had become very uncertain in the progress of our discussion.

I mention this case of the ravine chiefly because without the evidence of the marine shells in the sand, any one would have supposed that it had been hollowed out by simple alluvial action. The escarpment of the fringe-like plain, which stretches for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> miles along the coast, is in some parts fronted by two or three narrow, step- formed terraces, one of which at Herradura Bay expands into a small plain. Its surface was there formed of gravel, cemented together by calcareous matter; and out of it I extracted the following recent shells, which are in a more perfect condition than those from the upper plain:-- 1.

For, the shoes that are made from ten hides are worth thirty raw hides, in consequence of the extra labor bestowed upon them; just as twenty tanned hides are worth thirty raw hides, on account of the tanner's labor. But if the shoemaker demands thirty-three in the farmer's product, or twenty-two in the tanner's, for ten in his own, there will be no exchange; for, if there were, the farmer and the tanner, after having paid the shoemaker ten for his labor, would have to pay <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> for that which they had themselves sold for ten,--which, of course, would be impossible.

Seth Warner was delighted at the honor conferred upon him by his chief. Ethan Allen had a reason for keeping as strong a garrison at Ticonderoga as possible, for he feared that Delaplace might try to escape and perhaps recapture the fort. Arnold was surly. He thought that Allen had lost confidence in him, but Allen reasoned the matter with his Connecticut hero, and satisfied him that no insult was intended.

Its very situation was, at that not remote day, a subject of conjecture to the good people of Maryland. There were many passes of approach for the Indian foe, beyond its range; and a few stockade forts erected by the settlers were the only retreats for their families in case of these sudden and frightful inroads. A more eligible defensive position was sought, therefore, on the Potomac, a few hundred yards from its bank, and ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> miles above the mouth of the Conococheague. On this spot was erected Fort Frederick, the only monument of ante-revolutionary times remaining in Western Maryland, every vestige of the fortification at Cumberland having disappeared.

For a brief sketch of Sublette see our volume xix, p. 221, note 55 (Gregg). General William Henry Ashley was born in Virginia in 1778. Soon after the beginning of the nineteenth century he went to Missouri, settling first at Ste. Genevieve, later in St. Louis, and embarking in various mercantile enterprises. In 1816-17 he surveyed in the state, and the knowledge thus obtained permitted him to make heavy investments for some...", "...concealed he walked along the hedge until he found a rack over it, which seemed to be well worn, leading down to the cottages below, and by this rack he curled himself up in the bushes, and waited. In a short time the village was dark and silent, for in those days oil-lamps were never seen in a cottage; and the Corporal found waiting rather cold work, but he had bivouacked on colder nights in the wars, and lay patiently in his place. A little after ten the moon rose, but it was full <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock before the Corporal heard the bushes rustle, and at last made out a man creeping cautiously alongside the hedge. Nearer and nearer he came, straight to the rack in the hedge, where after pausing for a moment to listen, he was beginning to scramble up; when the Corporal suddenly laid hold of his ankles, brought him sprawling down, rolled him into the hedge-trough, and was instantly on top of him, with his knee on his chest and his hand on his throat. The unfortunate...", "...in the North Sea 9 Though Zeppelins apparently had practically reached the end of their usefulness, a considerable increase took place in the number and extent of aeroplane raids, especially over England. A number of watering places on the southeast coast of England were raided on August 12, 1917. Twenty-five persons were killed, fifty-two injured, and two German machines were brought down. Dover, Margate, and Ramsgate were visited on August 22, 1917, killing <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> persons and injuring thirteen. Eight of the attacking machines failed to return home. The east coast was again raided on September 2, 1917. The following day, September 3, 1917, an English naval station at Chatham, near London, was bombed. One hundred and eight persons were killed and ninety-two wounded, most of them members of the English naval service. The first moonlight raid of London was carried out during the night of September 4-5, 1917. It resulted in the death of...", "...to know better.

Sir Richard Bingham was regarded as a humane man, but he feared the consequences should the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hundred prisoners collected at Galway be restored to health and strength. He had but a handful of troops under him, and had had the greatest difficulty in keeping down the Irish alone. With eleven hundred Spanish soldiers to aid them the task would be impossible, and accordingly he gave orders that all, with the exception of Don Lewis himself, and three or four other nobles, should be executed. The order was carried out; Don Lewis, with those spared, was sent under an escort to...", "...lights of the little post-village of Fairport, where we stopped for the night.

It was past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock when Mr. Gaskell left to return to New College; but the night was unusually warm, with a moon near the full, and John sat for some time in a cushioned window-seat before the open sash thinking over what he had heard about the music of Italy.

What's the matter?\" \"Are you the captain here?\" asked a red-haired, Roman-nosed man, as he stepped out of the group. \"There's matter enough....", "...place under the figure of Apollo. It was a present made by TITON DU TILLET. In another of these rooms, built on purpose, are a pair of globes of an extraordinary size, constructed, in 1683, by Father CORONELLI, a Jesuit, for Cardinal D'ESTREES, who presented them to Lewis XIV. The feet of these globes rest in a lower apartment; while their hemispheres project by two apertures made in the floor of fhe first story, and are thus placed within reach of the observer.

I saw that she was very uneasy. The meeting was not altogether a pleasant surprise for her; that was very evident. \"This place is more civilised than Tirnovo,\" I laughed. \"Since then I expect that you, like myself, have been travelling a good deal.\" \"Yes. We've been about quite a lot--to Vienna, Abbazia, Rome, and now to Palermo.\" \"And not yet to London?\" \"Oh! yes. We were at home exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days.

Although she spoke gently her tones, to adopt Mr. Lamb's word, were most \"impressive\". \"I believe that, unwittingly, she has delivered herself into my hands; that the duel which she and I are fighting has advanced another stage; that soon we shall be exchanging shots; and that then there will be but one of us two left to tell how it all fell out.\" CHAPTER XXIX MARGARET PAYS A CALL The next morning, between <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock and noon, Margaret went out visiting.

Her mind travelled back to the day on which she had been repulsed from Cuthbert Grahame's door; she endeavoured to recall what on that occasion she had worn.

What I want to know is, whether I am to be the captain of the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> or not. If I am to be nothing but a figurehead, why, I'd rather get out.\" It was an aggressive, almost brutal, manner of expressing himself, and it produced an uproar. \"Put him out!\" \"Make him resign!\" \"Tell him he has got to behave himself and make good!\" \"Boys! Young gentlemen! We must have quietness!\" cried Andrew Dale, raising his hand. And then he rapped for order. \"I'll resign!\" shouted Guy Frapley, when he could be heard. \"I don't want anything more to do...", "...fell there, some of which he had sent to Naples, weighing two ounces; and that stones of an ounce weight had fallen upon an estate of his, ten miles farther off.

Nothing could be more dismal than the appearance of Ottaiano after this eruption.

There will be eleven crowns gained.\" It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d'Artagnan's purse. The host had reckoned upon <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> days of confinement at a crown a day, but he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five o'clock d'Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help, asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother's recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively refusing the assistance of any...", "...\"All the more reason why I should not be daunted now,\" Zibeline insisted. When they arrived at the public square of the Cascades, in front of the Auteuil hippodrome, she paused a moment between the two lakes, uncertain which course to take.

The vast ground, enclosed on all sides by a fence, had been cleared, since early morning, of the boards covering the paths reserved for pedestrians on days when there was no racing; but it was only <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, and the place was not yet open to the paying public. Several workmen, in white blouses, went along the track, placing litters beside the obstacles where falls occurred most frequently. \"Do you think the gatekeeper will allow us to enter at this hour?\" Zibeline asked. \"I hope not!\" Henri replied. \"Well, then, I shall enter without his permission! You are free to declare me the winner. I shall be left to make a walkover, I see!\" And setting off at a gallop...", "...smashed their hats over other persons' heads.

The escorts themselves scarcely noticed the said pretty girls, for they were gazing down on the field--the field about which were scattered eleven players in blue, and <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> in dull red, all motionless now, amazed or joyful, according to their color, over the feat of Andy Blair.

Sybert took the lamp from the wall and bent over to look at him. 'Poor little devil! He looks as if he needed soup,' he muttered. The woman broke in shrilly again to say that he was <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years old and never brought in a single soldo. She slaved night and day to keep him fed, and she had children enough of her own to give to. 'Whose child is he?' Sybert demanded. 'He was my husband's,' the woman returned; 'and that husband is dead and I have a new one. The boy is in the way. I can't be expected to support him forever. It is time he was earning something for himself.' Marcia sat down on a low stool and drew the boy to her.

This action was in direct violation of a solemn agreement between the border settlers of State and Territory.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock she stepped on a shelter, and, being a heavy mule, came into the trench abruptly. This worried but did not hurt her, and she proceeded down the trench at a steady trot, bumping into the traverses. She met a ration party, and for the first time in their lives they took refuge over the top, for Ermyntrude was angry.

I handed in a composition, too, about the eclipse, but I don't think Miss Clark liked it as well as she did Anna's, because it had something in it about \"the beggarly elements of the world.\" She asked me where I got it...", "...XXXVII WILSON--THE LONE HAND It has often been said by certain gentlemen who were associated with President Wilson on the other side that he was unyielding and dogmatic, that he insisted upon playing a \"lone hand,\" that he was secretive and exclusive, and that he ignored the members of the Peace Commission and the experts who accompanied him to the Conference. Contrary to this criticism, after an uninterrupted, continuous, and most intimate association with him for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years, an association which brought me into close contact with him in the most delicate crises through which his administration and the nation passed, a time which threw upon the Chief Executive of the nation a task unparalleled in the history of the world, I wish to say that there is no franker or more open-minded man, nor one less dogmatic in his opinion than Woodrow Wilson.

It was conducted with good feeling on both sides, the nearest approach to personalities being in respect of Mr Gibson's using the argument that Bradlaugh \"stood alone,\" since \"at least <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> apostles of the Secularist party\" had left it within twenty years, Mrs Besant's being the only name given. Bradlaugh drily replied that he doubted whether the assertion was material to the question, but that if it were he could remind Mr Gibson \"that eleven apostles deserted _his_ founder in the sorest hour of his need.\" One bystander, not a Secularist, summed up the debate as a matter of Bradlaugh launching cannon-balls while his opponent spun cobwebs, a criticism partly...", "...six clean sea-shells in her globe, the gold-fish are more likely to keep healthy.

He advised Conrad Lyte to purchase this lot, for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> thousand dollars, though an appraisal on a basis of rents did not indicate its value as above nine thousand. The rents, declared Babbitt, were too low; and by waiting they could make Purdy come to their price. (This was Vision.) He had to bully Lyte into buying. His first act as agent for Lyte was to increase the rent of the battered store-building on the lot. The tenant said a number of rude things, but he paid.

There had been several attempts in this direction before, but none of them had succeeded in making any impression on the mass of the public. In 1843, Joseph Napoleon Ney, Prince of Moszkowa, founded in Paris a society for the performance of religious and classical vocal music. This society, which the Prince himself conducted in his own house, set itself to perform the vocal works of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.[221] [Footnote 221: It published, in <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> volumes, the ancient works that it performed. Before this experiment there had been the _Concerts historiques de Fetis_, preceded by lectures, which were inaugurated in 1832, and failed; and these were followed by Amedee Mereaux's _Concerts historiques_ in 1842-1844.] In 1853, Louis Niedermeyer founded in Paris an _Ecole de musique religieuse et classique_, which strove \"to form singers, organists, choir-masters, and composers of music, by the study of the classic works of...", "...fragrant bloom. _Monday, April 2nd_.--Before breakfast I took a stroll all round the place, with our host, to look at his numerous pets, which include spotted deer, monkeys, and all sorts of other creatures.

He was in the cricket <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> of his school--a good player and very fond of the game. It had become the custom at cricket suppers for bad talk to be indulged in.

The theatre was not entirely closed, however, in August. On the 18th of that month, Murphy and Mack's minstrels opened and continued until the 28th giving <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> performances. This was Joe Murphy's first visit to Salt Lake, when he was a black face artist, and before he had dreamed of becoming an Irish comedian. The fact of this company giving eleven performances in the theatre in August shows how very popular they were, and how Salt Lake liked minstrelsy. CHAPTER XIII. SEASON OF '69-70.

Believe me, the reputation that your service is permanent, like service under the Sircar, is worth many rupees a month in India.

Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire, an aged philosopher who had first taken part in politics when he helped to dethrone Charles X. in 1830. In September 1881 he categorically invited the British government to join France in a military intervention to oppose any interference which the Porte might attempt, and the two powers each sent a war-ship to Alexandria. On the 14th of November Gambetta formed his _grand ministere_, in which he was foreign minister. Though it lasted less than <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> weeks, important measures were taken by it, as Arabi had become under-secretary for war at Cairo, and was receiving secret encouragement from the sultan. On the 7th of January 1882, at the instance of Gambetta, a joint note was presented by the British and French consuls to the khedive, to the effect that their governments were resolved to maintain the _status quo_, Gambetta having designed this as a consecration of the Anglo-French alliance in the East. Thereupon the Porte...", "...hearts Penrod and Sam walked demurely yet almost boundingly; their faces were shining but grave--they were on their way to the Party! \"Look at there!\" said Penrod. \"There's Carlie Chitten!\" \"Where?\" Sam asked. \"'Cross the street. Haven't you got any eyes?\" \"Well, whyn't you say he was 'cross the street in the first place?\" Sam returned plaintively. \"Besides, he's so little you can't hardly see him.\" This was, of course, a violent exaggeration, though Master Chitten, not yet <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years old, was an inch or two short for his age. \"He's all dressed up,\" Sam added. \"I guess he must be invited.\" \"I bet he does sumpthing,\" said Penrod. \"I bet he does, too,\" Sam agreed. This was the extent of their comment upon the small person across the street; but, in spite of its non-committal character, the manner of both commentators seemed to indicate that they had just exchanged views upon an interesting and even curious subject. They walked along in silence for...", "...A revisal of the Constitution can be legally effected only by a Constituant Assembly called by three-fourths of the present Legislative Assembly; and a bill summoning a Constituant Assembly can only pass after three readings, with three months intervening between the readings; and then does not go into effect until two months after the last reading. Eleven months is therefore the shortest period in which the alteration can be effected, supposing not a day were lost in deliberation.

Major Shaw, the Brigade Major, did a fair amount of galloping that day, looking for water, and no doubt his pony, if he is still alive, has not forgotten the 5th of July. However, the next day compensated us for our hard work, as we had a short march of merely ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> miles, which, with a halt at mid-day for a couple of hours, brought us into camp about four o'clock. There is no doubt that, where troops are marching with a big convoy, it is a wise thing to give the infantry a rest of a couple of hours in the middle of the day, as it enables the convoy to close up, to water and feed, and to get a short rest too. Transport animals travel all the better after being watered and after having had a short rest, and it is a sound policy to do this,...", "...if we're going to hear the ghosts to-night,\" muttered Greg. \"No one knows that,\" Dick answered. \"But I think we'd better keep one fellow on guard when the rest go to bed. The guard can take a two hour trick. He can keep the fire going, and, if anything happens, he can warn the other fellows in turn.\" So, at nine o'clock, when the others turned in, Greg, the air rifle in one hand, paced softly up and down the cabin, watching, listening. But nothing happened during Greg's watch. At <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> he called Tom Reade to relieve him. Just before midnight the same wailings as on the night before started in again. Within sixty seconds all of the Grammar School boys were awake and listening. The wailings continued, and soon came the same sepulchral warnings of death approaching. \"Queer that the racket doesn't bother us the way it did last night, isn't it?\" smiled Dick Prescott. \"It's awful enough!\" shivered Hen Dutcher. But he was the only one in the cabin who was...", "...and solemnly. \"Will madame see him an instant?\" Between resignation and anticipation she said: \"Yes.\" \"It is well, madame,\" said the waiter, disappearing without a sound. She sat up and managed to drag her matinee from a chair and put it around her shoulders. Then she sank back from weakness, physical and spiritual. She hated to receive Chirac in a bedroom, and particularly in that bedroom. But the hotel had no public room except the dining-room, which began to be occupied after <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock. Moreover, she could not possibly get up. Yes, on the whole she was pleased to see Chirac. He was almost her only acquaintance, assuredly the only being whom she could by any stretch of meaning call a friend, in the whole of Europe. Gerald and she had wandered to and fro, skimming always over the real life of nations, and never penetrating into it. There was no place for them, because they had made none. With the exception of Chirac, whom an accident of business had...", "...policy. They covered the country with committees, recruited, it is true, from all sections of Nationalist Ireland. But it was inevitable that the element who distrusted Redmond, and whose distrust he reciprocated, should attain an influence out of all proportion to its following in the country. Government's action--and this sentence will run like a refrain through the rest of this book--contributed largely to strengthen the extremists and to weaken Redmond's hold on the people. During <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months the Ulster Volunteers had been drilling, had been importing arms, and no step was taken to interfere. Within ten days after the Irish Volunteer Force began to be enrolled, a proclamation (issued on December 4, 1913) prohibited the importation of military arms and ammunition into Ireland. A system of search was instituted. But the Ulstermen were already well supplied. Redmond was blamed for not forcing the withdrawal of the proclamation. He controlled the House of Commons,...", "...across the great portage. Our young adventurers saw with interest that a good many of the boatmen were quite young, boys of fifteen, sixteen, and eighteen years of age. Some of these latter did the full work of a man, and one slight chap of seventeen, with three sacks of flour, and another youth of his own weight on top of it all, stood for a time supporting a staggering weight of several hundred pounds while Jesse fumbled with his camera to make a picture of him.

He thence arose and went onward. As he looked, he saw in front three gourds. Then he saw a bamboo stick, which he took up. When the river was flooded It washed away a gourd tree, and its seed fell, and each stem produced bottle-gourds. He inserted a bamboo stick in the hollow of the gourd and made a guitar. He plucked two hairs from his head and strung it. He held a bow and fixed <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> keys to that one stick, and played on it. Lingo was much pleased in his mind. Holding it in his hand, he walked in the direction of the old man's field. He approached the fire where Rikad Gawadi was sleeping.

Of the exactitude of these references we cannot be certain, because they also state (2 Kings xviii. 2) that Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and this reduces us to the absurdity of supposing that Hezekiah was born when his father was only <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years old.[436] We might infer from Isa. iii. 4 that Ahaz was not so old as twenty when he succeeded Jotham; for there--in a terrible prophecy which can only refer to the beginning of this reign--we read, \"And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them\"; or, as it should be perhaps rendered, \"And with childishness, or wilfulness, shall they rule over them.\" Whatever may have been the king's age, surely never king succeeded to a more distracted...", "...ignorance, and consider them as your Heavenly Father does the _less_ culpable on this account, even when they do wrong things.

Marr occupied in the concerns of his shop, Mrs. Marr occupied with some little ailment and restlessness of her baby, had both forgotten the affair of supper; the time was now narrowing every moment, as regarded any variety of choice; and oysters were perhaps ordered as the likeliest article to be had at all, after twelve o'clock should have struck. And yet, upon this trivial circumstance depended Mary's life. Had she been sent abroad for supper at the ordinary time of ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, it is almost certain that she, the solitary member of the household who escaped from the exterminating tragedy, would _not_ have escaped; too surely she would have shared the general fate. It had now become necessary to be quick. Hastily, therefore, receiving money from Marr with a basket in her hand, but unbonneted, Mary tripped out of the shop. It became afterwards, on recollection, a heart-chilling remembrance to herself--that, precisely as she emerged from the...", "...of figuring in this holy drama was greatly coveted; and the historian of Dieppe gravely assures us, that the earnestness felt on the occasion mainly contributed to the preservation of that purity of manners and that genuine piety, which subsisted in this town longer than in any other of France!

I apprehend that this <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months theory originated in sections where there are no crops of buckwheat raised, or in small quantities. Clover generally fails in August, and May, or June, of another year comes round, before there is a sufficient yield to produce the brood.

At night the Council assembled and...", "...about 112-116 A.D.[111] Tacitus probably died soon after the publication of the _Annals_ (A.D. 115-7), as he did not live to write his contemplated works on the Augustan age and the reigns of Nerva and Trajan. _Hist._ i. 1, 'Quod si vita suppeditet, principatum divi Nervae et imperium Traiani ... senectuti seposui.' _Ann._ iii. 24, 'Cetera illius aetatis [Augusti] memorabo, si effectis in quae tetendi, plures ad curas vitam produxero.' Tacitus was on intimate terms with Pliny, <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> of whose letters are addressed to him.

In 1627 the first discovery of the south coast was made by the _Gulde Zeepard_, and the land then explored, extending from Cape Leeuwin to the Nuyts Archipelago, on the South Australian coast, was named after Peter Nuyts, then on board the ship on his way to Batavia, whence he was sent to Japan as ambassador from Holland. In the year 1628 a colonizing expedition of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> vessels left Holland for the Dutch East Indies. Among these ships was the _Batavia_, commanded by Francis Pelsart. A terrible storm destroyed ten of the fleet, and on June 4th, 1629, the _Batavia_ was driven ashore on the reef still known as Houtman's Abrolhos, which had been discovered and named by a Dutch East Indiaman some years earlier--probably by the commander of the _Leeuwin_, who discovered and named after his ship the cape at the south-west point of the continent. The...", "...over, it was to a very spacious and pleasant house that they welcomed the elder Mrs Stevenson when she returned to Samoa in 1893. The scrub still, however, required much clearing, and we find in _The Vailima Letters_ Mr Stevenson dividing his day into so many hours of literary work and so many hours of weeding! The day began early, and Mr Stevenson, after the first breakfast, did his literary work, until the sound of a conch summoned the family to a lunch, or second breakfast, about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock. After this there was rest and music till four, and then outdoor work or play, lawn-tennis being a very favourite pastime, and in the evening they had more music, and a game at cards. It was a simple, natural life, and one that made far more for health, mental and physical, to those whose constitutions suited the climate, than the bustle and the clamour of cities. Visitors, too, often came up the hill to Vailima, sometimes the residents in Apia, sometimes home friends or...", "...abroad. He, with many of his brother and sister Moravians, are my friends.

It was early in December and we were spending an extremely amusing evening. At about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, all the women folk having departed, one fellow came up to me and said: \"Say, Captain, we have a barrel of sherry in the cellar, would you like a glass?\" A small party had collected near me at the time, so we all descended to a sort of catacomb where a small barrel of sherry was enthroned. I took a glass and found it very dry, and not very nice. I was offered another but refused. It is difficult to refuse a drink offered by a good looking American boy, so finally I held...", "...the feast [of Christmas] the [feast of the] expectation of the delivery of our Lady was celebrated one week beforehand, and a daily mass of the Queen [i.e., of the Virgin] which a moderate number of persons attended. On the last day or the vigil of the feast, a pleasing, although simple Belen [99] was made at one side of the presbytery in which were placed the images of the Child, Mary, and Joseph. Christmas eve came, and at eleven o'clock the bells were rung loudly, and from half past <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> until twelve, a continual ringing of bells two at a time announced to the people that the mass called Gallo [100] was to be celebrated in memory of that holy hour in which the eternal Son of God the Father, made man in the most pure entrails of the Virgin Mary willed to be born on that poor and abandoned manger threshold [portal de Belen].

At ten minutes of eleven, he took a skycab to the fashionable apartment house where the Honorable Jon Senesin, son of the Prime Portfolio, made his home. The skycab deposited him on the roof at two minutes of eleven. The android doorman opened the entrance for him, and he took the drop chute down to the fifteenth floor. At precisely <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock, he was facing the announcer plate on Jon Senesin's door. [Illustration] Senesin opened the door. There was a queer look--half jubilant, half worried--on his face as he said: \"Come in, my lord, come in. Care for a drink?\" \"Don't mind if I do, Jon.

And he knew that at a quarter past eight he would summon his nerve and reach for his hat, and that his wife would deliver this speech in a querulous tone: \"Now, where are you going, I'd like to know, John Perkins?\" \"Thought I'd drop up to McCloskey's,\" he would answer, \"and play a game or two of pool with the fellows.\" Of late such had been John Perkins's habit. At ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> he would return. Sometimes Katy would be asleep; sometimes waiting up, ready to melt in the crucible of her ire a little more gold plating from the wrought steel chains of matrimony. For these things Cupid will have to answer when he stands at the bar of justice with his victims from the Frogmore flats. To-night John Perkins encountered a tremendous upheaval of the commonplace when he reached his door. No Katy was there with her affectionate, confectionate kiss.

Nothing about his father's demeanour or language had suggested insanity.

In numbers the graduating classes have steadily increased. The first class, that of 1858, consisted of two members, Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Cavanaugh, of Iowa City. Classes remained small, never exceeding five, until the close of the Civil war when the young men who had entered the service of their country, and who survived the war, returned to school. In 1867 <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> were graduated, and in 1869 the class numbered twenty-two. The last decade the graduating class from the college of liberal arts has averaged sixty.

From the half-stunned guard my brother learned that the nearest signal-box was at Llandulas, a mile away. He ran there at the top of his speed, and arrived in time to get the up Irish mail and all other traffic stopped. On his return my brother had a prolonged fainting fit, as the strain on his heart had been very great. It took the doctors over an hour to bring him round, and we all thought that he had died. I was <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years old at the time, and the shock of the collision, the sight of the burning coaches, the screams of the women, the wreckage, and my brother's narrow escape from death, affected me for some little while afterwards.

He was, however, fortunate in his new coachman, who was exceptionally civil and obliging, and eventually regained the position of the coach, which, although it kept up a furious pace of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> miles an hour, remained for years a prime favourite with the more dashing travellers along the road. This and the other crack coaches, which continued running until the Great Western Railway finally took them away on trucks, quite cut out the mails, which, from being the fastest coaches on the road, soon came to occupy a very middling position.

Nine feet at the highest portion of the back is a good height for an Indian male, and eight feet for the female, although occasionally they are considerably larger. There are hardly any elephants that measure ten feet in a direct perpendicular, although the mahouts pretend to fictitious heights by measuring with a tape or cord from the spine, including the curve of the body. As Jumbo was proved to have attained the height of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet although in captivity from infancy, it may be easily imagined that in a wild state the African elephant will attain twelve feet, or even more. I have myself seen many animals that would have exceeded this, although it would be impossible to estimate their height with accuracy.

Stupified and astonished at being informed so late he instantly ordered the royal Allemand regiment, which was at Stenay, to mount and follow him. The colonel of this regiment had received the previous evening orders to keep the horses saddled.

If you witnessed the game between the <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> of the Orphion Academy and the Oakdale Football Club, which decided the championship by a single point in favor of the former, you were thrilled by the sight of the half-back, who, at a critical point in the contest, burst through the group which thronged about him, and, with a clear field in front, made a superb run of fifty yards, never pausing until he stooped behind the goal-posts and made a touchdown.

It is from this fact that they derive the name of sea elephant. There is a considerable disparity in size between the adult male and female, the latter very rarely exceeding <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet, though we have seen a few twelve and thirteen feet long. The females have no snout development and some of them facially very much resemble a bull terrier. The adults are called bulls and cows, while, curiously enough, in the sealers' phrase, the offspring are referred to as pups. The places where large numbers of them gather together during the breeding season are known as rookeries! \"Rookery\" appears to me to be inapplicable to a herd of sea elephants, though \"pup\"...", "...new member brought into the cabinet. NAVAL SUCCESSES. The successes of the British fleets during this year were various, and very encouraging to the nation to persevere in the struggle. Operations were, indeed, naval and military, extended to the south of Italy and Sicily, Portugal, the Cape of Good Hope, the East and West Indies, and South America. At the close of the preceding year Admiral Villauruez, accompanied by Joseph Buonaparte, succeeded in escaping from port with <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> sail of the line, and a number of frigates. This fleet subsequently separated: five ships of the line, two frigates, and a corvette steered, under the command of Admiral Le Seigle, for St. Domingo; but they were attacked off Ocoa Bay by Admiral Sir T. Duckworth, and after a furious action three ships struck, while the other two were driven on shore and burnt; the smaller vessels escaped. The other squadron, under Villauruez, steered first to the coast of Brazil, and afterwards...", "...gables, which according to contemporary writers was an indication of an aristocratic building. The lodging of the empress was opposite to that of the emperor, and a covered way was built across the street to connect them.

The condition of the unpaved roads made them requisite, as these could not be crossed on foot with safety or cleanliness.

Feasts, tournaments, rejoicings, followed upon one another; time was not allowed to hang heavy upon the emperor's hands. But neither was he allowed to carry out his ulterior objects. With great politeness and fulsome flattery Charles was made to understand that the Hansa was sure of its own strength, and...", "...an American citizen cannot send a letter to him if he pays the postage, and in that letter he can give him his opinion.

And a fellow that had dug in the ground about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet and had found some rock with a little stain on it and had had the stain assayed, wanted to hear from home right off. He stayed there and dreamed about fortune, palaces, pictures, carriages, statues, and the whole future was simply an avenue of joy upon which he and his wife and the children would ride up and down. He wanted to write a letter right off. He wanted to tell the folks how he felt. Do you think that man would not sign a petition for another mail?

At a cross street in Friendship the lead car drew up, and flashlights were turned on a road map in the rear of the car. There...", "...The guns still looked frowningly from the fortifications, tents were standing; but the troops were all gone, and Yorktown was deserted. They carried off all their light artillery, nearly all their provisions and supplies, but left fifty-two heavy guns in the intrenchments.

General Magruder, by showing a bold front, with <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> thousand men at first, had held an army of a hundred thousand in check, and gained a month of valuable time for preparations for the defense of Richmond.

The brief article by Signor Gianandrea Mazzucato (in Grove's _Dictionary of Music and Musicians_) on Verdi is a valuable contribution to the subject, and is probably the best account of the _maestro_ contained in any dictionary. The last work it treats of, however, is _Aida_, and although it touches _Otello_ somewhat prophetically, it is necessarily silent about that greater work _Falstaff_. Ritter, in his _History of Music_ (1876), disposes of Verdi in less than <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> short lines; but a little more justice, in the way of space, is done to the famous Italian by Naumann in his large, comprehensive _History of Music_, since he devotes to Verdi nearly two whole pages out of over thirteen hundred! _Masters of Italian Music_ (R.A.

There should be two of them, and it used to be believed that the second was destroyed in 1512 when the Spanish troops sacked the town.

It is a most decorative panel, the motive being ribands and wreaths, among which there are <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> winged _putti_ of different sizes. At the top of the capital is a big baby in high-relief peeping over the edge; an exquisite fancy reminding us of the two inquisitive children clambering over the heraldic shields on the Pecci monument. On the base of the capital are two other _putti_ of equal charm, winged like the rest, and sedately looking outwards in either direction. The volutes of the bronze are decorated with other figures, less boyish and almost suggesting the touch of...", "...perfectly.

These rollers are of unequal diameter, the one being 4 feet, and the other 1 foot; but they are both of the same length, 1 foot 4 inches, and make fifty-six revolutions in a minute. By this arrangement it is found the seed is both better bruised and faster than when, as was formerly the case, the rollers were of the same diameter. A pair of rollers will crush 4-1/2 tons of seed in <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> hours, a quantity enough to keep two sets of hydraulic presses going. After the seed is crushed in this way, it is passed under a pair of edge stones. These stones weigh about seven tons, are 7 feet 6 inches in diameter and 17 inches broad, and make seventeen revolutions a minute. If of good quality, they will not require to be faced more than once in three years, and they will last from fifteen to twenty. They are fitted with two scrapers, one for raking the seed between the...", "...this bustling planet, must play all his guns on one point. A wavering aim, a faltering purpose, will have no place in the twentieth century. \"Mental shiftlessness\" is the cause of many a failure. The world is full of unsuccessful men who spend their lives letting empty buckets down into empty wells. As opposed to men of the latter class, what a sublime picture of determination and patience was that of Charles Goodyear, of New Haven, buried in poverty and struggling with hardships for <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> long years, to make India rubber of practical use! See him in prison for debt; pawning his clothes and his wife's jewelry to get a little money to buy food for his children, who were obliged to gather sticks in the field for fire. Observe the sublime courage and devotion to his idea, when he had no money to bury a dead child, and when his other five were near starvation; when his neighbors were harshly criticising him for his neglect of his family, and calling him insane. But,...", "...replied Patty, giggling. \"Curb your curiosity, stepmothery, for it won't be gratified.\" Nan laughed and went away, and Patty proceeded to select certain very pretty embroidered doilies and centrepieces,--two of each. These she laid carefully in a flat box, which she tied up into a neat parcel. Then she put on her plainest cloth suit, and a small, dark hat, and was ready to start. \"Nan,\" she said, looking in at the library door, \"what time do you want the motor?\" \"Oh, about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> or twelve. Keep it as long as you like.\" \"It's only ten now. I'll be back in less than an hour, I'm sure. Good-by.\" \"Good-by,\" returned Nan. \"Good luck to you!\" She thought Patty's scheme ridiculous, but harmless, for she knew the girl well enough to know she wouldn't do anything that might lead her into an unpleasant position; but she feared that her boundless enthusiasm would urge her on beyond the bounds of her nervous strength. Though soundly healthy, Patty was...", "...the purpose which the maker of dust had in mind, or in other words the use of dust. Similarly when things are endowed with life and their own purpose, as in asking, \"Why does the wind blow?\" Here the child thinks of nature's processes as if they were a kind of human action which we can understand by seeing into its aim. Here are some curious observations which seem to illustrate this childish idea of how nature's processes originate. A little girl whom we will call M., when one year <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months old, happened to be walking with her mother on a windy day. At first she was delighted at the strong boisterous wind, but then got tired and said: \"Wind make mamma's hair untidy, Babba (her own name) make mamma's hair tidy, _so wind not blow adain_ (again)\". About three weeks later the same child being out in the rain with her mother said: \"Mamma, dy (dry) Babba's hands, _so not rain any more_\". This little inquirer seems clearly to have conceived of the wind and rain as...", "...made her very fond of dress and gayety. She was devoted to a life of pleasure, and was hardly conscious that there was any thing else to live for. In fetes, balls, theaters, operas, and masquerades, she passed night after night. Such was the only occupation of her life. The king, on the contrary, had no taste for any of these amusements. Uncompanionable and retiring, he lived with his books, and in his workshop making trinkets for children. Always retiring to rest at the early hour of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock precisely, he left the queen to pursue her pleasures until the dawn of the morning, unattended by him. It was very imprudent in Maria Antoinette thus to expose herself to the whispers of calumny. She was young, inexperienced, and had no judicious advisers. One evening, she had been out in her carriage, and was returning at rather a late hour, the lady of the palace being with her, when her carriage broke down at her entrance into Paris. The queen and the duchess were...", "...definitive treaty of peace lay on the table at the time. Nine States were required by the Articles to be present when a treaty was ratified. Unless ratified within six months after it had been signed in Paris, it would be null and void. More than half the precious time had already elapsed. With the greatest difficulty, the required number was secured. Four years later, there was no quorum for a period of three months, the representation at times falling to two States. During the first <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> months of the year 1788, a quorum was present only 129 days. Much of this delinquency was due to the expense of maintaining the delegates which fell upon the individual States. To make the burden as light as possible, two delegates only were commonly sent. They were likely to disagree. Manifestly the State in which the Congress sat avoided this difficulty, because it could maintain a larger number of delegates at less expense. To avoid this draft upon the needy treasuries, some...", "...joined Prouty. He was smiling and seemed not at all put out. I fell back to ride with old man Horne. Hetty and Lafe were far in the lead, going at a long lope and beating the mule joyously with a rope-end when it lagged in its pace. She threw a flower at him and he caught it and stuck it inside the bosom of his shirt. Old man Horne departed at dawn on some cow business, and when his wife went to bed that night, she left injunctions that she was on no account to be disturbed before <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> in the morning. Yet at midnight she was wakened by a knock at her door. \"Wha-what--who's there?\" she cried. Mrs. Vining padded into the room in her bare feet and crawled into bed beside her friend, snuggling against her shoulder. It was black in the room and the older woman winked solemnly at the wall. She waited with patience for the other to speak her mind. \"I couldn't sleep,\" said Mrs. Vining. \"I could.\" \"Martha, I've been so catty.\" \"Yes, you have,\" said Mrs....", "...Mrs. Williams much pleased with the success she had met with, as she said she had not a doubt but Mr. Freeman would engage me when he knew it was one of his best customers that asked the favour. I was much pleased too, for, as I could not stay with Mrs. Williams, I did not venture to form a higher wish than to be engaged at Mr. Freeman's, for my spirits had been so much broken during my stay at Smith's that I no longer dared to indulge the hope of ever finding my father. About <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> o'clock my new friend, John Davis, came for me. Taking my little bundle under his arm, he conducted me to his cart. He lifted me in, and putting his horses into motion, we went shaking and rattling through the streets. This part of the journey was disagreeable enough; but when, at Knightsbridge, we entered the turnpike-road, then it began to be very pleasant.

St. Dunstan's clock was the fly in the ointment, for it boomed out intrusively the hour of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> just as my guests were beginning thoroughly to appreciate one another, and thereby carried the sun (with a minor paternal satellite) out of the firmament of my heaven.

Hofer alone remained. When, resolute in his determination not to abandon his native soil, he was on his way back to his dwelling, he encountered Speckbacher hurrying away in a carriage in the company of some Austrian officers. \"Wilt thou also desert thy country?\" was Hofer's sad demand. Buol, in order to cover his retreat, sent back <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> guns and nine hundred Bavarian prisoners to General Rusca, who continued to threaten the Pusterthal. In the mountains all was tranquil, and the advance of the French columns was totally unopposed. Hofer, concealed in a cavern amid the steep rocks overhanging his native vale, besought Heaven for aid, and, by his enthusiastic entreaties, succeeded in persuading the brave Capuchin, Joachim Haspinger, once more to quit the monastery of Seeben, whither he had retired. A conference...", "...fraternity and put them on the pay-roll. For weeks an average of at least one column of exciting Rawhide stampede news was published on the front pages of the big Coast dailies. The publicity campaign went merrily on. I kept close watch on the character of the news that was being sent out and was pleased in contemplating the fact that very little false coloring, if any, was resorted to. A boisterous mining-camp stampede, second only in intensity to the Klondike excitement of <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years before, was in progress, and there was plenty of live news to chronicle almost every day. After returning from one of my trips to Rawhide I became alarmed on reading on the front page of the leading San Francisco newspapers a harrowing two-column story about the manner in which Ed. Hoffman, mine superintendent of the Rawhide Coalition, had been waylaid the day before on a dark desert road and robbed of $10,000 in gold which he was carrying to the mines for the purpose...", "...in such hysterical humour, more blood will flow: for it is as with the Tiger in that; he has only to begin.

The country had thus been educated by the sages of the era of the Constitution in the belief that only an extraordinary occasion justified a resort to what, in the popular dislike of its character, had received the name of \"the one-man power.\" President Jackson, therefore, surprised the country and shocked conservative citizens by his frequent employment of this great prerogative. During his term he thwarted the wish and the expressed resolve of Congress no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> times on measures of great public consequence. Seven of these vetoes were of the kind which, during his Presidency, received the name of \"pocket-vetoes.\" In Madison's administration a bill which reached the President during the last ten days of the session failed by accident or inadvertence to receive the President's signature, and did not become a law.

The _Essex_ was a little frigate that had been built in the Revolution. It was not fit to fight with the larger British frigates, but with David Porter on its quarter-deck it was sure to make its mark. On the _Essex_ with him was a fine little midshipman, only <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> years old, who had been brought up in the Porter family. His name was David G. Farragut. I shall have a good story of him to tell you later on, for he grew up to be one of the bravest and greatest men in the American navy. On July 2, 1812, only two weeks after war was declared, Porter was off to sea in the _Essex_, on the hunt for prizes and glory. He got some prizes, but it was more than a month before he had a chance for glory.

The sea-fire glimmered on the rising net, glittered in the boat, and then, with an almost painful suddenness, snuffed out. \"They be so full as eggs,\" said John every minute or two, holding out fish to Tony, who felt them and answered, \"Iss, they'm no scanters [spawned or undersized fish]. _They_ bain't here alone.\" Nets inboard, we rowed a little east of another boat, to shoot a second time. John said, \"Hoist the sail, can't 'ee.\" Tony said, \"What's the need?\" Before <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> we were foul of the other boat's nets and had again to haul in. Tony puffed and panted with the double weight; John disentangled the mesh and swore. \"If we'd a-hoisted the sail...\" he grumbled. \"There wasn't no need if we'd a-pulled a bit farther.\" \"What's the good o' pulling yer arms out?\" \"I knowed where to go, on'y yu said we was far enough.\" \"No I didn't!\" \"S'thee think I don' know where to shute a fleet o' nets?\" \"Well, we'm foul, anyhow.\" \"I was herring...", "...(line 66), and taking the thirty palms as eighteen feet, we get twenty-six feet or so for half his height. The giants vary in bulk; whether they do so in height is not clear. We cannot be far mistaken if we assume them to stand from fifty to sixty feet high. Virgil and Dante must throw their heads well back to look up into the giant's face; and Virgil must raise his voice as he speaks.--With regard to the height of the cone it may be remarked that Murray's Handbook for Rome makes it <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet high; Gsell-Fels two and a half metres, or eight feet and three inches. It is so placed as to be difficult of measurement. [787] _Three Frisians_: Three very tall men, as Dante took Frisians to be, if standing one on the head of the other would not have reached his hair. [788] _Rafel, etc._: These words, like the opening line of the Seventh Canto, have, to no result, greatly exercised the ingenuity of scholars. From what follows it is clear that Dante meant them to be...", "...provided in the new National constitution. Where two associations exist in one State and will not unite, both are to be accepted as auxiliary societies. An earnest debate followed. Miss Anthony threw her influence strongly in favor of union and carried many with her, even those who openly expressed themselves that their judgment would be to continue the two societies. The vote was then taken on union, thirty voting for, <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> against. Miss Alice Stone Blackwell and Rev. Anna H. Shaw were present on behalf of the American Association, accepted the deviations from the propositions as presented by that association, and felt reasonably certain that it would endorse their action. [Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours for equal rights, Alice Stone Blackwell.\"] No one person contributed so much toward effecting the union of these two societies as Alice Stone Blackwell. On February 17,...", "...he perceived some dark object, which he could not clearly make out. It was too large for a man, he thought, and it remained motionless; and after gazing for several minutes he quietly mounted the five steps which led up to the platform. He then perceived that the object which had alarmed him was a rude sentry-box, with a cannon hard by; and, having ascertained that it was empty, he looked over and beheld the river flowing quietly through the fosse at the foot. The wall was about <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> feet in height, and he certainly would not have feared to leap. But noise was to be avoided; and, tying the end of the sheet to one of the trunnions of the cannon, the young adventurer let himself down by his hands as far as he could, and then dropped into the water. A slight splash was all the sound; but he sunk deep, and his feet touched the bottom. He rose again, however, and, thanking in heart the harsh angler who had first counselled him to learn to swim, he struck out for...", "...behind us but Harry, asking what was the matter. \"Matter enough for you to come along,\" said the Arkansan, and we went two and two, he and Gholson, Harry and I. We reached camp at sundown, and stopped to feed and rest our horses and to catch an hour's sleep. Gholson's fatigue was pitiful, but he ate like a wolf, slept, and awoke with but little fever. The Colonel kept him under his eye, forcing on him the honors of his own board, bed and bottle, and at nine we galloped again. Between <span class=\"clocktext\">eleven</span> and twelve the Colonel, Harry and I were in a dense wood, moving noiselessly toward a clearing brilliantly lighted by the moon. I was guide. A few rods back in the woods Gholson was holding our horses and with cocked revolver detaining a young mulatto woman from whom the Colonel had extorted the knowledge which had brought us to this spot. The clearing was fenced, but was full of autumn weeds. Near the two sides next us, tilted awry on its high basement pillars, loomed an old..."]
