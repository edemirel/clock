It is enough now to say that the periodical had a weekly stagnation--it will not do to call it a circulation--of only five or six thousand copies, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> half of them gratuitous, and it had netted an aggregate loss of many thousands of dollars to the several publishers who had successively made themselves its sponsors.

The floor was sanded, and the tables were covered with soiled cloths. However, Ben had learned already not to be fastidious, and he sat down and gave his order. A plate of roast beef and a cup of coffee were brought, according to his directions.

It was perhaps during these next months of her life that she most <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> approximated the Endbury notion of what she should be. She had yielded to Paul on the subject of the cook not only because of her timid distrust of her own inexperienced judgment but because of her intense reaction from the usual Endbury motto of \"Husbands, hands off!\" She had wanted Paul to be interested in the details of the house as she hoped to know and be interested in what concerned him, and when he showed his interest in a request she could not refuse it. She hoped...", "...a bread knife, in a struggle with my nurse.\" \"When was that?\" eagerly inquired John. For me, I said nothing. Already I guessed all.

As to what advancement was shown in the progress of women, I would emphatically answer that advancement was unmistakably apparent in every line of women's educational work--advancement not alone along old lines, but along new as well. One of the greatest steps forward made by woman in the last eleven years, since the Columbian Exposition, has been the throwing open to her of the doors of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of the old established men's colleges, giving her in every country, in every State, and in nearly every large town almost the same free and easy access to learning enjoyed by her brothers.

In vain the novelist or the painter studies archaeology, takes a journey to the Holy Land for his local colouring, reads up the records of the time, or works in museums.

For the modern novelist, like the ancient myth-maker, is necessarily the child of his time; his work takes the bent of his personal temperament, and is moulded by the environment of ideas and circumstances within which he lives. The Myth, the Romance, the Historic Novel, each in its successive period, did at least this service to later generations: they preserved and handed down to us the popular impressions, the figures or pictures of great...", "...much as you have, and he has hardly turned a hair.

Anyhow, I have been doing my best. Well, here goes!\" Harry laughed at his brother's theory for explaining why Jose had done more work than he had. He was himself by no means sorry that Dias had come to his assistance, and that his tree was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> ready to fall. Jose climbed it with the end of a long rope, which he secured to an upper bough. Dias then took the other end of the rope, crossed the torrent by the tree he had felled, and when Jose had come down and Harry had given a few more cuts with the axe, he was able to guide the tree in its fall almost directly across the stream. Then he took Bertie's tree in hand. In ten minutes this was lying beside the others. It took three hours' more work to cut off the branches and...", "...an anatomic standpoint. There is a specimen in St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London from a man of forty-four, who died of cerebral hemorrhage. He was well formed and had a beard and a full-sized penis. He was married, and it was stated that his wife had two children. The bladder and the internal organs of generation were those of a man in whom neither testis had descended into the scrotum, and in whom the uterus masculinus and vagina were developed to an unusual degree. The uterus, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as large as in the adult female, lay between the bladder and rectum, and was enclosed between two layers of peritoneum, to which, on either side of the uterus, were attached the testes. There was also shown in London the pelvic organs from a case of complex or vertical hermaphroditism occurring in a child of nine months who died from the effects of an operation for the radical cure of a right inguinal hernia. The external organs were those of a male with undescended testes. The...", "...stoop nor the shoulders be humped and set up till the collar of the coat was as high as the poll.

My brother succeeded in getting specie, principally in silver change, for the bills, and returned it to me in a few days. In the mean time, or shortly after, the bank had been sued, the bills discredited, and, in the end, proved <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> worthless. I determined not to use the money, except in the safest way; and therefore loaned it to Messrs. Parkman, in whom I had entire confidence.

I used it in my business, but took care to pay off the mortgage as soon as it would be received.

The stately bearing of Frederick, which he inherited from Barbarossa, the charm and refinement of his manners, and the generosity he exhibited towards all who were friendly to his claims, gradually increased the number of his supporters.

It appears that on the 16th March, 1810, an ancient gold ring, weighing 12 dwts., and bearing the initials \"W. S.,\" engraved in Roman characters, was found by a labourer's wife upon the surface of the mill-close adjoining Stratford churchyard, being the exact spot whereon Mr. Oldaker since erected his present residence. It had undoubtedly been lost a great many years, being <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> black; and, continues Mr. W.,-- \"Though I purchased it upon the same day, for 36s. (the current value of the _gold_), the woman had sufficient time to destroy the 'precious _aerugo_' by having it unnecessarily immersed in _aquafortis_, to ascertain and prove the metal, at a silversmith's shop, which consequently restored its original colour. It is of tolerably large dimensions, and evidently a gentleman's ring of Elizabeth's age. Similar seal-rings...", "...a portage. Even then we got a few bumps in running it, but arrived at the bottom all right. Now the scene changed; we were in a smaller and narrower part of the valley; buildings had entirely disappeared; there was nothing to be seen but gloomy pine forests and black-looking mountains: the weather also was quickly changing, and evidently intending to be wet and stormy; so we pushed on rapidly, one coasting on each side of the lake till we reached its further extremity, where Esau was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> swamped crossing the waves, as the wind began to blow harder every minute. Soon the rain was upon us, while we looked for a camping-ground but found none, as the shores were everywhere very swampy for a quarter of a mile inland. At length we came to a second rapid, where the natives have thrown a clumsy weir across for some unknown purpose, and here we found a fairly dry spot, made our portage in heavy rain and wind, with a great deal of groaning, misery, and brandy and water;...", "...table and approach Natalie. She seemed to know him; they exchanged a few sentences, and then, passing through a door, they left the tent together. I hurried after them as fast as the crowd of persons through which I had to make my way would allow me. On getting out of the tent I saw no signs either of Natalie or the stranger. They could not be far--they must have turned down one of the numerous sidepaths; and I darted in quest of them down the first I came to. I had run and walked over <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> half the grounds without finding them, when I met the general and his cousin, who, with looks of some suspicion, asked me if I had seen Natalie. I told them with whom I had last seen her; but my description of the stranger, although minute and accurate, did not enable the general to recognise in him any one of his acquaintance; and separating, we resumed our search in different directions with increased anxiety and redoubled care. While thus engaged, loud cries were suddenly...", "...never takes away all the comfort of his people at once, there is always some ray of light to cheer them.

It may be said to be one of the most difficult points in dramatic construction to decide when to bring the curtain down at the end of a play; and the fall of the drop at the end of each act offers nearly equal difficulties. Is there any guide to a solution of this question in the handling of well-known plays? If there is, let us endeavor to find it. The first thing to be remarked is that we cannot apply to Shakespeare for the information. The experience of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> three centuries in the acting of Shakespeare's plays has resulted in making the acting editions very different from the original plays in arrangement, in the suppression of whole scenes and acts, the substitution of others, the amalgamation of plays, the taking of all sorts of liberties with the action. Only in one thing do they remain at all times faithful to the original author, in the preservation, for the most part, of his language. Familiar instances will occur in the...", "...conquer the rebel, and soon afterwards die; both of which came to pass as might easily have been guessed. On the death of Theodosius, in 395, the Roman empire was again divided. Arcadius, his elder son, ruled Egypt and the East, while Honorius, the younger, held the West; and the reins of government at once passed from the ablest to the weakest hands. But the change was little felt in Egypt, which continued to be governed by the patriarch Theophilus, without the name but with very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the power of a prefect. He was a bold and wicked man, but as his religious opinions were for the Homoousians as against the Arians, and his political feelings were for the Egyptians as against the Greeks, he rallied to his government the chief strength of the province. As the pagans and Arians of Alexandria were no longer worthy of his enmity, he fanned into a flame a new quarrel which was then breaking out in the Egyptian church. The monks of Upper Egypt, who were mostly...", "...to ordinary rain and snows during an English winter. But it also shows that when the manure has been fermented for six months, and is then turned and left exposed to the rain of spring and summer, the loss is very considerable. The five tons (10,000 lbs.,) of fresh manure placed in a heap on the 3d of November, are reduced to 7,138 lbs. by the 30th of April. Of this 4,707 lbs. is water. By the 23d of August, the heap is reduced to 7,025 lbs., of which 5,304 lbs. is water. There is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 600 lbs. more water in the heap in August than in April. Of total nitrogen in the heap, there is 64.3 lbs. in the fresh manure, 63.9 lbs. in April, and only 46.3 lbs. in August. This is a great loss, and there is no compensating gain. We have seen that, when five tons of manure is fermented for six months, in winter, the nitrogen in the soluble organic matter is increased from 14.9 lbs. to 21.4 lbs. This is a decided advantage. But when the manure is kept for another six...", "...and took no notice whatever of either Redbud or Verty. \"Why, thank for the antlers, Verty!\" said the good-humored Squire. \"I saw Cloud, and knew you were here, but I had no idea that you had brought me the horns.\" And the Squire extended his hand to Verty, who took it with his old dreamy smile. \"I could have brought a common pair any day,\" he said, \"but I promised the best, and there they are.

Is it at all likely that these several gradations came to be established in two totally different ways,--some of them (though naturalists can't agree which) through natural variation, or other secondary cause, and some by original creation, without secondary cause? We have seen that the judicious Pictet answers such questions as Darwin would have him do, in affirming, that, in all probability, the <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> related species of two successive faunas were materially connected, and that contemporaneous species, similarly resembling each other, were not all created so, but have become so.

It is idle to attempt to prove the accuracy of statements made concerning one who has been dead <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a hundred years, but the story, although possessing no evidential value, is interesting as an almost unique specimen of the comprehensive and complicated prophetic ghost and clairvoyant story. These facts, which are well accredited, would seem to show that in the book of Job Elihu was not far wrong when he said, \"In slumberings upon the bed God openeth the ears of men and sealeth their destruction.\" Or, to quote from an author who uses more modern dialect, it justifies...", "...trenches, but the squadrons that followed could not come on with the same speed, and only a few horsemen, among whom was Francis Albert, Duke of Saxe Lauenburg, were able to keep up with the king. He rode directly to the place where his infantry were most closely pressed, and while he was reconnoitring the enemy's line for an exposed point of attack, the shortness of his sight unfortunately led him too close to their ranks. An imperial Gefreyter,--[A person exempt from watching duty, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> corresponding to the corporal.]--remarking that every one respectfully made way for him as he rode along, immediately ordered a musketeer to take aim at him. \"Fire at him yonder,\" said he, \"that must be a man of consequence.\" The soldier fired, and the king's left arm was shattered. At that moment his squadron came hurrying up, and a confused cry of \"the king bleeds! the king is shot!\" spread terror and consternation through all the ranks. \"It is nothing--follow me,\" cried the...", "...to the piano, unasked, and played a short, striking piece from memory. They asked her if she could sing; she answered by breaking into the charming old song \"Robin Adair;\" it was one of William Arkell's favourites, and he stood by enraptured, half bewildered with this pleasant inroad on their quiet routine of existence. \"You play, I am sure,\" she suddenly said to him. He had no wish to deny it, and took his flute from its case. He was a finished player. It is an instrument very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> forgotten now, but it never would have been forgotten had its players managed it as did William Arkell.

NASAL SINGING By raising the back of the tongue toward the soft palate and lowering the soft palate toward the tongue, we produce nasal sound, such as is heard in the pronunciation of the word \"hanger,\" for instance. The air is then expelled chiefly through the nose. The nasal sound can be much exaggerated--something that very rarely happens; it can be much neglected--something that very often happens. Certain it is that it is not <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> enough availed of. That is my own everyday experience. We Germans have only small opportunity to make the acquaintance of the nasal sound; we know it in only a few words: \"E_ng_el,\" \"la_ng_e,\" \"ma_ng_el,\" etc.,--always where _ng_ occurs before or after a vowel. The French, on the contrary, always sing and speak nasally, with the pillar of the fauces raised high, and not seldom exaggerate it. On account of the rounding up of the whole soft palate, which, through the power of...", "...\"You vill so lubb dee babba--it is such a pretty dear!\" I stood in a state of stupefaction for some time, but the dark-visaged visitors by no means shared my inactivity; they ran, and screamed, and bustled; trotted down stairs, jumped up again, and filled the whole passage; then the drawing-room; then the little bedroom behind it, with trunks, and bags, and band-boxes, and bird-cages full of parrots, and cloaks, and shawls; till at last, when I started from my trance--in doing which, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> let the baby fall--I found my whole house taken possession of, and the two women apparently as much at home as if they had lived with me twenty years. I unrolled the shawls and things from the baby's face. It was an infant about a year old, and opened its eyes as I was looking at it, and looked so wisely and sagaciously at me in return, that I could almost believe it knew as much of the proceeding as I did--and this it might very easily have done, without being a miracle of...", "...supplies to O'Neil, to be used against Inchiquin and Ormond, and O'Neil coining to the rescue of Coote, and raising for him the siege of Londonderry. Inchiquin, in rapid succession, took Drogheda, Trim, Dundalk, Newry, and then rapidly countermarched to join Ormond in besieging Dublin. At Rathmines, near the city, both generals were surprised and defeated by the Parliamentarians under Michael Jones. Between desertions, and killed and wounded, they lost, by their own account, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 3,000, and by the Puritan accounts, above 5,000 men. This action was the virtual close of Ormond's military career; he never after made head against the Parliamentary forces in open field.

British friends attempted to explain and to soothe, usually to their astonished discomfiture on receiving angry American replies.

Presently I came upon the carcass of an antelope, half-consumed, and I made up my mind to wait for the return of the lions. I hid myself among the boulders twenty paces from the prey.

It is because some of them only read a little of the squib I wrote and jumped to the conclusion that it was serious, and the rest did not read it at all, but heard of my agricultural venture at second-hand. Those cases I could not guard against, of course. To write a burlesque so wild that its pretended facts will not be accepted in perfect good faith by somebody, is very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> an impossible thing to do. It is because, in some instances, the reader is a person who never tries to deceive anybody himself, and therefore is not expecting any one to wantonly practise a deception upon him; and in this case the only person dishonoured is the man who wrote the burlesque. In other instances the \"nub\" or moral of the burlesque--if its object be to enforce a truth--escapes notice in the superior glare of something in the body of the burlesque itself. And very often this...", "...\"The master's eye does more than both his hands.\" The thrashing-machine is the ultimate test of the yield or cast of the wheat crop, and it seems to have something itself to say about it. For when the straw is short the cast is generally good, and _vice versa_.

Throughout the course of my farming the gloomy note of the machine was that which predominated, but in the spring of 1877, on the prospect of complications with Russia, when wheat rose to I think nearly 70s. a quarter, it was again a cheerful sound, for I had several ricks of the previous year's crop on hand.

At that time the holidays of the Church were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all that students could claim. There was no regular break in the lectures as now, and men remained for years at Oxford without thinking of visiting their homes.

Thus the main mass of the Germans sustained the same defeat as the detachments operating further to the north along the coast. The support which, according to the idea of the German General Staff, the attack on Ypres was to render to the coastal attack, was as futile as that attack itself had been.

By making a sloping bank to a certain height and then building a perpendicular wall upon it.--Now if the 1st of these constructions could be arranged, I have no doubt that it would be the best of all, because a sea does not _break_ against a perpendicular face, but recoils in an unbroken swell, merely making a slow quiet push at the wall, and not making a violent impact. But practically it is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> impossible. The 2nd construction makes the sea to break tremendously, but if the sloping surface be made of square stone put together with reasonable care there is not the smallest tendency to unseat these stones. This is the principle of construction of Plymouth Breakwater. In the 3rd construction, the slope makes the sea to break tremendously, and then it strikes the perpendicular face with the force of a battering ram: and therefore in my opinion this is the worst...", "...weeks following--so much as it was the injustice and cruelty that hurt sensitive, high-mettled Topsy.

The temptation to use colour with the key-block comes when one attempts to use the key-block for rendering light and shadow. Its use by the Japanese masters was generally for the descriptive expression of the contours of objects, ignoring entirely their shadows, or any effects of light and shade, unless a shadow happened occasionally to be an important part of the pattern of the design. Generally, as in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the landscape prints by Hiroshige, the line is descriptive or suggestive of essential form, not of effects in light and shade. If the key-block is used for light and shade, the question of relative tones and values of shadows arises, and these will be falsified unless a key-block is made for each separate plane or part of the design, and then there is danger of confusion or of compromises that are beyond the true scope of the work. It is generally safest to print the...", "...me with all the information which I could desire.

There is no doubt that the _Chesapeake_ was beaten at the guns before she was boarded. Had the ships not come together, the fight would have been longer, the loss greater, and more <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> equal; but the result would have been the same. Cooper says that the enemy entered with great caution, and so slowly that twenty resolute men could have repulsed him. It was no proof of caution for Captain Broke and his few followers to leap on board, unsupported, and then they only waited for the main body to come up; and no twenty men could have repulsed such boarders as followed Broke.

It may be observed in the first place that a revelation _must possess some distinctive character_. Even, if it should turn out that there is no such thing in reality at all, at least the notion which we form in our minds must possess such points of difference as to distinguish it from all other notions. It appears needful to bear this in mind, obvious though it is, because there are not a few, in the present day, who deprive the word, revelation, of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the distinguishing features which have commonly been supposed to attach to it, and so extend the meaning of the word inspiration as \"sometimes to believe it in poets, legislators, philosophers, and others gifted with high genius,\" (Essays and Reviews, p. 140).

But the minor triad, as an artistic and not purely acoustic phenomenon, is an inevitable thing.

Mr. Jahier, together with Dr. Tron, was in conference with us in New York, and the simple, Christian character and progressive educational ideas of the Waldensean teacher charmed and impressed us all. He went into the field and opened a school and Sunday-school at Valdese, as the colonists call their mountain village. The Rev. Enrico Vinay remained with the people for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a year, being in regular correspondence with the officers of this Association. He was then called to another field, and Rev. B. Soulier was chosen as their pastor. Mr. Soulier is also a native of Italy. He is a thoroughly educated young man, and speaks English readily.

Each was about the size of an ass, and not unlike one in colour,--especially that variety of the ass which is of a buff or fulvous tint. Their forms, however, were more graceful than that of the ass, though they were far from being light or slender. On the contrary, they were of a full, round, bold outline. They were singularly marked about the head and face.

Where they assemble peaceably there is no officer of the government and no court that can interfere with them; and when they petition the government they cannot be reprimanded or punished in any way.

As the ship came into the roadstead which served as a harbor, the town lay spread out before them: in the foreground, straggling along the beach and for some distance back, were the adobe houses of the inhabitants, about one hundred in number, most of them glittering white in the brilliant sunlight; among them, somewhat distant from the shore, was the huge, low building of the presidio, frowning out over the rest of the scene; beyond the houses, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two miles from the water, was the mission, a large group of buildings, from the midst of which rose the white two-towered Moorish church. Back of all was the long range of mountains, stretching off far into the north, in color a wonderful changing golden pink, streaked with palest blue-grey in the shadows. It was a perfect picture of peace, the sole hostile point in the whole being the presidio, which served but to accentuate the quiet beauty of the rest.

The correct form of this is: _We ought to stand bravely for our rights_. But we have found, also, that common usage breaks down the old rules and makes new rules and laws for itself, and so we frequently find the adverb placed between the infinitive and its sign. Sometimes it seems difficult to express our meaning accurately in any other way; for example, when we say: _To almost succeed is not enough_, we do not make the statement as forceful or as <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> expressive of our real idea, if we try to put the adverb _almost_ in any other position. This is also true in such phrases as _to far exceed_, _to more than counterbalance_, _to fully appreciate_, and various other examples which you will readily find in your reading. The purpose of written and spoken language is to express our ideas adequately and accurately. So we place our words in sentences to fulfill this purpose and not according to any stereotyped rule of grammarians....", "...to disembark. Of them all, only Leonid Plekhanov was unarmed.

They prefer to fire at 500 to 700 yards, which means that at this range the track or \"wake\" of a projectile would be discernible for, say, twenty-five to thirty seconds--not much time, indeed, for any ship to get out of the way. At 100 yards' range or less they do not care to fire unless compelled to, as the torpedo is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always discharged when the submarine is lying ahead of the object, _i. e._, to hit the ship coming up to it; it follows that a gun forward is more useful than one aft, the gun aft being of real service when a submarine starts shelling, which she will do for choice from aft the ship rather than from forward of her, where she would be in danger of being run over and rammed.

As the apartment had been flooded with water, and the fire <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> drowned out, this did not endanger the little vessel as it would have done a few minutes before, but the mate was none the less angry. \"Well, douse my to'-gallant top-lights,\" he growled, \"Here's a go.\" \"Wheeler,\" shouted the second lieutenant, from the deck, \"close that door at once.\" \"No words, now,\" said Peters, shaking his fist at Jackson, \"or you'll go overboard.\" \"We'll see about that.

To manoeuvre properly with the Rob Roy in such a case as this with the chain-boat required every vigilance, and strong exercise of muscular force, as well as caution and prompt decision, for I had sometimes to cling to the middle barge, then to drop back to the last, and always to keep off from the river-banks, the shoals, and the trees.

All were _voluntary_, all were _compensated_ for their labor. All were released from their regular labor <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> _one half of the days in each year_, all were furnished with stated _instruction_; none in either class were in any sense articles of _property_, all were regarded as _men_, with the rights, interests, hopes, and destinies of _men_.

For a small kitchen the range may be commended, because it occupies the least space, and does not heat a room as intensely as a stove, although it will heat water enough for kitchen and bath-room purposes for a large family.

There are these advantage of a stove over a set range: it requires less than half as much fuel and is more easily managed--that is, the fire can be more quickly started, and if it gets too low, more easily replenished and put in working order; and the ovens can be more quickly heated or cooled. But, although you can have a water-back and boiler...", "...men.

As soon as she was dressed, Mrs. Daviess \"commenced showing the Indians one article of clothing and then another, which pleased them very much; and in that way delayed them at the house <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two hours. In the mean time, the Indian who had been in pursuit of her husband returned, with his hands stained with poke berries, which he held up, and with some violent gestures and waving of his tomahawk, attempted to induce the belief, that the stain on his hands was the blood of her husband, and that he had killed him. She was enabled at once to discover the deception, and instead of producing any alarm on her part, she was satisfied that her husband had escaped...", "...Miss Rose was so vexed, and you were her dearest friend.'

If the surmise be correct the kestrel drops like a stone and seizes its quarry in its talons; if it sees nothing it sweeps away with a few easy movements of its powerful wings and hovers elsewhere. The only other bird of prey that hovers like the kestrel is the black-winged kite (_Elanus caerulus_). This is mainly white and so cannot be confounded with the kestrel. The explanation of the fact that one species of bird of prey leaves the plains in the hot weather, while a <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> related species remains, may perhaps be found in the nature of their food. Birds of prey are to a greater or lesser extent specialists; while quite ready to devour any small bird, reptile, or mammal which comes their way, they lay themselves out more especially to catch one particular species, and if that species migrates it follows that the bird that preys upon it will also migrate. Thus the peregrine falcon lays itself out to catch ducks and naturally goes with them to their...", "...Kerver. But these with the publications of Verard belong to another chapter.

I wish I could take the wings of a swallow and tell you them. You must supply gaps from your imagination. They were as odd a lot of tales as I ever heard--_drawled_ (oh so...", "...all their greatness, all their thousands of soldiers, would fall as quickly as this State had fallen, and even more quickly, if their citizens were to do what the citizens of this State had done; if the citizens of England had behaved towards the Crown as the burghers of this State had behaved to their Government, England would never have stood as long as she had, not even as long as this State had stood. This State owed obligations to other countries; they knew that the fire which had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> consumed this State would, if felt by them, very soon consume them also. * * * * * * * In several of the cities of Holland there were people who had subscribed for only one debenture, because they thought men of their own blood were living in South Africa.

That was built for Stella, wasn't it?\" \"Yes, but they're changing it here and there to fit me. Larry knows my work, too! That's luck again for little Enid.\" \"How long have you known Millard?\" In a flash I realized Kennedy's cleverness. This was the fact he had wished to unearth. The question was as natural as could be. He had led up to it deliberately. I was sure of that. \"Four, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> five years,\" she replied, unsuspiciously. Then suddenly she bit her lip, although her expression was well masked. \"That is,\" she added, somewhat lamely--\"that is, in a casual way, like nearly everyone knows nearly everyone else in the film game.\" \"Oh!\" murmured Kennedy, lapsing into silence.

It fluttered once, not markedly, then a black hand withdrew it. Only just in time, for even as it disappeared, the detective's head thrust itself out of a farther window. He was not looking for anything in particular, as far as I could tell--just observing the signals. But it gave me a strange thrill to think even now we were so <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> defeated. My next trouble was--would the train draw up at Dunbar? The 10 A.M. from King's Cross is not set down to stop there in Bradshaw, for no passengers are booked to or from the station by the day express; but I remembered from of old when I lived at Edinburgh, that it used always to wait about a minute for some engine-driver's purpose. This doubt filled me with fresh fear; did it draw up there still?--they have accelerated the service so much of late years, and abolished...", "...that he seemed determined to profit by. Shortly after the disappearance of the dog, I separated from my companion and took a different line of country. Large plains, with thorny jungles and bushes of the long cockspur thorn interspersed, formed the character of the ground. This place literally swarmed with peafowl, partridges, and deer. I killed another peacock, and the shot disturbed a herd of about sixty deer, who bounded over the plain till out of sight. I tracked up this herd for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a mile, when I observed them behind a large bush; some were lying down and others were standing. A buck and doe presently quitted the herd, and advancing a few paces from the bush they halted, and evidently winded me. I was screening myself behind a small tree, and the open ground between me and the game precluded the possibility of a nearer approach. It was a random distance for a deer, but I took a rest against the stem of the tree and fired at the buck as he stood with his...", "...while of late the capital has been held by comparatively few hands. In 1843, the greater portion of the traders were New Mexicans, several of whom, during the three years previous, had embarked in this trade, of which they bid fair to secure a monopoly. The amount of merchandise transported to Santa Fe each year, is set down at its probable cost in the Eastern cities of the United States. Besides freights and insurance to Independence, there has been an annual investment, averaging <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> twenty-five per cent. upon the cost of the stocks, in wagons, teams, provisions, hire of hands, &c., for transportation across the Prairies. A large portion of this remaining unconsumed, however, the ultimate loss on the outfit has not been more than half of the above amount. Instead of purchasing outfit, some traders prefer employing freighters, a number of whom are usually to be found on the frontier of Missouri, ready to transport goods to Santa Fe, at ten to twelve cents per...", "...at the seal. Underneath this layer, and set but lightly into the skin, is a short coat of very much finer hair known as the underpelt. When the skin is taken from the seal it is split by machinery into a lower and an upper layer. When so split the deep-seated pits of the long hairs are cut, and these hairs come out. The fine underpelt thus laid bare is what is commonly known as sealskin. Fashion has decreed that this must be dyed a rich brown, although when taken from the animal it is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> mouse gray. The birds have need for better clothing. To begin with, their blood is much warmer, and hence needs better protection from outside cold. In addition such of them as fly high must be prepared to stand great variations in temperature. For these purposes birds need a covering of the finest type. This clothing, in addition, must be extremely light because the creature must carry it into the air in flight. All of the requisite conditions are thoroughly met by the...", "...the world direct from one of those dens. Many of the details she gave were too horrible to be even hinted. On the strength of inducements now familiar, she went to work in a lumberman's hotel in the North. She went, accompanied by another girl, both believing the situation to be respectable. She and her companion were taken to a rough two story building, four and a half miles from Iron Mountain, in Wisconsin. The house was surrounded by a slab fence <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> twenty feet high, within which about the building was a cordon of bull dogs, thirteen in number, chained to iron stakes driven into the ground. She said, \"Scarcely a day passed that I was not knocked down and kicked. Several times when I was undressed for bed I was beaten with a rawhide on my bare back. There were always from eleven to thirty-two girls in the house and I did not fare a bit worse than the rest.

[Sidenote: Saturday, 15th.] The fog clearing away, and the wind moderating, we embarked about three in the morning of the 15th; and steering along the coast, came to a group of low sandy islands, that were separated by wide but very shallow channels, and skirted, to the distance of five or six miles, by sand-banks, which were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dry at low water. In rounding these banks our soundings varied from two feet to two fathoms, and we were occasionally led almost out of sight of the land. During the whole day we saw much ice to seaward, and in some places it was so closely packed as to render it doubtful whether a ship would have been able to make way through it. The line of deep water was marked by large masses of ice lying aground, and was about ten miles from the shore. As we could not reach the beach, we...", "...no change of expression. \"I don't mind,\" she said. \"When will you come?\" \"I get off early on Thursdays.\" They made arrangements. Mildred lived with an aunt at Herne Hill. The play began at eight so they must dine at seven. She proposed that he should meet her in the second-class waiting-room at Victoria Station. She showed no pleasure, but accepted the invitation as though she conferred a favour. Philip was vaguely irritated. LVII Philip arrived at Victoria Station <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> half an hour before the time which Mildred had appointed, and sat down in the second-class waiting-room. He waited and she did not come. He began to grow anxious, and walked into the station watching the incoming suburban trains; the hour which she had fixed passed, and still there was no sign of her. Philip was impatient. He went into the other waiting-rooms and looked at the people sitting in them. Suddenly his heart gave a great thud. \"There you are. I thought you were...", "...get carriages enough. I don't know about no places. Then you'll take breakfast at six, ma'am? You'll be called.\" With which she shewed Rotha into a bare little hotel room, lit a lamp, and left her. Rotha refreshed herself with cold water and put her hair in order. It must be half past three then. She went to the window, pulled up the shade and opened the sash and sat down. At half past three in the morning, when the season is no further advanced than May, the world is still <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dark. Yet two cocks were answering each other from different roosts in the neighbourhood, and announcing that morning was on its way. The sky gave little token yet, however; and the stars sparkled silently out of its dark depths. The rush and the roar of the train, and of life itself, seemed to be left behind; the air had the fresh sweetness which it never can have where human beings do greatly congregate; there was a spice in it which Rotha had not tasted for a long...", "...copyright royalties.

She was more cheerful than I had yet seen her, and she had changed her mournful garments to something a trifle less depressing. With her masses of fair hair dressed high, and her face slightly animated, I realized what I had not done before--that she was the wreck of a very beautiful woman. Frail as she was, almost shrinkingly timid in her manner, there were times when she drew up her tall figure in something like its former stateliness. She had beautiful eyebrows, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> black and perfectly penciled; they were almost incongruous in her colorless face. She was very weak; she used a cane when she walked, and after dinner, in the library, she was content to sit impassive, detached, propped with cushions, while Margery read to the boys in their night nursery and Edith embroidered. Fred had been fussing over a play for some time, and he had gone to read it to some manager or other. Edith was already spending the royalties. \"We could go a...", "...that night had she believed that either of her daughters would attain to thirty years unmarried. This may have been owing to a defect of education, or it may have been that she was so happily married to a husband six years her junior--whom she could manage. And she was nearly thirty when she was married herself and had really begun to believe that she should never be married at all. She believed marriage to be so honorable in all, that the absence of it, as in Miss Prudence's case, was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dishonorable. She was almost a Jewish mother in her reverence for marriage and joyfulness for the blessing of children. This may have been the result of her absorbed study of the Old Testament Scriptures. Marjorie had wondered why her mother in addressing the Lord had cried, \"O, Lord God of Israel,\" and instead of any other name nearer New Testament Christians, she would speak of him as \"The Holy One of Israel.\" Sometimes I have thought that Marjorie's mother began her religious...", "...If you put it up to me to decide, I say every time, go ahead!\" Merritt looked almost joyous. Though he was not a demonstrative fellow as a rule, he could not help reaching out and squeezing a hand of each of his faithful chums. Indeed, no one ever knew more reliable allies than Merritt possessed in Rob and Tubby, who were ready to go through fire and water with him, if necessary. \"It may all turn out for the best,\" Tubby continued, with fine optimism, such as these chubby fellows <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always show since life looks rosy to them. \"And it's going to save you a little money in the bargain, too, Merritt. I must brush up my French and Flemish from now on. Already I can say as many as six words of the first, and I think I know how to almost pronounce one in Flemish.\" \"No trouble to tell what that one is,\" remarked Rob, laughing. \"It stands for grub!\" added Merritt. \"Now, I consider it strange how you should guess so easily,\" Tubby shot back at them...", "...which Pelle knew better than all of them put together, and he would chime in with some correction. _Smack!_ came a box on his ears that would send him rolling into the corner; he was to hold his tongue until he was spoken to. But Pelle, who was all eyes and ears, and had been accustomed to discuss everything in heaven or earth with Father Lasse, could not learn to hold his tongue. Each exacted with a strong hand his quantum of respect, from the apprentices to the old master, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> bursting with professional pride in his handicraft; only Pelle had no claim to any respect whatever, but must pay tribute to all. The young master was the only one who did not press like a yoke on the youngster's neck. Easygoing as he was, he would disregard the journeyman and the rest, and at times he would plump himself down beside Pelle, who sat there feeling dreadfully small. Outside, when the sun was shining through the trees in a particular way, and a peculiar note came...", "...declared Hazel, decidedly. \"We'll just snatch a bite here and follow you at once. I couldn't enjoy a dinner till I know she is safe.\" And so, though both Jasper Kemp and her husband urged her otherwise, she would take a hasty meal by the way and hurry on. But Bud and Gardley waited not for others. They plunged wildly ahead. It seemed a long way to the eager hunters, from the place where Bud had found the handkerchief to the little note twisted around the red chessman. It was perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a mile, and both the riders had searched in all directions for some time before Gardley spied it. Eagerly he seized upon the note, recognizing the little red manikin with which he had whiled away an hour with Margaret during one of her visits at the camp. The note was written large and clear upon a sheet of writing-paper: \"I am Margaret Earle, school-teacher at Ashland. I am supposed to be traveling to Walpi, by way of Keams, to meet Mr. and Mrs. Brownleigh of Ganado. I am...", "...the attention paid in recent decades by the experimental psychologists to rhythm and metre, we are in a position to reach at least approximate clearness on this vexed point. Since the older theorists have mostly started either from the traditional conceptions of classical prosody or from examination of but a part of the phenomena, their work may be left out of account here. Certainly no great blame attaches to them; they are the Bacons and Harveys and Newtons of metrical science. A more <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> correct analysis of the facts is possible now because with the minutely accurate instruments of the scientists to aid us we need no longer trust to the uncertainties of perception and statement of separate individuals. Of course no one today holds the extreme belief that science explains everything; and of course the scientific experiments on the nature and effect of rhythm must have a starting point in the personal equations of those who have submitted themselves to the...", "...no hurry about it, is there?\" said a voice behind him; and Dan, jumping down, turned about, and with more shamefacedness than Shenac would have believed possible, met the offered hand of Angus Dhu. \"I heard you had come back again, Dan, lad; and I thought you would not let the grass grow under your feet.--Are you for putting my good rails in the creek, Hamish, man?\" Hamish was laughing too much at Dan's encounter to be able to answer at once. Shenac was laughing too; but she was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as shamefaced as Dan, remembering her own encounter on the same ground. \"If it is Allister you're thinking about, he's not here yet, and you need not be in a hurry. And as to whether the rails are yours or mine, when the goods are bought and paid for there need be no words about the string that ties them.

But he was hooked fast and flopping, and held quite tight by a very strong hook and gut, like a bull with a ring and a pole fastened to his nose. I got him out too--not a big fish, but about 1-1/2 lbs. This showed pretty clearly that where chub can be fished for \"silently, invisibly,\" they can still be caught, even though steam launches or row-boats are passing every ten minutes. This was mid-August; my next venture <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> realised the highest ambitions of a chub-fisher. It also showed the sad limitations of mere instinctive fishing aptitudes in the human being as contrasted with the mental and bodily resources of a fish with a deplorably low facial angle and a very poor _morale_. There was just one place on the river where it seemed possible to remain unseen yet to be able to drop a bait over a chub. A willow tree had fallen, and smashed through a willow _bush_. Its head stuck out like a feather...", "...Minister Stovall to make a verbal report on the situation of the Germans in France to Baron Romberg, the German Minister to Switzerland. I was much impressed in this my first touch with a German official. He is rather small, slim of body, but keen of mind, with excellent repose and control. Like all German diplomats, he speaks faultless English. A startling evidence of the efficiency of the German Information Bureau was furnished by the fact that he already knew to the minutest details <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as much about my work in Paris in caring for German subjects as did I myself. He spoke quite unreservedly about many matters but did not attempt to draw us into indiscretions as do so many foreign diplomats when dealing with younger men.

I want them to like me!\" \"Help yourself.\" Phyllis granted promptly. \"Not a bit of it.\" John contradicted her coolly. \"You must teach them to love you for yourself alone. Come on, kiddie.\" He tucked her hand under his arm and hurried her, laughing, down the drive. Phyllis ran after them with a too-late-remembered motor-veil, which she managed to convey into the car by the risky method of tying a stone in it and throwing the stone. It just missed John, and Joy <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fell out, turning to wave thanks for it. John threw his arm around her hastily to hold her in, and so Phyllis saw them out of sight. \"You needn't do that any more,\" observed Joy as they sped on. \"There's nobody can see us now.\" \"That, with most people,\" observed John amusedly, \"would be a reason for continuing to do it.\" \"M'm,\" said Joy in assent, as he removed his arm. \"You see,\" she went on rather apologetically, \"I never was engaged before, not even this much, and I...", "...I do not recollect ever having before seen so many negociations going on, within so short a distance. At West Woodhay my horse _cast a shoe_, and, as the road was abominably flinty, we were compelled to go at a snail's pace: and I should have gone crazy with impatience, had it not been for these ambassadors and ambassadresses of Cupid, to every pair of whom I said something or other. I began by asking the fellow _my road_; and, from the tone and manner of his answer, I could tell pretty <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> what prospect he had of success, and knew what to say to draw something from him. I had some famous sport with them, saying to them more than I should have said by daylight, and a great deal less than I should have said, if my horse had been in a condition to carry me away as swiftly as he did from Osmond Ricardo's terrific cross! \"There!\" exclaims Mrs. Scrip, the stock-jobber's young wife, to her old hobbling wittol of a spouse, \"You see, my love, that this mischievous man...", "...as his father's head was off, and of the vengeance Cromwell took. So it was inevitable that they should espouse the cause of James II against the Protestant William, whom the English had called over from the Netherlands to be their king. James came to Ireland to lead the rebellion, proved himself an idiot and a coward, and ended by running away and leaving the Irish to their fate. William's troops swept the country, took town after town and castle after castle, until Limerick remained <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the last stronghold in Irish hands. So William marched against it, at the head of 26,000 men, but the position was a very strong one, and that ablest of Irish generals, Patrick Sarsfield, was in command of the town, and William was beaten back. The next year another great army under General Ginkle marched against the place, first capturing Athlone, and so getting across the river. A terrific attack was concentrated on the fortress guarding the bridge, a breach was made, the fort...", "...the race. These discoveries providentially prevented hostilities, so that the 'Great War,' so long expected, never came, and the rival nations had their pains for nothing, or, rather, for others than themselves. \"Let us now examine the political and ethnological results. Hundreds of thousands, of the flower of Continental Europe were killed by overwork and short rations, and millions of desirable and often--unfortunately for us--undesirable people were driven to emigration, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of whom came to English-speaking territory, greatly increasing our productiveness and power. As, we have seen, the jealousy of the Continental powers for one another effectually prevented their extending their influence or protectorates to other continents, which jealousy was considerably aided by the small but destructive wars that did take place. High taxes also made it more difficult for the moneyed men to invest in colonizing or development companies, which are so...", "...files of the prisoners, consisting of twenty-four men, which I told off myself to divide from the rest, one of whom I took hold on.'] Winslow informed them that orders were orders, that this was not the time for parley, and commanded the troops to fix bayonets and advance. This appears to have had the effect desired, for, with the assistance of the commander, who pushed one of them along, twenty-four men started off and the rest followed. The road from the church to the ships, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a mile and a half in length, was lined by hundreds of women and children, who fell on their knees weeping and praying. Eighty soldiers conducted the procession, which moved but slowly. Some of the men sang, some wept, and others prayed.

The first Hibbert Lecturer was the celebrated Oxford professor, Max Mueller, in 1878. Among other lecturers may be named Renan of Paris in 1880; Kuenen of Leyden in 1882; Pfleiderer of Berlin, in 1885. The battle waged with great passionateness on both sides since 1869 for and against the removal of the Athanasian Creed, or at least its anathemas, from the liturgy has not yet been brought to any decided result. 5. _Protestant Dissenters in England._--Down <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> to the end of the eighteenth century all the enactments and restrictions of the Toleration Act of 1689 (\u00a7 155, 3) continued in full force. But in 1779 the obligation of Protestant dissenters to subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles was abolished, and the acknowledgment of the Bible as God's revealed word substituted. The right of founding schools of their own, hitherto denied them, was granted in 1798. In 1813 the Socinians were also included among the dissenters who should enjoy...", "...one of the many deep ravines along whose edge we were, when going down hill, whirled with startling speed. It was at these descents that the driver sought to pull up his lost time; and this he did with a recklessness of consequences that led me, after mature consideration, aided by the experience of much rough travel, to come to the following conclusion,--that, in crossing the Alleghany mountains, when the roads are rotten and slippery, the chances for and against a broken neck are so <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> equal that no sporting man, of any liberality, need desire to seek odds, should he feel inclined to make a bet before commencing the journey. We at times encountered a string of waggons at some narrow sharp turn of the corkscrew path, and were whirled by them, with our off-wheels curiously circling the unguarded ledge of a precipice some four or five hundred feet deep, where a wheel-horse suddenly jibbing, or a leader shying or falling, would, in all human probability, have...", "...to Asia, Middle East, Europe, and US; microwave radio relay to Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Yemen, and Sudan; coaxial cable to Kuwait and Jordan; satellite earth stations - 5 Intelsat (3 Atlantic Ocean and 2 Indian Ocean), 1 Arabsat, and 1 Inmarsat (Indian Ocean region) (2008) Senegal general assessment: good system with microwave radio relay, coaxial cable and fiber-optic cable in trunk system domestic: above-average urban system with a fiber-optic network; <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two-thirds of all fixed-line connections are in Dakar where a call-center industry is emerging; expansion of fixed-line services in rural areas needed; mobile-cellular service is expanding rapidly international: country code - 221; the SAT-3/WASC fiber optic cable provides connectivity to Europe and Asia while Atlantis-2 provides connectivity to South America; satellite earth station - 1 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2007) Serbia general assessment: replacements...", "...cause against the nations that surround them.

In this comfortable bedroom, amid flowers of chintz, was she not already more at home than she had ever been along the herbaceous borders of Clare? The fact was that her life at Clare had been a part sustained with infinite verve and accomplishment through many months, but always a part. Yes, it had been a part which she had sustained so brilliantly that she had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> ruined the well-mounted but not very brilliant play in which she had been performing. The dowager had been right when she had expressed her fears for the effect upon Tony of his wife's behavior. She had considered her warning as kindly, but quite unnecessary; she had even pitied the poor little beaver-like dowager for likening her own position with that rake of a husband to that which Dorothy occupied in respect of the son. But the dowager had been right. Herself had risked the...", "...only to articles of small size. The preservation of small objects in a flat vessel, the bottom of which is covered with glycerine, has the disadvantage that glycerine extracts organic substances and thus assumes a brown colour. If glycerine is used the object should undergo a thorough preliminary steeping, and the glycerine should be renewed until it remains colourless. Closed cylinders filled with glycerine or a mixture of glycerine and water are not convenient because wood <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always floats in the liquid. This may be remedied however by the addition of alcohol. JENNER'S METHOD[172].

They both held themselves silent, her lips still parted. Far off, they heard the rustle of skirts. Then the owner of the skirts appeared in the doorway, which she almost filled, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> concealing the figure of a very much smaller lady who accompanied her. \"My aunts!\" Katharine murmured, under her breath. Her tone had a hint of tragedy in it, but no less, Ralph thought, than the situation required.

But young Jack had already grown desperate, and he held his knife in his hand ready for an emergency. The jerk had sent the knife through the sack about two inches, and it prodded Barthes in the hand. \"Hullo!\" He yelled and drew back his hand \"What now?\" \"I've cut myself.\" \"Why, how on earth did you manage that?\" \"There's a knife sticking out of the sack.

It is of the thickness of a man's arm, and in length <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> five feet. Its outline is ragged. Its form resembles an umbrella closed, and without handle. This irregular mass advances slowly towards you. Suddenly it opens, and eight radii issue abruptly from around a face with two eyes.

Although <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two centuries have gone since he made his exit from the world, we can still picture him in his pride, towering a head higher than the tallest of his courtiers, swart of face, \"as if he had been born in Africa,\" with his black, close-curling hair, his bold, imperious eyes, his powerful, well-knit frame--\"the muscles and stature of a Goliath\"--a kingly figure, with majesty in every movement.

To do Mr Arnold justice, the three classes are, if not very philosophically defined, very impartially and amusingly rallied, the rallier taking up that part of humble Philistine conscious of his own weaknesses, which, till he made it slightly tiresome by too long a run, was piquant enough. The fourth chapter, \"Hebraism and Hellenism,\" coasts the sands and rocks (on which, as it seems to some, Mr Arnold was later to make shipwreck) very nearly in the title and rather <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> in the contents, but still with a fairly safe offing. The opposition might be put too bluntly by saying that \"Hellenism\" represents to Mr Arnold the love of truth at any price, and \"Hebraism\" the love of goodness at any price; but the actual difference is not far from this, or from those of knowing and doing, fear of stupidity and fear of sin, &c.

The Puritans complained that the church exerted insufficient control over the morals of the congregation. Their ideas of morality were very strict and even plays were thought to be immoral. The Independent Puritans were those Protestants who had fled from Mary's Catholic reign to the continent, where they were persuaded to the ideas of John Calvin of Geneva. He stressed the old idea of predestination in the salvation of souls, which had in the past been accepted by <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all English Christian leaders, thinkers, and teachers, but not stressed. The act of conversion was a common experience among the early Puritans. The concomitant hatred of past sins and love of God which was felt in thankfulness for mercy were proof of selection for salvation. The good works that followed were merely an obligation showing that one's faith was real, but not a way to salvation. But the puritans also accepted Calvin's idea of independent church government. They...", "...Who boundless seas passed o'er, And boldly met in every path, Famine, and frost, and heathen wrath, To dedicate a shore Where Piety's meek train might breathe their vow, And seek their Maker with an unshamed brow; Where Liberty's glad race might come, And set up there an everlasting home! _Charles Sprague_.

India, the great peninsula stretching from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> half as large as Europe, and contains a population of 150,000,000. Myth and tradition claim for this people a very great antiquity, and there are many evidences that in arts, government, and literature, India is at least coeval with China and Egypt, the three constituting the most ancient civilizations of the world. While Western Europe was still the abode of barbarians, and while even Greece had scarcely felt the impulse which aroused her to intellectual life, the fabrics of...", "...and, consequently, there was a clammy, vault-like atmosphere indoors that was anything but pleasant.

As I approached the village I was walking ahead of my guides, who were with the sled. It was getting late, and we were endeavoring to trace the direction by following the tracks on the snow which covered the lake; but a high wind, which was blowing from the north, had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> obliterated all signs and rendered the task a difficult one. Presently, however, I heard the barking of dogs and the voices of a number of children, who soon appeared approaching over a hill on the right bank of the lake, beyond which the village was built. I hastened toward them, and was shortly conducted into an igloo where all the men were seated, tailor fashion, around bones which showed that justice had been done to a hearty repast of frozen deer meat. They extended a rude...", "...craft, and have got us into serious trouble. The shoals hereabouts are numerous and the water generally is shallow. This native craft was rigged very much like an ordinary pilot-boat, and flew a huge ensign at the main until dark, besides burning enough blue lights, flash-lights, and flare-lights afterwards to draw any ship from her safe course. It would therefore not have been surprising if we had allowed ourselves to be misled by her. We heard afterwards that only a few days ago she <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> led H.M.S.

The first sensation was that of dizziness and confusion, from the unusual absence of the sky above, and the dashing frantic speed of the angry boiling waters. The rocks on each side have been blasted so as to form a path by which you may walk up to the first fall; but this path was at times very narrow and you have to cling to the chain which is let into the rock. The heavy storm of the day before had swelled the torrent so that it rose <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a foot above this path; and before I had proceeded far, I found that the flood swept between my legs with a force which would have taken some people off their feet. The rapids below the Falls are much grander than the Falls themselves; there was one down in a chasm between two riven rocks which it was painful to look long upon, and watch with what a deep plunge--what irresistible force--the waters dashed down and then returned to their own surface, as if struggling and out of...", "...in reaching an immense shea-oak, under which we hoped to find some shelter till the violence of the rain had diminished; nor where we disappointed, though it was long before we could venture to leave our place of refuge. At length however, we did so, and endeavoured to find our way back to Eagle Hawk Gully. Hopeless task! The ground was so slippery, it was as much as we could do to walk without falling; the mud and dirt clung to our boots, and a heavy rain beat against our faces and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> blinded us. \"It is clearing up to windward,\" observed Frank; \"another half-hour and the rain will be all but over; let us return to our tree again.\" We did so. Frank was correct; in less than the time he had specified a slight drizzling rain was all of the storm that remained. With much less difficulty we again attempted to return home, but before very long we made the startling discovery that we had completely lost our way, and to add to our misfortune the small...", "...'news,' which was generally that 'Mrs. \"Bunny\" Bumpkin looked sweet in grey'--or that 'Miss \"Toby\" Tosspot was among the loveliest of the debutantes at Court.'

Presumably, the man she loved got the refusal she intended for the other, for he never sought her society again; and Mr. Van Ariens told me she <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> died in consequence.

A better kind is that which comes about by a turn of incident, as in the Bath Scene in the Odyssey. Next come the recognitions invented at will by the poet, and on that account wanting in art. For example, Orestes in the Iphigenia reveals the fact that he is Orestes. She, indeed, makes herself known by the letter; but he, by speaking himself, and saying what the poet, not what the plot requires. This, therefore, is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> allied to the fault above mentioned:--for Orestes might as well have brought tokens with him. Another similar instance is the 'voice of the shuttle' in the Tereus of Sophocles. The third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object awakens a feeling: as in the Cyprians of Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks into tears on seeing the picture; or again in the 'Lay of Alcinous,' where Odysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the past and weeps; and hence the...", "...the first asked me what I would take for the book.

'Nonsense,' said the first man, 'there are plenty of them, there have been <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fifty editions, to my knowledge; I will give you five shillings.'

'Well,' said the fat gentleman, 'I will give you what you ask;' and sure enough he presently gave me the money; so...", "...whether Crockett had the slightest appreciation of the sacred character of that day which commemorates the advent of the Son of God to suffer and die for the sins of the world. With Crockett it had ever been a day of jollification. He fired salutes with his rifle. He sung his merriest songs. He told his funniest stories. He indulged himself in the highest exhilaration which whiskey could induce. As this holiday approached, Crockett was much troubled in finding that his powder was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> expended, and that he had none \"to fire Christmas guns.\" This seemed really to annoy him more than that he had none to hunt with. In the mean time, a brother-in-law had moved to that region, and had reared his cabin at a distance of six miles from the hut of David Crockett, on the western bank of Rutherford's Fork, one of the tributaries of Obion River. He had brought with him a keg of powder for Crockett, which had not yet been delivered. The region all around was low and...", "...I had never heard of the track of a ghost; though a _horse-ghost_ might be different from the common kind! My reflections on this head ended in the determination to follow the trail as far as it should lead; of course to the point where the steed must have mounted into the air, or evaporated--the scene of his apotheosis. With this resolve, I gathered my reins, and rode forward upon the trail, keeping my eyes fixed upon the hoof-prints. The line was direct, and I had ridden <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two hundred yards, when my horse came to a sudden stop. I looked out forward to discover the cause of his halting; with that glance vanished my new-born superstitions. At the distance of some thirty paces, a dark line was seen upon the prairie, running transversely to the course I was following. It appeared to be a narrow crack in the plain; but on spurring nearer, it proved to be a fissure of considerable width--one of those formations known throughout Spanish America as...", "...good man.

The Flathead nation, to which <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the Puget Sound Indians belong, may almost be termed amphibians; for though they can, and do in some cases, live inland exclusively, they are never happy when away from the water. They are canoeists by birth and education.

The _yabu_ is a hardy mountain pony used by the Afghans for the saddle and packing purposes; they are very strong, active, and sure-footed, and have been frequently used by the British forces in their military operations. In 1839 Captain (afterward General) Outram relates that his _yabu_, \"although but thirteen hands high, carried me and my saddlebags, weighing altogether upward of sixteen stone, the whole distance from Kalat in seven days and a half (an average of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> forty-seven miles a day), during which time I had passed 111 hours on its back; there was no saddle on the pony, merely a cloth over his back.\" They will carry from four to five _maunds_ with perfect ease, making journeys of thirty miles a day.

This is no small task, but it is usually postponed until near the rainy season.

His wife too is inclined to postpone cutting the thatch grass until it is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all burnt, and then it requires much more labor to find enough thatch than if she had done the work at the proper time. The rain usually is threatening, or even the first has fallen before the man begins the actual building, and then he and his neighbors hurry and put up the huts after a fashion. When asked why he does not build earlier in the season he naively exclaims, \"Oh!

Maggie was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> eight years old, and from her very earliest days there had been a great fuss made about her.

Add to this the fact that aluminum is extremely abundant everywhere in nature--it is a constituent of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all soils and is computed to form about the twelfth part of the entire crust of the earth--whereas the other valuable metals are relatively rare, and it will appear that aluminum must be destined to play an important part in the mechanics of the future.

The fact is that the truth of my original notion of the people of this country is now confirmed. The _mass_ only wanted the vigorous interference of a well-intentioned government, strong enough to control both the extreme parties, and to proclaim wholesome truths and act for the benefit of the country at large, in defiance of ultras on either side. But, apart from all this political effort, I am delighted to have seen this part of the country--I mean the great district, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as large as Ireland, placed between the three lakes, Erie, Ontario, and Huron.

It should never be left in the pot, but should be turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to get cold. Never cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour very quickly. Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the top. If this be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly be spoiled. Thickened soups require <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> double the seasoning used for thin soups or broth.

This was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two thirds of the whole American force, according to Tarleton's own account; and the manner in which those left on the ground were mangled, is told, by others, as horrible.

Then Sigurd of Reyr made the following speech: \"Now there is hope that the time is come which has been promised us all the summer, that we shall meet King Inge in battle. We have long prepared ourselves for this; and many of our comrades have boasted that they would never fly from or submit to King Inge and Gregorius, and now let them remember their words. But we who have sometimes got the toothache in our...", "...of armies. The first military necessity of the war was, as has been described, to place the bulk of the Egyptian army at Akasha. In ordinary circumstances this would not have been a serious commissariat problem. The frontier reserves of food were calculated to meet such an emergency. But in 1895 the crops in Egypt had been much below the average. At the beginning of 1896 there was a great scarcity of grain. When the order for the advance was issued, the frontier grain stores were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> exhausted. The new crops could not be garnered until the end of April. Thus while the world regarded Egypt as a vast granary, her soldiers were obliged to purchase 4,000 tons of doura and 1,000 tons of barley from India and Russia on which to begin the campaign. The chief item of a soldier's diet in most armies is bread. In several of our wars the health, and consequently the efficiency, of the troops has been impaired by bad bread or by the too frequent substitution of hard...", "...was that comfort which saved her from further struggle with herself upon the subject.

Every preparation was made, in the city, for the expected attack. The defenses were strengthened; the lower portion of the populace--who would be likely to declare against them--were turned out of the town; and provisions were collected from the country round. Fortunately, ample time was afforded them for these preparations. Ayoub's army had been, to a great extent, demoralized by the tremendous losses which it had sustained, in the defeat of...", "...not be amiss, then, to stop a moment to trace rapidly the main points of this conflict--to discuss the various forms of this scientific wolf. First, then, it came in the form of the _heliocentric theory of the planetary system_. We once thought the earth the center of the universe, and so firm that it can not be moved. But science shows that it moves about the sun, and spins unceasingly on its axis. Every one has heard of the terror of the sheep produced by this discovery, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> tragic results to the bold scientist. But now we look back with wonder that there should have been any trouble at all. Would any Christian now consent to give up the grand conceptions of Nature and of God thus opened to the human mind--the idea of infinite space full of worlds, of which our earth is one, moving in silent harmony as in a mystic dance? Verily, this wolf has proved itself a harmless, nay, a very noble beast, and lies down in peace with the lambs. Next, it came in...", "...copyright royalties.

With these weapons the students perpetrated savageries, almost unrebuked, which struck an American with horror. Duels were of frequent occurrence, taking place sometimes at places and on days regularly set apart for the really bloody work. The fighters were partially protected by a sort of armour, and the wounds inflicted were generally more ghastly than dangerous; though a son of Bismarck was said to have been <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> killed at Bonn a few years before, and there was sometimes serious maiming. Perhaps one may say it was nothing but very rough play, but it was the play of young savages, whose sport was nothing to them without a dash of cruel rage.

Mary returned to Edinburgh for a short time; and on the 8th of October she marched again, this time at the head of eighteen thousand men, to renew the war. The rebel lords, terrified at the approach of their royal mistress, fled across the English border, and took refuge in Carlisle. Queen Mary had no further opportunity of displaying her courage till after the murder of Darnley, in 1567, when the base conduct of Bothwell and the consequent insurrection of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the Scottish nobles forced her once more to take the field in person. When the opposing armies met, June 14th, at Carberry Hill, she rode with her followers to the field, though neither she nor they had broken their fast that morning. After this followed the captivity of Mary in Loch-Leven Castle. In 1568 she made her escape, and assisted by a few friends, made a last effort to recover her throne.

As practical questions, they were canvassed when the measures which they regarded were acted on and adopted; and as belonging to history, the time has not come for their consideration. It is, perhaps, not wonderful, that, when the Constitution of the United States first went into operation, different opinions should be entertained as to the extent of the powers conferred by it. Here was a natural source of diversity of sentiment. It is still less wonderful, that that event, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> contemporary with our government under the present Constitution, which so entirely shocked all Europe, and disturbed our relations with her leading powers, should be thought, by different men, to have different bearings on our own prosperity; and that the early measures adopted by the government of the United States, in consequence of this new state of things, should be seen in opposite lights.

Fortunately it was quite dark so our passage through the township attracted no attention. I looked at the lamp-lit windows and thought of the happy folk inside, and could have cried for very shame when I remembered that I too might have been in my own house, happy with my pretty wife, but for my own obstinate stupidity.

One day I went out to look at my _rahar_ crop which was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> ripe and as I stood under a mowah tree I heard a voice whispering. I stooped down to try and see through the _rahar_ who was there but the crop was so thick that I could see nothing; so I climbed up the mowah tree to look. Glancing towards Dhubia village I saw the third daughter of the Paranik come out of her house and walk towards me. When about fifty yards from me she climbed a big rock and waited. Presently an old aunt of hers came out of the village and joined her. Then the...", "...the grass he could see right into one of the flower-tubes, and presently he noticed a little, old, grey, shrivelled woman in it, very, very small, for she was not longer than the nail of his little finger. She wore a grey shawl that dragged behind her, and kept getting under her feet and tripping her up. She was most active, whisking about this way and that inside the flower; and at intervals she turned to stare at Martin, who kept getting nearer and nearer to watch her until his face <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> touched the flower; and whenever she looked at him she wore an exceedingly severe expression on her small dried-up countenance. It seemed to Martin that she was very angry with him for some reason. Then she would turn her back on him, and tumble about in the tube of the flower, and gathering up the ends of her shawl in her arms begin dusting with great energy; then hurrying out once more she would shake the dust from her big, funny shawl in his eyes. At last he carefully raised...", "...republican, though at some slight distance, and on the opposite side of the way. A gentleman on foot, apparently returning from a party, met Wolfe, and, with an air half haughty, half unconscious, took the wall; though, according to old-fashioned rules of street courtesy, he was on the wrong side for asserting the claim. The stern republican started, drew himself up to his full height, and sturdily and doggedly placed himself directly in the way of the unjust claimant. Clarence was now <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> opposite to the two, and saw all that was going on. With a motion a little rude and very contemptuous, the passenger attempted to put Wolfe aside, and win his path. Little did he know of the unyielding nature he had to do with; the next instant the republican, with a strong hand, forced him from the pavement into the very kennel, and silently and coldly continued his way. The wrath of the discomfited passenger was vehemently kindled. \"Insolent dog!\" cried he, in a loud...", "...hidden for just such times.

Jacques Cartier saw the beluga disporting itself off Malbaie <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 400 years ago and in summer it is still to be seen there almost daily. It is never alone. One sees the creatures swimming rapidly in single file. They come to the surface with a prolonged sigh accompanied by the throwing of a small jet of water; the perfectly white bodies writhe into view as the small round heads disappear. Sometimes the beluga makes a noise like the half suppressed lowing of oxen and, since the aquatic world is so silent, sailors have christened the beluga, for...", "...the island. The trade was continued so late as 1853, and occasional cargoes were brought over even later, slavers having been captured on the south coast two years subsequent to the last named date. The slave vessels generally sought a landing on the south side, both as being nearest and safest for them, but when they were hard pressed they made a port wherever it could be most easily reached. A favorite point at the time of which we speak, was in the Bay of Broa, on the south coast, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> opposite to the Isle of Pines. It was here in 1845 that the author witnessed a scene which forms the theme of the following chapter. A superior knowledge of all the hidden bays and inlets of the south side gave the contrabandists great advantages over any pursuing vessel, and their lighter draught of water enabled them to navigate their small crafts where it was impossible for a heavy ship to follow.

Colorado has more than thirty peaks within its borders whose height is quite or <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> three miles. The wild, mountainous region was explored in 1858 at two points, one near Pike's Peak and the other in the southwestern portion. Both exploring parties discovered gold, which, while abundant, is hard to extract. The Territory was organized in 1861, and the principal discoveries of the enormous deposits of silver have been made since 1870. The date of Colorado's admission has caused it often to be referred to as the \"Centennial State.\" THE PANIC OF 1873. We...", "...P. O.

They spoke of the messages of the mountains, the sublimities of sunsets, and the lessons taught by the flowerets.

In many places these look like a river following the coast-line, but frequently they spread out into extensive sheets of water. By cutting about 30 m. of canal to connect them, a continuous waterway could be formed for 270 m. along the coast. This has already been done for about 55 m. between Ivondrona and Andovoranto, a service of small steamers forming part of the communication between the coast and the capital.

To see and to speak with Aspatria was now the one thing in life worthy of his attention. It was not an easy thing to accomplish.

Sumter retreated up the Wateree river to Fishing creek, but on the 18th Tarleton for once caught him napping, and routed him; taking 300 prisoners, setting free the captured British, and recovering all the booty. The same day witnessed an American success in another quarter.

Two days later, Marion performed one of his characteristic exploits. A detachment of the British army was approaching Nelson's Ferry, where the Santee river crosses the road from Camden to Charleston, when Marion, with a handful of men, suddenly darting upon these troops, captured 26 of their number, set free 150 Maryland prisoners whom they were taking down to the coast, and got away without losing a man.

They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and voluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of Hayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis.

The rate of mortality is of course not equal throughout the country. According to Dr. Hawkins, this is mainly influenced by the proportion of large towns which any district or county contains. The lowest well-ascertained rate of mortality in any part of Europe is that of Pembrokeshire and Anglesey, in Wales, where only one death takes place annually out of eighty-three individuals. Sussex enjoys the lowest rate of mortality of any English county; it is there 1 in 72....", "...copyright royalties.

But even now we constantly find good books severely criticized because of this deficiency. All that I have said tends to show that even to-day in Western countries the immense importance of systematic arrangement in literary collections is not sufficiently recognized.

But you must have observed that, in Western countries, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all such anthologies are compiled chronologically--not according to the subject of the poems. To this general rule there are indeed a few exceptions. There is a collection of love poetry by Watson, which is famous; a collection of child poetry by Patmore; a collection of \"society verse\" by Locker-Lampson; and several things of that sort.

The pages which follow were prepared originally as a prize monograph for the American Economic Association, receiving an award from it in 1891. The restriction of the subject to a fixed number of words hampered the treatment, and it was thought best to enlarge many points which in the allotted space could have hardly more than mention. Acting on this wish, the monograph has been <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> doubled in size, but still must be counted only an imperfect summary, since facts in these lines are in most cases very nearly unobtainable, and, aside from the few reports of Labor Bureaus, there are as yet almost no sources of full information. But as there is no existing manual of reference on this topic, the student of social questions will accept this attempt to meet the need, till more facts enable a fuller and better presentation of the difficult subject.

The Puritans complained that the church exerted insufficient control over the morals of the congregation. Their ideas of morality were very strict and even plays were thought to be immoral. The Independent Puritans were those Protestants who had fled from Mary's Catholic reign to the continent, where they were persuaded to the ideas of John Calvin of Geneva.

The concomitant hatred of past sins and love of God which was felt in thankfulness for mercy were proof of selection for salvation. The good works that followed were merely an obligation showing that one's faith was real, but not a way to salvation. But the puritans also accepted Calvin's idea of independent church government.

Should the Arapahoes attempt to retreat towards the Arkansas, this party could intercept them. A second division--also keeping above the bluffs--was to make to a point <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> opposite the butte; where, by a ravine known to the Indians, a descent could be made into the valley of the Huerfano. A third was to seek its station upon the opposite side--where a similar defile led down to the plain; while the remaining warriors were to move forward by the upper canon, and halt at its mouth--until the other three parties were known to have reached their respective places.

We might tell of the rivalry which existed between the boys, and which seemed to grow stronger every day, affording infinite amusement to the trappers, who praised first one, and then the other, to incite them to greater deeds of valor; how Frank took the lead by killing a grizzly bear, alone and unaided, and Archie, to be even with him, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> broke King James's neck, and his own into the bargain, by attempting to capture a wild horse. That was a proud day for Archie, for he actually succeeded in lassoing one of the drove; but, unfortunately, the lariat was insecurely fastened to his saddle, and the wild steed made his escape after all, carrying the lasso with him. All the trappers voted that this exploit was fully equal to the killing of a grizzly, and that, if Frank wished to take the lead again, he must trap or...", "...but the process was tedious.

What a nice little paper _Euterpe_ is! Long ago we used to have good papers like that--real literary papers, in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the same format--in America. Now, alas! they have become impossible. The taste for good literature in America is practically dead: vulgar fiction has killed the higher fiction; \"sensationalism\" and blatant cheap journalism have murdered the magazines; and poetry is silent.

As I have said, the tree on which I was perched was twenty yards from the window, and except on this one occasion <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> everything was said in a low voice. But his words enabled me to see who the other occupant of the room was, for at his behest the woman whom I had accompanied almost all the way from Folkestone town came to a part in the room where I could see her plainly. She had thrown off her headgear, and the heavy cloak which she had worn, and when I saw her there I wondered more than ever what business she could have with this old man. I have said that I thought she was young when I saw...", "...I did not intend it, although I did not take special pains to avoid it. The sum is this. I have presented my thoughts, without so much reference to what has already been said by myself or others, as to what I have supposed to be the necessities of those for whom I write.

They galloped down the long hills and through the level groves till they were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> home. The sunlight faded--a strong breeze swept up from the ocean, and a sudden cloud obscured the sun; one of those abrupt changes so common in autumn fell upon the sea, robbing the day of its loveliness, and making it so cold and leaden that it was more than dreary from contrast with the glorious morning. They were near the gates which led into their own domain, when a man came running swiftly towards them, and as he passed looked up in Elizabeth's face.

Its conquest was desirable on many accounts, and circumstances had already shown that this was not a matter of serious difficulty. The invasion of Prevost the year before, which had so <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> proved successful; the little resistance which had been offered to him while traversing more than one hundred miles of country contiguous to the Capital; and the rich spoils which, on his retreat, had been borne off by his army, betrayed at once the wealth and weakness of that region. The possession of Savannah, where British Government had been regularly re-established, and the entire, if not totally undisturbed control of Georgia, necessarily facilitated the invasion of the...", "...the air thick for many a mile around.

Thousands of these wallows are seen, and for several hundred miles the furrowed trails are rarely out of sight for many miles.

Gentlemen, since the settlement of that constitution, now <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two centuries ago, England has never experienced a revolution, though there is no country in which there has been so continuous and such considerable change.

Rathaiyah remained behind. The large tents and the workmen were left under the care of the Bairakdar. About three miles from Arban we passed a small artificial mound called Tel Hamer (the red); and similar ruins abound on the banks of the river. Three hours from Arban we reached a remarkable artificial mound called Shedadi, washed by the Khabour. It consists of a lofty platform, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> square, from the centre of which springs a cone. On the top are the tombs of several Jebour chiefs, marked by the raised earth, and by small trees now dry, fixed upright in the graves. I found fragments of pottery and bricks, but no trace of inscriptions. We did not reach the encampment of Mohammed Emin, spreading three or four miles along the Khabour, until after sunset.

The troops marched in, and to their utter surprise found the commandant willing and ready to yield up his sword. After that, the whole of the garrison laid down their arms like a flock of sheep. Without a blow, without any resistance whatsoever, one hundred and fifty thirsty, hungry, exhausted men had captured Cairo, with its enormous garrison of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> thirty thousand rebels! The feat was one unprecedented in history, and though it reflected little credit on the sagacity of the leaders of the campaign, it at least was a tribute to the commander's knowledge of the peculiarities of the Eastern character, and the reckless devotion to duty of the men under his command.

Before we started, the Amazonas Boundary Commission had come up the lower Aripuanan and then the eastern branch, or upper Aripuanan, to 8 degrees 48 minutes, following the course which for a couple of decades had been followed by the rubbermen, but not going as high. An employee, either of this commission or of one of the big rubbermen, had been up the Castanho, which is easy of ascent in its lower course, to about the same latitude, not going <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as high as the rubbermen had gone; this we found out while we ourselves were descending the lower Castanho. The lower main stream, and the lower portion of its main affluent, the Castanho, had been commercial highways for rubbermen and settlers for nearly two decades, and, as we speedily found, were as easy to traverse as the upper stream, which we had just come down, was difficult to traverse; but the governmental and scientific authorities, native and foreign, remained in...", "...that they have dug up the ground in various places and searched for the Jewish Ark of the Covenant, which they believe was buried here by the Irish priests to escape capture at the time the palaces of Tara were looted and destroyed.

Theophrastus, however, was much less a classifier than his master, and his work on botany, called The Natural History of Development, pays comparatively slight attention to theoretical questions.

In this regard the work of Theophrastus, is more <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> akin to the natural history of the famous Roman compiler, Pliny. It remained, however, throughout antiquity as the most important work on its subject, and it entitles Theophrastus to be called the \"father of botany.\" Theophrastus deals also with the mineral kingdom after much the same fashion, and here again his work is the most notable that was produced in antiquity.

The stalks are tougher, and they are quite smooth, with fine ridges running up them. The flower-heads are made up in the same way as those of the other daisy plants. You find a mass of tiny yellow tubes in the centre, and forming a border round this yellow centre is an outer ring of flowers, each with one large white strap. When the Mayweed begins to wither, these white straps droop towards the stalk, and the yellow centre, instead of remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> flat, becomes the shape of a thimble. You will find many of these yellow thimbles on the plant, after all the white straps are gone. The tips of the green leaves, which grow in a double ring behind the flowers, are often tinged with pink. The leaves of the Scentless Mayweed are like many leaves that grow in running water. They are divided into a tangle of fine hair-like points, which spring directly from the main stem without any stalk. PLATE XXIII: 1. SNOWDROP 2....", "...copyright royalties.

The bombardment which the enemy at once opened from the Aubers ridge did very little damage. This, the fourth day following upon three days of hard and continuous fighting, was the most trying of all. The men were by this time in the last stage of fatigue. The devotion of the British soldier, however, is not readily fathomed. Such was the battle of Neuve Chapelle. It cost the lives of nearly 2,500 British heroes, and casualties to <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 9,000 others, while 1,751 were listed as missing. The losses of the enemy were some 18,000. In his dispatch Sir John French says: \"The results attained were, in my opinion, wide and far-reaching.\" Not only did the British attack breach a part of the German front which had been elaborately fortified, and prove the power to breach it, and at a cost to the attacking force actually less than the force defending, but it set back in a decisive manner a scheme which the Germans had for...", "...if he did sell her, for no one wanted an old slave that was unable to work.

If an Algonkin married a girl of his clan he committed a crime for which his nearest relatives might put him to death.

What led to this custom is not known definitely; <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> every anthropologist has his own theory on the subject.[134] Luckily we are not concerned here with the origin and causes of exogamy, but only with the fact of its existence. It occurs not only among barbarians of a comparatively high type, like the North American Indians, but among the lowest Australian savages, who put to death any man who marries or assaults a woman of the same clan as his.

Their kingdom reached its farthest limit in the reign of Euric (466-486), who extended its boundaries northward to the Loire and southward over <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of Spain.[138] Under the Visigoths the lot of the Latinized provincials, who with their ancestors had long been Roman citizens, was not a hard one. The Roman system of quartering soldiers upon provincials, with a right to one-third of the house, afforded precedent for the manner of settlement of the Visigoths and other Teuton invaders after them. The Visigoths received two-thirds not only of the houses but also of the lands, which indeed were bare of cultivators.

The above rules for the peroration apply equally to the accuser and to the defendant's advocate. They, likewise, use <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the same passions, but the accuser more seldom and more sparingly, and the defendant oftener and with greater emotions; for it is the business of the former to stir up aversion, indignation, and other similar passions in the minds of the judges, and of the latter to bend their hearts to compassion.

It was clear daylight, impossible to think of ghosts or anything uncanny; but Jerry's heart nevertheless beat rather faster than usual for an instant or two. Then there was a little cry, a rush towards the bed, disjointed exclamations--\"Oh, dear Charlotte! is it you?\" \"My own old Jerry, to think you were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> lost in the snow. Oh, how miserable we were! Oh my old Jerry.\" There was some one in the doorway, some one who had brought Charlotte up-stairs, whose eyes filled with tears as she listened to them. \"Oh, how happy they are to be together, not to have to be separated,\" she thought, as her fancy flew off to her own dear ones, Lalage and Alix, and the three little brothers at the Rectory. And an hour or two later, Jerry, well wrapped up, and in Charlotte's careful convoy,...", "...words in such a manner as to produce other words that possess meaning. The construction of anagrams is an amusement of great antiquity, its invention being ascribed without authority to the Jews, probably because the later Hebrew writers, particularly the Kabbalists, were fond of it, asserting that ``secret mysteries are woven in the numbers of letters.'' Anagrams were known to the Greeks and also to the Romans, although the known Latin examples of words of more than one syllable are <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all imperfect. They were popular throughout Europe during the middle ages and later, particularly in France, where a certain Thomas Billon was appointed ``anagrammatist to the king'' by Louis XIII. W. Camden (Remains, 7th ed., 1674) defines ``Anagrammatisme'' as ``a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, subtraction or change of any letter, into different words, making...", "...or the soul which she imagined it to contain; but she was always a gracious figure and her voice was gentle. Perhaps Mr. LORAINE owed most to his scenic artists, Messrs. DULAC and JOHN BULL, who gave of their best. There was attraction too in the very names of Arras and Bapaume, as well as in the thought of the part that our _Cyrano_ of to-day has played against a ruder foe than the Spaniard. And was I wrong in tracing a hint of other experiences gained at the front, when Mr. LORAINE <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> turned up his false nose at the mention of \"military wit.\" The part offers little scope for humour. _Cyrano_, with all his generous impulses, is too self-conscious for that. But in each of his moods and phases--bravado, sacrifice, acceptance of the inexorable pathos of things--Mr. LORAINE had got at the heart of the man. A very brave and inspiring performance.

No heron was found for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> an hour; and he was in the act of declaring that it was useless to try any farther, and they had better go back, when a bird was started from the long reeds, and the jesses of the falcons were slipped.

The other prisoners standing near then attacked him, and beat him <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> to death, for having drawn the fire of the guard. Nothing could be more inexcusable than these murders. Whatever defense there might be for firing on men who touched the Dead Line in other parts of the prison, there could be none here.

A merchant, for example, may be employed <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the day at his counting-room, and so may a mechanic. A physician may spend all his waking hours in visiting patients, and feel little more than healthy fatigue. The reason is, that in all these employments, and, in fact, in most of the employments of life, there is so much to diversify, so many little incidents constantly occurring to animate and relieve, and so much bodily exercise, which alternates with and suspends the fatigues of the mind, that the labors may be much...", "...had about ten words written on its face, above a general's signature.

Attention was now directed to the Penobscot River in the state of Maine, which, though very unproductive compared with Canadian rivers, might yet, perhaps, be made to yield the requisite quantity of spawn. A preliminary examination of the river brought out the following facts: The Penobscot is about 225 miles in length. The upper half of its course and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of its principal tributaries lie in an uninhabited wilderness, and in this district are the breeding grounds of the salmon. The fisheries, however, are all on the lower part of the river and in the estuary into which it empties, Penobscot Bay.

In spite of this fact in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the engagements in the early part of the great offensive the Allied forces were outnumbered in a ratio varying from three to one to five to three.

I must repeat an incident which I have related in another of these Essays. When Dr. Holyoke, nearly seventy years ago, received young Mr. James Jackson as his student, he showed him the formidable array of bottles, jars, and drawers around his office, and then named the four remedies referred to as being of more importance than all the rest put together. These were \"Mercury, Antimony, Opium, and Peruvian Bark.\" I doubt if either of them remembered that, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> seventy years before, in 1730, Dr. William Douglass, the disputatious Scotchman, mentioned those same four remedies, in the dedication of his quarrelsome essay on inoculation, as the most important ones in the hands of the physicians of his time.

For overtime, her hardest hours, are taxed at nearly 50 percent. This sends a terrible message: You will never get ahead. But America's message must be different. We must honor hard work, never punish it. With tax relief, overtime will no longer be overtax time for the waitress. People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage reductions. And millions of additional American families will be removed...", "...of the universe solider by some infinitesimal increment, about which in itself nobody except my wife and me particularly cares.

Hence in the course of growth the pelvis not only becomes proportionally higher, but it undergoes a rotary movement around the cotyloid axis; this movement has the effect of elevating the pubis and bringing the ischium forward.

This was too early for such an improvement, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the whole of his excellent work was sold as waste paper. His elementary introduction to the Differential Calculus was drawn up while he was learning the subject late in life. Books of this sort are often very effective on points of difficulty.

In his reign was formed the first code of laws, known by the name of \"Statute of Wislica,\" a part of which is written in the Polish language; and he laid the foundation of the university of Cracow (1347), which, however, was only organized half a century later.

With Sigismund I. (1505-1542), and Sigismund Augustus (1542-1613), a new period of Polish literature begins. The university of Cracow had been organized in 1400, on the model of that of Prague, and this opened a door for the doctrines, first of the Bohemian, then of the German reformers. The wild flame of superstition which kindled the fagots for the disciples of the new doctrines in Poland was extinguished by...", "..._now_ used is the _inspired_ sense, David says, \"I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried.\" What, stop the earth in its revolution! Two hundred years ago, _prevent_ was used in its strict Latin sense to _come before_, or _anticipate_. It is always used in this sense in the Old and New Testaments. David's expression, in the English of the nineteenth century, would be \"Before the dawning of the morning I cried.\" In almost every chapter of the Bible, words are used in a sense now <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> or quite obsolete, and sometimes in a sense totally _opposite_ to their present meaning. A few examples follow: \"I purposed to come to you, but was _let_ (hindered) hitherto.\" \"And the four _beasts_ (living ones) fell down and worshipped God,\"--\"Whosoever shall _offend_ (cause to sin) one of these little ones,\"--\"Go out into the highways and _compel_ (urge) them to come in,\"--\"Only let your _conversation_ (habitual conduct) be as becometh the Gospel,\"--\"They that seek me _early_...", "...I slipped and stumbled over some log or stone or brake through the snow into a hole or gulley, so that I marvel now I did not break my legs.

These traditional lost Cherokee are entirely distinct from the historic emigrants who removed from the East shortly after the Revolution. Similar stories are common to <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the tribes. Thus the Kiowa tell of a chief who, many years ago, quarreled over a division of game and led his people far away across the Rocky mountains, where they are still living somewhere about the British border and still keeping their old Kiowa language.

One of these representative women had entered the work at seven years of age, being then fifty-seven.

The Irish historians allege that the number of the brigade at first amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> thirty thousand men.[42] Though, they fought bravely for France, and conducted themselves valiantly in many of her great battles, they were unfortunately put forward to do a great deal of dirty work for Louis XIV.

Swimming hastily to the spot to try to discover what had happened, I found one of my woodpeckers floating motionless with outspread wings. All was over. Had I been a minute or two earlier, I might have saved him. He had glanced on the water I suppose in pursuit of a moth, was unable to rise from it, and died struggling, as I <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> did at this same spot. Like me he seemed to have lost his mind in blind confusion and fear.

What was our surprise, on reaching the post-station, at learning that it was actually 2 deg. below zero! Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the darkness decreased, but the morning was cloudy, and there was little appearance of daybreak before nine o'clock. In the early twilight we were startled by the appearance of a ball of meteoric fire, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as large as the moon, and of a soft white lustre, which moved in a horizontal line from east to west, and disappeared without a sound. I was charmed by the forest scenery through which we passed. The pine, spruce, and fir trees, of the greatest variety of form, were completely coated with frozen snow, and stood as immovable as forests of bronze incrusted with silver. The delicate twigs of the weeping birch resembled sprays of crystal, of a thousand airy and exquisite patterns....", "...all I have written about ferrets and dogs are not given merely from hearsay, but are the facts derived from study and experience during 25 years of dog and ferret-keeping. PART III. THE HABITS OF RATS. Rats breed very quickly. This I have often proved by visiting a given haunt for many years together. I remember an instance in point one June, when out with dog and ferrets. The dog made a set under the root of a tree. I put the ferret in and it bolted eight young Rats, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> half grown, still suckling the bitch Rat. When the old Rat bolted my dog killed it, and whilst the dog was shaking it I found she was very heavy in young again. This, therefore, will prove how quickly Rats breed. Another result of my observation may be of interest to my readers. After removing a lot of old rubbish when ratting I came upon a nest of just- born Rats, and, in curiosity, I cut the tails off the lot, and then put the young Rodents back, leaving the nest...", "...sound of the tea-bell. John was the first to notice this omission. \"Oughtn't we to climb up again and come down by the ladder?\" he said. \"Oh no, bother the ladder!\" replied Madge, so curtly that the others stared at her in surprise. \"But the ladder was your idea, your very own idea. And I thought you were so proud of it!\" observed Betty in a bewildered voice. \"Oh yes, so I was!\" cried Madge impatiently. \"But don't you see, so many new things have happened that they have <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> put the old things out of my head. The ladder is quite safe up there twisted round the bough. Barton will never think of looking in the tree even if he does miss it, but it's my belief he doesn't count the ropes all through the summer. Now let us hurry back or there will be a fuss about our keeping tea waiting, and we sha'n't be allowed to go so far away in the fields.

In the conducting of criminal trials, the manner of procedure is in a great measure different from our English form. A criminal, when first apprehended, is carried, before the magistrate of the town, generally the Mayor. He there undergoes repeated examinations; all the witnesses, are summoned and examined, in a manner similar to the precognitions taken before the Sheriff of Scotland, and the whole process is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as tedious as upon the trial. All the papers and declarations are then sent with the accused, to the _Jure d'Accusation_, who also thoroughly examine the prisoner and the witnesses; if grounds are found for the trial, the papers are immediately laid before the \"_Cour d'Assize_.\" Before this court, the prisoner is again specially examined by its president. His former declarations are compared and confronted with his present answers, and the strongest evidence against him, is...", "...we do, let us do without delay.\" Pathfinder was struck with the firmness of Mabel's tones, and perhaps he was a little deceived by the forced tranquillity and self-possession she had assumed. At all events, he did not deem any further explanations necessary, but descended forthwith, and began to unbar the door. This delicate process was conducted with the usual caution, but, as he warily permitted the mass of timber to swing back on the hinges, he felt a pressure against it, that had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> induced him to close it again. But, catching a glimpse of the cause through the crack, the door was permitted to swing back, when the body of Sergeant Dunham, which was propped against it, fell partly within the block. To draw in the legs and secure the fastenings occupied the Pathfinder but a moment. Then there existed no obstacle to their giving their undivided care to the wounded man. Mabel, in this trying scene, conducted herself with the sort of unnatural energy that her...", "...own, strangers and sojourners among you! The next bull is treated to a refinement of torture, in the form of darts filled with heavy China crackers, which explode on the neck of the poor beast. I could not see that even this made him really dangerous. The light-complexioned, green-and-silver matador dispatches him, as he did the first bull, with a single lunge, and--a fall and a quiver, and all is over! The fifth bull is a failure and is allowed to go out of the ring. The sixth is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the same with the others, harmless if let alone, and goaded into short-lived activity, but not into anything like fury or even a dangerous animosity. He is treated to fire-crackers, and gores one horse a little--the horse standing, side on, and taking it, until the bull is driven off by the punching of the spear; and runs at the other horse, and, to my delight, upsets the rider, but unfortunately without hurting him, and the black-haired matador in green tries his hand on him...", "...he would weigh anchor again, in four hours.\" Dick was rather disappointed, but, as they would be at Madras before long, he did not much mind. Ten days later, they anchored off that town. Little was to be seen except the fort, a number of warehouses, and the native town, while the scenery contrasted strongly with that of Ceylon, with its masses of green foliage, with hills rising behind. For the last fortnight, Mrs. Holland had been somewhat depressed. Now that the voyage was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> over, the difficulties of the task before her seemed greater than they had done when viewed from a distance, and she asked herself whether, after all, it would not have been wiser to have waited another two or three years, until Dick had attained greater strength and manhood. The boy, however, when she confided her doubts to him, laughed at the idea. \"Why, you know, Mother,\" he said, \"we agreed that I had a much greater chance, as a boy, of going about unsuspected, than I...", "...how they're going to get along.\" \"Leave that to us,\" said Tubby, rather pompously; \"and we'll land on our feet all right, just as a cat does if you drop it out of the second-story window.\" After considerable difficulty, the boys were admitted to an audience with the mayor or burgomaster of Antwerp in his official chambers. Fortunately, he spoke English, so they expected to meet with little difficulty in acquainting him with the nature of their mission to Belgium at a time when <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all other Americans were only too well pleased to get away from the land of strife and warfare. The burgomaster looked surprised and even anxious when he heard that they desired an official paper from him, requesting all Belgians to assist them in their search for one Steven Meredith, who was believed to be located in a town not many miles to the west of the capital. \"I would do much for my old friend, Monsieur Charles Crawford, for whom I have long entertained a sincere...", "...a difficult surgical operation to restore it to its place.\" It struck me that, in spite of their boast that they have no paupers, no thieves, no money, they were a melancholy-looking set of beings. \"What are their amusements?\" I asked. \"Intoxication and suicide are their chief recreations. They have a way of mixing the oxygen which issues in small jets from certain natural springs with their atmospheric nitrogen in the proportion of about twenty per cent, which makes very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the same thing as the air of your planet. But to the Saturnians the mixture is highly intoxicating, and is therefore a relief to the monotony of their every-day life. This mixture is greatly sought after, but hard to obtain, as the sources of oxygen are few and scanty. It shortens the lives of those who have recourse to it; but if it takes too long, they have other ways of escaping from a life which cuts and dries everything for its miserable subjects, defeats all the natural...", "...\"Why wass you going so fast?

As, however, these terms only apply to English work, and as the architectural styles do not altogether correspond in date with those of the glass, I prefer to speak simply of the First, Second, and Third Period. The First lasts from the earliest examples almost to the end of the thirteenth century, and might be subdivided again into twelfth and thirteenth century work, between which there is a distinct difference. The Second covers <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the whole of the fourteenth century. The Third lasts down to the end of the fifteenth century, by which time the influence of the classic Renaissance began to be felt in glasswork, but lingers on in belated examples well into the sixteenth. Between each of these periods there is a very short transitional period lasting hardly a decade, and occupying the closing years of each century.

This was done at the suggestion of the ever-hungry Rinkitink, and when the oysters had been stowed in their shells behind the water barrel and a plentiful supply of grass brought aboard for Bilbil, they decided they were ready to start on their voyage. It proved no easy task to get Bilbil into the boat, for he was a remarkably clumsy goat and once, when Rinkitink gave him a push, he tumbled into the water and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> drowned before they could get him out again. But there was no thought of leaving the quaint animal behind. His power of speech made him seem almost human in the eyes of the boy, and the fat King was so accustomed to his surly companion that nothing could have induced him to part with him. Finally Bilbil fell sprawling into the bottom of the boat, and Inga helped him to get to the front end, where there was enough space for him to lie down. Rinkitink now took his seat in the...", "...a look at Goliad, uncertain about going in, because I do not know whether it is held by Texans or Mexicans.\" \"It is held by Mexicans at present,\" replied Potter, solemnly. \"But I think that within an hour or two it will be held by Texans.\" \"If it ain't there'll be some mighty roarin' an' rippin' an' tearin',\" said the Ring Tailed Panther. \"Give me a bite to eat and something to drink,\" said Milam; \"and I'll help you turn Goliad from a Mexican into a Texan town.\" Exhausted and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> starved, he showed, nevertheless, the dauntless spirit of the Texans. Food and drink were given to him and the little party moved toward the town. Presently they saw one or two lights. Far off a dog howled, but it was only at the moon. He had not scented them. By and by the ground grew so rough and the bushes so thick that all dismounted and tethered their horses. Then they crept into the very edge of the town, still unseen and unheard.

A few years ago, some fishermen (who wintered at Nova-Zembla), after they had been shut up in a hut for several days, _opened the window_, and the cold external air rushing in, instantly condensed the air of the hut, and the vapour (which was squeezed out) fell on the floor _in a shower of snow_.

While the youth was enacting the disgusting but expressive pantomime, Ruth watched the countenance of her child in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> breathless agony. She would have been relieved by a single glance of disapprobation, by a solitary movement of a rebellious muscle, or by the smallest sign that the tender nature of one so lovely, and otherwise so gentle, revolted at so unequivocal evidence of the barbarous practices of her adopted people.

In the country, among English woods and heaths the sun was still strong, and trees and bracken, withered heath, and reddening berries, burned and sparkled beneath it. But in the dingy bedroom of a dingy Bloomsbury hotel, with a film of fog over everything outside, there was no sun to be seen; the plane trees beyond the windows were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> leafless; and the dead leaves scudding and whirling along the dusty, airless streets, under a light wind, gave the last dreary touch to the scene that Nelly Sarratt was looking at.

Old Blowhard, however, nothing daunted, stood on, firm to his purpose of attacking the enemy and leaving the convoy time to escape.

All this was known to Lee but this unexpected meeting at a moment when privates were being mowed down like grass was a terrible shock and strain. Nevertheless, it was characteristic of the man that no change was made in the orders of the Rockbridge battery, which continued on its way to the post of danger and, with young Lee, gallantly performed the work he had called on it to do. By night the Confederates still held the field, but the struggle had cost them <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 11,000 men, reducing their force to less than 45,000, while McClellan, despite even heavier losses, had more than 74,000 left. Lee, accordingly, withdrew his army under cover of darkness to another part of the field and again awaited attack. But McClellan neither attacked nor attempted anything like a pursuit until his opponent was safely out of reach, being well satisfied with having checked the advance of his formidable foe and spoiled his plans. This he was certainly entitled...", "...II WILLIAM HENRY HAYSTON These were the first particulars I ever heard of the man who had afterwards so great an influence upon my destiny that no incident of my sojourn with him will ever be forgotten. A man with whom I went into the jaws of death and returned unhurt.

Our Captain's altercation with the crew <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> blossomed into a mutiny. This was compromised, however, one of the conditions of peace being that we should touch at Rurutu, one of the five islands forming the Tubuai group.

But, as her Majesty would soon notice, they lived mostly on vegetables and fruit, which were cheap, and they took their meals at the public eating-houses at the corners of the streets. Her Majesty was surprised to see all the carriages drawn by mules? But in Madrid horses were coming into fashion, which were much better. The late king had been frequently painted on his horse by one Velasquez, and it had a beautiful tail, which <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> swept the ground, and a long mane decorated with ribbons. Then, if the dreaded Camarera Mayor did not happen to be present, they would begin to talk about the fashions. Yes, Spanish ladies had quantities of splendid jewels, but they were not cut and set like those the queen wore. Many of the devout ones had belts made entirely of relics, and if their husbands were away it was customary for every wife to dress herself during his absence in grey or white. Indeed, as a rule it...", "...speed. In case of bringing down a burden, twice the number of turns are taken. As a matter of course, Seth was taught to leap from the building into a net, and later to aid in holding it, in which last exercise he learned that 'Lish Davis had not spoken falsely when he declared it was exceedingly hard work. It might not be entertaining to repeat all the lessons which Ninety-four's kid took part in; but suffice it to say that by the 1st of May Mr. Fernald announced that he was as <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> perfect in the drill as he could be until after having gained greater strength. \"You will participate in the exhibition, my boy, and I am expecting a good showing from you.\" \"Will Ninety-four's men be there?\" Seth asked eagerly, trying hard not to show how delighted he was by this praise. \"Surely; they are to take part in the parade, and you can see 'Lish Davis display his skill at driving.

The river is broader, the walls more sloping, and composed of black slates that stand on edge. These <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> vertical slates are washed out in places--that is, the softer beds are washed out between the harder, which are left standing. In this way curious little alcoves are formed, in which are quiet bays of water, but on a much smaller scale than the great bays and buttresses of Marble Canyon. The river is still rapid and we stop to let down with lines several times, but make greater progress, as we run ten miles. We camp on the right bank.

I would at least go to Marseilles, which I could reach that very night, and once there would be guided by circumstances, seeking only to control them to the extent of reporting my whereabouts to Henriette at Fuentellato, and to the Colonel via London as arranged. This as it proved was the very wisest course I could have adopted, as will presently appear. I was doomed to a long wait at Culoz. There was no train due westward till 12.40, and I had to put in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> three solid hours, which I spent in wandering into the village, where I found an unpretending _auberge_ and a rather uneatable breakfast. Everywhere I was met with wearisome delays. A slow train to Amberieu, a still slower cross journey to Lyons, which I did not reach till nearly 4 P.M., and learnt that another hour or more must elapse before the departure of the next Marseilles express. The journey seemed interminable, but just as I was losing all patience, I received a...", "...me was not one of lordly distinction; in fact, it was partly of the character of that I had already rejected in Cincinnati, but I hoped that in the smaller city its duties would not be so odious; and by the time I came to fill it, a change had taken place in the arrangements so that I was given charge of the news department. This included the literary notices and the book reviews, and I am afraid that I at once gave my prime attention to these. It was an evening paper, and I had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as much time for reading and study as I had at home. But now society began to claim a share of this leisure, which I by no means begrudged it. Society was very charming in Columbus then, with a pretty constant round of dances and suppers, and an easy cordiality, which I dare say young people still find in it everywhere. I met a great many cultivated people, chiefly young ladies, and there were several houses where we young fellows went and came almost as freely as if they...", "...to an exact science. Now, had there been an atom of pride in my composition I might have glorified myself, for it certainly seemed as if the heap upon the floor could never have come out of a single trunk. Clearly, Toddie was more of a general connoisseur than an amateur in packing. The method of his work I quickly discerned, and the discovery threw some light upon the size of the heap in front of my trunk. A dress-hat and its case, when their natural relationship is dissolved, occupy <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> twice as much space as before, even if the former contains a blacking-box not usually kept in it, and the latter contains a few cigars soaking in bay rum. The same might be said of a portable dressing-case and its contents, bought for me in Vienna by a brother ex-soldier, and designed by an old continental campaigner to be perfection itself. The straps which prevented the cover from falling entirely back had been cut, broken or parted in some way, and in its hollow lay my...", "...applauded vociferously! We packed with joyous anticipation. We were going home! After we got out of the theatre I made straight for a little hotel run by a New England woman and gorged myself on baked beans! On the way I ran across Arthur Hoops and Louis Payne. \"Governor,\" said Payne, \"if we turn up aboard the ship to-morrow a bit squiffy or with a hold-over, you won't mind, will you?\" \"Go to it,\" responded I. \"I may turn up that way myself.\" They kept their promise and I <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> kept mine! There were hundreds of people at the pier to see us off. I wondered if they were inspired by feelings of gratitude! It sounded like a courteous farewell but I was never sure. At Honolulu we had our first taste of the \"Welcome home\" we were all so fondly counting on.

It is sometimes suggested that the 'cello part is best omitted and these works played as violin sonatas. But experiment shows that in this condition much of the violin part sounds incomplete; and the truth appears to be that Haydn is thinking, like any modern composer, of the opposition of two solid bodies of tone--the pianoforte and the stringed instruments. And it will be found that the method of performance which most <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> justifies the instrumental effect of these otherwise beautiful works is that in which the pianoforte player regards himself as frequently doubling the stringed instruments, and not vice versa. He should therefore in all such passages play extremely lightly, so as to give the violin and 'cello the function of drawing the main outline. In the time of Bach such writing was beautifully suited to enliven the dry glitter of the harpsichord, and Bach's duets for clavier and violin seem...", "...at 2.15. For a quarter of an hour Mike was comparatively quiet. Adair, fortified by food and rest, was bowling really well, and his first half dozen overs had to be watched carefully. But the wicket was too good to give him a chance, and Mike, playing himself in again, proceeded to get to business once more. Bowlers came and went. Adair pounded away at one end with brief intervals between the attacks. Mr. Downing took a couple more overs, in one of which a horse, passing in the road, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> had its useful life cut suddenly short. Change bowlers of various actions and paces, each weirder and more futile than the last, tried their luck. But still the first-wicket stand continued. The bowling of a house team is all head and no body. The first pair probably have some idea of length and break. The first-change pair are poor. And the rest, the small change, are simply the sort of things one sees in dreams after a heavy supper, or when one is out without one's gun....", "...quay,\" as he burst into the kitchen where the family were gathered for breakfast. \"The baker's boy told me he could see them from the bakery. They came late last night, and are waiting to get permission from the mayor to put up their tents in the town.\" \"Oh, let's go and see them at once!\" said Marie and Germaine in the same breath. Jean quickly disposed of his breakfast by taking a slice of bread and eating it as he went. The quay presented a lively appearance indeed. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a dozen gaudily painted wagons, while near by were tethered the horses. The women were preparing the morning meal outside the wagons, which served for houses, while the men fed the horses or fished in the river, and the children played about, or followed the visitors with outstretched hands asking for pennies. \"I should like to give them something,\" said Marie, \"but you know they are not allowed to beg while they are in the village, and we should not encourage them to break...", "...of masters and scholars at Paris.\" Later the term _university_ became restricted to the meaning which we give it to-day.

Though this movement for association and the development of advanced study had manifested itself in a number of places by the close of the twelfth century, two places in particular led all the others and became types which were followed in charters and in new creations. These were Bologna and Paris. [9] After one or the other of these two <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the universities of western Europe were modeled. Bologna or Paris, or one of their immediate children, served as a pattern. Thus Bologna was the university mother for almost all the Italian universities; for Montpellier and Grenoble in southern France; for some of the Spanish universities; and for Glasgow, Upsala, Cracow, and for the Law Faculty at Oxford. Paris was the university mother for Oxford, and through her Cambridge; for most of the northern French universities; for...", "...on as he turned the handle of the door; and he walked somewhat more gently than usual into the room. \"Well, Fanny, how are you now?\" he said, as he crept up to her. \"You shouldn't brood over these sad thoughts.

He died before he had wasted his fortune and health, as he might have done:--this will always be a consolation.\" It was singular how <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> alike were the platitudes of the daughter and the father. The young man had not injured his name, or character, in the world, and had left his money behind him: and, therefore, his death was less grievous! Fanny did not answer, but she sat upright on the sofa as he came up to her--and he then sat down beside her. \"Perhaps I'm wrong, Fanny, to speak to you on other subjects so soon after the sad event of which we heard last night; but, on the whole, I think it better to do...", "...whom, perhaps, when under the patronage of Major Carbonnell, and the universal rapture from my supposed wealth, I had treated with hauteur, glad to receive the intelligence, and spread it far and wide. My _imposition_, as they pleased to term it, was the theme of every party, and many were the indignant remarks of the dowagers who had so often indirectly proposed to me their daughters; and if there was anyone more virulent than the rest, I hardly need say that it was Lady Maelstrom, who <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> killed her job horses in driving about from one acquaintance to another, to represent my unheard-of atrocity in presuming to deceive my betters. Harcourt, who had agreed to live with me--Harcourt, who had praised my magnanimity in making the disclosure--even Harcourt fell off; and about a fortnight after I had arrived in town, told me that not finding the lodgings so convenient as his former abode, he intended to return to it. He took a friendly leave; but I perceived that if we...", "...warmly for her kind thought, and then I wrote to Giles, and asked his opinion. I found that he entirely agreed with Aunt Philippa.

Miss Prudence will be less active there: I shall be allowed to enjoy a reasonable conversation without the speech--\"Oh, do please go away now, Giles; you have been here <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> an hour\"--that invariably closed our cottage interviews.' I could see Giles was really pleased with Aunt Philippa's proposition, so I promised to go back to Heathfield and settle my affairs, and join them directly the house in Brunswick Place was ready; and by the middle of October we were all settled comfortably for the winter.

Yet there was no driving sleet and darkness and wet and cold as off Cape Horn; and instead of stiff oilcloth suits, southwester caps, and thick boots, we had on hats, round jackets,...", "...century, is right, may have resulted from the influence of _An Essay on Man_. Or the _Essay_ may have been popular because it expressed ideas already in general acceptance. But whatever the explanation is, the catch-phrases extracted from Pope's most popular work become the touchstones of post-Augustan satire. The problem that the satirist faced in the sixties was, then, formidable. The country was in upheaval but the conventions demanded that the satirist say everything was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> perfect. As a result, satire tended toward personal whines, like _The Curate_, toward attacking tiresomely obvious objects, like the superficial chit-chat of Lloyd's _Conversation_, toward trivial quarrels, like Churchill's _Rosciad_, toward broadly unimpeachable morals, like Johnson's _The Vanity of Human Wishes_. It is understandable that many writers, such as Joseph Warton and Christopher Smart, abandoned satire for various kinds of enthusiasm. Methodism lent itself to such...", "...Those first teachers gave the Spanish language and Christian faith to a thousand aborigines, where we gave a new language and religion to one. There have been Spanish schools for Indians in America since 1524. By 1575--nearly a century before there was a printing-press in English America--many books in _twelve_ different Indian languages had been printed in the city of Mexico, whereas in our history John Eliot's Indian Bible stands alone; and three Spanish universities in America were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> rounding out their century when Harvard was founded. A surprisingly large proportion of the pioneers of America were college men; and intelligence went hand in hand with heroism in the early settlement of the New World. II. A MUDDLED GEOGRAPHY.

Had that three thousand miles of unknown sea been the chief obstacle, civilization would have overstepped...", "...It was strictly true; it was also true that Master Sam had outstayed his meal-time and a new customer might help to avert the probable storm awaiting him, as indeed it did. Mr. Gruner, greengrocer, was standing at the door of his shop looking both ways down the street at once, owing to a remarkable squint, and his reception of Sam was unfriendly, but quickly checked at the sight of his companion, whose extraordinary terms of intimacy with his errand boy rendered the good man <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> speechless. The young gent, however, ordered lettuces and green peas with a free hand and earned Sam's pardon, as anticipated by that far-sighted youth. The two boys said good-bye and Sam made no hint as to the possibilities of a future meeting, neither did Christopher, embarrassed by the presence of the greengrocer. He also would be late and hurried off, hoping he might still be in time to give Aymer tea and relate his adventures. He had no misgivings at all as to Caesar's...", "...\"your long sleep has refreshed you. Shall we try it to-night?

I must go to Violet.\" \"Ah, Violet!\" sighed Fulk. \"That was my poor wife's name too. I shall love your Violet. I will help you. I know more of the world than you do.\" The day passed slowly. They conversed in low tones <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the time. Aymer, led on by Fulk's gentle ways, frankly told him all his struggles, his disappointments, his hopes. Fulk was deeply interested. At last he said-- \"At ten we will do it, or perish. I have a mind,\" he said, \"to let you go alone; you are stronger than I am. Very likely my nervousness or weakness will spoil the whole enterprise; but you could do it certainly.\" \"I will not hear of such a thing,\" said Aymer; \"I will not attempt it without you.

In the third act, the Heavens are in a blaze of uproar. The rebellion is now widespread; and revolution is imminent. The whole act is one grand antithesis of the loyal and the seditious angels, or Luciferians, as the latter are called.

With wonderful art, our sympathy for the rank and file of the rebellious spirits is first awakened. One is made to feel that their disaffection is genuine and that their sorrow is unaffected.

It was Jenny who said \"how real!\" How fantastic, too, is the present! Sometimes, perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always, it tortures us with the unreality, the unrealisability of precious moments that are flying, flying, and can never come again; and at other times it equally eludes us with a sense of their indestructibility.

In the ninety years from the death of William III. (1702) to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War with France (1793) there are four serious wars, covering nearly thirty-five years. There is the long peace administration of Walpole, and there are the shorter intervals of rest following each of the contests. From the beginning of the war with the French Republic to the year of Waterloo there is a <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> unbroken war time of over twenty years. The forty years' peace is closed by the Crimean War (1854-56); and another forty years of peace ends with the South African War (1899-1902). During this time the older mercantilism passes into protectionism; and this, again, gives way before the gradual adoption of the free trade policy. At each time of war, taxation (particularly in the indirect form) and debt increase. Financial reform is connected with the maintenance of peace.

He was the acknowledged leader of the war element in the tribe. While lawless white men were thus destroying the buffalo, the Indians themselves were suffering for food. The agent for the Cheyenne reports that for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> four months preceding the outbreak the rations had fallen short, and expresses the opinion that if there had been a full supply he could have held the tribe from the warpath. At the same time they were being systematically robbed of their stock by organized bands of horse thieves.

The sound of a squeaking wheelbarrow had wakened her. Alec was trundling it around the house, with the parrot perched on it. The parrot loved to ride, and its silly laugh at every jolt of the squeaking barrow usually amused Lloyd, but to-day its harsh chatter annoyed her. \"Oh, deah!\" she...", "...so fragrant, so invigorating, which we breathe with all the avidity of a convalescent who for the first time crosses the threshold of his chamber.

Paraguay lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak export prices for agricultural commodities. In 1987 the economy experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural...", "...water as this might discolor these parts. Practically all market ducks from Long Island are scald picked at the present time. Dry picking which is demanded in some markets such as Boston makes a somewhat better looking carcass and also increases the value of the feathers, but is generally considered too slow and too highly skilled a process for use on the average duck farm. [Illustration: FIG. 45. Holding the head in one hand and the feet in the other, the picker dips the duck in water heated <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> to the boiling point and souses well to work the water into the feathers until they pluck easily.

In doing this the duck is held either on the lap or on a board nailed to the side of the feather box.

I think she is stopping with the Morgan Greytons, at their suburban place.\" The reporter gulped down a shout. \"Worked, by thunder!\" he exclaimed to himself. Then, in a deadly, forced calm: \"She attended the masked ball Thursday evening, didn't she?\" \"Well, she was invited.\" \"You didn't see her there?\" \"No. Who _is_ this?\" Then Hatch hung up the receiver. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> choking with excitement, for, in addition to all those virtues which have been enumerated, he possessed, too, the quality of enthusiasm. It was no part of his purpose to tell anybody anything. Mallory didn't know, he was confident, anything of the girl having been a possible guest at the ball. And what Mallory didn't know now wouldn't be found out, all of which was a sad reflection upon the detective. In this frame of mind Hatch started for the suburban place of the Greytons....", "...the free coinage of silver, but an expansion of the currency, cheaper money, and broader credit, and they also are largely represented on this floor in support of the proposition in favor of the free coinage of silver.

These are probably largely derived from the Mystery Plays; for the moral teaching has the same direct soundness. The ideas are often jocosely put, but the principle is one of mere retribution. The Devil cannot hurt the Saint and he pays out to the Wicked the exact price of his wrong-doing. Thus in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of what may be termed the Sin series there is a Recording Imp who bears a tablet or scroll, on which we are to suppose the evil commissions and omissions of the sinner are duly entered, entitling the fiend to take possession.

Neglect, cruelty, bitterness, scorn! What did the words mean? Like poisonous weeds they had grown fast and rank before his eyes, but in the burning face of this all-conquering love they had shrunk, withered and dead to the earth. Yes, it was the vile earth from which they had sprung, and it was in the radiant heavens that this great love was shining. Wanda's victory was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> complete. The only thing lacking to make it so was that she should renounce it altogether.

LEGENDS OF THE PROVINCE HOUSE I HOWE'S MASQUERADE One afternoon, last summer, while walking along Washington Street, my eye was attracted by a signboard protruding over a narrow archway, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> opposite the Old South Church. The sign represented the front of a stately edifice, which was designated as the \"OLD PROVINCE HOUSE, kept by Thomas Waite.\" I was glad to be thus reminded of a purpose, long entertained, of visiting and rambling over the mansion of the old royal governors of Massachusetts; and entering the arched passage, which penetrated through the middle of a brick row of shops, a few steps transported me from the busy heart of modern Boston into a small and...", "...Catholics are in the majority, because they had obtained seats in the House of Commons. On the boards of guardians the mass of the poor might expect that a majority of guardians would be prompted by national and religious feeling to sympathise with them, so that they would find in the master and matron, the doctor and the relieving officer, something like the natural tenderness which a common kindred and creed inspire. But half the guardians are _ex-officio_ members, as magistrates; <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all landlords and Protestants. They have in addition 'property votes,' and 'residence votes;' so that, with their influence over the elections, they are generally able to pack the board; and in that case the officials are almost invariably Protestants and conservatives.

But as their weapons were inferior [to the enemy's] and their powder had been exhausted, the Pampangos were finally defeated; <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two hundred were barbarously put to death, and forty others together with the alcalde and the other religious [70] who was in the convent, were taken prisoners.

But perhaps the best insight into the social state of Willenhall at this period will be obtained from a consideration of its inhabitants liable to pay a war tax which was levied by Edward III. in order to enable him to carry on a war of defence against Scotland. For this popular military expedition, Parliament in 1327 granted the youthful king a Subsidy to the amount of one-twentieth leviable upon the value of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all kinds of property. Assessors and collectors were appointed for every town and village, and they were sworn to make true returns of every man's goods and chattels, both in the house and out of it.

But being comparatively sober--as sober as <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> twenty-four hours of abstinence could make him--poor Hemburg was in a swirl of mental confusion. At that, out-mastered as he was, he made only one mistake. There were two stories lying in type, side by side, on the stone. One of them was to be played up in the leading position in the make-up. The other was to be dumped in the hell-box. That was the order, plain enough in his own mind. So one of them he dumped, and the other one he put in the forms to be printed.

Certain friends who have taken a kindly, if somewhat frivolous, interest in the compilation of this work have inquired if Sir Francis Drake was to be included; and it must be admitted that the question is not an easy one to answer. The most fervent patriot must admit that the early voyages of Drake were, to put it mildly, of a buccaneering kind, although his late voyages were more <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> akin to privateering cruises than piracy. But if, during the reign of King Philip, a Spaniard had been asked if Drake was a pirate, he would certainly have answered, \"Yes,\" and that without any hesitation whatever.

Many people who fell in love at first sight have made splendid marriages. But it does not always happen so. Sometimes this physical attraction remains the only bond between two people. Sometimes in the other departments of life they actually fret and annoy one another. Sometimes a friendship refuses to grow up. Sometimes even while the attraction still exists contempt lurks behind it. And that means that it is entirely unsafe to get engaged on the...", "...copyright royalties.

I really do not know how it was possible to tear myself out of Catherine's arms. But it is a fact that in jumping out of her carriage I <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fell on M. d'Asterac, whose tall figure leant against a tree on the roadside. Courteously I saluted him and showed the surprise I felt at this pleasant encounter. \"Chance,\" he said, \"lessens as knowledge grows; for me it is suppressed. I knew, my son, that I had to meet you at this place. It is necessary for me to have a conversation with you already too long delayed.

The town within and below is of the same material, the dull gray or drab so predominating as to give the place the somberness of a stone village of Wales.

It is noteworthy that those communities that are least embellished by nature are most prone to garb themselves in all the colors of the spectrum.

In this we were terribly disappointed, for at the end of the second day, after wading through deep snow, and frequently putting ashore to light a fire on account of the intense cold, we camped but a short distance below the Findlay Rapid. John's feet were frozen already, and all of us were touched in the face; there was always great difficulty in lighting a match with numbed fingers, but birch-bark was plentiful, and being readily inflammable was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> sure to blaze up at once. Our only remaining axe was almost useless from having been carelessly left for a night in the fire. Much of the snow had drifted off the ice and was lying three and four feet deep on the banks, increasing the labour of making camp and picking up firewood, for we were too weak to do any effectual chopping even if our axe had been in good condition. Without snow-shoes it was impossible to walk through the forest in the hope of finding grouse; and, after...", "...that the work of her husband and his friends should not be interrupted. In France the models migrate en masse to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where the painters congregate. The English models, however, wait patiently in London, as a rule, till the artists come back. Nearly all of them live with their parents, and help to support the house. They have every qualification for being immortalised in art except that of beautiful hands. The hands of the English model are <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always coarse and red. As for the male models, there is the veteran whom we have mentioned above. He has all the traditions of the grand style, and is rapidly disappearing with the school he represents. An old man who talks about Fuseli is, of course, unendurable, and, besides, patriarchs have ceased to be fashionable subjects. Then there is the true Academy model.

The ovary enlarges, and, with the seeds enclosed, constitutes the fruit, frequently incorporated with which are other parts of the flower, as receptacle, calyx, &c.

In this message, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of Mr. Roosevelt's later policies as President are presaged, and in it also are marked the spirit and phraseology which have done so much to make him the idol of the American middle class, and particularly of the social reformer.

In _Clubiona_ and _Drassus_ they are all <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> of the same size[1441]; and in the _Micrommata_ family they are very small[1442]. They vary also in _shape_. In _Scolopendra morsitans_ the three anterior ones are round, and the posterior one transverse, and somewhat triangular. In _Mygale calpeiana_, a spider, the two smallest are round and the rest oval[1443]. In the trapdoor or mason spider (_Mygale caementaria_), the four small internal ones are round, and the large external ones oval[1444]; and those that are...", "...that on the summit a fresh breeze blew. 'But look across there,' said Anne. There had entered upon the down from another direction several battalions of foot, in white kerseymere breeches and cloth gaiters. They seemed to be weary from a long march, the original black of their gaiters and boots being whity- brown with dust. Presently came regimental waggons, and the private canteen carts which followed at the end of a convoy. The space in front of the mill-pond was now occupied by <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the inhabitants of the village, who had turned out in alarm, and remained for pleasure, their eyes lighted up with interest in what they saw; for trappings and regimentals, war horses and men, in towns an attraction, were here almost a sublimity.

And when the feast was over, I had the best surprise of all. Unknown to my mother, I had begged from my Aunt Betsy my own father's portrait, and I had hung that opposite the window, and now I drew the curtain that hid it, and told my sweetheart that this and the house were her birthday presents for this year! . . . . . . . . And this was the beginning of a happy life, which lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> twelve years. I could make a long story of it, for there was an adventure in everything,--in the way we bought our milk, and the way we took in our coals. But there is no room for me to tell all that, and it might not interest other people as it does me. I am sure my mother was never sorry for the bold step she took when we moved there from our tenement. True, she saw little or no society, but she had not seen much before. The conditions of our life were such that she did...", "...and blankets are also worn. These articles, too, are made at home. While the mother is the dressmaker and tailor, the father is the family shoemaker. A few of the Zuni girls have dresses like those of American girls. These clothes have come to them through the mission-school which adjoins the village. The Zunis have a language of their own--no very easy one for boys and girls to learn, judging from its many-syllabled, harsh-sounding words. They also speak a little Spanish, as does <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> everybody in New Mexico. The little Zunis amuse themselves with running, wrestling, jumping, and playing at grown folks, just as civilized children do. They have their bows and arrows, their rag-dolls,--strapped like real babies to cradles,--and their shinny sticks and balls. The children also make themselves useful at home. The older girls take care of their younger brothers and sisters, and the boys tend the goats. There are large herds of goats belonging to the village,...", "...a position to try and escape the horrible death that seemed my fate. \"But no, the handle was far out of my reach; and I groaned and wept at my helpless condition. The press held me by the chest with awful power, but my hands and arms were at liberty; while my head hanging down backwards enabled me to see the flames creeping along faster and faster, as I saw them reversed, and began to calculate how long it would be before they would reach me and end my misery. \"All at once, when <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fainting, my hand came in contact with the iron bar used to lengthen the handle of the pump, to force in the water with more ease when greater power was required; and then my heart gave a leap as I thought I might be able to strike the handle of the tap and let out the water. \"I grasped the bar, and then I began swinging it about slowly, to try and strike the tap; but in vain, for I could do nothing with it from only being able to swing it at random, for I could not see....", "...with Bent waited anxiously for news of the fight. Was it a victory or a defeat? Soon, the first of the defenders of the _pa_ dropped into camp, blood-stained and angry. And then, as the afternoon went on, the rest straggled in. Many were wounded, and seven dead bodies were carried in on hastily made litters of supplejack vines lashed to poles. Then the full story of the battle was told. It was a sad and angry camp, that remote pocket between the hills. Most of the Hauhaus came in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> naked, just as they had jumped up when the first shot was fired in the grey dawn. They were desperately sullen and grief-stricken over their dead and the loss of their stronghold, which to them had seemed almost impregnable, for it was the strongest stockaded position they had yet built. Many a dark look was bent upon the white man as he sat by one of the fires, not daring to speak a word. That night the camp was suddenly abandoned by order of the Hauhau leader, who feared...", "...faulty footwork. The other point of importance which I have mentioned in connection with the short swing, is that it comes much more naturally to the player to hit downwards. Probably not one golfer in a hundred realises that the vast majority of his strokes are made in a manner wholly opposed to the best science of golf. They are, generally speaking, _hit upwards_, whereas the most perfect golf drive should be hit downwards, and this statement is, in perhaps a less degree, true of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all golf strokes which are not played on the green. The best way to get any ordinary ball into the air is to hit it upwards, but this general rule does not apply to the golf ball, for it is always stationary and is generally lying on turf. However, few players will trust the loft of the club to perform its natural function. They seem to forget that each club has been made with a loft of such a nature that, given the ball is struck fairly and properly, the loft may be relied on...", "...\"Well, it's too late now.

The existence then of a meteoric swarm, moving in the same track, is not the only evidence of the original comet's partial dissolution. The comet of 1866 was invisible to the naked eye; that of 1366, seen under nearly similar circumstances, was a conspicuous object. The statement of the Chinese historian that \"it appeared <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as large as a tow measure,\"[19] though somewhat indefinite, certainly justifies the conclusion that its magnitude has greatly diminished during the last 500 years.

On cold days people manage to get some warmth by crowding together; and you can warm your mind in the same way--by bringing it into contact with others.

I have written a little fable illustrating this: it may be found elsewhere.[1] As a general rule, it may be said that a man's sociability stands very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> in inverse ratio to his intellectual value: to say that \"so and so\" is very unsociable, is almost tantamount to saying that he is a man of great capacity.

The woman's husband had been active with the mob, and had not returned home until <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dawn. He was gone now to find out what the general result had been. While we were still talking he came back from his quest. His report was revolting enough. Eighteen persons hanged or butchered, and two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire. \"And how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults?\" \"Thirteen.\" \"Then every one of them was lost?\" \"Yes, all.\" \"But the people arrived in time to save the family; how is it they could save none of the...", "...my wildest follies, in my rashest acts, I have thought of you and loved you. I have remembered you with affection, and with grief, and with tenderness. Memory, sad memory, has come upon me in the midst of the maddest efforts for gaiety, and cast me into a fit of deep, anxious, sorrowful, repentant, remorseful thought, which I could not shake off: it seemed as if some vengeful spirit seized upon me for its prey, and dinned in my ears the name of love and Caroline, till my heart was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> broken.\" \"And the moment after,\" she said, \"what was it, Sherbrooke, that you did? Did you sit down and write to Caroline, to her who was giving every thought to you? or did you fly to the side of some gay coquette, to dissipate such painful thoughts in her society? or did you fly to worse, Sherbrooke?\" He was silent. \"Sherbrooke,\" she added, after a time, \"I wish not to reproach you. All I wish is to justify myself, and the firm unchangeable resolution which I have been...", "...a city. Even at this unseemly hour we are visited by an owlish pedler, whose boat is fitted up with boxes containing various dishes toothsome to the heathen palates of the water-men. Yung Po and Ah Sum look wistfully over the ancient pastry-ped-ler's wares, and pick out tiny dishes of sweetened rice gruel; this they consume with the same unutterable satisfaction that hungry monkeys display when eating chestnuts, ending the performance by licking the platters. Although the price is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a farthing a dish, with wanton prodigality Yung Po orders dishes for the whole company, including even his passenger! From various indications, it is surmised, as I seek my couch, that the city opposite is Chao-choo-foo. Inquiry to that effect, as usual, elicits nothing but a bland grin from Yung Po. When, however, he takes the unnecessary precaution of warning me not to venture outside the covered sleeping quarters during the night, intimating that I should probably get...", "...From the head waters of the Illinois a portage was made to Lake Michigan, and the French returned to the Bay of the Puans alongshore. They had traveled over twenty-five hundred miles, and accomplished the object of their journey. Jolliet, with his canoe of voyageurs, his maps and papers, and the young Indian boy given him by the Illinois chief, went on to Montreal. His canoe was upset in the rapids of Lachine just above Montreal, and he lost two men, the Indian boy, his papers, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> everything except his life. But he was able to report to the governor all that he had seen and done. Marquette lay ill, at the Bay of the Puans, of dysentery, brought on by hardship; and he was never well again. Being determined, however, to go back and preach to the tribe on the Illinois River, he waited all winter and all the next summer to regain his strength. He carefully wrote out and sent to Canada the story of his discoveries and labors. In autumn, with Pierre Porteret...", "...the top of a hill I would dismount, and leaving my horse with Meyers, would crawl to the summit of the hill and peep over in order to discover whether or not the Indians were in sight, and then return, mount my horse and ride at a rapid gait until near the top of another hill, when the same maneuver would be repeated. At last we came to a sharp ridge and I dismounted. I remarked that if we did not find those Indians soon we would have to make another dry camp that night. It was now <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> sunset, and on crawling to the top of the ridge and looking down on a nice little valley not more than a half-mile distant, I saw that they had just gone into camp and had not yet got all their ponies unpacked. I had a good chance to make a rough estimate of their number, which I thought to be about two hundred warriors. I rushed back to Meyers and told him that I had located them, and that one of us would have to ride back to headquarters that night and report, and asked...", "...that the negroes, liberated, would labor twice as well as when enslaved. But what was the result? Ten years after final emancipation was effected, the exports of sugar from Jamaica were only 67,539,200 lbs. a year, instead of 234,700,000 lbs., as in 1805-6. The exports of coffee, during the same year, were reduced to 5,684,921 lbs., instead of 23,625,377 lbs., as in 1805-6; and the extinction of the cultivation of cotton, for export, had become almost complete, though in 1800, it had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> equaled that of the United States. These are no fancy sketches, drawn for effect, but sober realities, attested by the public documents of the British government.[57] The Jamaica negro, ignorant and destitute of forethought, disappointed the English philanthropists. In Hayti, emancipation had been productive of results, fully as disastrous to its commerce, as it had been to that of Jamaica. There was an almost total abandonment of the production of sugar, soon after freedom...", "...ejaculated and relapsed into quiet again. The two women glanced at Tory and then at Edith Linder, who was at this instant coming across the yard with the tea. The two girls were an apt illustration of Memory Frean's last expressed opinion. Edith had grown tall in the past year. Her features were large and a little coarse, but handsome in their own fashion. There was about her a look of capacity. If she had desired she could easily have lifted and carried the other girl who was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> her own age. Edith's family had been small farmers for generations. Tory Drew's had been students and artists and writers. She had no appearance of physical strength and yet her vitality was probably as great. She looked admiringly at the other girl. \"Edith is splendid. She knows more of cooking and practical things than any girl in camp. She was trying to teach me to cook and we were together a good deal of the time before Kara's accident. Now I see little of any of the...", "...and I guessed you was a-lookin' for more help, and I don't often guess wrong, neither.

May I ask why you felt so sure that the letter sent to your care was from me, or had anything to do with my need of more help in this business?\" The smile and wink which prefaced his reply <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> proved the last straw. Quietly reaching below the counter, Constance pressed an electric button. She had been wise beyond her years when she had this connection made between her Arch and Charles' counter. Sniffins did not notice the motion. \"Well, you see, I'm boss in my own house and run the wimmin-folks.

Most of the youths of Morlaix wear the big, flapping hat, but very often a black cloth cap is also seen. This is ridiculous rather than picturesque, for so long is it that with almost every movement it tips over the wearer's nose. The tunic accompanying either hat or cap is of blue flannel, and over it is worn a black waistcoat. The porters of the market-places wear a sort of smock. The young boys of Morlaix dress very like their elders, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of them wear the long loose cap, with the difference that a tasselled end dangles down the back.

Port!\" Then the murk closed down, and with our friends far astern of us we were racing deeper into the fog banks--speeding seaward; though of this I was unable to judge at the time. On we raced, and on, sweeping over growing swells. Once, a black, towering shape dropped down upon us. Far above, lights blazed, bells rang, vague cries pierced the fog. The launch pitched and rolled perilously, but weathered the wash of the liner which so <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> had concluded this episode. It was such a journey as I had taken once before, early in our pursuit of the genius of the Yellow Peril; but this was infinitely more terrible; for now we were utterly in Fu-Manchu's power.

The day wore on, with turns being taken in the watching, the two girls and Aunt Georgie insisting upon aiding, their sight being sharp enough they declared, so that the defenders of the little fort were able to get more sleep, and prepare for the night attacks which were sure to come. The sun was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> ready to dip when the sleepers rose and prepared for the evening meal. The cows had been milked and gone quietly away; and, trying hard to look cheerful, Mrs Bedford summoned all but German and Rifle to the table, where there was no sign of diminution of the supply as yet. This was the one pleasant hour of the day, for experience had taught them that the blacks would run no risk of coming within range of the deadly guns till after dark, and the heat was giving place to the...", "...very short time. The game is in such plenty that it has become a mere amusement to supply the party with provisions. We made twenty-five miles to a clump of trees on the north where we passed the night. Tuesday 7. The morning was pleasant and we proceeded at an early hour. There is much driftwood floating, and what is contrary to our expectation, although the river is rising, the water is somewhat clearer than usual. At eleven o'clock the wind became so high that one of the boats was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> sunk, and we were obliged to stop till one, when we proceeded on, and encamped on the south, above a large sandbar projecting from the north, having made fifteen miles. On the north side of the river are the most beautiful plains we have yet seen: they rise gradually from the low grounds on the water to the height of fifty or sixty feet, and then extend in an unbroken level as far as the eye can reach: the hills on the south are more broken and higher, though at some distance...", "...more right to this old house than you Kenways have, and she's going to get her rights.\" That made Dot cry, and Tess looked dreadfully serious. Agnes was too angry to play with the girl any more, and Ruth, even, gave her up as impossible. Lillie wandered off by herself, for her mother would not be bothered with her just then. When Mrs. McCall went out into the kitchen that afternoon to start dinner, she missed the bag of dried apples that had been left on the table. There had been <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> four pounds of them. \"What under the canopy's become of that bag?\" demanded the good lady. \"This is getting too much, I declare.

I couldn't be sure about the cookies and doughnuts, and the pie. \"But there that bag of dried apples stood, and there it _isn't_ now! What do you know about such crazy actions?\" she demanded of Ruth, who had come at her call. \"Why! it's a mystery,\" gasped the...", "...more days dragged by their torturous lengths, and except for its own little lonely click, the drift-ice radio brought no other sound.

But there was Van Granger to be thought of, sick and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> helpless.

It became obvious, therefore, from their thus changing place, that they were not constructing a nest, but merely quarrying for clay as a building material. By catching one of the bees (_Osmia bicornis_) when it was loaded with its burden, we ascertained that the clay was not only carefully kneaded, but was also more moist than the mass from which it had been taken. The bee, therefore, in preparing the pellet, which was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as large as a garden-pea, had moistened it with its saliva, or some similar fluid, to render it, we may suppose, more tenacious, and better fitted for building. The reason of their digging a hole, instead of taking clay indiscriminately from the bank, appeared to be for the purpose of economizing their saliva, as the weather was dry, and the clay at the surface was parched and hard. It must have been this circumstance which induced them to prefer digging a hole, as it were, in...", "...on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog, though appearing so different, are really varieties most closely allied, and have probably descended from the same wild stock; hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other: I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies, I found that the puppies had not <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> acquired their full amount of proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no means acquired their...", "...Railway is conveyed on a Sunday by a mail-cart, expressly running on that day between Cambridge and Wolverton, through Newport Pagnel, a distance of 47 miles--an arrangement involving an expense of L148 per annum (L98 for the cart and L50 for additional sorting at Newport Pagnel), besides a direct increase in Sunday occupation. 12.

This view is taken because it was not until <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a year afterward that Negroes began to move in numbers sufficiently large to attract public notice. The Negro migration in its truest sense, therefore, had its beginning in 1916 and was precipitated as follows: \"A national philanthropic organization arranged with some Northern tobacco growers to import Negro students from some of the Southern private institutions for summer work and early in May, 1916, brought the first two trainloads from Georgia. Then the agent of a large...", "...are not meant for rough roads,' replied the king, 'but for walking about the smooth paths of the mountain, for we have many wonders to show you.'

'Little King Loc,' said Abeille again--and this time her voice trembled--'let me go back to my mother and Youri, and I will love you with all my heart, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as well as I love them.' 'Who is Youri?' asked King Loc. 'Why--Youri--who has lived with us since I was a baby,' replied Abeille; surprised that he did not know what everyone else was aware of, and never guessing that by mentioning the boy she was sealing her own fate. For King Loc had already thought what a good wife she would make him in a few years' time, and he did not want Youri to come between them.

On one side the prostitute is disinclined to enter into a slavery which usually fails even to bring her any reward; on the other side her client feels it as part of the fascination of prostitution under civilized conditions that he shall enjoy a freedom and choice the brothel cannot provide.[212] Thus it comes about that brothels which once contained <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the women who made it a business to minister to the sexual needs of men, now contain only a decreasing minority, and that the transformation of cloistered prostitution into free prostitution is approved by many social reformers as a gain to the cause of morality.[213] The decay of brothels, whether as cause or as effect, has been associated with a vast increase of prostitution outside brothels. But the repugnance to brothels in many essential respects also applies to...", "...he had walked, he was at school the next morning, and if on day duty, he did not go to bed until he had attended the night class. I cannot say that Danny liked this, for he would much rather have gone with the other boys on their pleasure excursions about the city, but Mr. Kean had urged Danny to put in all the time he could spare in school. He promised him that if he did so he would find him a better position when he was far enough advanced to take one. One evening, when it was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> time for Danny to go off duty, a messenger call came in the office, and as he was \"next\" he had to answer it. It took him to a big fashionable house where he had often been before, and he expected as usual to have a short errand with a note to some neighboring house or shop.

One of the great inconveniences and discomforts of a sister-nurse is the clothes which she is compelled to wear.

Our petticoats and stockings are the only garments that are changed in weight for the different temperatures. We are allowed two garbs at a time, but a sister wears one <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the time until it is worn out. All the cleaning these garbs get is a little brushing with soap and water, and when it gets discolored, it is dyed to its original color. One of these garbs I had for twelve years, and when I discarded it, there was only a small piece of the original left.

For nearly five years he had been jogging along pretty comfortably in Laysford, to the great joy of his much-tried wife; but his position as editor of the _Leader_, which represented the dominant party in local politics, made him much sought after by scheming public men, and in the end brought his old weakness for what is ironically called \"social life\" to the top.

My first view of this spot was about a fortnight after the birds had chosen it. I arrived there <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two hours before sunset. Few pigeons were then to be seen, but a great number of persons with horses and wagons, guns and ammunition, had already established different camps on the borders.

Knowing nothing of the science of music, I am not always looking for defects, or listening for discords.

Music has been, I suppose, a gradual growth, subject to the law of evolution; as <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> everything, with the possible exception of theology, has been and is under this law. Music may be divided into three kinds: First, the music of simple time, without any particular emphasis--and this may be called the music of the heels; second, music in which time is varied, in which there is the eager haste and the delicious delay, that is, the fast and slow, in accordance with our feelings, with our emotions--and this may be called the music of the heart; third, the music...", "...instead of 2y by a day's labor, and B would get 1-1/3x instead of 1x for a day's labor (2x for 1-1/2 day's labor instead of for two days').

Their temporary advance is attributable solely to the inclement weather during 1912.

In fact, it aroused considerable controversy, some maintaining that so far from being an advance on, it lacked the admitted promise of \"The Prodigal Son\"; while others were equally pronounced in their views as to its superlative merits.

That \"The Light of the World\" contains much that is beautiful is not denied, but that it contains some that <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> verges on the common-place, cannot, I am afraid, but be admitted. It has fallen into desuetude for many years now. In a short summary of Sir Arthur Sullivan's career, as this must, necessarily be, I have to leave unrecorded much that is both interesting and important.[34] I content myself, therefore, with some reference to those works upon which his fame, so far as serious music is concerned, will chiefly rest. \"The Martyr of Antioch\" was produced at the Leeds Festival in...", "...Kellermann joined him at St Menehould on the 19th of September. Valmy. Brunswick meanwhile had passed the northern defiles and had then swung round to cut off Dumouriez from Chalons. At the moment when the Prussian manoeuvre was nearly completed, Kellermann, commanding in Dumouriez's momentary absence, advanced his left wing and took up a position between St Menehould and Valmy. The result was the world-renowned Cannonade of Valmy (September 20, 1792). Kellermann's infantry, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all regulars, stood steady. The French artillery justified its reputation as the best in Europe, and eventually, with no more than a half-hearted infantry attack, the duke broke off the action and retired. This trivial engagement was the turning-point of the campaign and a landmark in the world's history. Ten days later, without firing another shot, the invading army began its retreat. Dumouriez's pursuit was not seriously pressed; he occupied himself chiefly with a series of...", "...old, crazy, and miserably weak for the ordeal that lay before her; and it was not in my power to remedy so serious a defect as tint.

Fortunately, there was such a sail on board,--a small lug-sail made of stout canvas, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> new,--which was intended to be substituted for the lateen on those rare occasions when the little craft might be caught in heavy weather; and this sail I now proceeded to drag up from below and bend to its yard; after which I lowered away the lateen, laid it fore and aft the deck, and made it up, securing it as well as I could by passing innumerable turns of a light warp round it; after which I firmly lashed it to the bulwarks with as many lashings as I could find pins or cleats...", "...wait a whoile an' see about thot, me b'y,\" said Barney Mulloy, who had overheard the remark. \"Frankie is as full av surproises as a horrunet's nest is full av stings.\" CHAPTER XXIV.

Through it all Rains kept the lead, but the village lad was second until the turning point was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> reached. Then Merriwell settled down to business and took second place, while Hodge pushed the village boy hard. Rains' heart was full of triumph. Over and over he told himself: \"At last I have found something at which I can defeat Merriwell fairly!\" Rains believed he was safely in advance, and this delusion was not broken till the last half mile of the course was struck. Then he heard somebody's skates ringing close behind, and, looking over his shoulder, he saw Frank...", "...in his agony. \"I'll do everything you tell me to, if you won't strike me again!\" This piteous appeal seemed to have no effect upon the cruel man, and he continued to whip the boy, despite his cries and entreaties, until his arm fairly ached from the exertion, and Toby's body was crossed and recrossed with the livid marks of the cane. \"Now, let's see whether you'll 'tend to your work or not!\" said the man as he flung Toby from him with such force that the boy staggered, reeled, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fell into the little brook that flowed by the roadside. \"I'll make you understand that all the friends you've whined around in this show can't save you from a lickin' when I get ready to give you one!

In the next four years, during which we continued to live at Greenhay, nothing memorable occurred, except, indeed, that troubled parenthesis in my life which connected me with my brother William,--this certainly was memorable to myself,--and, secondly, the visit of a most eccentric young woman, who, about nine years later, drew the eyes of all England upon herself by her unprincipled conduct in an affair affecting the life of two Oxonian undergraduates. She was...", "...my mind. I hate talking about it, but you know how things are with me. Freddie must have told you.

And didn't you find that the only possible thing to do was to work and work and work as hard as ever you could? When I first came to America, I <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> went mad. Uncle Chris sent me down to a place on Long Island, and I had nothing to do all day but think. I couldn't stand it. I ran away and came to New York and met Nelly Bryant and got this work to do. It saved me. It kept me busy all day and tired me out and didn't give me time to think. The harder it is, the better it suits me. It's an antidote. I simply wouldn't give it up now.

The longshore wiseacres shook their heads when they heard of it, and spoke of the foolhardiness of sailing across Channel in so tiny a vessel.

An Australian native is said to have once <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> died of fright because the shadow of his mother-in-law fell on his legs as he lay asleep under a tree. The awe and dread with which the untutored savage contemplates his mother-in-law are amongst the most familiar facts of anthropology.

The way across the quicksands had been so level that we had walked, counting our paces mechanically, but now in every movement there was danger, and terror gripped my heart with a gauntlet of steel.

It is a hydrous uranium and calcium phosphate, Ca(UO_2)_2(PO_4)_2 + 8(or 12)H_2O.

The Doctor's house has not yet received the compliment of a description, and it is now high time that the omission were supplied, for the house is itself an actor in the story, and one whose part is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> at an end. Two stories in height, walls of a warm yellow, tiles of an ancient ruddy brown diversified with moss and lichen, it stood with one wall to the street in the angle of the Doctor's property. It was roomy, draughty, and inconvenient. The large rafters were here and there engraven with rude marks and patterns; the handrail of the stair was carved in countrified arabesque; a stout timber pillar, which did duty to support the dining-room roof, bore mysterious characters...", "...dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep. \"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened, as it were instinctively, finding myself so desolate.

Here they conversed in low, eager tones for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a quarter of an hour. Jerry and Hamp looked on with some curiosity and suspicion. They were afraid that Raikes was coaxing Sparwick to turn traitor. But the end of the palaver did not confirm this supposition. When the men returned, their relations were evidently the same as before. Raikes looked moody and downcast. Sparwick's impassive face told nothing.

At times he seemed much stronger, and those who loved him believed he would recover. But by degrees their hopes faded, and in September he died. Once again the sorrowing nation followed their President to the grave, and once again the Vice-President took office as President. The new President was named Chester A. Arthur, and on taking office he was less known to the country than any President before him. He came to office in a...", "...talents of the old newsmen were most frequently exercised on mysterious appearances in the air, floods, fires, and frosts, earthquakes and upheavings of the sea.

According to the testimony of an eye-witness, 'The people kept trades on the Thames as in a fair, till February 4, 1684. About forty coaches daily plied on the Thames as on drye land.'

And, like her predecessors in that room, she told no one of the hoard. Most of the bags contained guineas of George I., George II., and George III., down to the year 1816, when the Mint left off coining guineas. A few contained sovereigns of later date; but the family savings since that year had been small and uncertain. The really fat time--the prosperous time--when the money poured in, was during the long war which lasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> five-and-twenty years. There were actually forty of these bags. Armorel laid them out upon the table and counted them. Forty! And each bag to all appearance, for she only counted two, contained five hundred guineas or pounds. Forty times five hundred--that makes twenty thousand pounds, if all were sovereigns!

A squall seemed coming on, and as I have a horror of small boats at sea, and from all I could learn Watelai village was not a place to stop at (no birds of Paradise being found there), I determined to return and go to a village I had heard of up a tributary of the Watelai river, and situated <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> in the centre of the mainland of Aru. The people there were said to be good, and to be accustomed to hunting and bird-catching, being too far inland to get any part of their food from the sea. While I was deciding this point the squall burst upon us, and soon raised a rolling sea in the shallow water, which upset an oil bottle and a lamp, broke some of my crockery, and threw us all into confusion.

In the spring of 1862 I was called by the bishop of the Clara ward to drive an ox team to Omaha on the Missouri river, to get some cotton gins and spinning jennies for the benefit of the ward. Leaving my family camped in a tent, I responded to the call, driving my own team, and crossing the plains in John R. Murdock's train. At Omaha I found my Brother Joseph W., who had charge of the Church immigration, lying at the point of death. He had been knocked down by lightning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> crushed to death by baled wagon beds that were blown upon him during the terrible storm. Under the blessing of God, and with careful nursing, his life was preserved. For three weeks I aided in purchasing teams for the immigrants, and brought up the rear end of that year's emigration. After all our companies had started back, I received orders, by telegram from President Young, to buy more teams and wagons and to clear out the Church warehouse at Florence.

She did not say what she meant to do with that hour, but she spent a quarter of it examining the stable and everything in it.

Leave a body alone, free from all friction or other retarding forces, and it will go on for ever. The planetary motion through empty space therefore wants no keeping up; it is not the motion that demands a force to maintain it, it is the curvature of the path that needs a force to produce it continually. The motion of a planet is approximately uniform so far as speed is concerned, but it is not constant in direction; it is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a circle. The real force needed is not a propelling but a deflecting force. The second law asserts that when a force acts, the motion changes, either in speed or in direction, or both, at a pace proportional to the magnitude of the force, and in the same direction as that in which the force acts. Now since it is almost solely in direction that planetary motion alters, a deflecting force only is needed; a force at right angles to the direction of motion, a force normal to the...", "...recourse to the spirits of wine thermometer, which never freezes.

He was, however, evidently somewhat embarrassed respecting the validity of his title to command.

But nothing more definite was known of the Tenor's labours than was known of anything else concerning him; and, fortunately for himself, there was that in his bearing which preserved him from being personally annoyed by impertinent curiosity, so that he was most probably pretty <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the only person in the city who had no idea of the interest he himself excited. Two years had glided by in great apparent tranquillity since the day the Tenor entered the choir; two years, during which he had trodden the path of life so uprightly, and so purely, that not even a suspicion of wrong-doing was ever breathed against him by gentle or simple, good or bad. It was a calm and passionless existence that he led, the life of an ascetic, but of a cultivated ascetic, devoted...", "...were therefore granted, with a reservation of the right of the Crown in case the quay should be resolved on or the frontage required for government purposes. This scheme was afterwards abandoned by Government, and the licences remained unrepealed.

The teeth are got out for length, breadth, and thickness at the pitch line as follows: The lumber from which they are cut should be very straight grained, and should be first cut into strips of a width and thickness slightly greater than that of the teeth at the pitch line. These strips (which should be about two feet long) should then be planed down on the sides to very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> the thickness of the tooth at the pitch line, and hollow on one edge to fit the curvature of the wheel rim. From these strips, pieces a trifle longer than the breadth of the wheel rim are cut, these forming the teeth. The pieces are then planed on the ends to the exact width of the wheel rim. To facilitate this planing a number of the pieces or blank teeth may be set in a frame, as in Figs. 148 and 149, in which A is a piece having the blocks B B affixed to it.

The 14th, 15th, and 22d of May, it froze pretty sharply, accompanied by the north and north-west winds, and I then likewise observed that all those sheltered from the wind were very much injured, but that all those which were exposed thereto had suffered but very little.

The Insurance Act has been the means of a more startling propaganda. The results following the working of this Act shew that although women are longer lived than men, they have considerably more sickness. The claims of women for sick benefit had been underestimated, and many local insurance societies became <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> insolvent in consequence. A cry of malingering was raised in various quarters, and we were asked to believe that excessive claims could be prevented by stricter and more careful administration. This solution of the problem, however, is quite inadequate to explain the facts. There may have been some malingering, but it has occurred chiefly in cases where the earnings of the workers were so low as to be scarcely above the sickness benefit provided by the Act, or even below it.

Then Dara was on the other side of the blazing yellow star. It took time to reach it.

They were simply marvellous. Their works in cotton and wool exceeded in fineness anything known in Europe at that time. They had carried irrigation, agriculture, and the cutting of gems to a point equal to that of the Old World.

Akin to transportation is communication:--but in communication, one may reasonably feel that we have arrived almost at the boundary line, not only of the possible but even the desirable.

The wireless telephone is following fast on the heels of the wireless telegraph; and by it we can already telephone hundreds of miles between stations on land and sea, and carry on conversation for several miles between fast moving aeroplanes.

We visited the wreck with the natives, who directed us to the spot. We saw a part of her quarter deck, with the ice piled up around it.

They have a long fast called _Soum el kebir_, and it is sometimes <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> sixty days long. One year the fast commenced, and the priest had blundered so often that he went to the bishop and asked him to teach him some way to count the days to the Easter feast.

This matting, which is made about a foot and a half in width, and in rolls of great length, is fastened either with twine or wire to the vine-stakes; and it is estimated that half a dozen men can fix <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 11,000 yards of it, or sufficient to roof over 2-1/2 acres of vines, during an ordinary day. To carry out the system properly, a double row of tall and short stakes connected with iron wires has to be provided.

She never told the doctor of this incident, and in time it became a mere shadow in the background, so that she was again his happy housekeeper, but that was because she had found strength to break with Tommy.

Birds were rare, and being perfectly silent at this season, their notes did not betray their whereabouts. The evening was drawing on. I considered whether I could manage to set any traps. It would take time to construct them, and I was starving. As I wandered along, I found myself again near the borders of the wood with a thick bush near me. At that moment I caught sight of an animal of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> three feet in length, which I at once recognised as a \"peeshoo,\" as the French Canadians call it, though properly denominated the Canadian lynx. Its fur was of a dark grey, freckled with black. It had powerful limbs, and thick, heavily-made feet. It was still when I first caught sight of it, but presently it commenced a succession of bounds with its back slightly arched, all the feet coming to the ground at the same moment. Instead of moving forward in a direct line, I...", "...lunar caustic and traced out Alpha Kappa Phi on my chest. It didn't do anything just then, but the next day it turned all black.

After I was branded they took me up some stairs and down some more. I was still blindfolded, you know. They said to me, \"You must jump the last fifteen steps.\" Well, I jumped and it was just one step and it <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> ruined me. Then there were some more things like having to stand on your head and sing the first verse of the school song. They helped you a little by holding up your feet. And you had to get down on the floor and scramble like an egg. Then there was something very impressive. They took the bandage off and I was standing just in front of a skull.

Just...", "...him, and as he drew it forth, a letter likewise was pulled from his pocket and fell upon the floor. It was the note addressed to the Candidate Gottlieb Pigglewitch, which he had received a few hours before. Egon had forgotten it; he picked it up now and carried it to the table, where a light was burning. His thoughts had taken another turn; the momentary disgust at the thought of his revolver vanished, he contemplated it with a half-smile, and his thoughts ran thus: \"I had very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> thrown you away forever, old friend. It was only an accident, the appearance of this wretched letter, which prevented me from yielding to the impulse of the moment. Shall I never, then, be master of myself?

There is no danger in it for me, except by my own will, by my being too great a...", "...and taking Dorothy's arm, led her from the room into a long dim-lighted corridor. Arrived at the end of it, where a second passage met it at right angles, she stopped at a door facing them. 'I think we shall find my lord of Worcester here,' she said in a whisper, as she knocked and waited a response. 'He is not here,' she said. 'He expects me to call on him as I pass. We must make haste.' The second passage, in which were several curves and sharp turns, led them to a large room, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> square, in which were two tables covered for about thirty. By the door and along the sides of the room were a good many gentlemen, some of them very plainly dressed, and others in gayer attire, amongst whom Dorothy, as they passed through, recognised her cousin Scudamore. Whether he saw and knew her she could not tell. Crossing a small antechamber they entered the drawing-room, where stood and sat talking a number of ladies and gentlemen, to some of whom lady Margaret spoke and...", "...are about the size of a small pea.

On July 4th, a cell was opened in which was a bee busily engaged preparing the pollen, which was loosely and irregularly piled up, while there was a larva in an adjoining cell <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> half an inch long. It would seem, then, that the bee comes in from the fields laden with her stores of pollen, which she elaborates into bee bread within her cell. When the bee returns to her cell she does not directly fly towards the entrance, since, as was noticed in a particular instance, she flew about for a long time in all directions without any apparent aim, until she finally settled near the hole, and walked into her subterranean retreat.

I grieve to state so distressing a fact, but the inhabitants of Typee were in the habit of devouring fish much in the same way that a civilized being would eat a radish, and without any more previous preparation. They eat it raw; scales, bones, gills, and all the inside. The fish is held by the tail, and the head being introduced into the mouth, the animal disappears with a rapidity that would at first <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> lead one to imagine it had been launched bodily down the throat. Raw fish! Shall I ever forget my sensation when I first saw my island beauty devour one? Oh, heavens! Fayaway, how could you ever have contracted so vile a habit? However, after the first shock had subsided, the custom grew less odious in my eyes, and I soon accustomed myself to the sight.

Nevertheless, the Money-lender determined to have the conch by hook or by crook, and, as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles, he waited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conch. But, after <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> bursting himself with blowing the conch in every conceivable way, he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad job. However, being determined to succeed, he went back to the Farmer, and said coolly: \"Look here! I've got your conch, but I can't use it; you haven't got it, so it's clear you can't use it either. Business is at a standstill unless we make a bargain. Now, I promise to give you back your conch, and never to interfere with your using it, on one condition, which is...", "...glossy neck of her black favourite, \"would probably tell you he found me quite enough on his back, could he be consulted.

There is a lovely piece of galloping ground over Tapton Downs, and a charming cut across country this side of it, by which we can save <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a mile.\" \"That'll be great fun,\" replied Beauchamp, \"and I advocate strongly such a saving of distance on our homeward journey. This is one of your father's hunters I am riding, is it not?\" \"Yes, and a grand jumper he is too: accustomed to papa's weight, carrying you will be quite play to him.\" Arrived at Trotbury, the first thing, as Jim remarked, was obviously to order lunch at \"The Sweet Waters;\" fortified with which they could then proceed to do the cathedral, and...", "...now made of cement.

Draining the gutter and the drive.] The materials. The best materials for the main walks are cement and stone flagging. In many soils, however, there is enough binding material in the land to make a good walk without the addition of any other material. Gravel, cinders, ashes, and the like, are <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always inadvisable, for they are liable to be loose in dry weather and sticky in wet weather. In the laying of cement it is important that the walk be well drained by a layer of a foot or two of broken stone or brickbats, unless the walk is on loose and leachy land or in a frostless country. In back yards it is often best not to have any well-defined walk. A ramble across the sod may be as good.

As a radiation shield, it provided sufficient safety against cosmic radiations of space and from solar radiations, except for solar flare conditions, to provide a margin of safety for the crew over the three months in which they would do their jobs before being rotated back to Earth for the fifteen-month recovery period. The margin was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> enough for permanent duty--and there were those who claimed it was sufficient--but the claim had not been substantiated, and the three months maximum for tour was mandatory. Originally, shielding had not been considered of vital importance, but experience had proven the necessity. The first construction personnel had been driven back to Earth after two weeks, dosimeters in the red. The third crew didn't make it. All five died of radiation exposure from a solar flare. An...", "...some pieces of that will weigh 16 lbs., very many 1 lb. Many men who began last June to dig gold with a capital of 50 dollars can now show 5000 to 15,000 dollars. I saw a man to-day making purchases of dry goods, etc., for his family, lay on the counter a bag of raw hide, well sewed up, containing 109 ounces. I observed, 'That is a good way to pack gold dust.' He very innocently replied, 'All the bags I brought down are that way; I like the size!' Five such bags in New York would bring <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 10,000 dollars. This man left his family last August. Three months' digging and washing, producing four or five bags, of 100 ounces each, is better than being mate of a vessel at 40 dollars per month, as the man formerly was. His companion, a Mexican, who camped and worked with him, only had two or three cow-hide bags of gold. In this tough, but true, golden tale, you must not imagine that all men are equally successful. There are some who have done better, even to 4000 dollars...", "...life upon you, I confidently appeal to you to say that the prisoner was not the man who shot Sir Horace Fewbanks, and to bring in a verdict of 'not guilty,'\" A short discussion arose between the bench and bar on the question of adjourning the court or continuing the case in the hope of finishing it in a few hours. Sir Henry Hodson wanted to finish the case that night, but Counsel for the prosecution intimated that his address to the jury would take nearly two hours. As it was then <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> five o'clock, and His Honour had to sum up before the jury could retire, it was hardly to be hoped that the case could be finished that night, as the jury might be some time in arriving at a verdict. His Honour decided to adjourn the court and finish the case next day. CHAPTER XIX Mr. Walters began his address to the jury on orthodox lines. He referred to the fact that his learned friend had warned them that the life of a fellow creature rested on their verdict. It...", "...another was her father having dared to offer her hand to such an uncouth wooer and intolerable bore; and the principal one of all, was his having rejected his own nephew--undoubtedly the handsomest of Dalecarlian hussars--in favour of such a vulgar, ugly individual. The subject of these flattering considerations seemed to feel at last that he ought to say something to the young beauty, on whose pouting lip had gathered something which was very different indeed from a smile, and yet <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> as captivating. He accordingly turned his large light eyes from his plate for a moment, and with a mouth still filled with a leg and wing of a capercailzie, enquired-- \"What do you think of Alexander the Great, madam?\" This was too much. Even her rage disappeared, and she burst into a loud laugh at the serious face of the querist. \"I never think of Alexander the Great at all,\" she said. \"I only recollect, that when I was reading his history, I could hardly make out...", "...that time the country round resembles a vast encampment, \"and all the races, faces, costumes, customs, and languages of the East, from Persia to Siam, from Ceylon to Siberia, are represented.\" *CHAPTER VI* *AMONG THE HIMALAYAS (*_*continued*_*)* But to see the Himalayas in all their majesty we must still keep our faces to the east, and travel on towards the great central knot, where Mount Everest and the Kanchanjanga spring <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 30,000 feet, about five and a half miles, towards the sky. Of these two mountain giants Mount Everest, though the highest measured mountain in the world, presents the less imposing appearance. This is because it lies so far in the interior of the range, and is surrounded by a girdle of snowy peaks which seem to gather about and protect their lord. They, however, block the way for a complete view of the enormous height, and thus seem to dwarf it.

They stopped at a valley-like opening which ran in a sinuous manner up and up till they had a glimpse of the central mountain <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> to its highest part. The captain, in his caution, set a man on the highest part to act as sentry and guard against a surprise, and he himself took another and walked a quarter of a mile farther in search of traces on the sands of canoes.

We had our pistols ready, a brace each, in our belts, and our swords by our sides, should we come to a close encounter; but the blacks had, we concluded, firearms, and might shoot us down, should they see us, at a distance.

The ground rose gradually towards the house, and we could now distinguish a dark mass coming across the open space in the plain below. \"Now we'll move on,\" said Mr Talboys; and we proceeded deliberately towards the house. \"They must have got in now,\" he added shortly afterwards, speaking as before in a suppressed tone.

Unseen hands reached the end of the big hose and fastened it securely. Odin had often dreamed of landing on the moon.

He further asserts that the portions of the Muellerian duct with a lumen open into the Wolffian duct. The most important difference, however, between Professor Semper's and my own description consists in his having failed to note that the splitting of the segmental duct commences much further forwards in the male than in the female. I have attempted to shew that the oviduct in the female, with the exception of the front extremity, is formed as a <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> solid cord split off from the ventral surface of the segmental duct, and not by a simple splitting of the segmental duct into two equal parts. If I am right on this point, it appears to me far easier to understand the relationship between the oviduct or Muellerian duct of Elasmobranchii and the Muellerian duct of Birds, than if Professor Semper's account of the development of the oviduct is the correct one.

To see our comrades, we had to look very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> straight up at those above us, and very nearly straight down at those below. We stood on the summit at last--it had taken an hour and fifteen minutes to make the trip. What we saw there was simply a circular crater--a circular ditch, if you please--about two hundred feet deep, and four or five hundred feet wide, whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference. In the centre of the great circus ring thus formed, was a torn and ragged upheaval a hundred feet high, all...", "...Fig. 465, _I_, 3). In its general appearance the caecum of these singular animals bears a close resemblance to the caecal pouches of many birds. 4. Direct continuity of small and large intestine, with lateral colic caecum, extending along the convex free border of the terminal ileum and slightly convoluted at the extremity (Fig. 465, _II_, 4), characterizes the entire group of the _Cebidae_ among the new-world monkeys. The caecum in these animals is a comparatively long pouch, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> equalling in caliber the remainder of the intestine, occupying a distinctly _lateral_ position, with the terminal portion rounded and slightly recurved (Figs. 453 and 454). 5. The _Cynoid group_ of Carnivora, including the dogs, wolves, jackals and foxes, presents a similar relative position of small and large intestine and caecum (Fig. 465, _II_, 5). The caecum, compared with that of _Cebus_, is longer and more highly convoluted (Fig. 397).

He did wear a black and silver ribbon across his shirt front, however, and a tiny gold button in the lapel of his coat; otherwise he might have been mistaken for a \"regular guest,\" to borrow an expression from Mr. Blithers.

But the capture of this town was not of much service to L'Olonnois, who did not find provisions enough to feed his men. Their supplies ran very low, and it was not long before they were in danger of starvation. Consequently they made their way by the most direct course to the coast, where they hoped to be able to get something to eat. If they could find nothing else, they might at least catch fish.

He had besides an immeasurable vanity; he frequently disguises it under humble prologues; on other occasions he speaks out boldly and confidently, avowing his opinion that he has done better than Shakspeare, Fletcher, and Jonson (whom he places <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> on the same level); all the merit of this he is, however, willing to ascribe to the refinement and advances of the age. The age indeed! as if that of Elizabeth compared with the one in which Dryden lived, were not in every respect \"Hyperion to a Satyr!\" Dryden played also the part of the critic: he furnished his pieces richly with prefaces and treatises on dramatic poetry, in which he chatters most confusedly about the genius of Shakspeare and Fletcher, and about the entirely...", "...of us so young as we have been--but you do wear well, I must say.\" Miss Selina drew back; she was within an inch of being highly offended, when she too happened to catch a glimpse of the carriage and horses.

With a strong inspiration of his breath, he drew into his capacious maw, across the valleys, whole flocks of sheep and goats, herds of oxen, men, women, children, the population of whole villages at once. He was now asleep, and inert, after such a repast. The whole male population of several valleys assembled to consult on what should be done. After long and fruitless debate an old man arose and spoke:--\"We have <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> three months yet before he will wake; let us cut down all the forests on the opposite hills; then let us bring all our forges and all the iron we possess, and with the wood thus cut down let us melt it all into one red-hot fiery mass; then we will hide ourselves behind the rocks, and make all the noise we can to try and awaken the monster.\" So said, so done.

[Illustration: EDWARD GIBBON. _From the painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds_.] Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) is the greatest historian of the century. His monumental work, _The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, in six volumes, begins with the reign of Trajan, A.D. 98, and closes with the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople in 1453. Gibbon constructed a \"Roman road\" through <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fourteen centuries of history; and he built it so well that another on the same plan has not yet been found necessary. E.A. Freeman says: \"He remains the one historian of the eighteenth century whom modern research has neither set aside nor threatened to set aside.\" In preparing his _History_, Gibbon spent fifteen years. Every chapter was the subject of long-continued study and careful original research. From the chaotic materials which he found, he constructed a history...", "...nothing remains but to consider geometry as conversant with such lines, angles, and figures, as really exist; and the definitions, as they are called, must be regarded as some of our first and most obvious generalizations concerning those natural objects.

When we have occasion to extend these inductions, or their consequences, to cases in which the error would be appreciable--to lines of perceptible breadth or thickness, parallels which deviate sensibly from equidistance, and the like--we correct our conclusions, by combining with them a fresh set of propositions relating to the aberration; just as we also take in...", "...afore I could reason on it, there I was a-lying on a star in six colors of marble.

We had, on one occasion, no less than twelve penitents crying to God for the pardon of their sins, amongst whom are some of the most thoughtless in the neighborhood.

It is true that the tenant-farmers, especially those whose leases were <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> run out, were very loud in their indignation against Mr. Arundel, and one adventurous spirit made a dash at the young man's bridle as he went by; but the general feeling was in favour of the conqueror, and there was a lack of heartiness even in the loudest expressions of sympathy. The crowd made a lane for Paul Marchmont as he went back to the house, white and helpless, and sick with shame.

To this type of struthious, or running bird, the name Dromornis has been given. Now, it is a remarkable fact that remains of another giant bird and its eggs have been found on the opposite side of the great Indian Ocean, namely, in the island of Madagascar, the existence of which was first revealed by its eggs, found sunk in the swamps, but of which some imperfect bones were afterwards discovered. One of these eggs was so enormous that its diameter was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> fourteen inches, and was reckoned to be as big as three ostrich eggs, or 148 hen's eggs! This means a cubic content of more than two gallons! The natives search for the eggs by probing in the soft mud of the swamps with long iron rods.

The close of Edward II.'s reign saw them everywhere ready to descend from their hills, and to emerge from their woods.

The nest itself was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> eight inches across and about three inches deep, made entirely of grass. Hurriedly clearing away the broken eggs, we called the Architect from the far side of the marsh. He hastened up, took one look at the nest, and then told us solemnly that this was one of the most unusual occurrences known in ornithology. Three pairs of bitterns had joined housekeeping and laid eggs in the same nest. It was hard on the Architect that we should have flushed probably the only bird in the world...", "...look happy!

Sometimes, however, searching waxed so hot and close that Gordon had to withdraw himself altogether out of Galloway and seek quieter parts of the country. On one occasion he was speeding up the Water of Ae when he found himself so weary that he was compelled to lie down under a bush of heather and rest before proceeding on his journey. It so chanced that a noted King's man, Dalyell of Glenae, was riding homewards over the moor. His horse started back in astonishment, having <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> stumbled over the body of a sleeping man. It was Alexander Gordon. Hearing the horse's feet he leaped up, and Dalyell called upon him to surrender. But that was no word to say to a Gordon of Earlstoun. Gordon instantly drew his sword, and, though unmounted, his lightness of foot on the heather and moss more than counterbalanced the advantages of the horseman, and the King's man found himself matched at all points; for the Laird of Earlstoun was in his day a famous sworder....", "...was the main dormitory for pupils, a plain but substantial structure, the first one erected for school purposes.

It must be remembered that at this time the cause of the South was favoured by <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all classes, that it appealed to Mr. Gladstone; that the Duke of Argyll and John Bright were almost the only statesmen who backed the North; and that amongst London newspapers of any weight the _Spectator_ stood almost alone on that side. _Punch's_ reading of the war at the close of 1861 is shown in the cartoon which represents King Cotton as Prometheus, bound with the chains of Blockade, and with the American Eagle preying on his vitals.

My own acquaintance with Whistler did not extend over forty years, but for about ten years I was very intimate with him, so intimate that during part of this period we met almost every day. Indeed, at one time we were jointly engaged on a weekly periodical called 'Piccadilly,' for which Du Maurier designed the cover, and for which Whistler...", "...the Germans tried this form of attack, an alert British lookout discovered the tiny motor-boat.

The hut in which they are stored is <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> always kept guarded, and, where this is impracticable, the skins are hid in hollow trees, or carried to some near settlement, as we have already mentioned. If the campaign proves successful and promises well for another season, it is customary to hide the traps beneath rocks, thus saving the labor of a second transportation. In order to keep the traps from rusting, it is well to cover them with oat or buckwheat chaff.

There was not a moment to be lost; an order was despatched that the troops should move bodily by the right towards Oricain, a village <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> in the rear of the mountain position taken up by Sir Lowry Cole. In issuing this hurried order, one of war's romantic incidents occurred. The despatch was written on the parapet of the bridge; and as the staff-officer who carried it, rode out of one extremity of the village, the French cavalry galloped in at the other; while the allied commander dashed quickly up the hill, and joined the allied troops who held it.

Yet there were many exceptions to this rule, as will be shown later. At the outset, although facilities for shorter relays had been provided, it was planned to run each horse twenty-five miles with an average of three horses to the rider; but it was soon found that a horse could rarely continue at a maximum speed for so great a distance. Consequently, it soon became the practice to change mounts every ten or twelve miles or as <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> that as possible. The exact distance was governed largely by the nature of the country. While this shortening of the relay necessitated transferring the mochila many more times on each trip, it greatly facilitated the schedule; for it was at once seen that the average horse or pony in the Express service could be crowded to the limit of its speed over the reduced distance. One of the station-keeper's most important duties was to have a fresh horse saddled and bridled a half...", "...was full of sculptors, many of whom had come directly under the influence of Phidias, and they were not left idle.

It is to this period that the Erechtheum probably belongs (420?-408), though all that we certainly know is that the building was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> finished some time before 409 and that the work was resumed in that year. The temple had a sculptured frieze of which fragments are extant, but these are far surpassed in interest by the Caryatides of the southern porch (Fig. 67).

Nothing can be more neat and regular than all the works, the glacis, the covered way, the ditch, the walls, and the ramparts. Some of the bridges are made of stone and mortar, others of wood, supported on blocks of masonry, and all of them remarkably neat. When we had passed <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> mid-way along this front, we entered the place by a principal gate, neatly and strongly built in the European style, and with simple and few ornaments. The glacis is covered with short grass, and about 200 yards in breadth.

In this instrument the curved edge, having graduated lines, approaches more <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> to the curves produced by rolling circles than can be obtained from any system in which an arc of a circle is taken to represent the curve; hence, that edge is applied direct to the teeth and used as a template wherefrom to mark the curve. The curve is a logarithmic spiral, and the use of the instrument involves no other labor than that of setting it in position. The applicability of this curve, for the purpose, arises from two of its properties: first, that the involute of the...", "...pages all those reflections which I indulged in, after hearing General Davenant's singular narrative. \"Pride! pride!\" I muttered, rising at the end of an hour. \"I think I can understand that--exceptional as is this instance; but I wish I had heard who was the 'real murderer' of George Conway!\" Having thus dismissed the subject, I set about drawing up my official report, and this charmingly common-place employment soon banished from my mind every more inviting subject!

The eschar is generally adherent in cases of recent injuries, and in small ulcers, when they are <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> even with the skin and attended by little inflammation. In other cases the eschar is too apt to be unadherent, and this arises from the formation of pus or of a scab underneath. If the eschar be unadherent by subjacent pus, it may be ascertained in the space of from twelve to twenty-four hours; the centre is generally observed to be raised and to yield to the pressure of a probe; sometimes the subjacent fluid has partly escaped by an opening at the side of the eschar.

The height to which the Orinoco rises has been variously estimated by travellers: some alleging it to be nearly one hundred feet; while others estimate it to be only fifty, or even less! The reason of this discrepancy may be, that the measurements have been made at different points,--at each of which, the actual...", "...was hardly wind enough there to fill the sails. It was still dull sailing, and I was very sleepy and stupid in spite of the abuse with which Mr. Whippleton regaled me.

The helmsman yawned, and I yawned. The Marian, close-hauled, was not making two knots an hour. We were headed about north-west, which was not <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> so close to the wind as the boat could lay. \"We shall not get to Chicago in twenty-four hours at this rate,\" said Mr. Whippleton, when he had wasted all his vituperative rhetoric upon me. \"Not in forty-eight, if you don't keep her a little closer to the wind,\" I replied. \"Do you sail this boat, or do I?\" he demanded. \"Well, sir, you and that whiskey bottle appear to be doing it just now; and between you both you are not doing it very well.\" \"None of your impudence!...", "...all the others are totally untrustworthy.

We have reduced all gases to a liquid and nearly all to a solid form. Conversely, we have raised all solids to a liquid and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all to a gaseous condition. This has been done by reducing or raising the vibration of each within one octave --each one of the eighty odd having a special octave, a tone or half-tone different from any other.

The Turkish railway, which went as far as Junction Station, and from which much had been hoped, proved almost useless owing to shortage of rolling...", "...the ring in Actinotrocha (the larva of Phoronis) amongst the Gephyrea. Although there is no doubt a striking resemblance between the tentacular disc of a larval Brachiopod and the lophophore of a Polyzoon, which has been pointed out by Lankester, Morse, Brooks, etc., their homology is rendered, to my mind, very doubtful (1) by the fact that the lophophore is prae-oral in Polyzoa[133] and post-oral in Brachiopoda; and (2) by the fact that the concave side of the lophophore is turned in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> opposite directions in the two forms. In Brachiopods it is turned dorsalwards, and in phylactolaematous Polyzoa ventralwards. [133] For the ectoproctous Polyzoa it might be held that the ciliated ring of tentacles is post-oral, but the facts of development recorded in the previous chapter appear to me to shew that this view is untenable. The view of Morse, that the Brachiopoda are degraded tubicolous Chaetopods, is not so far supported by any definite...", "...the profits, in defiance of my most arduous exertions to prevent her.

It is quite possible that my own profits may reach one or two miserable hundred more. But I was the architect of her fortunes--the publisher, so to speak, of her book--and, if anything, I am underpaid. I made the above discovery on the twenty-ninth of the month--anniversary of the Restoration of my royal predecessor in the field of human sympathies, Charles the Second. I had barely finished locking up my dispatch-box, when the ungrateful girl, whose...", "...belonged to an older generation, when athletics were not a _sine qua non_; she had never been a cricketer, at hockey her pupils easily outran her, and she had lost her nerve for high-diving--altogether, she had lived past her age. The queer part was, it had all taken such a little time; it seemed only yesterday that she had come to the school, the youngest on the staff, and now she was the oldest there, far older than the young girl from Girton who reigned as head. And yet life was not <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> over yet; Miss Allison remembered with dismay that women went on living for fifty, sixty, seventy, and even eighty and ninety years--it might be that half the journey still lay before her.

Having carried the meat forward, we made a rack of willows and dried it over the fire, making up a lot of moccasins for the barefooted ones while we waited. We were over most of the rocky road, we calculated that our shoemaking would last us through. This was a very pleasant camp. The tired ones were taking a rest. No one needed it more than our women and children, who were tired <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> out. They were in much better condition to endure their daily hardships than when they started out, and a little rest would make them feel quite fresh again. They understood that this was almost on the western edge of this desert country and this gave them good hope and courage.

Even before Mendel's discoveries, anthropologists had observed that in the intermixture of races certain human attributes remained _distinct_ while others...", "...growth continuing as long as the earth contributes her sustenance. On the bank's of the Nerbudda stood a celebrated tree of this kind, which is supposed to be that described by Nearchus, the admiral of Alexander the Great. This tree once covered an area so immense, that it was known to shelter no fewer than 7000 men, and though much reduced in size by the destructive power of the floods, the remainder was described by James Forbes (1749-1819), in his _Oriental Memoirs_ (1813-1815) as <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> 2000 ft. in circumference, while the trunks large and small exceeded 3000 in number. The tree usually grows from seeds dropped by birds on other trees. The leaf-axil of a palm forms a frequent receptacle for their growth, the palm becoming ultimately strangled by the growth of the fig, which by this time has developed numerous daughter stems which continue to expand and cover ultimately a large area. The famous tree in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Calcutta, began its growth at the...", "...east, to carry you out.

She and Vera Lagerloff were walking along what must once have served as a road, each girl carrying a large, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> empty basket on her arm. \"Do you mean the actual country?\" Vera questioned. \"Then, yes, conditions are worse than I expected to find them, certainly in a neighborhood like this, where the work of restoration is only just beginning.\" She frowned, shaking her head sadly. \"I could never have imagined God's earth could be transformed to look like a place of torment, and yet this countryside suggests one of the hells in Dante's 'Inferno.'

The pickets saluted the advance guard with a volley, and gracefully fell back, and although we pressed on close to the river, we saw nothing more of them.

The division remained on the line of the Cumberland, picketing from Stagall's ferry to Celina for <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> three weeks. The headquarters of the first brigade was at Albany, county seat of Clinton county, that of the second at Monticello, county seat of Wayne. In that time the ranks filled up again, nearly all absentees, with or without leave, returning. The horses were grazed on the rich grass and carefully attended to, and got in excellent condition again. Several scouting expeditions were undertaken, during this period, against the enemy on the north side of the river, the most...", "...turn him away here in Livorno.

We found no fantastic forms such as were rather common in the Thompson River country.[46] It will be remembered[47] that the art of chipping stone was not extensively practised on the coast of British Columbia or Washington, no specimens having been found in that area north of Vancouver...", "...the coniferous forests are almost ideal. That is why the Hudson's Bay Company is one of the few great organizations which have persisted and prospered from colonial times to the present. As long ago as 1670 Charles II granted to Prince Rupert and seventeen noblemen and gentlemen a charter so sweeping that, aside from their own powers of assimilation, there was almost no limit to what the \"Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay\" might acquire. By 1749, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> eighty years after the granting of the charter, however, the Company had only four or five forts on the coast of Hudson Bay, with about 120 regular employees. Nevertheless the poor Indians were so ignorant of the value of their furs and the consequent profits were so large that, after Canada had been ceded to Great Britain in 1763, a rival organization, the Northwest Fur Company of Montreal, was established. Then there began an era that was truly terrible for the Indians of the...", "...ditches sufficient to carry it all; you are constructing a dam to divert it all; and you are selling land to an acreage which, if cultivated, will require it all.

Everybody in the room knew,--or thought that he knew,--that Goarly was a cheating fraudulent knave, and that Lord Rufford was, at any rate, in this case acting properly. They all understood the old goose, and were aware, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> to a bushel, of the amount of wheat which the man had sold off those two fields. Runciman knew that the interest on the mortgage had been paid, and could only have been paid out of the produce; and Larry Twentyman knew that if Goarly took his 7_s._ 6_d._ an acre he would be better off than if the wood had not been there.

With respect to the fertility of the two forms, I marked at Torquay a large hermaphrodite and a large female plant of <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> equal sizes, and when the seeds were ripe I gathered all the heads. The two heaps were of very nearly equal bulk; but the heads from the female plant numbered 160, and their seeds weighed 8.7 grains; whilst those from the hermaphrodite plant numbered 200, and their seeds weighed only 4.9 grains; so that the seeds from the female plant were to those from the hermaphrodite as 100 to 56 in weight.

Other habits affecting my special senses followed in rapid succession. The visitors began pouring in to see me on the second day, and I think it was a morbid interest that any one could work up over such a red, speckled mite of humanity as I must have been. They all insisted on digging me out of my nest, taking me up and rolling me about, when it was my natural inclination to want to sleep <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all the time. From this procedure I soon grew restless and disturbed sleep followed. For the first two or three days I had no desire for nourishment, so far as I can remember now, but a number of concoctions were put down my unwilling little throat. As I have since learned, a babe, like a chick, is born with sufficient nourishment in its stomach to tide it along a few days without parental intervention.

He knew that the dread hour had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> come, and that he must bid good-bye to everything. During the previous evening he had been in a state of great excitement. He had listened eagerly for the coming of Mary and his father, but they never came. In a numb sort of way he wondered why. He would like to have bidden them good-bye. He longed to hold Mary in his arms once more, and longed, too, to tell his father that he forgave him. For he had to confess to himself at last that he had done this. With death knocking...", "...boys; in a few minutes we found ourselves in the middle of the Mississippi; becoming frightened at the situation we lost our presence of mind, as well as our oars. We at once set up a chorus of pitiful yells, when a man, who fortunately heard us, came to our rescue with a canoe and towed us ashore. We had stolen the boat, and our trouble did not end until we had each received a merited whipping, which impressed the incident vividly upon my mind. I recollect several occasions when I was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> eaten up by a large and savage dog, which acted as custodian of an orchard and also of a melon patch, which I frequently visited. Once, as I was climbing over the fence with a hatful of apples, this dog, which had started for me, caught me by the seat of the pantaloons, and while I clung to the top of the fence he literally tore them from my legs, but fortunately did not touch my flesh. I got away with the apples, however, by tumbling over to the opposite side of the fence with...", "...required rest. Roger therefore divided the men into two watches, he taking charge of one and Bates of the other. Bates begged to take the first watch of serving, that Roger and his men might then, after rest, be more wide-awake to watch the pirates. The prize had drifted considerably nearer the Cuba coast than when she had been captured. Bates, who was vigilant on every point, kept continually going below, while he turned his eye frequently towards the distant land. The watch was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> out when, as he listened, he fancied he heard the sound of oars in the water. He well knew the sort of characters who inhabited the quays scattered about on that part of the coast of Cuba, and that if they had discovered the condition of the vessel they might have seen before sunset, they would be very likely to come out and try to capture her. He at once, therefore, sent down to call Roger, who was on deck in a moment. \"We must be prepared, at all events,\" said Roger; and,...", "...\"Do you know what day it is?\" observed Captain Miles presently, as we were all busily engaged freeing ourselves from the lashings that held us to the spars, preparing to stand on the deck once more in an upright position and stretch our sadly cramped legs, our movements for so many hours having been much restricted. \"No,\" replied Mr Marline, taking the question to himself as he stamped his feet vigorously to restore the circulation of the stagnant blood. \"I have lost all count <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> of time during this awful week!--Saturday, is it not--or Monday?\" \"You are a little behind in one guess and too far ahead in the other!\" said the captain quietly. \"It is Sunday, the seventh day since our trials began.\" \"Well,\" responded the other; \"it is a lucky day for us, whatever it may be, sir.

The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from...", "...Ulysses had been warned by Circe of the two monsters Scylla and Charybdis. We have already met with Scylla in the story of Glaucus, and remember that she was once a beautiful maiden and was changed into a snaky monster by Circe.

The other terror, Charybdis, was a gulf, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> on a level with the water. Thrice each day the water rushed into a frightful chasm, and thrice was disgorged. Any vessel coming near the whirlpool when the tide was rushing in must inevitably by ingulfed; not Neptune himself could save it. On approaching the haunt of the dread monsters, Ulysses kept strict watch to discover them. The roar of the waters as Charybdis ingulfed them, gave warning at a distance, but Scylla could nowhere be discerned. While Ulysses and his men...", "...in Cornwall (see CELT: Language). Brythonic dialects, allied to Welsh and Cornish, were apparently spoken over the greater part of Britain, as far north as the firths of Forth and Clyde; beyond these estuaries and in the isles to the west, including Ireland and Man, Goidelic dialects, akin to Irish and Scottish Gaelic, prevailed.

We very <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> met one night, both being out with the same object in view. I, however, had very little of his zeal for the sport, and was less interested by the crayfish than by the fantastic indistinctness of trees and shrubs and flowers, which, in the light of the stars and the lantern, seemed to belong to a world with which I was but vaguely familiar, although I had travelled all over it in dreams. Sometimes I used to go out fishing with the Otter on the Dordogne. When the casting-net was...", "...2 P.M.). James whispered to Ruthven that he had better see the treasure at once: Ruthven bade him wait, and not arouse Gowrie's suspicions by whispering ('rounding'). James therefore directed his conversation to Gowrie, getting from him 'but half words and imperfect sentences.' When dinner came Gowrie stood pensively by the King's table, often whispering to the servants, 'and oft-times went in and out,' as he also did before dinner. The suite stood about, as was custom, till James had <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dined, when Gowrie took them to their dinner, separately in the hall; 'he sat not down with them as the common manner is,' but again stood silent beside the King, who bantered him 'in a homely manner.' James having sat long enough, Ruthven whispered that he wished to be rid of his brother, so James sent Gowrie into the hall to offer a kind of grace-cup to the suite, as was usual--this by Ruthven's desire. James then rose to follow Ruthven, asking him to bring Sir Thomas...", "...that long-eared fellow. It--it was queer.\" He took a long pull at his black coffee. \"He looked like some sort of monk, or priest. A Buddhist, I mean. He nearly got the chest of treasure from us. \"You see, it was entrusted to our care. It was sold all right, but wouldn't be paid for until delivered to the purchaser in America. \"He tried to knife the man I was with, this long-eared fellow did. Entered our tent at night. Fortunately, I was awake. I smashed him one just in time; <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> killed him. Thought I had, until he showed up in Tientsin and made a second attempt to rob us.\" \"But the treasure?\" Florence tried to still her wildly beating heart, to seem calm, unconcerned. \"The treasure? What happened?\" \"That's just the question!\" Erik Nord shrugged his broad shoulders. \"It was entrusted to me. I sent the chest that contained it all--worth a lot of dollars I can tell you--to San Francisco in care of a friend. It arrived in due time. The friend paid the...", "...at a small port called St. Nicholas, at the eastern extremity of the island. The English embarked on the 5th, but, owing to contrary winds, did not sail until the 15th of February, when they bade farewell to their friends. They next touched at Zante, another small island, abounding in currants and olives, the oil from the latter of which constitutes the chief riches of the people. After remaining there four days, they sailed for Corfu, where they arrived on the 2d of March 1807, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two months after the date of their shipwreck. WRECK OF A SLAVE SHIP. The following extract of a letter from Philadelphia, dated November 11th, 1762, gives an account of the melancholy disaster that befel the Phoenix, Capt. M'Gacher, in lat. 37 deg. N. and lon. 72 deg. W. from London, bound to Potomac, in Maryland, from the coast of Africa, with 332 slaves on board. \"On Wednesday the 20th of October 1762, at six o'clock in the evening, came on a most violent gale...", "...important business was completed, I repaired to the drawing-room, where I found Mr. and Miss Wilmot and Milicent Hargrave already assembled. Shortly after, Lord Lowborough entered, and then Mr. Boarham, who seemed quite willing to forget and forgive my former conduct, and to hope that a little conciliation and steady perseverance on his part might yet succeed in bringing me to reason. While I stood at the window, conversing with Milicent, he came up to me, and was beginning to talk in <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> his usual strain, when Mr. Huntingdon entered the room. 'How will he greet me, I wonder?' said my bounding heart; and, instead of advancing to meet him, I turned to the window to hide or subdue my emotion. But having saluted his host and hostess, and the rest of the company, he came to me, ardently squeezed my hand, and murmured he was glad to see me once again. At that moment dinner was announced: my aunt desired him to take Miss Hargrave into the dining-room, and odious...", "...upon its patriarch this strange dignity, and also affiliating him to the order. What were Voltaire's motives in so odd a transaction, it is not very hard to divine. Probably, he thought even this humble office would be some protection against persecution. Then it gave him an opportunity of harassing his enemy, the bishop of Annecy. Thirdly, it amused that whimsical element of farce and mischief which was always so irrepressible in him, from the early days when he is said to have <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> damned his own play by appearing on the stage as the high-priest's train-bearer, and burlesquing that august person's solemn gait. Voltaire filled his letters with infinite pleasantries about the new Capucin, and seemed as much pleased at the idea of wearing the cord of Saint Francis, as he had been with the gold key of a Prussian chamberlain.[288] One of his first enjoyments was to write letters to his episcopal foe, signed with a cross and his name: '[Cross sign] _Voltaire,...", "...a trifle over a year ago. Eaton's, Evan Shelby's, John Shelby's, Campbell's, and the Wommack forts were the important way stations on this path from Virginia to Kentucky. Two Indian parties larger than the others made for Fort Watauga and Eaton's Station, and the defenders of the latter post, learning from their scouts that a formidable array under the notorious Dragging Canoe was coming, resolved to give them a hot, unexpected welcome. Accordingly, on the morning of July twentieth <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> two hundred brown forms could have been seen stealing away from the fort in two thin lines half lost in the fog toward the open land known as \"the Flats\" near the \"Long Island\" of the Holston. In the march an advance party of a score of savages was met and put to flight. No other signs of the enemy could be discovered and the men started back to their fort at the end of the day. Dragging Canoe, not less audacious than his foes, awaited his time, and when the whites were...", "...copyright royalties.

Ten years before, Cyrus Lyon, one of the four brothers of whom Colonel Duncan was the eldest, was a resident of Hillsburg in the State of Vermont, where he had settled on a valley farm, which he had hired with the intention of buying it when he was able to do so. He was married in Derry, and had two children, with whom he moved to his new home. He lived in an old house, between which and the public road flowed a small river, <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> dry most of the year, but exceedingly turbulent in the spring when the snow melted on the mountains. A freshet came, and the house was surrounded by water. The bridge over the stream was raised, and Cyrus went out to secure it. His wife followed to assist him, and while both of them were on it, a rush of waters came which tore the structure into fragments, and both of them were swept away by the mad torrent. They were drowned in spite of the efforts of the neighbors to rescue...", "...Poe's every visage in characters which all might read; in the weak falling away of the outline of the jaw, the narrow, receding chin, and the sensitive, irresolute mouth. Above the soul-lighted eyes and the magnificent temple of intellect overshadowing them, we look in vain for the rising dome of _Firmness_, which, like the keystone of the arch, should strengthen and bind together the rest. Lacking this, the arch must be ever tottering to a fall. To this weakness of will we may trace <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> every other defect in Poe's character, together with most of the disappointments and failures in whatsoever he undertook. He lacked the resolution and persistence necessary to battle against obstacles, to persevere to the end against opposition and discouragement, and to resist temptations and influences which he knew would lead him astray from the object which he had at heart. In this way he lost many a coveted prize when it seemed almost within his grasp. The accepted...", "...announcement would naturally remark that the first line of the couplet contains a logical contradiction, probably of Hibernian origin; but I have often thought, during my wanderings in Russia, that the expression, if not logically justifiable, might for the sake of vulgar convenience be legalised by a Permissive Bill. The truth is that, as a Frenchman might say, \"there are roads and roads\"--roads made and roads unmade, roads artificial and roads natural. Now, in Russia, roads are <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> all of the unmade, natural kind, and are so conservative in their nature that they have at the present day precisely the same appearance as they had many centuries ago. They have thus for imaginative minds something of what is called \"the charm of historical association.\" The only perceptible change that takes place in them during a series of generations is that the ruts shift their position. When these become so deep that fore-wheels can no longer fathom them, it becomes...", "...safer if we remained in the woods till all was quiet, and then make our way to Petersburg and claim protection at the English Embassy. \"We went on again; Anne was still insensible, and he insisted on carrying her,--till we came to a charcoal burner's hut. He told us to stay there till a messenger came who would guide us to the road, where a carriage would be in waiting to take us to Petersburg. \"He left us then, and I have never seen him since. But he kept his word, though it was <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> a week before the messenger came,--a big, surly man, very lame, as the result of a recent accident, I think.\" \"Mishka!\" I exclaimed. \"He would not tell his name, and said very little one way or the other, but he took us to the carriage, and we reached the city without hindrance.

She knew me, but...", "...his mechanical creature, a woman. She looked like a big, strong, laboring woman, and the rabbi was greatly pleased with his handiwork. \"Now to endow it with life,\" he said. Carefully, in the silence of his mysterious study at midnight, he wrote out the Unpronounceable Sacred Name of God on a piece of parchment. Then he rolled it up and placed it in the mouth of the creature. Immediately it sprang up and began to move like a living thing. It rolled its eyes, waved its arms, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nearly</span> walked through the window. In alarm, Rabbi Lion snatched the parchment from its mouth and the creature fell helpless to the floor. \"I must be careful,\" said the rabbi. \"It is a wonderful machine with its many springs and screws and levers, and will be most useful to me as soon as I learn to control it properly.\" All the people marveled when they saw the rabbi's machine-woman running errands and doing many duties, controlled only by his thoughts. She could do everything but..."]
