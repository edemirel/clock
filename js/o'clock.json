Kali's eyes were bloodshot, the veins in his neck were inflated, and his lips cracked the same as the other negroes. About five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he approached Stas and, in a hollow voice which with difficulty issued out of his throat, said: \"Great master, Kali can go no further.

He recited what his tramp acquaintance had imparted to him. The sturdy foreman knit his brows, but he did not scare a bit. He walked slowly over to a closet, took out a new Winchester rifle, laid it across the top of the desk, and said quietly: \"I've got orders to admit no one here without an order from the lawyer up to ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> tomorrow morning. The man who gets in before that time on any other conditions will be a dandy, I can tell you that.\" Ralph requested permission to use the telephone.

Elaine was as interested as they to meet Eric again, and readily agreed to the proposed expedition. \"We'll take some cake and milk with us, and have a little picnic,\" she suggested. \"Let us tear down to Whitecliffe at once and buy him a present.\" Shortly before four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the three girls, carrying a tea-basket and several parcels, were walking along the cliffs above the cove. The long perambulator was already waiting at the trysting-place, and Eric, propped up with pillows, smiled a welcome. Elaine was shocked to see how ill the child looked. He had been frail enough in the autumn, but now the poor little body seemed only a transparent garment through which the soul shone plainly. She greeted him brightly, but with an ache in her heart. \"My...", "...slowly down the narrow ravine. It was a wild place which seemed to have been cut out of the mountain side with two strokes of a mighty ax and was choked with a tangle of thorny vines and sword grass. Impenetrable as a wall of steel, the only entrance was by the tiger tunnels which drove their twisting way through the murderous growth far in toward its gloomy heart. The shadows had passed over us and just reached a lone palm tree on the opposite hillside. By that I knew it was six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and in half an hour another day of disappointment would be ended. Suddenly at the left and just below us there came the faintest crunching sound as a loose stone shifted under a heavy weight; then a rustling in the grass. Instantly the captive goat gave a shrill bleat of terror and tugged frantically at the rope which held it to the tree. At the first sound Harry had breathed in my ear \"Get ready, he's coming.\" I was half kneeling with my heavy .405 Winchester pushed forward...", "...awake with a sense of irritation. Her mother was the last person she wished to resemble, much though she admired her. Her common sense would assert itself almost brutally, and Mrs. Hilbery, looking at her with her odd sidelong glance, that was half malicious and half tender, would liken her to \"your wicked old Uncle Judge Peter, who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the bathroom. Thank Heaven, Katharine, I've not a drop of HIM in me!\" CHAPTER IV At about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, on every alternate Wednesday, Miss Mary Datchet made the same resolve, that she would never again lend her rooms for any purposes whatsoever. Being, as they were, rather large and conveniently situated in a street mostly dedicated to offices off the Strand, people who wished to meet, either for purposes of enjoyment, or to discuss art, or to reform the State, had a way of suggesting that Mary had better be asked to lend them her rooms. She always met the request with...", "...have fallen by the time he came to the neighbourhood of the railway. Having seen that the animal was rubbed down and provided with a good feed of hay, he joined the farmer in a game of _wei-ch'i_, a difficult variant of chess, and with this and a slow laborious conversation, in the course of which his host expounded his hazy ideas of the war, he managed to get through the hot afternoon. Soon after six he set off again. The way was mainly downhill now, and easier riding. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he saw in the gloaming a little settlement ahead, and beyond it the hexagonal water-tower and timbered store-house of the typical Siberian railway-station, but on a small scale. The path he was following led direct to the hamlet, and the sight of several small knots of people at that hour of the evening showed that a train would shortly be passing; the peasants have not yet lost their curiosity about the iron horse. He thought it well to avoid observation by leaving the...", "...boys--no traitor's hand shall touch that flag--keep her swinging--there's not rebs enough in Macon to take that flag to-day, &c.,--and I really and firmly believe that a terrible and bloody struggle would have ensued, had there been any attempt on the part of the authorities, to interfere with it or take it from us. I never saw men wrought up to such a pitch of excitement, and the rebs were afraid all day, that an attempt would be made to assault the stockade and break out. From nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning until three in the afternoon, the celebration was kept up, with speaking and singing, when finally the rebel commandant sent in his officer of the day, who said we had been permitted to have a good celebration, and now he wished us to quietly adjourn which we did; giving three hearty cheers for the flag, three for Lincoln, and three for the cause. No officer who participated in this celebration can ever forget it while reason holds its sway. Lieutenant Col....", "...is married and gone. Day before yesterday was a day of emotions. In the morning we went at ten o'clock to the Campidoglio, where the magistrate's offices are and where the _sindaco_ (the Marquis Guiccioli, a great friend of Nina's) performed the civil marriage. He particularly wished to do this _en personne_ as a special favor. He made a charming and affectionate speech and gave the pen we signed the contract with to Nina. Then we drove home, changed our dresses, and were ready at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> for the real marriage at the church. The church was filled to the last pew. When Nina came in on Johan's arm there was a murmur of admiration. She looked exquisitely in her bridal gown, and as she turned round before descending the altar steps and threw back her veil she was a vision of beauty, and I am sure she will be a \"joy for ever.\" All Rome came to the reception at our house. While at Sorrento we went one afternoon to take tea with the Marion Crawfords. They have a...", "...presence of mind he seized the arm of Hicks, and in a hoarse voice shouted: \"Don't do that, you'll sink the ship. Look what mine did.\" They all gazed in amazement at the ragged aperture in the side of the cabin through which the sparkling waters of the Atlantic could be seen dancing past. Events moved swiftly that afternoon. Owen, peering in the galley porthole beheld the disguised cook remove his wig to wash his face and recognized the curly light hair of Harry. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the launch tied up to the landing at the small village of St. Andrew. There Owen had opportunity to reveal his discovery of Harry's presence to the other two conspirators. They were frightened at first but soon agreed that it was a fine chance to get rid of both at the same time. The pirate confided to them that he had brought a clock-work bomb along and had it in his bag. A few minutes' discussion produced a simple plan. Owen sent the disguised Harry with a bucket, in...", "...the summit to the base of a lofty mountain the course of a stupendous avalanche, which had recently rushed down into the sea, crushing and destroying everything in its way, and leaving a broad track of desolation behind it.

Port Grappler is rather a difficult place to make in the dark; but Tom managed it with much dexterity, and by eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we were safely anchored for the night. We all wanted Tom to stay here to-morrow to get some rest, which he much needs, but he has determined to start at five o'clock in the morning as usual, for fear of being caught by bad weather. Even I, who have of course had no anxiety as to the navigation, felt so fatigued from having been on the bridge the whole day since very early this morning, that I went straight to bed before dinner, in order to be ready for to-morrow....", "...baggage waggons began to clatter through the streets. They were being driven westward, and it was in the same direction that the regiments made their way. Fergus followed them to the plain outside the town. The tents had already been struck; the troops, as they arrived from the town and camp, were marshalled in order; a long train of baggage waggons were already making their way westward; and there was no longer any grounds for doubt that Soubise was retreating. It was just eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when Fergus returned to the cathedral. The peasant was awaiting him. \"They all seem on the move,\" the latter said. \"I have heard much about them.\" \"It does not matter, now,\" Fergus replied. \"I must get back to your place, as quickly as I can.\" Not a word was spoken, until they had left the town. \"They must be going up into Hanover, to join the French army there,\" the peasant said. \"They are running away. Frederick will be here tomorrow night, or at any rate next...", "...bronze. VI. CHATEAUBRIAND. July 5, 1848. Chateaubriand is dead. One of the splendours of this century has passed away. He was seventy-nine years old according to his own reckoning; according to the calculation of his old friend M. Bertin, senior, he was eighty years of age. But he had a weakness, said M. Bertin, and that was that he insisted that he was born not in 1768, but in 1769, because that was the year of Napoleon's birth. He died yesterday, July 4, at 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. For five or six months he had been suffering from paralysis which had almost destroyed his brain, and for five days from inflammation of the lungs, which abruptly snuffed out his life. M. Ampere announced the news to the Academy, which thereupon decided to adjourn. I quitted the National Assembly, where a questor to succeed General Negrier, who was killed in June, was being nominated, and went to M. de Chateaubriand's house, No. 110, Rue du Bac. I was...", "...Five out of the twelve commissioned officers of the Third Infantry were killed, says General Grant. Two sections of field artillery came up, but the gunners were shot down rapidly in spite of all precautions; and at length, finding the pieces too light for effective service, Taylor ordered them to retire. A gun at the Teneria redoubt was tried, but after a time the advance of the Americans made it dangerous to fire toward the plaza.[12.10] The infantry pushed on, however, and by three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> were only one square from the grand plaza. Here ammunition began to fail, and Lieutenant Grant, hanging over the side of his horse by an arm and a foot, dashed across the streets too swiftly to be fired at, and went in search of it. With a view to preparing for a general assault, however, or for some other reason Taylor ordered the troops, now working safely inside the houses, to withdraw--under fire, of course. Reluctantly, though many of them had not eaten for thirty-six...", "...\"All right.\" Reinhart put the folder slowly away in his coat. \"I'll feed it. But you better be able to come through. There can't be any slip-ups.

It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. The day was warm, a pleasant May afternoon. Outside the building the daily life of the planet went on as usual. As usual? Not exactly. The feeling was in the air, an expanding excitement growing every day. Terra had waited a long time. The attack on Proxima Centaurus had to come--and the sooner the better. The ancient Centauran Empire hemmed in Terra, bottled the human race up in its one system. A vast, suffocating net draped across the heavens, cutting...", "...engagement ensued, but he drove the rebels back with considerable loss, including one general officer killed. He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylight the next morning. I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatch from Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka, saying that some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of his column was not yet up as far as Jacinto. He said, however, that he would still be at Iuka by two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next day. I did not believe this possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads, which was bad; besides, troops after a forced march of twenty miles are not in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through. It might do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison, but not to make an assault. I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch and ordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound of guns to the south or...", "...merely a request for particulars as to the proposed interview, and she had a strong faith in the spoken word, as against that which is written. At five o'clock the editor would have read his letters, and would probably have seen most of those who were waiting for him, and Miss Baxter quite rightly conjectured that this hour would be more appropriate for a short conversation than when he was busy with his correspondence, or immersed in the hard work of the day, as he would be after ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night. She had enough experience of the world to know that great matters often depend for their success on apparent trivialities, and the young woman had set her mind on becoming a member of the _Daily Bugle_ staff.

The notion that Chilton was perhaps imposing on her credulity and fears seemed not to have struck her before. \"What do you think, Sharp?\" said my partner. I hesitated to give an opinion, as I did not share in the hope entertained by Flint. Detection was so certain, that I doubted if so cunning a person as Chilton appeared to be would have ventured on a fraud so severely punishable. \"Suppose,\" I said, avoiding an answer, \"as this note appoints an interview at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-day at Seyton House, we meet him there instead of your ladyship? A little talk with the fellow might be serviceable.\" Lady Seyton eagerly agreed to this proposal; and it was arranged that we should be at Seyton House half an hour before the appointed time, in readiness for the gentleman.

Concerning her appearance, he says: \"If she could have foreseen while she stood, at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning on the bank of the river, how her maiden corpse would have looked eighteen hours afterwards, and how coarse men would strive with hand and foot to reduce it to a decent aspect, and all in vain,--it would surely have saved her from the deed.\" And again: \"I suppose one friend would have saved her; but she died for want of sympathy--a severe penalty for having cultivated and refined herself out of the sphere of her natural connections.\" The first remark has...", "...guideboard, which showed where the road did not go.

What it will amount to I do not know; but I take no thought for the morrow. LETTER XVI. MAY 8. MY DEAR C.:-- In fulfilment of my agreement, I will tell you, as nearly as I can remember, all the details of the meeting at Stafford House. At about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we drove under the arched carriage way of a mansion, externally, not very showy in appearance. It stands on the borders of St. James's Park, opposite to Buckingham Palace, with a street on the north side, and beautiful gardens on the south, while the park is extended on the west. We were received at the door by two stately Highlanders in full costume; and what seemed to me an innumerable multitude of servants in livery, with powdered hair, repeated our names through the long...", "...of his own dwelling, and went through all the exercises which it was proper for them to learn. When this was finished he very often played a bout of singlestick, or underwent some other severe muscular exertion. He then retired for the evening, to spin yarns with his friends or to study military tactics. Parry says: 'At eleven o'clock I left him, and I was generally the last person he saw, except his servants. He then retired, not to sleep, but to study. Till nearly four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> every morning Byron was continually engaged reading or writing, and rarely slept more than five hours. In this manner did he pass nearly every day of the time I had the pleasure of knowing him.' It was at the end of February that Mr. George Finlay, who afterwards wrote a 'History of Greece,' arrived at Missolonghi. He brought a message from Odysseus, and also from Edward Trelawny, inviting both Byron and Mavrocordato to a Conference at Salona.

On the morning of Feb. 25th, I made him swear to give my letter to the Emperor, and keep silence as to my proceeding. \"At 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he was with my letter in the Couriers' lobby of the palace, where there is usually a crowd of persons with petitions awaiting the Emperor.

We crossed the Potomac here on the railroad bridge and camped on Maryland Heights, which are close to the Potomac, not leaving but little more room than enough between its base and the river, for the canal and the Baltimore and Ohio railroad (which latter in going east crosses into Maryland from West Virginia at this point) to pass.

Both sheep carried good heads, but I aimed at the one which stood broadside to me. Hunter, who had the glasses, told me afterward that the ram with the more massive horns got away, but I succeeded in wounding the other so that he was unable to move. Knowing he would shortly die, and that I could find him the next morning, we at once started at our best pace for camp. We only reached our tent at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night, both completely fagged out. A cup of tea made us feel better, but it was late before I could get to sleep. Such days are a bit too much for steady practice, but if they end in success the trophy means all the more. The following day we were literally wind-bound, and not until the day after could we set out for the wounded sheep, which we eventually found, not fifty yards from where we had last seen him. It was a long and hard climb to reach him, but he carried a...", "...will, and you can frame your conduct according to the reply that I receive.\" He did as he said, and went to the fair maiden and saluted her courteously, and she, who was as wise as she was fair and good, politely returned his salute.

It sounds romantic enough to please the most enthusiastic devourers of pre-Radcliffe novels, or to capture the imagination of the most ardent votaries of fiction. But it was far otherwise to me on the night of that Thursday which had seen Hugh Atherton branded with the name of murderer. It was far otherwise to me--weighed down with the crushing knowledge that...", "...guns. \"Mais oui,\" said Jean. \"That is what this train is doing. It is taking guns to Ghent. There are big movements of troops going on.\" We were shaken nearly to pieces. And we went so slowly that we scarcely moved at all. But we arrived at Ghent at last, arrived of course, as usual in war time, at a station one had never seen or heard of before, in a remote, far-off portion of the town, and then we had to find our way back to the town proper, a long, long walk. It was twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when we got into the beautiful old dreamlike town. First we went to the Hotel Ganda. \"Full up!\" said the fat, white-faced porter rudely. \"No room even on the floor to sleep.\" \"Can you give us something to eat?\" we pleaded. \"Impossible! The kitchens are shut up.\" He was a brute of a porter, an extraordinary man who never slept, and was on duty all night and all day. He was hand in glove with the Germans all the time, his face did not belie him; he looked the...", "...with the most intolerable drowsiness, we were absolutely dozing upon our legs; and if any check at the head of the column caused a momentary delay, the road was instantly covered with men fast asleep. It is generally acknowledged that no inclination is so difficult to resist as the inclination to sleep; but when you are compelled not only to bear up against that, but to struggle also with weariness, and to walk at the same time, it is scarcely possible to hold out long. By seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, it was found absolutely necessary to pause, because numbers had already fallen behind, and numbers more were ready to follow their example; when throwing ourselves upon the ground, almost in the same order in which we had marched, in less than five minutes there was not a single unclosed eye throughout the whole brigade. Piquets were of course stationed, and sentinels placed, to whom no rest was granted, but, except these, the entire army resembled a heap of...", "...arrived in front of Chartres, where 10,000 French were said to have assembled. The marine infantry and Gardes-Mobiles advanced to the attack, but were repulsed by the fire of seven batteries. The General commanding the Division had deployed both his brigades southward of the city, and with the assistance of his cavalry, which had been joined by the 6th (Cavalry) Division, completely surrounded it. The fate of Chateaudun had been a warning to the municipal authorities, and at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> an agreement was come to by which the troops were to be withdrawn, the National Guards to lay down their arms, and the gates to be thrown open. General Wittich's orders were to remain at Chartres for the present, while the 6th Cavalry Division was to occupy Maintenon, and so cover the investing army to the west. Not less fervid was the rush to arms in the north, in Picardy and Normandy. The Saxon Cavalry Division, supported by detachments of the Army of the Meuse, had in...", "...that I had hired from Kandy, were to return; and I had agreed with them to carry back M'Millan's knapsack, and some amber and beads to purchase provisions for him; but three people came up to us with two asses for sale, and they informed me that they left Sanjeekotta early in the morning; that the soldier who was left there, had died during the night, and the natives had buried him in a corn field near the town. Purchased the asses in order to carry forwards the sick. About three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> left Koombandi. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Scott were so sick, that they wished to remain here for the night; with much entreating, persuaded them to mount their horses and go on. Three miles east of the village, William Alston, one of the seamen whom I received from His Majesty's ship Squirrel, became so faint that he fell from his ass, and allowed the ass to run away. Set him on my horse, but found he could not sit without holding him. Replaced him on the ass, but he still tumbled...", "...in the green-parliament that morning, but had been seen to dash into the fruiterer's and out again, before he went in a great hurry to The Hurst, shortly after twelve-thirty. Classes on Eastern philosophy under the tuition of Mrs Quantock's Indian, were already beginning to be hinted at, but today in the breathless excitement about the prima-donna nobody cared about that; they might all have been taking lessons in cannibalism, and nobody would have been interested. Finally about one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> one of the motors in which the party had arrived yesterday drew up at the door of the Ambermere Arms, and presently Mr Bracely,--no, dear, Mr Shuttleworth got in and drove off alone. That was very odd conduct in a lately-married bridegroom, and it was hoped that there had been no quarrel. Olga had, of course, been given no directions as to Hightum or Tightum, and when she walked across to Georgie's house shortly after half-past one only Mrs Weston who was going back home to...", "...and honest, had no clear opinion on the case. He thought the Commissary had done wrong, but he did not wish to get his subordinates into trouble; and he proposed this, that, and the other, to all of which the _Arethusa_ (with a growing sense of his position) demurred. \"In short,\" suggested the _Arethusa_, \"you want to wash your hands of further responsibility?

There is no reason to believe that it differed materially from that of other Christian captives in Algiers. The masters of vessels were lodged together, and indulged with a table by themselves, though a small iron ring was attached to one of their legs, to denote that they were slaves. The seamen were taught and obliged to work at the trade of carpenter, blacksmith, and stone mason, from six o'clock in the morning till four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, without intermission, except for half an hour at dinner.[89] Some of the details of their mode of life, as transmitted to us, are doubtless exaggerated.

Grover's pickets soon fell in with those of the enemy, and sharp skirmishing commenced; but the rebel picket line was steadily driven back into the clearing, where it was strengthened by their reserve. The fighting now became general. The woods rang with the sharp sounds of musketry and the deep tones of the artillery, and clouds of smoke obscured the scene from view. Ambulances were emerging from the woods bearing the wounded; and bloody forms on...", "...as I live, John Barclay.

The wind was very variable till noon, when it fixed at N.N.E., and blew a gentle gale; but it increased in such a manner, that, before three o'clock, we were reduced to our two courses, and obliged to strike top-gallant yards. We were very fortunate in getting clear of the land, before this gale overtook us; it being hard to say what might have been the consequence had it come on while we were on the north coast.

We then took the opportunity to sound, but found no bottom with a line of an hundred and eighty fathoms. Next day the storm was succeeded by a thick fog, attended with rain; the wind veered to N.W., and, at five in the morning, it fell calm, which continued till eight; and then we got a breeze southerly, with which we stood to the east till three in the afternoon.

At that time I marked the two hulls inside of this, still inside this...", "...that there had been a heavy squall, and one of the iron-clad fleet had had to run for the harbour, rolling so much from her weight, and shipping so much water, that she went down; but, fortunately, all hands were saved.

At that time there was not a ripple upon the water, but on his return at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the sky was becoming a good deal overcast, while about half-past ten he was a witness of one of the squalls peculiar to the Mediterranean, and made familiar to old-fashioned people in the words and music of \"The White Squall.\" Sheets of water, without the least preliminary warning, dropped suddenly from the clouds; the furious wind tore along, driving before it every light object; outdoor chairs and tables were swept away, and the wind was master of everything for about twenty...", "...the hearth that night. No such cold had been known in Vermont for years. The frost on the window-panes thickened--the light of the full moon could not penetrate them; all over the house were heard sounds like those on a straining ship at sea.

A few minutes before nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mrs. Otis put away her knitting-work and got the great Bible off the desk. \"Stop fiddling now, Jim,\" she said, solemnly. Mrs. Otis spoke with more direct authority in religious matters than in others. She felt herself well backed by the spiritual law. Jim finished the tune he was playing and lowered his fiddle from his shoulder. His mother found the place in the Bible, and the holy words were on her tongue when there was a sharp clash of sleigh-bells close under the window....", "...but to-night she had another and strange anxiety.

On the Wednesday night before she had nearly reached the climax of her wishes. Richard had come, departing from his usual custom--he had never called except on Sunday before--and remained later. It was ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before he went home. He had been very silent all the evening, and had sat soberly in the great best rocking-chair, which was, in a way, his throne of state, with Sylvia on the sofa on his right. Many a time she had dreamed that he came over there and sat down beside her, and that night it had come to pass. Just before ten o'clock he had arisen hesitatingly; she thought it was to take leave, but she sat waiting and trembling. They had sat in the twilight and young moonlight...", "...his desire for self-devotion evaporated, for he was not a man to go out of his way to find opportunities for benevolence.

As for Cisy, he was glad to let that young aristocrat get a slight glimpse as to the extent of his fortune.

Lodging is not always included. I have known men in the full vigour of life earning only the equivalent of ninepence halfpenny a day, paying rent out of it, and presumably supporting a wife and children. The daily life at the chateau was quite old fashioned in its simplicity. Everybody rose with the sun, or very soon afterwards. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the bell in the court rang for the principal meal, which was called dinner. Kings dined at about the same hour in the times of the Crusaders. Early in the afternoon the bell rang again. This was for _collation_, a very light repast, which was often nothing more than salad or fruit and a _frotte_--a piece of crusty bread rubbed with garlic. At about seven o'clock the bell rang for supper. The small chateaux with which the whole country hereabouts is strewn, notwithstanding...", "...half-strangled, and venomous words came, came in gouts of poisonous sound, which made the sweet Spanish hideous.... \"The whole world, Mr. Commendone, will not be wide enough to hide you, your paramour, and this villain from my vengeance.\" Johnnie would have heard anything but that one word--that shameful word. At the word \"paramour,\" hardly knowing what he did, he lifted his hand and struck the bound and helpless King upon the face. A timepiece from the next room beat. It was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning.

There were, however, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K. was invited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his industry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner with him at his large house. K. would also go,...", "...in the same way. It was a turning of the tables. The measure the Arabs had meted was being indeed measured to them again, and Tom rejoiced in the thought that just retribution was at last falling on men by whom human life had been held so cheap.

Cries of \"Kuboko!\" rang through the air, and a new war-song was composed on the spot. It was past two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning; the rain was beating down more heavily than ever; and Tom ordered the men to see to the few wounded of his force and to do what they could for their wounded enemies before seeking shelter for themselves.

The party was a bachelor's one, and, when we walked up the front steps, there was our host in person, standing to receive us at the door; while, on each side of him, there were five or six of his visitors, all sitting with their legs cocked up, their feet resting on a sort of surbase, above which the jealousies, or movable blinds of the piazza, were fixed. I was introduced to the whole party seriatim--and as each of the cock legs dropped...", "...withdrew from the scene. He did not return to the house during the week, and on Saturday he received a dainty perfumed note from her by messenger. It was the first missive he had ever received from a woman. He turned it over in his broad hand, touched it nervously, and opened it with his fingers trembling as he recognised her handwriting. \"My Dear Mr. Overman: I have been sorely disappointed in not seeing you again this week. I write to command your presence Sunday morning at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to accompany me to the Temple, if I choose to go, and to dine with me. Sincerely, KATE RANSOM GORDON.\" He wrote an answer accepting and then sat holding this note in his hand as though it were something alive. For an hour he paced back and forth in his office alone, screening his eye behind his bushy brows, wrinkling his forehead, twisting his mouth, and now and then thrusting his hand into his collar and tugging at it, as though he were choking.

The black-fishers seldom journeyed far from home, confining themselves to the rivers within a radius of three or four miles. There were many reasons for this; one of them being that the hands had to be at their work on the farm by five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning; another, that so they poached and let poach. Except when in spate, the river I specially refer to offered no attractions to the black-fishers. Heavy rains, however, swell it much more quickly than most rivers into a turbulent rush of water; the part of it affected by the black-fishers being banked in with rocks that prevent the water's spreading. Above these rocks, again, are heavy green banks, from which stunted trees grow aslant across the river.

But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided; so Hendon reined up, and called out-- \"I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. Thy commands, my liege!\" \"To London!\" Hendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer--but astounded at it too. The whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it ended with one. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the night of the 19th of February they stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling jam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out strongly in the glare from manifold torches--and at that instant the decaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between them, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the hurrying confusion of feet.

The settlers, though good Catholics, were too few and too poor to support a priest, and hailed the arrival of the friar with delight. He said mass, exhorted a little, as was his custom, and, on one occasion, baptized a child. At length, he reached Montreal, where the enemies of the enterprise enticed away his two canoe-men. He succeeded in finding two others, with whom he continued his voyage, passed the rapids of the upper St. Lawrence, and reached Fort Frontenac at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, of the second of November, where his brethren of the mission, Ribourde and Buisset, received him with open arms.

So the Oven Door had to remain an unsolved mystery, and Pip and Pipette were compelled to comfort themselves with the Talking-Hole. This was a most absorbing affair, and, thank goodness! it was no mystery. The Talking-Hole was carefully plugged with a whistle; and whenever a visitor came to see Father,--they came in shoals between one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and three,--Mr. Evans would uncork a similar hole in the wall of the hall, and after blowing up it vigorously, would murmur the name of the visitor; and his words, owing to the fact that the Talking-Hole in the hall was in some mysterious way connected with the Talking-Hole in the Consulting Room, were conveyed to Father's ear. The conversation as a rule was of a formal and fragmentary nature, limited on Mr. Evans's part to the announcement of the visitor's name and some such...", "...rudeness. Besides this, a dispute arose between the Duke of Osuna and the Marquis of Astorga as to who should ride nearest the queen, and, to put an end to it, Marie Louise was obliged to quit her horse and enter a carriage, surrounded, as the custom was, by curtains of shiny green cloth, which were kept drawn. Right glad was she to think that she would soon be free of this tyranny, and be with someone who wanted her--and Charles did want her to the end of her life. It was at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning that the news was brought to her that the king had arrived. Dressed in her Spanish costume, in which she still felt awkward, she hurried to greet him, but before she reached the antechamber he was in the room.

Chambers, in the High Street of Edinburgh, and remained there till half-past two, when we walked home together, sometimes paying a call or two on the way. Though a mere uneducated child I helped him in his literary work, and at odd hours committed to memory many poets. We returned to four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> dinner, the correct hour in those days, and at six o'clock a porter arrived with my father's bag, containing manuscripts to be read and selected for _Chambers' Journal_. From six p. m. till midnight he worked at reading manuscript, not typed then, and proof correcting. Twice a week we went to the theater--there was only one in Edinburgh then. It was managed by a hard working couple, Mr. and Mrs. Howard, who sometimes filled up a week by acting themselves.

The mob of course sing obscene songs and dance indecently, all which is tolerated for the occasion.

Between seven and eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, the assembled crowd begins to disperse in joyous mood, talking all the way as to the respective superiority of such and such images. Amongst such a great number and variety, there is sure to be difference of opinion, but it is soon settled by the affirmation of a wise head that \"the spirit of the goddess is the same in all the images; _Ma Doorga_, does not mind show.\" When the worshippers and others return home, they go at once to the temple, where the...", "...over what you have said with so much beauty and force.\" \"I had forgotten that I had a letter to deliver to you,\" said Catesby; and he drew from his breast-pocket a note which he handed to Lothair, who opened it quite unconscious of the piercing and even excited observation of his companion. Lothair read the letter with a changing countenance, and then he read it again and blushed deeply. The letter was from Miss Arundel. After a slight pause, without looking up, he said, \"Nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> is the hour, I believe.\" \"Yes,\" said the monsignore rather eagerly, \"but, were I you, I would be earlier than that.

It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but alas! I had now ascended to so vast a distance that nothing could with accuracy be made out. Indeed, I estimated that at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning of April the seventh the balloon had reached a height of not less than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea.

A negro boy who went by the name of Wash--evidently short for Washington--gave them more information than anybody else. This boy, who had been fishing near the woods below Shapette, stated that he had seen the two men go aboard the houseboat early in the...", "...up too long. At any rate I have said enough.

Lake of St. Peter is a shoal sheet of water twenty-two miles long and nearly eight miles wide, a bad place to cross in a small boat in windy weather. We set our sail and sped merrily on, but the tempest pressed us sorely, compelling us to take in our sail and scud under bare poles until one o'clock, when we double-reefed and set the sail. We now flew over the short and swashy seas as blast after blast struck our little craft. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the wind slackened, permitting us to shake out our reefs and crowd on all sail. A labyrinth of islands closed the lake at its western end, and we looked with anxiety to find among them an opening through which we might pass into the river St. Lawrence again. At five o'clock the wind veered to the north, with squalls increasing in intensity. We steered for a low, grassy island, which seemed to separate us from the river.

Twenty men were left with the canoes, and Swan with the rest marched towards the town, by a road which led partly through woodland, and partly through savannas well stocked with cattle.

After dressing and waiting wearily until nearly nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she had a carriage called and went to the opera alone; not forgetting, however, to bid Magda leave a case of imported beer where Mr. Calcraft could find it when he awoke.... Rather flustered, she watched the stage with anxious eyes. Brangaene--an ugly, large person in a terra-cotta cheese-cloth peplum--had already warned the desperate pair beneath the trees that dawn and danger were at hand. But the lovers sang of death and love, and love and death; and their sweet,...", "...did gladden Jimmy's. He felt so gay and frolicsome that he could hardly refrain from doing a few barrel rolls, or looping the loop, or in some other way giving expression to his mood. But when he remembered that he was a fully accredited member of the staff of a great newspaper, and saw that it would not be seemly for a real reporter to be doing somersaults like a child, he restrained himself and flew along soberly enough. Yet his heart was singing gaily. It was little more than nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when Jimmy hopped off from the Long Island airport. He had only a trifle more than 100 miles to go. He could make it easily in an hour, and in much less time if he chose to do so. But there was no call for haste, and Jimmy didn't want to get to Springfield too soon. He was enjoying the night and the ride altogether too much. So he flew along at a lazy gait. He had crossed the upper part of New York City, so that he could fly over the East River rather than the Sound. And he...", "...himself to speak till he had mastered his precious discovery, and put it away in the back of his heart, and weighed it down there with a good covering of hatred and revenge, to be brought out as occasion should serve. He was plunging down rapidly enough now; but he had new motives for making the most of his time, and never played his cards better or made more progress. When a man sits down to such a game, the devil will take good care he sha'n't want cunning or strength. It was ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> instead of nine before he left, which he did with a feeling of triumph. Poor Patty remained behind, and shut up the bar, her heart in a flutter, and her hands shaking, while Dick was locking the front door. She hardly knew whether to laugh or cry; she felt the change which had come over him, and was half fascinated and half repelled by it. Tom walked quickly back to college, in a mood which I do not care to describe. The only one of his thoughts which my readers need be...", "...1670).] _19th, Friday, and 20th, Saturday._ Nothing occurred. _21st, Sunday._ Coming out of the church, Mr. Teller spoke to us, and invited us to dine with him, but we thanked him. _22d, Monday._ We took our leave, and went on board the ship, which was all ready to sail, except that they were waiting for the captain. _23d, Tuesday._ After some delay the captain came on board with the rest of the passengers, accompanied by many of their friends. Weighed anchor at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, it being almost low water, and set sail with a southwest and south-southwest wind. In passing the fort we fired the salvo, which it answered; the pilot and the company then left us and we put to sea. But before going further to sea we must give a brief description of New England, and the city of Boston in particular. When New Netherland was first discovered by the Hollanders, the evidence is that New England was not known; because the Dutch East India...", "...Powill's Valley, and on reaching the Knoxville and Cumberland Gap road, learned that the enemy were in our front. Not wishing to travel any further in that direction the column was turned toward Knoxville. After traveling a few miles in that direction, we came upon the enemy's wagon train, which fell into our hands, they supposing it perfectly safe on this road; no guards had been left with it. After burning the train and paroling the prisoners, 32 in number, it now being 12 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, the column headed for Roger's Gap, which was made in the afternoon of the next day. Finding this Gap well guarded with artillery and infantry, the command halted for a short time for consultation. The result of this was as follows: A strong line of skirmishers were to be shown to the enemy, the artillery to be put in position loaded with shell, spiked and wheels cut down. The detachment of the Seventh being the rear guard was ordered to remain in position one hour...", "...One must have good, strong legs to climb daily the flights of stairs that steeply lead to some of them. In the heart of the town is an old Presbyterian Mission church, built of logs, with an artistic square tower, also of logs, at one corner. This church is now used as a brewery and soda-bottling establishment! The lawns are well cared for, and the homes are furnished with refined taste, giving evidences of genuine comfort, as well as luxury. My first sight of Juneau was at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> of a dark and rainy autumn night in 1905. We had drifted slowly past the mile or more of brilliant electric lights which is Treadwell and Douglas; and turning our eyes to the north, discovered, across the narrow channel, the lights of Juneau climbing out of the darkness up the mountain from the water's edge. Houses and buildings we could not see; only those radiant lights, leading us on, like will-o'-the-wisps. When we landed it seemed as though half the people of the town,...", "...the morning with which they started at midnight. As for myself, I awoke to wonder where I was and what had become of my men. Not one of them could I see. My horse was a fast walker, and I soon satisfied myself that I was in advance of my troop and, when the place designated for the division to bivouac was reached, dismounted and awaited their arrival. Some of them did not come up for an hour, and they were scattered about among other commands, in squads, a few in a place. It was seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before we were all together once more. Then we had breakfast, and the men had a chance to look the captures over and quiz the prisoners. The wagons were soon despoiled of their contents and such stuff as was not valuable or could not be transported was burned. Among the prisoners was Colonel Davis, of the Tenth Virginia cavalry, who claimed that he led the charge against our position on the third. He expressed himself very freely as having had enough, and said, \"This useless...", "...because I have got so worried and fearful (people's theories are so varied) that I scarcely dare eat any food at all. I am at present taking only two meals daily (I like the two-meal plan best): at eleven A.M. and 6 P.M.

I think of changing the coffee for Sanum Tonic Tea or Dandelion Coffee. At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I have an egg with Winter's \"Maltweat\" bread and almond butter, and some conservatively cooked vegetable (celery or carrot or spinach). At six P.M. I have one or two baked apples, a teaspoonful or two of malted nuts, or Emprote, and more \"Maltweat\" bread and butter. At four P.M. I take a cup of barley water or carrot water, and at bedtime another cup of barley water. Do you think that if I went on to a milk diet for a time it would do...", "...back to D'Erraha with me now or to take you to Lloseta, should you care to go direct there. Eve has packed up some lunch for you in the saddle-bag if you think of going to Lloseta first.\" The Count nodded. \"Yes,\" he said, \"that is like Eve; she would think of such things.\" He went up to the horse, patted it, measured the length of the stirrup-leather, and then turned to Fitz. \"I will go to Lloseta,\" he said. \"It is only natural after forty years. I will be with you by seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-night at D'Erraha.\" Fitz did not offer to accompany him, and Cipriani de Lloseta rode that strange ride alone; unknown, an outcast in his own land, he rode through the most fertile valley in the world, of which every tree was dear to him; and no man knew his thoughts. The labourers in the fields, men and women, brown, sunburnt, half Moorish, wholly simple and natural, paused in their toil and looked wonderingly at the lonely horseman; the patient mules walking their...", "...now silent and weary. All along the road lay men asleep in the pouring rain. There were blood blisters on my feet, but never once did I stop except to get a drink of water at a brook just after daylight. The rain now fell in torrents; we were literally wading in mud and water. The thirty miles from Centreville to Washington seemed three times that distance. My gun grew more and more heavy, and I shifted it constantly. It was about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Monday forenoon when I reached the Virginia end of Long Bridge. A strong guard was posted there to stop the troops; for Washington was already full of fugitive soldiers. Forcing my way through a vast mob of shouting, cursing soldiers, I reached the officer in charge, and got a rough reception. First he doubted my pass; next he wanted to take away my musket, but I protested that I had saved it from the enemy; and at length he allowed me...", "...the opportunity of leaving the choir, to restore their circulation by a brisk turn in the cloister, or for any other purpose. 2. LAUDS In ancient days the Office of Lauds was called _Matutinae Laudes_--\"the morning praises\"--because they were supposed to be always celebrated at dawn of day. In mediaeval monasteries, however, this canonical Hour was generally said or sung, with only a short interval between it and Matins. It would, therefore, have been probably somewhere about one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning that Lauds usually began. If the feast was of sufficient rank for the hebdomadarian to be vested in a cope, he then occupied the stall next to the abbot; if not, he remained in his own place, and, when the tolling of the bell ceased and gave notice of the conclusion of the interval, he at once intoned the _Deus in adjutorium_ for the beginning of Lauds. It was his place to give out the first antiphon, the second being taken by the abbot, or by the first...", "...best,\" said Dick, brokenly, \"I always do that,\" answered Doctor Garrison, gravely. There were no accommodations for Dick at the hospital, so he found a room at a hotel several blocks away. From the hotel he sent another telephone message to Sam, telling him what the specialist had said. Then he asked Sam if he would come up. \"If you'll do that I can go down and help father,\" he added. \"All right--I'll come up to-night or first thing in the morning,\" said Sam. It was eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning when the youngest Rover boy appeared. He was as anxious as Dick concerning Tom, and both waited for the specialist to appear and report. Tom had regained consciousness for a few minutes, but that was all. \"He is no worse,\" reported Doctor Garrison. \"I hope to see him improved by this afternoon. I will call again about three o'clock.\" And then he left directions with the nurse as to what should be done. \"This is terrible, Dick!\" murmured Sam, when the brothers...", "...with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred brave and well-equipped men. Smith started enough in advance to be near the river when Hazen should arrive. There are a number of detached spurs of hills north of the river at Chattanooga, back of which is a good road parallel to the stream, sheltered from the view from the top of Lookout. It was over this road Smith marched. At five o'clock Hazen landed at Brown's Ferry, surprised the picket guard, and captured most of it. By seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the whole of Smith's force was ferried over and in possession of a height commanding the ferry. This was speedily fortified, while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge. By ten o'clock the bridge was laid, and our extreme right, now in Lookout valley, was fortified and connected with the rest of the army.

He communicates with the surveyors of stock of the offices interested in a fire, and arranges with them, in the event of its being necessary, to work out salvage from the ruins. When a fire happens, he causes a report to be made immediately, if in office hours (or, if after office hours, before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next morning), to those offices interested in the fire, and also to their surveyors of buildings and stock, as soon as possible after the fire is extinguished, and causes a daily report to be transmitted to each office of all fires which have happened, according to a printed form given to him for that purpose, as follows:-- Date and hour.

And to renounce happiness and union when the other person is clamouring for a continuance of relations, brings a great measure of consolation, because there is no wound to the self-love, no disastrous feeling that but for personal stupidity the ache need not be. There is even a melancholy pleasure in it, giving a pensive sadness not all pain.

She read French quite easily, but she was not accustomed to judge of its style, and as yet hardly appreciated _nuances_, but the story, the cynical, enchanting, wonderful story, seized hold of her imagination. As she read the last words, the book dropped into her lap and she stared in front of her. She saw what Lord Algy had meant--and it...", "...'Now,' she said, 'here is the cheque.

The man piled the goods in a cab, and in a few minutes she had transferred Betty's presents to a carrier's office, with instructions to send them off at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by a messenger who was to wait at the door until the addressee returned. This was not unnecessary foresight, for Betty would not be back until nine. With the Major's cigarette case in her white muff, Victoria then drove to Bond Street, there to snatch a cup of tea. On the way she stopped the cab to buy a lace blouse for Mary and an umbrella for Charlotte, having forgotten them in her hurry.

He gave personal attention to every detail. He rode on horseback ten or fifteen miles every morning, looking after his estate and its servants.

The general would not wait more than five minutes for any guest, however distinguished. So much time he allowed for the difference of watches. \"My cook,\" said he, \"does not ask whether the guests have arrived, but whether the hour has.\" Washington's dress and appearance were very simple. \"How shall I know him?\" asked a gentleman who was about to ride off in search of him. \"You will meet, sir,\" replied...", "...attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, he was quite haughty.

If so, we must look out for squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The combination is a dreadful one. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being.

It was about three o'clock in the afternoon of the day following Bob's disappearance. They had waited in vain for any news of the lost boy and at about eight-thirty o'clock, Mr. Golden had got into communication, by telephone, with a well-known detective agency in Boston and they had promised to have one of their best men there on the four-forty train. \"Yes, I guess we can do something now. We'll run across in the Sprite, and catch the four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> trolley to town, which will get us there in time to meet that detective, Mr. Sharp.\" Glad of anything which promised action, Jack grabbed his cap and started for the boathouse. It had been a terrible day to him, for he was lost without Bob, and the thought that he might never see him again nearly drove him frantic. He and his father were soon in the Sprite speeding across the lake, and as they reached the wharf in front of the hotel, they saw Fred and Will Jenkins just...", "...hammering on the door of his residence at the outskirts of town.

The colonel and the troops were to surround the officers' messroom, and offer them life and largesse, or death and destruction. Here again we anticipated their choice with composure. The army was then to be paraded in the Piazza, the town overawed or converted, and, behold, the Revolution was accomplished! The success of this design entirely depended on its existence remaining a dead secret from the one man we feared, and on that one man being found alone and unguarded at twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Friday night. If he discovered the plot, we were lost. If he took it into his head to attend the supper, our difficulties would be greatly increased. At this point we turned to the signorina, and I said briefly: \"This appears to be where you come in, signorina.

But don't you think they have arranged the knobs in these mattresses in very curious places?\"' Well, it _was_ a little like sleeping on a wood-pile during a continuous earthquake. But that was nothing compared to the news broken to us about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that our luggage would be examined at the German frontier at five o'clock in the morning. That meant being wakened at half past four. But it was quite unnecessary, for we were not asleep. It was cold and raining. I got up and dressed for the day.

At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we passed _Point Vancouver_, the highest reached by Broughton. The width of the river diminishes considerably above this point, and we began very soon to encounter shoals of sand and gravel; a sure indication that we were nearing the rapids.

The jeweler replied: \"Certainly; the lady telephoned to me.

Through the window he saw her place on the counter a piece of antique jewelry set with garnets. She went away almost immediately, walking quickly and passed through streets that were unknown to the Englishman.

I expected to be more pleased with it than with anything I had seen or was to see, and was insensate enough to rise at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and proceed into the saloon, when of course it was too dark for another hour to see anything.

Will was heard to give a long sigh, but no one spoke as they all came back to the drawing-room, which was full enough by this time--four gentlemen, hotly discussing a cricket-match by the chimney-piece; Wilmet knitting on a stiff chair in the corner; and Robina, under the lamp, hard at work on some point-lace on a green roll.

About three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she kissed him good-bye, and turned homeward. After she had passed the point where the Silver Creek trail ran into the road she heard the sound of a galloping horse behind. A rider was coming along the trail toward town.

Carey left him, and continued his watch at night.

From Sydney, until the Loyalty...", "...seems; how monstrously mighty an orange; how immeasurably great the football of youth; but these are as nought when the naked eye beholds the boulder of barred strength--a mountain of mystery. The usual hour for arousing the inmates of Dunfern Mansion was designated by the ringing of a bell, constructed at the back part of the building, and connected by means of a wire with the room of the footman, whose duty it was to ring fully three minutes every morning at the hour of seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in winter and six in summer. On Christmas morning, only a short time after Lady Dunfern's escape was effected, it rang somewhat later, arousing from sleep all the servants, with the exception of Marjory Mason, who failed entirely to put in an appearance, even when called thrice by Rachel. However, believing that she was still fast asleep, Rachel ceased to further call on her until after serving her ladyship's breakfast. On this festive day the breakfast served in the...", "...Behrisch kept himself either in the chamber of the young count, or at least close to it, when the instructors gave their daily lessons, regularly frequented the lectures with him, never went out in the daytime without him, and accompanied him in all his walks, yet the rest of us were always to be found in Apel's house, and joined them whenever they went on a pleasure ramble: this already excited some attention. Behrisch, too, accustomed himself to our society, and at last, towards nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evenings, generally transferred his pupil into the hands of the /valet de chambre/, and went in quest of us to the wine-house, whither, however, he never used to come but in shoes and stockings, with his sword by his side, and commonly his hat under his arm. The jokes and fooleries, which he generally started, went on /ad infinitum/. Thus, for instance, one of our friends had a habit of going away precisely at ten, because he had a connection with a pretty girl, with...", "...of Justinian Povy, Auditor-General to Queen Anne of Denmark in 1614, whose father was John Povy, citizen and embroiderer of London.] and it is intended him, may not be of the Commission itself, and my Lord I think will endeavour to get him to be contented to be left out of the Commission, and it is a very good rule indeed that the Treasurer in no office ought to be of the Commission. Here we broke off, and I bid him good night, and so with much ado, the streets being at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night crammed with people going home to the city, for all the borders of the river had been full of people, as the King had come, to a miracle got to the Palace Yard, and there took boat, and so to the Old Swan, and so walked home, and to bed very weary. 24th (Lord's day). Slept till 7 o'clock, which I have not done a very great while, but it was my weariness last night that caused it. So rose and to my office till church time, writing down my yesterday's observations,...", "...out of the ordinary had happened. It was the master's order, and as they all came trooping in with inquiring faces, and stood grouped near the back porch, Mrs. Grundy appeared, and told them briefly that their young mistress was coming that afternoon, and that there would be no more work that day. They cheered the news with many a lusty shout, and the pickaninnies rolled over each other, and the youths turned handsprings, while upon each face was a look of high good humor. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mrs. Grundy and I repaired to the settee to watch the road, which could be seen for perhaps a mile, winding through the valley. Then around the corner of the house began to appear the vassals of this Kentucky lord. The stain of the soil had been washed from their hands and faces, and their cotton shirts were clean, though patched and worn. The negresses, also, appeared, with their kinky hair done up in multitudes of \"horns,\" and tied with bits of the most extravagant-colored...", "...said Kitsap. \"I shall take all of Lamson's five hundred dollars in dimes, and the whole reservation will come out to see the fun.\" The cashier granted the leave of absence gladly. \"If you will hold the event in the afternoon, I think the president would be pleased to go out and see it,\" said he. Kitsap needed no other hint, but went boldly to the president and invited him to witness the scattering of the coins. \"With pleasure,\" replied the president. \"Come on the three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train, and I will have a carriage for you,\" said Kitsap. The reservation had been waiting for twenty-cent hops as a band of children wait for the circus. Five thousand dimes to be thrown to less than three hundred children! It would be a rare scramble. Indian children raided their mothers' button-baskets that they might throw the buttons in the sand and practise scrambling for them. Then came the news of twenty-two cent hops, and every Indian, young or old, jumped up and...", "...we'll meet again yet and have a good time together.\" One visitor, wishing not to appear too curious, pretended to be looking at a picture. \"Come, sir,\" said Derues, \"you haven't come here to see the pictures, but to see me. Have a good look at me. Why study copies of nature when you can look at such a remarkable original as I?\" But there were to be no more days of mirth and gaiety for the jesting grocer. His appeal was rejected, and he was ordered for execution on the morrow. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of May 6 Derues returned to the Palais de Justice, there to submit to the superfluous torments of the question ordinary and extraordinary. Though condemned to death, torture was to be applied in the hope of wringing from the prisoner some sort of confession. The doctors declared him too delicate to undergo the torture of pouring cold water into him, which his illustrious predecessor, Mme. de Brinvilliers, had suffered; he was to endure the less severe torture of...", "...to come immediately to the farm of the Bertaux to set a broken leg. Now from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good eighteen miles across country by way of Longueville and Saint-Victor. It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior was afraid of accidents for her husband. So it was decided the stable-boy should go on first; Charles would start three hours later when the moon rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him, and show him the way to the farm, and open the gates for him. Towards four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his cloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still sleepy from the warmth of his bed, he let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse. When it stopped of its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that are dug on the margin of furrows, Charles awoke with a start, suddenly remembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures he knew. The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches of the...", "...Coronacion. Then to my father's, and there staid talking with my mother and him late about my dinner to-morrow. So homewards and took up a boy that had a lanthorn, that was picking up of rags, and got him to light me home, and had great discourse with him how he could get sometimes three or four bushells of rags in a day, and got 3d. a bushell for them, and many other discourses, what and how many ways there are for poor children to get their livings honestly. So home and I to bed at 12 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, being pleased well with the work that my workmen have begun to-day. 26th. Up early to do business in my study. This is my great day that three years ago I was cut of the stone, and, blessed be God, I do yet find myself very free from pain again. All this morning I staid at home looking after my workmen to my great content about my stairs, and at noon by coach to my father's, where Mrs. Turner, The. Joyce, Mr. Morrice, Mr. Armiger, Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and his...", "...I met Murray, looking more pleased with himself than I had seen him since he had taken up the unprofitable task of smuggler-hunting. \"Come along and have some lunch,\" he said, \"I've got a real good thing on this time! That chap Canty came to me late last night, and told me that he knew for a fact that the island on Corran Lake was just stiff with barrels of bacon and rum, and that I'd better send every man I could spare to-day to get them into the town. I sent the men out at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning; I think I've gone one better than Bosanquet this time!\" I began to realise that Philippa was going to score heavily on the subject of the fairies that she had heard snoring on the island, and I imparted to Murray the leading features of our picnic there. \"Oh, Slipper's been up to his chin in that rum from the first,\" said Murray. \"I'd like to know who his sleeping partner was!\" It was beginning to get dark before the loaded carts of the salvage party came...", "...of sport there.\" They talked over the matter for some time before they separated, and Harry Prendergast became quite excited over it. On his return to his rooms he was astonished to find the candles alight and a strong smell of tobacco pervading the place. A lad of about sixteen leapt from the easy-chair in which he had been sitting, with his feet on another. \"Hullo, Harry, I didn't expect you back so soon! The maid said you were dining out, and I suppose that generally means one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before you are back.\" \"Well, what brings you here, Bert? I thought I had got you off my hands for a year at least.\" \"I thought so, myself,\" the lad said coolly; \"but circumstances have been too strong for me. We were running down the Channel the night before last, when a craft that was beating up ran smack into us. I don't know that it was his fault more than ours; the night was dark, and it was very thick, and we did not see each other until she was within a length of...", "...shorter. _Sunday, May 3._--Battle of Chancellorsville. Our battery was ordered to fall back to the Rappahannock at daylight. Marching back, the First corps, commanded by General Reynolds, passed us, going to the front. Arriving at the brick house, near the river, we found some batteries posted there already,--Kirby's amongst them. Our line of battle fell back to the rifle-pits we occupied last night. The enemy holds the plank-road and tavern. The battle is raging again since six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> A. M. About ten o'clock A. M., Lieutenant Kirby ordered his and our battery to the front again, on his own responsibility. We marched back, but very unwillingly. On the way, a division of the Third corps met us, marching back to the river, with a rebel colonel and half of his regiment, as prisoners, and carrying four rebel battle-flags as trophies. Arriving at the front, to our pleasant surprise, we found out that our battery was not wanted at all. Colonel Morgan appeared to be...", "...lightning kept pace with the pealing thunder, and heaven's own artillery seemed let loose. Anything more dismal or dreary could not well be imagined, and gradually the loneliness grew very oppressive. Every straggler had fled to shelter, and the usual idlers had deserted the platform. But I resolutely set to work at the dry statistics of the station-books, with an occasional call to the wires, which were ticking like mad, so fierce was the electric current. It was near five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when a long freight train came lumbering by, switched off a car or two, then dragged its slow length onward. This created a brief diversion, then once more I was deserted. The next passenger train was not due till ten o'clock. I lit the lamps and resigned myself with questionable patience to the intervening hours. An agreeable interruption came in the form of my supper, which was brought in a water-proof basket by a sort of jack-at-all-trades whom we called Jake. Shaking...", "...our destinies had not deserted us; for as the Sabbath morning's light dawned the wind abated and the sea became comparatively calm, except that there was still a heavy swell; but still, there we were, thirteen human beings, in a frail, leaky boat, without an atom of food of any sort, the vast ocean around us, and in a state of perfect ignorance as to our geographical position, while our other physical wants, such as of clothes, boots, &c., made our case truly deplorable. By about twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at noon, on Sunday, we had drifted, as nearly as possible, to the spot where the Amazon had sunk; and upon the then comparatively calm sea were strewn about but too many evidences of the last night's fearful devastation--immense spars, charred timbers, barrels, bales, and boxes innumerable. We drew up one of the latter, got it on board, forced it open, and found that it contained only a quantity of shoes. To those each helped himself to a pair, and then threw the remainder...", "...to Heaven; and the soldiers, by using their swords to protect the sanctions of social order. \"Colombians, my last wishes are for the happiness of our country. If my death can help to destroy the spirit of partisanship, and strengthen union, I shall tranquilly descend to my grave.\" After this act he became delirious and, calling his servant, he said: \"Joseph, let us go away. They are throwing us out of here. Where shall we go?\" On the 17th of December, at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, the great man of the South, one of the greatest men in the history of the world, died. On that same day, eleven years before, in Angostura, Colombia had been created by his genius. He died at the age of forty-seven and one-half years. \"Few men have lived such a beautiful life in the whirlpool of action; nobody has died a more noble death in the peace of his bed.\"[1] [Footnote 1: Bol\u00edvar--J.E.

For...", "...face lit up. \"Right now!\" \"Give me to-night;--two or three hours more, and don't interfere with me between this and then,--and I'll take you on.\" \"It's a go!\" exclaimed Phil, holding out his hand. Jim gripped it, and Phil knew that Jim would keep his word, for he was the kind of man whose word, drunk or sober, was as good as the deed accomplished. \"Mind you, Phil,--I don't say I'll never drink again.\" \"I'm not asking you to promise that,\" answered Phil. \"Right! At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-night I'm through with the long-term Highland Fling for keeps.\" Phil assented to the proposal and left Jim to complete his potato distribution. But Jim could not have remained very long with the job, for, by the time Phil had taken a leisurely stroll round to the forge to have a few words with Sol Hanson, and had partaken of a bit of supper with Betty and the big, genial Swede, Jim had succeeded in putting up his delivery-outfit, had dressed himself out in his cowboy...", "...darling, how can you suppose that a priest, a priest in his surplice, would show himself in a restaurant?\" She listened obediently, and allowed herself to be persuaded. \"You are right, you are right, I know it well enough.\" In that little head of hers illusions were soon dispelled. She was born two hundred and thirty years after the death of Descartes, of whom she had never heard; yet, as Dr. Socrates would have said, he had taught her the use of reason. Robert met her at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> after the rehearsal, under the arcades of the Odeon, and drove away with her in a cab. \"Where are we going?\" she inquired. He hesitated a little. \"You would not care to go back to our house out there?\" She cried out at the suggestion. \"Oh no! I couldn't! Oh, heavens, never!\" He replied that he had thought as much; that he would try to find something else: a little ground-floor flat in Paris; that in the meantime, just for to-day, they would content themselves with...", "...the Isle of Wight. The _Active_ had orders to cruise wherever she pleased within the limits of the admiral's station; and she ran for West Bay, on the other side of the Bill of Portland. The _Happy-go-lucky_ was also bound for that bay to land her cargo. The wind was light, and there was every appearance of fine weather, when the _Happy-go-lucky_, at ten o'clock on the Tuesday night, made the Portland lights; as it was impossible to run her cargo that night, she hove-to. At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the Portland lights were made by the revenue cutter _Active_. Mr. Appleboy went up to have a look at them, ordered the cutter to be hove-to, and then went down to finish his allowance of gin-toddy. At twelve o'clock the yacht _Arrow_ made the Portland lights, and continued her course, hardly stemming the ebb tide. Day broke, and the horizon was clear. The first on the look-out were, of course, the smugglers; they, and those on board the revenue cutter, were the only two...", "...for a spectator during the last four innings. After the game he came out on the grounds and shook hands with us all, complimenting us in a nice little speech on the skill that we had shown and expressing his own liking for the game that he had that morning seen for the first time. That afternoon we left for Ballarat, the great gold-mining center of Australia, and at one time famous as the home of the bushrangers who for years terrorized that section of the country. It was six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning when we arrived there, and we were just climbing into the drag that was awaiting us when some one missed Tom Daly. After a search he was found fast asleep in one of the compartments of the car, and being awakened was released by an obliging guard, looking a bit the worse for wear. In the early gray of the dawning we reached Craig's Hotel, where lunch had been arranged for us, after partaking which we were driven to the Botanical Gardens, the roadway winding along...", "...I have already intimated, this tavern with the curious name (a name totally unsuggestive, by the way, of its location on a perfectly straight road) had for its southern aspect the road and a broad expanse beyond of varied landscape which made the front rooms cheerful even on a cloudy day; but it was otherwise with those in the rear and on the north end. They were never cheerful, and especially toward night were frequently so dark that artificial light was resorted to as early as three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. It was so to-day in the remote parlour which these three now entered. A lamp had been lit, though the daylight still struggled feebly in, and it was in this conflicting light that there rose up before them the vision of a woman, who seen at any time and in any place would have drawn, if not held, the eye, but seen in her present attitude and at such a moment of question and suspense, struck the imagination with a force likely to fix her image forever in the...", "...\"Are you fond of me still?\" \"Just as fond as ever.\" She put up her lips and he kissed her. There was a surrender in the action which he had never seen in her before. It was worth all the agony he had suffered. She went away and he found that she had been there for two hours. He was extraordinarily happy. \"Poor thing, poor thing,\" he murmured to himself, his heart glowing with a greater love than he had ever felt before. He never thought of Norah at all till about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a telegram came. He knew before opening it that it was from her. Is anything the matter? Norah. He did not know what to do nor what to answer. He could fetch her after the play, in which she was walking on, was over and stroll home with her as he sometimes did; but his whole soul revolted against the idea of seeing her that evening. He thought of writing to her, but he could not bring himself to address her as usual, dearest Norah. He made up his mind to...", "...decided that he would try to make himself visible to two young ladies whom he knew, and he concentrated his mind on the effort just before going to bed. He willed to show himself in their room at one o'clock in the morning. The distance from his house to theirs was three miles. Next time he saw them, a few days later, they told him they had had a great fright: the elder sister had seen Mr B.'s apparition, had screamed and awakened her little sister, who also saw him. The time was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. They told him this before he said anything about his experiment, and they had no reason to expect that he would try anything of the kind. Both Mr B. and his brother are keen and successful business men; Mr S. H. B. is now retired, his brother is still the head of a large firm. I mention this because some critics seem to have a notion that psychical researchers are a crowd of long-haired poets or semi-lunatic cranks.

That for some time his intention was well known is proved by the group that little by little gathered on the opposite side of the street. It is a matter of record that a small boy passing by was commandeered and sent with a message for Peter Wrightman, a deputy sheriff. Pete, out of breath, soon joined the group. There he idled, also watching,--an official charged with the maintenance of the law of the land! At just five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> King turned the corner, his head bent. He started to cross the street diagonally and had almost reached the opposite sidewalk when he was confronted by Casey who stepped forward from his place of concealment behind a wagon. \"Come on,\" he said, throwing back his cloak, and immediately fired. King, who could not have known what Casey was saying, was shot through the left breast, staggered, and fell. Casey then took several steps toward his victim, looked at him closely as...", "...the usual game. Lacking other interests, Nan found it amused her to play at it, to contend with the leaders, to form alliances, to declare war, to assume by right and talent her place among the best. This pleased Keith. Social standing helped him in business; and he enjoyed the sight of his beautiful young wife queening it serenely over the city's best. He was always eager to advance money for new gowns or expensive parties. At first he went out with her, but soon found that three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning meant a next day's brain dulled of its keenest edge. But he would not hear of her staying at home on his account. \"I'm tired, and I'm going to bed right away,\" he told her. \"You go and uphold the splendour of the family. Get Ben to take you.\" Ben Sansome was to Keith a tremendous convenience. He was the only idle man in town, always on tap, ready to stay out any and every night until the cocks crowed. Why shouldn't he? He had nothing to do all next day,...", "...on top of the other. By one man each little body was seized and the clothing quickly cut from it.

A few of their number who lost presence of mind when the flood struck the train were drowned.

Fifteen cents was a lower price than he had calculated on. \"That's a sensible idea!\" said the farmer, rubbing his hands with satisfaction at the thought that he had secured valuable help at no money outlay whatever. The next morning Carl continued his tramp, refusing the offer of continued employment on the same terms. He was bent on pursuing his journey, though he did not know exactly where he would fetch up in the end. At twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that day he found himself in the outskirts of a town, with the same uncomfortable appetite that he had felt the day before, but with no hotel or restaurant anywhere near. There was, however, a small house, the outer door of which stood conveniently open. Through the open window, Carl saw a table spread as if for dinner, and he thought it probable that he could arrange to become a boarder for a single meal. He knocked at the door, but no one came. He shouted out: \"Is anybody at...", "...bowing to his niece with pompous deference.

A sultana, sir!\" \"Then, gentlemen,\" said Burr, rising with glass in hand, \"let us do ourselves the honor of drinking the health of Madam Blennerhassett.\" When, at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, the travellers went down to the boat, not a soul did they find on board. Seven o'clock came, but no Captain Pierce, no minion of his. Burr made inquiry of the agent, the tavern-keeper and others, without obtaining information concerning any of the missing men. Much incensed, he and Arlington were compelled to lodge another night in the best bedchamber of the Green Tree. III. PILLARS OF SMOKE.

Then during the day the tension became tight and tighter, for how the fight was going exactly no one could tell and it seemed well-nigh impossible to stop the vote steal that was going on all over the city, protected by the organized government. Defeat seemed inevitable. So at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the disgusted Cap picked up his hat and started home and to the astonishment of the whole headquarters David Kildare calmly rose and followed him without a word to the others, who failed to realize that he had deserted until he was entirely gone.

Arriving at Morton's Ford, skirmishing commenced between ours and the rebel infantry. A rebel battery on a hill opened on our battery, while going in position close to the river. We did not open immediately, as the rebel battery fired but a few rounds. The Third division, under General Hayes, forded the stream. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, General Webb, of the Second division, ordered the infantry to advance, and our battery to fire. We used twenty-four rounds. The infantry pushed on, half-way up the hill, but had to retire at dark. Our battery fired fifteen more rounds, by Lieutenant Colonel Munroe's order. The infantry kept on fighting until seven o'clock in the evening. It rained all day. _Sunday, February 7._--In line of battle at Morton's Ford.

Turkish bombardments and trench \"strafes\" once more became the order of the day. Not to let the enemy have everything his own way, we ourselves arranged, late in October, to make a tremendous onslaught on the Turks. One of their trenches, known as H. 12, occupied a somewhat commanding position and had been giving us a lot of trouble. It was decided, therefore, to batter it out of existence. Sharp to time, at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on a very \"nippy\" afternoon, a most terrific cannonade was opened on the doomed trench. Naval guns, French guns, British howitzers and field-pieces rained a devastating fire of high explosives and, as if this were not enough, three huge volcanoes spurted out at three points of the trench, denoting that some great mines had been exploded. While the fire lasted, it was terrific, and the dust and smoke speedily hid all the Turkish trenches, as well as Krithia and Achi Baba, from...", "...of the royal sleeping-room. \"The Chamber,\" one of the eleven offices in the service of the King, comprised four first gentlemen of the Chamber, twenty-four gentlemen of the Chamber, twenty-four pages of the Chamber, four first valets of the Chamber, sixteen ushers, thirty-two valets of the Chamber, two cloak-bearers, two gun-bearers, eight barbers, three watch-makers, one dentist, and many minor attendants--all under the direction of the Grand Chamberlain. A few minutes before eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> it was the duty of the chief _valet de chambre_ to see that a fire was laid in the King's chamber (if the weather required one), that blinds were drawn, and candles snuffed. As the clock chimed the hour of eight, he approached the embroidered red velvet curtains of the royal bed with the announcement, \"Sire, it is the hour.\" When the curtains were drawn and the royal eyelids lifted upon a new day, the children of the King were admitted to make their morning obeisance.

Do be punctual this time, pray.\" It was about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning that, after sitting up reading hard, and trying to recover lost time, till half-past three, North was plunged in a deep sleep, in which he dreamed that Leo was smiling in his eyes, and repeating the words she had uttered in her delirium, when there was a heavy dragging at the night-bell. \"What is it?\" cried the doctor from his window. \"My young master, sir,\" cried the voice of the butler from the Hall. \"Taken ill?\" \"Ill, sir?

How exquisite it was--that dress in Evelina's shop off Shaftesbury Avenue! It was four o'clock on a fine day early in April, and was Fanny the one to spend four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on a fine day indoors? Other girls in that very street sat over ledgers, or drew long threads wearily between silk and gauze; or, festooned with ribbons in Swan and Edgars, rapidly added up pence and farthings on the back of the bill and twisted the yard and three-quarters in tissue paper and asked \"Your pleasure?\" of the next comer. In Evelina's shop off Shaftesbury Avenue the parts of a woman were shown separate. In the left hand was her skirt. Twining round a pole in the...", "...Joel--we are all going to live in that fine house and be comfortable and happy at last.\" He bowed silently. That was his answer. He accepted her proposal as a proud man might a shameful verdict of death. He went back to his wagon, raised his tattered hat, and mounted upon his load of wood.

He was to take the midnight train and was finishing his packing in his room at about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when Cavanaugh came in. \"I have something to tell you that you may or may not like,\" the old man faltered. \"I don't know how you'll feel about it, but Joel Eperson is at the gate and says he wants to speak to you.\" \"Eperson!\" John exclaimed, with a start. \"Yes, and the poor fellow looks awful, John.

It's his...", "...be suppressed, even when he was ministering at the altar. But to-day the organist's doubtful compliment to the Madonna passed almost unnoticed by Don Agostino. He knew that his people gave of their best to their religion; and, if that best were not of a standard to satisfy more artistic or more pious conceptions, the fact did not greatly concern him. The truth was that it was not the first time by many that Don Agostino had heard selections from \"La Traviata\" at the half-past nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> mass, and on this occasion he had more important matters to occupy his mind than the lack both of perception of the fitness of things and of a sense of humor on the part of the organist. A glance round the church as he had entered it and made his way to the altar, showed him that there was scarcely a man, and certainly none of the younger men, among the congregation. The fact was all the more noticeable because Don Agostino invariably had a good attendance of men at that...", "...Ord directions to continue his march to Burkesville and there intrench himself for the night, and in the morning to move west to cut off all the roads between there and Farmville. I then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort of cavalry, going directly through the woods, to join Meade's army. The distance was about sixteen miles; but the night being dark our progress was slow through the woods in the absence of direct roads. However, we got to the outposts about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, and after some little parley convinced the sentinels of our identity and were conducted in to where Sheridan was bivouacked. We talked over the situation for some little time, Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee was trying to do, and that Meade's orders, if carried out, moving to the right flank, would give him the coveted opportunity of escaping us and putting us in rear of him. We then together visited Meade, reaching his headquarters about...", "...afternoon the sea had quieted down a little, and it was decided that it would be safe for us to land at the settlement. Personally I was rather disappointed at this decision; but it gave, we believe, much satisfaction to the captain, who did not seem at all to like the idea of landing us on the sea-shore, where we should certainly have had to spend one night, and might have had to spend several. We steamed to within three-quarters of a mile of the settlement, and between three and four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all was in readiness for us to leave the steamer. Farewells were said, and then we descended to the lower deck, which was crowded with people. One island boat had already left. The other had been hauled on to the ship, and it was thought best that we should get into it and then be lowered. As they began to lift the boat there was an ominous crack, which caused the chief officer to tell us to get out, which we quickly did. The boat was then lowered into the sea. One by one we...", "...passed this island we had only ten fathom water, with a rocky bottom, and therefore I was afraid of running down to leeward, lest I should meet with shoal water and foul ground. These islands have no place in the charts except they are the Arrou islands; and if these, they are laid down much too far from New Guinea. I found the south part of them to lie in latitude 7 deg. 6' S., longitude 225 deg. W. We continued to steer W.S.W., at the rate of four miles and a half an hour, till ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, when we had forty-two fathom, at eleven we had thirty-seven, at twelve forty-five, at one in the morning, forty-nine, and at three, 120, after which we had no ground. At day-light we made all the sail we could, and at ten o'clock saw land extending from N.N.W. to W. by N., distant between five and six leagues: At noon it bore from N. to W., and at about the same distance: It appeared to be level, and of a moderate height; by our distance from New Guinea, it ought to...", "...at the mouth of the creek above it, and also the circular battery on the opposite or east side of the river. The light squadron consisted of the Modeste, Columbine, and Clio, towed respectively by the Nemesis, Phlegethon, and Pluto. The channel had been buoyed off the previous night, and two junks had been moored so as to mark the entrance, on the eastern side of which there ran out a long sand-bank. At the dawn of day on the 16th all the ships of war got under weigh, and by six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they were in tow of their respective steamers. In this instance, and indeed throughout all the operations in the north of China, under Sir William Parker, the steamers were always lashed _alongside_ the vessels they had to tow, instead of going ahead. This plan was found to answer remarkably well in the intricate navigation of the Yangtze river, as the movements of both vessels were more easily managed. The Blonde, towed by the Tenasserim, led in towards the batteries; the...", "...work requires it, a large force is turned into the fields; and the women labor with the men in the harvest. The workmen in the factories are, of course, not often changed. The children are kept at school between the ages of six and thirteen; the sexes do not sit in separate rooms. The school opens at seven o'clock, and the children study and recite until half-past nine. From that hour until eleven, when they are dismissed for dinner, they knit gloves, wristlets, or stockings. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> school reopens, and they once more attend to lessons until three, from which hour till half-past four they knit again. The teachers are men, but they are relieved by women when the labor-school begins. Boys as well as girls are required to knit. One of the teachers said to me that this work kept them quiet, gave them habits of industry, and kept them off the streets and from rude plays. They instruct the children in musical notation, but do not allow musical instruments....", "...Pee-wee's new friend continued, \"and we thought it meant there was good fishing there. So I said I'd go and see if I could catch a couple of eels and sunfish or something. While I was out at the edge of that little knob of land or whatever you want to call it, all of a sudden I could feel something giving way under me and the first thing I knew the whole business was in the water. \"Oh, you should have heard those fellows laugh as I went sailing down the river. That was about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning and the tide was running down strong. This little old island flopped around and went every which way but it stayed right side up anyway and do you think I'd desert the ship? By the time we flopped downstream this far the tide was so low that our little old roots dragged the bottom and we stopped for keeps. So here we are till the tide comes in anyway. I don't know whether we'll float in deep water or not, or whether we'll capsize in deep water or not and I...", "...the day of rising; but all the documents, as well as his own narrative, prove this to be an error.] the first in the northern, the second in the western counties. It was the intention of Wagstaff to surprise Winchester during the assizes; but the unexpected arrival[a] of a troop of cavalry deterred him from the attempt. He waited patiently till the judges proceeded to Salisbury; and, learning that their guard had not accompanied them, entered that city with two hundred men at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning of Monday.[b] The main body with their leader took possession of the market-place; while small detachments brought away the horses from the several inns, liberated the prisoners in the gaol, and surprised the sheriff and the two judges in their beds. At first Wagstaff gave orders that these three should be immediately hanged; for they were traitors acting under the authority of the usurper; then, pretending to relent, he discharged the judges on their parole, but...", "...left a message there for me, and I started up the street. But an inquiry of the clerk developed the fact that, while Godfrey was still stopping there, he had gone out immediately after dinner, and had left no message of any kind. For a moment I was fairly taken aback, so confident had I been; but perhaps Godfrey had deemed a message superfluous after the hint given in the telegram--I knew how he detested the obvious. He had no doubt thought that hint sufficient--and it was. Eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was striking as I gained the street again, and turned my steps toward the Lawrence place. If there were indeed any new developments, it must be either there or at the cottage that they had come to light. That was self-evident; that could be the only rendezvous; it was there Godfrey was awaiting me. So I walked on rapidly, and in a very few minutes reached my destination. The house was dark and gloomy, as it had been the night before. I entered the grounds and made a careful...", "...looked at him, annoyed and troubled him. After supper, the uneasiness he had felt during the afternoon, returned, and worried his mind considerably. The fact was, the brandy had already disturbed the well balanced action of the lower viscera. The mucous membrane of the whole (sic) alementry canal had been stimulated beyond health, and its secretions were increased and slightly vitiated. This was the cause of the uneasiness he felt, and the slight pains which had alarmed him. By ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> his feelings had become so disagreeable, that he felt constrained to meet them with another \"mouthful,\" of brandy. Thus, in less than ten hours, Mr. Hobart had wronged his stomach by pouring into it three glasses of brandy; entirely disturbing its healthy action. The morning found Mr. Hobart far from feeling well. His skin was dry and feverish and his mouth parched. There was an uneasy sensation of pain in his head. Immediately upon rising he took a strong glass of brandy....", "...untimely graves; the sun of prosperity smiled upon the fortress-city, and its light-hearted inhabitants had just begun their nightly round of pleasure and gaiety. The viceroyalty of Lord Elgin was drawing rapidly to a close, and two parties, given every week at Government House, afforded an example which the good people of Quebec were not slow to follow. There were musical parties, _conversaziones_, and picnics to the Chaudi\u00e8re and Lorette; and people who were dancing till four or five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning were vigorous enough after ten for a gallop to Montmorenci. The absolute restlessness of the city astonished me very much. The morning seemed to begin, with fashionable people, with a desultory breakfast at nine o'clock, after which some received callers, others paid visits, or walked into the town to make trifling purchases at the stores; while not a few of the young ladies promenaded St. Louis Street or the ramparts, where they were generally joined by the...", "...had entreated Leonisa to dress herself just as she had appeared in the tent before the two pashas, for he wished to play off a pleasant trick upon his relations.

It was about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when they entered the harbour, and the morning was so calm and clear that it seemed as though it were intent on beholding this joyful arrival. Before coming into port, Ricardo fired a salute with the three pieces belonging to the galley, which were one gun amidships, and two falconets; the town returned the salute with an equal number. The whole shore was in lively commotion, watching the approach of the gaily decked galley; but when they had a nearer view of it, and saw by...", "...the two scientists continued their discussion on how to equip Exman with senses and the power of speech.

It was now about 11 o'clock, fighting having continued since about 6 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. I had learned, in the meantime, that the enemy were in heavy force, fully three times our number, with twelve pieces of artillery, under General Forrest in person; consequently I was fearful that they were making an effort to get around us and attack in the rear of our position; hence I decided to resume the march. Everything was soon in readiness, and we moved out, leaving a strong guard (dismounted) in the rear, to check any immediate...", "...first edition ran as follows: QUINN'S CASTLE VANISHES. AND SO DOES QUINN! WITH HOUSE AND BELONGINGS. THE HARLEM SAGE DISAPPEARS IN A SINGLE HOUR. LEAVING NOT A TRACE BEHIND. What happened to Professor Quinn last night? And what happened to the strange steel structure known locally among Harlem residents as Quinn's Castle? For Quinn and his castle were snuffed out like a candle-gleam some time between the hours of eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and midnight. Patrolman Casey, who travels a beat in that part of Harlem, avers that he passed the castle at eleven o'clock, and that it was there; he passed its site again at twelve, and it was not there. Considerably exercised, Patrolman Casey made search for the castle, and although he beat up the country for a dozen blocks in all directions, he failed to find it. And what is more, Patrolman Casey declares that he took the pledge when he...", "...while the others enjoy cool air and starlight.

By ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the mattresses are brought. They are spread in a row on the floor, and we weary women, four in number, lie down and sleep as only weary people can. The summons that arouses us at five the next morning does not awaken enthusiasm. We struggle up, however, and get each a minimum of the limited basin and towel privilege. Descending, we find Major Zampacopolus in full uniform, and are admonished by him for being so late. He came for us at four o'clock; but the chief veteran would...", "...up in a flash and commences to grin. \"I'd be very glad indeed to show it to you,\" he says. \"Very glad!

It was wonderful to see how clean everything was in that little square room, yet with the exception of the fire-place, she cleaned everything herself. At about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the day she was dressed, and standing at the door, to catch passers by. She never spoke to them unless they spoke to her. She was to me at first a novel experience but I soon had plenty of experience of the poor class of women in adjacent streets.

It was late Sunday afternoon when dust on the south trail announced the coming of Elsa and Ernest. Gustav and Roger had given the entire morning to putting the camp in order. Gustav had achieved his _chef-d'oeuvre_ in a huge \"welcome\" made of yucca stalks outlined over the living tent door. Roger had given Peter to Felicia and about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she appeared, riding the little burro whose face she explained she had washed with soap and water for the occasion. Charley and Dick followed not long after. For the first time Roger realized that Charley's isolation had meant more to her than she allowed any of them to suspect. She nearly wept as she begged that Elsa be permitted to stay with them and went over the living tent and the cook tent with a critical eye. When the cloud of dust appeared upon the horizon Roger saw...", "...in the party had been formed into three companies, and each of these into four watches; every third night it is the duty of one of these companies to keep watch and ward over the camp, and it is so arranged that each watch takes its turn of guard duty through the different watches of the night. Those forming the first watch to-night, will be second on duty, then third and fourth, which brings them all through the watches of the night.

He turned his back on the group, and re-entered the hall, trembling with suppressed emotion. There he spent another miserable two hours, resolving every moment to go home, and yet incapable of tearing himself from the magic spell of her environment. He sat moping in silence behind the broad back of a whist-player, apparently engrossed in watching the game, and only glad that no one disturbed him. When it was almost three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he heard one of the young officers telling a servant to order round the Uhlenfelde sleigh. A swift decision made him spring up, take his leave, and rush to the stables to see that his own horse was put in as speedily as possible. A clear, cold moonlight lay on the white world.

She disliked the confinement and routine of teaching so much that she decided to try a new kind of work, and secured a place in the Mint, where she described her duties vividly to her interested friends. \"I sat on a stool,\" she said, \"from seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning to six at night for twenty-eight dollars a month.

Livingston would not commit himself, again insisting that he must consult Monroe. So important did this interview seem to Livingston that he returned to his apartment and wrote a long report to Madison without waiting to confer with Monroe. It was three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning when he was done. \"We shall do all we can to cheapen the purchase,\" he wrote, \"but my present sentiment is that we shall buy.\" History does not record what Monroe said when his colleague revealed these midnight secrets.

They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the _Bonadventure_, carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be impossible to rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree, yet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller he anxiously endeavoured to pierce the darkness which surrounded them. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning he started forward,-- \"A light! a light!\" he shouted. Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the north-east. Lincoln Island was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding, showed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too much to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire, which burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first magnitude. [Illustration: A LIGHT! A LIGHT!] CHAPTER...", "...Jack highly pleased at the proposed change. He left Indret one July morning, just four years after his arrival. What a superb day it was! The air became more fresh as the little steamer he was on approached the ocean. Jack had never seen the sea. The fresh salt breeze inspired him with restless longing. Saint Nazarre lay before him,--the harbor crowded with shipping. They landed at the dock, and there learned that the Cydnus, of the _Compagnie Transatlantique_, would sail at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that day, and was already lying outside,--this being, in fact, the only way to have the crew all on board at the moment of departure. Jack and his companion--for Father Rondic had insisted on seeing him on board his ship--had no time to see anything of the town, which had all the vivacity of a market-day. The wharf was piled with vegetables, with baskets of fruit, and with fowls which, tied together, were wildly struggling for liberty.

Mounted my horse at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and by easy riding reached a farm house in Rock River Bottom, where I passed the noon hour. After dinner I made good time as the weather had changed and become cold, reminding me of the necessity of hurrying on if I would avoid the deep snows which the traveller is sure to encounter in the elevated regions farther west and it was every day more evident that I could not well afford to allow my lecture appointments to conflict with the dispatch of my journey.

But at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> three persons of the most extraordinary appearance, led by M. Kangourou, present themselves with profound bows at the door of my cabin. They are arrayed in long robes bedizened with dark patterns; they have the flowing locks, high foreheads, and pallid countenances of persons too exclusively devoted to the fine arts; and, perched on the top of their coiffures, they wear sailor hats of English shape tipped jauntily on one side.

With the coming of daylight, on July 1st, the army lay beneath a dense blanket of mist that spread its wet folds over the entire region they were to traverse. It was eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before Grimes's battery of four light field-pieces, posted on El Poso Hill, opened an ineffective fire upon the heights across the broad valley.

So shells began to fall about the battery with such startling accuracy that a score of Americans and Cubans...", "...\"As soon as possible.

They agreed upon a meeting at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the next morning, or at ten, if Felix should not have sufficiently recovered before, and the place was to be a small copse on Baron Cloten's estate. Then the gentlemen returned--it may be imagined in what state of mind to the ball-room, where the ladies had been waiting for some time, to escort them to the supper-rooms. Felix had been carried off by his friends to his rooms; he was too drunk and too much stunned by his fall to appear again in the company. Oldenburg returned...", "...Pacific, promised a rich experience, and the opportunity was golden. The good news from home was therefore joyfully received.

By two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I was on the road again, riding briskly toward Monroe, for the weather was so much cooler than it had been during the previous week, that I could move comfortably at a good pace. _Paul_ seemed very proud of his new shoes, and, although I halted two or three times, covered something over ten miles by five o'clock. As I reached the outskirts of Monroe, I was considerably surprised to find a large number of people assembled on the picnic grounds. They were accompanied by a...", "...passed before her, and the successive scenes of the crucifixion were panoramically progressive. She saw Christ in person--His clothing, His wounds, His crown of thorns, His cross--as well as the Apostles, the holy women, and the assembled Jews.

From midday of Thursdays, when she took a frugal meal, until eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Saturday mornings the girl took no nourishment, not even water, because it was said that she did not feel the want of it and could not retain anything upon her stomach.

He had had it set out, he told me ever since five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> (for I had sent to tell him I would be there that night). While I ate he would say nothing at all of the business on hand; but talked only of France and what I had done there. He told me the King was very greatly pleased; and there were rewards if I wished them--or even a title, though he was not sure of what kind, for I was a very young man. \"He vows you have done a thousand times more than the Duchess of Portsmouth in all her time. But I would recommend you to take...", "...disappeared, rounding the spit of land. Majendie, as he paced the deck and talked to his men of wind and weather, turned casually, on his heel, to look at her where she stood alone in the level immensity of the land. The world looked empty all around her. And he was touched with a sudden poignant realisation of her life; its sadness, its incompleteness, its isolation. That was what he had brought her to.

Even Scale, where it stretched its flat avenues into the country, showed golden in the warm and brilliant air. The household in Prior Street had been up early, making preparations for the day. Peggy had waked before it was light, to feel her presents which lay beside her on her bed; and, by the time Majendie's sail had passed Fawlness Point, she was up and dressed, waiting for him. Anne had to break it to her gently that perhaps he...", "...two forefingers rather ruefully. One was roughened by the use of the vegetable knife, for the times had been hard and houseworkers scarce at Harley's Mills that winter; while the other was pricked deep from the sewing of harsh muslin for the clothing that some would otherwise have lacked. \"But really, Miss Emmy, don't you think it would look more honest if I wore my own gown?\" Miss Emmy laughingly acknowledged that perhaps it might, yet held her point with determination, and eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> saw the party of six gathered in the opera-box, their faces differing almost as much in expression as the details of their clothing. Jeanne Latimer and Miss Emmy were what might be called very much dressed without having overstepped the bounds of good taste. Miss Emmy wore pale blue satin with much fine lace and pearl ornaments; though pale in the morning, her color always grew somewhat hectic at night and helped justify a combination by far too young for her years. While...", "...a smile. We were afforded a novel and striking scene before we left Zatrijebac in the form of an open-air Mass on Sunday. The church being in the course of rebuilding, a rough altar had been hastily constructed, or rather knocked up--for it was of most crude workmanship--of wood planks on a small grass plot. From nine a.m. onwards the people began to assemble, coming from all parts of the large and straggling district, and sat about in groups gravely talking. Towards eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a large number of peasants had arrived, and the altar was covered with not a fair white cloth as usual, but with something suspiciously resembling a long and not overclean towel. A tiny crucifix was placed upon it, and the young priest robed himself there in sight of the whole congregation. A group of elder men knelt or squatted on the small open space immediately in front of the High Altar, but the majority of worshippers ranged themselves under the shade of some small trees...", "...is always a tremendous task, dear friends--a mammoth task. Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy.

Nothing was noticed until about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, when, as Mr. Weller has informed us, he was awakened by a low, grinding sound, which, in his quaint style, he says reminded him \"a fellow in _quad_ a-filing his irons.\" With much promptitude he rose and, loosening the dog, proceeded in the direction of the sounds; the villains, however, became alarmed, and Mr. Weller was just in time to see them, as he says, \"a-cuttin' their lucky\" over the garden wall. Much sympathy is expressed for the...", "...\"Come, Sybil, dear, get into bed,\" said Beatrix, taking her hand and lifting her up. \"Yes,\" said the docile creature, and immediately did as her friend directed her. There was no surer or sadder symptoms in Sybil's insanity, than the perfect docility of her who had once been so difficult to manage. She went quietly to bed. Beatrix prepared to follow her. But Miss Pendleton was faint from long fasting. Neither she nor Sybil had tasted anything since their luncheon at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that day, when the court had taken a recess. They had reached the prison sometime after supper had been served; and in the awful crisis of Sybil's fate, no one had thought of food. Sybil did not seem to require it; she lay in a quiet lethargy, like death. But Beatrix was half-famished when she went to bed. Her hunger, however, was soon forgotten in the great anxiety of her mind; and the sharpest point of it was this: What effect would the night's repose have on Sybil's...", "...\"What is it?\" \"Chicot, my friend, it is I.\" \"You; who?\" \"I, Henri.\" \"Decidedly, my son, the pheasants must have disagreed with you; I warned you at supper, but you would eat so much of them, as well as of those crabs.\" \"No; I scarcely tasted them.\" \"Then you are poisoned, perhaps.

The English lost heavily, but the onslaught of the enemy had totally failed, and thousands of prisoners remained behind. There was a pause in the infantry combat; and again the artillery of Napoleon battered the English centre, while Ney marshalled fresh troops for a new and greater effort. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the attack was renewed on the left. La Haye Sainte was carried, and vast masses of cavalry pressed up the English slope, and rode over the plateau to the very front of the English line. Wellington sent no cavalry to meet them, but trusted, and trusted justly, to the patience and endurance of the infantry themselves, who, hour after hour, held their ground, unmoved by the rush of the enemy's horse and the terrible spectacle of havoc and death in their own ranks; for all through...", "...the boards gave off a sweet smell of pine woods, as the heap of yellow shavings grew higher and higher. I wondered why Fuchs had not stuck to cabinet-work, he settled down to it with such ease and content. He handled the tools as if he liked the feel of them; and when he planed, his hands went back and forth over the boards in an eager, beneficent way as if he were blessing them.

It was a fine clear frosty moonlight, and the hollow sound of the drum resounded through the silent streets...", "...It was simply impossible to live with such a porcupine on board. It was a mystery to him that Mr. Lowington had procured the services of such an unsuitable instructor; but the fact was, that he had been engaged by the principal's agent on the strength of his classical attainments, rather than his fitness for the place.

About 3:30 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> one afternoon we arrived in Genipapo in the interior of the State of Bahia, after having ridden since early morning upon the railroad train through a mountainous country which, with its tropical vegetation, held our keenest interest. We were met at the station by some members of our church, who escorted us to the home of Polycarpo Nogueira. Mrs Nogueira is a very devout Christian. Some years ago she learned that her mother had embraced Christianity. Mrs. Nogueira set out upon a...", "...another retrograde movement, which brought me back to the southern face of Missionary Ridge, where I was joined by Carlin's brigade of Davis's division. Still thinking I could join General Thomas, I rode some distance to the left of my line to look for a way out, but found that the enemy had intervened so far as to isolate me effectually. I then determined to march directly to Rossville, and from there effect a junction with Thomas by the Lafayette road. I reached Rossville about <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, bringing with me eight guns, forty-six caissons, and a long ammunition train, the latter having been found in a state of confusion behind the widow Glenn's when I was being driven back behind the Dry Valley road. The head of my column passed through Rossville, appearing upon Thomas's left about 6 o'clock in the evening, penetrated without any opposition the right of the enemy's line, and captured several of his field-hospitals. As soon as I got on the field...", "...centre of a system of drawing-rooms. When she removed the cordovan leather from the grand piano and ventured to play a few notes on it, it sounded with a mournful sadness, startling the dismal echoes of the house. George's picture was gone, and laid upstairs in a lumber-room in the garret; and though there was a consciousness of him, and father and daughter often instinctively knew that they were thinking of him, no mention was ever made of the brave and once darling son. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mr. Osborne came back to his dinner, which he and his daughter took in silence (seldom broken, except when he swore and was savage, if the cooking was not to his liking), or which they shared twice in a month with a party of dismal friends of Osborne's rank and age. Old Dr. Gulp and his lady from Bloomsbury Square; old Mr. Frowser, the attorney, from Bedford Row, a very great man, and from his business, hand-in-glove with the \"nobs at the West End\"; old Colonel Livermore, of...", "...its gallant crew of marines to help in handling the naval guns. Lord Methuen deployed the cavalry on the flanks, while the artillery took up positions in front of the Boer trenches. Meanwhile the 9th Brigade went forward in skirmishing order. This consisted of the Northumberland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion Northamptons, half-Battalion Loyal North Lancashires, 2nd Battalion King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry. With the 9th was the Naval Brigade, commanded by Captain Prothero. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> an active artillery duel began, the guns of the foe being splendidly posted, and their range, as before-said, carefully calculated. Their shells burst with appalling fracas over our batteries, but the brave British gunners never swerved. They gave the Boers some smart and telling replies, and presently, on withdrawing their guns to a new position, quite defeated the calculations of the enemy, whose shells now began to fall wide of the mark. The rifle-fire of the Dutchmen was...", "...Hereward.\" \"You--don't--say--so!\" breathed her ladyship, slowly. \"And now, you know how to manage it. You must aid the young couple as much as you can by giving them as much as possible of each other's society.\" \"Yes, I see,\" said her ladyship. \"And now--don't look toward them again.\" The banker nodded intelligently. And they gave their attention to the game. And the two young people seemed to find inexhaustible interest in the volume they were bending over. It was eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before the young marquis arose to take leave. \"I have asked Miss Levison to ride with me in the Park to-morrow, and she has kindly consented--with your approbation, Sir Lemuel,\" said the young man. \"Certainly, Mr. Scott. I consider horseback riding one of the most healthful of exercises,\" said the banker, heartily. The young marquis then bowed and took his leave. Lady Belgrade gathered up her embroidery work and bade them good-night. \"My girl, what do you think of...", "...I owe you one for this. How did you manage to carry all those things?\" \"Large hands,\" said Hughie. \"Half a minute!\" He produced from his tail-pocket two forks, a napkin, and a bottle of soda-water. \"I remembered you liked your drink diluted,\" he said, pouring out both bottles at once. \"I noticed it at dinner, the other night.\" \"Hughie, you're a dear!\" said Joan impulsively. \"Say when!\" remarked Hughie unsteadily. * * * * * It was five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning.

The Manors party, all twelve of them, were being scientifically packed into an omnibus constructed to seat...", "...fog seemed to have cleared from the room somewhat, but since in the midnight stillness I could detect the muffled sounds of sirens from the river and the reports of fog signals from the railways, I concluded that the night was not yet wholly clear of the choking mist. In accordance with a pre-arranged scheme we had decided to guard \"the key of India\" (whatever it might be) turn and turn about through the night. In a word--we feared to sleep unguarded. Now my watch informed me that four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> approached, at which hour I was to arouse Smith and retire to sleep to my own bedroom. Nothing had disturbed my vigil--that is, nothing definite. True once, about half an hour earlier, I had thought I heard the dragging and tapping sound from somewhere up above me; but since the corridor overhead was unfinished and none of the rooms opening upon it yet habitable, I concluded that I had been mistaken. The stairway at the end of our corridor, which communicated with that above,...", "...14 deg. 49' S; longitude made 25 deg. 46' W; course S 88 deg. W; distance 75 miles. [Sidenote: Thursday 21.] Thursday, May the 21st. Fresh gales, and heavy showers of rain. Wind E N E. Our distresses were now very great, and we were so covered with rain and salt water, that we could scarcely see. Sleep, though we longed for it, afforded no comfort: for my own part, I almost lived without it: we suffered extreme cold, and every one dreaded the approach of night. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning we were overwhelmed with a deluge of rain. It fell so heavy that we were afraid it would fill the boat, and were obliged to bale with all our might. At dawn of day, I served a large allowance of rum. Towards noon the rain abated and the sun shone, but we were miserably cold and wet, the sea breaking so constantly over us, that, notwithstanding the heavy rain, we had not been able to add to our stock of fresh water. The usual allowance of one 25th of a pound of...", "...could see distinctly the flames around it, and in a very little while a bright blaze came up, as if some cars were suddenly struck by the fire, and there was a good deal of noise and firing. He said the Philadelphia troops were in there, and asked if I couldn't get down to relieve them. I then went back and asked about ammunition, and was told it was in the cellar--about twenty boxes of it--and that Colonel Stewart had engaged wagons to remove it, and I went down on a wharf about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to engage a boat to take the ammunition to Rochester. It was hard to find any person willing to take the ammunition or anything. Most all were with the strikers, except one boat, and the captain of that agreed to take it. We went back, and there was considerable delay about getting the ammunition. I went once or twice to the ordinary telegraph office to get word from the troops, but found I could get nothing, as the wires were in the hands of the strikers. OFFICE...", "...arms and was crooning softly, with unspeakable joy: \"Hark to him sing! Hark to him sing! A ringer for the chief!\" \"Why should we be in such a hurry?\" continued Donnegan. \"You see that clock in the corner? Tut, tut! Turn your head and look. Do you think I'll drop you while you look around?\" Landis flung one glance over his shoulder at the big clock, whose pendulum worked solemnly back and forth. \"In five minutes,\" said Donnegan, \"it will be eleven o'clock. And when it's eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the clock will chime. Now, Landis, you and I shall sit down here like gentlemen and drink our liquor and think our last thoughts. Heavens, man, is there anything more disagreeable than being hurried out of life? But when the clock chimes, we draw our guns and shoot each other through the heart--the brain--wherever we have chosen. But, Landis, if one of us should inadvertently--or through nervousness--beat the clock's chime by the split part of a second, the good people of The...", "...his sometime friend lay there helpless, unconscious, removed beyond his reach as completely as if he had been lying in his coffin. \"O God, it is hard to bear!\" he said half aloud: \"it is a bitter trial to bear. If this illness should end in death, I may never know Marian's fate.\" He sat in the sick man's room all through that long dismal afternoon, waiting to see the doctor, and with the same hopeless thoughts repeating themselves perpetually in his mind. It was nearly eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when Mr. Mew at last made his evening visit. He was a grave gray-haired little man, with a shrewd face and a pleasant manner; a man who inspired Gilbert with confidence, and whose presence was cheering in a sick-room; but he did not speak very hopefully of John Saltram. \"It is a bad case, sir--a very bad case,\" he said gravely, after he had made his careful examination of the patient's condition. \"There has been a violent cold caught, you see, through our poor friend's...", "...a holiday and rest--take my \"agreeable ugliness\" off (I was amused when the Heavenly Twins told me their mother talked of my \"agreeable ugliness\"; but, now, did I like it? No. I was cynical when I said it) take my \"agreeable ugliness\" off to the mountains--\"Turn thine eyes unto the mountains\"--the magnet of the mountains. Yes, I felt it. I delighted to do so. I was not morbid. To the mountains! to the cold which stays corruption, the snows which are pure, and the eternal silence! By ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night I was well on my way. CHAPTER XI I went abroad that year for my holiday, but spent the last week of it in London on my way home. All the vapours of sentimentality had disappeared by that time. My nerves had been braced in the Alps, my mind had been calmed and refreshed by the warm blue Mediterranean, my sense of comparison emphasized in Egypt, where I perceived anew the law of mutability, the inevitable law, by the decree of which the human race is...", "...breath away, what, to think that a shark like me can waste his time playing the Don Quixote? And you wonder what dirty motive I can have? Don't try to find out: it's beyond your powers of perception. Answer me, instead: do you accept?\" \"So you're serious?\" asked Daubrecq, who seemed but little disturbed by Lupin's contemptuous tone. \"Absolutely. The forty-five pieces are in a shed, of which I will give you the address, and they will be handed over to you, if you call there, at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this evening, with the child.\" There was no doubt about Daubrecq's reply. To him, the kidnapping of little Jacques had represented only a means of working upon Clarisse Mergy's feelings and perhaps also a warning for her to cease the contest upon which she had engaged. But the threat of a suicide must needs show Daubrecq that he was on the wrong track. That being so, why refuse the favourable bargain which Arsene Lupin was now offering him? \"I accept,\" he said. \"Here's...", "...he now perceived were only a blind, increased, and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance. 19.

At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the tennis balls began, according to Grimaud's directions, to take the direction of the moat, much to the joy of La Ramee, who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat; and very soon balls were wanting, so many had gone over. La Ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up, but the duke remarked that it would be losing time; and going near the rampart himself and looking over, he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by...", "...and not with me. Now, whether the step that Lady Level took had its rise in an innocent remark made by Mrs. Guy, or whether it was the result of her own indignant feeling, cannot be told. \"My dear,\" said the old lady, \"if my husband were ill, I should go to him all the more.\" And that was just what Blanche Level resolved to do. The previous arrangement had been that she should drive to my office, to save me time, pick me up, and so onwards to Victoria Station, to take the four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train, which would land us at Marshdale in an hour. \"My dear, I thought I understood that you were not going to Marshdale; that the telegram stopped you,\" said Mrs. Guy, hearing Blanche give orders for the carriage to be at the door at a quarter past three to convey her to Victoria, and perceiving also that she was making preparations for a journey. \"But I intend to go all the same,\" replied Blanche. \"And look here, dear Mrs. Guy, Charles has sent me word that he will call...", "...to eat, and my passage to Charleston, and you may do what you please with the vessel, but I shall deliver the papers to nobody but the persons who shipped me.

About twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a negro boy came to the vessel with a tin pan covered with a towel, and presenting it to Cesar, for \"massa cap'en and buckra boy.\" Cesar brought it aft and set it upon the companion. It contained some rice, a piece of bacon, corn-cake, and three sweet-potatoes. \"Coarse fare, but I can get along with it. Come Tommy, I guess you're hungry, as well as myself,\" said the captain, and they sat down, and soon demolished the feast of Southern hospitality. About five o'clock in the...", "...he had to spend it very quietly, delighted him. For ten days he seemed to be gaining, he read much, and dictated a good deal. On January 5th, he reviewed a book on pheasants and wrote also a little message to be read at the meeting of the American Defense Society, which he was unable to attend. That evening he spent with the family, going to bed at eleven o'clock. \"Put out the light, please,\" he said to his attendant, James Amos, and no one heard his voice again. A little after four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning, Amos, noticing that he breathed strangely, called the nurse, and when they reached his bedside, Roosevelt was dead. A blood clot in his heart had killed him. Death had unbound Prometheus. By noon on that day, the 6th of January, 1919, the whole world knew of his death, and as the news sank in, the sense of an unspeakable void was felt everywhere. He was buried on January 8th, on a knoll in the small country graveyard, which he and Mrs. Roosevelt had long...", "...with so much interest. And, as everybody endeavored to be better informed than his neighbor, quite a number of idle men had assumed the duty of watching Jacques's friends, and spent their days in trying to find out what was going on at M. de Chandore's house. Thus it came about, that, on the evening of Dionysia's visit to Jacques, the street was full of curious people. Towards half-past ten, they saw M. de Chandore's carriage come out of the courtyard, and draw up at the door. At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> M. de Chandore and Dr. Seignebos got in, the coachman whipped the horse, and they drove off. \"Where can they be going?\" asked they. They followed the carriage. The two gentlemen drove to the station. They had received a telegram, and were expecting the return of the marchioness and M.

Our friends marked the course of destruction by watching the thread of fire slowly wander down the mountain slope. They did not know of the desolation it...", "...left the Palace. He had spoken to a great number of acquaintances there. The next day he went with Mrs Montefiore to St James' Palace to attend the Queen's drawing-room. Mrs Montefiore was presented to Her Majesty by the Countess of Albemarle, and was most graciously received. \"I followed her,\" writes Mr Montefiore. \"The Queen smiled good-humouredly at me, and the Duchess of Kent said she was pleased to see us. No reception at a drawing-room could have been more flattering.\" At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he went to dine at the Merchant Taylors Hall. Mr Alliston, the Master, was most civil and kind to him, and to Mr George Carrol. It was a most splendid banquet, about one hundred and twenty sat down to table. The entertainment was given by the Merchant Taylors to the Skinners Company, in accordance with an old custom, which owed its origin to the following occurrence. A difference having arisen between the two companies, it was referred to the Lord Mayor, who decided that \"they...", "...was a dull thud, apparently from the prison, miles away, followed by a loud echo which seemed to come from close at hand, making him turn again as if to look for the spot from which it came, and seeing it too, for the report of the gun had as it were struck against the face of the tor above him, and then glanced off to strike elsewhere. \"How queer echoes are!\" he muttered. \"Yes, and how queer I feel--all hollow. That's made me think about it. I suppose that means twelve or one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> dinner-time. Oh, how stupid to go right away from uncle like this! I wish he'd come. But I won't go till I have made my fifty trout.\" Turning his attention now to the stream, he began whipping away again, and finding that the little trout were rising as well as ever, with the result that Rodney Harding once more forgot everything else in his pursuit and went on up-stream nearer and nearer to the great tor, till at last he found himself in a little hollow amongst the rocks...", "...Her sister shook her head. There was a note of utter discouragement and melancholy in her voice as she answered: \"He is seldom home--his club seems to have more attraction for him.

However, the meeting decided to send commissioners to the Hotel-de-Ville, for, whether they liked it or not, there was the power.

It held a third sitting at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to receive the commissioners. These were the deputies Clemenceau, Milliere, Tolain, Cournet, Malon, and Lockroy, the mayors Bonvalet and Mottu, the adjuncts Murat, Jaclard, and Leo Meillet.

This turned out to be the invariable daily programme, and Archie became...", "...and dug a tank, for the horses badly wanted water.

It was nearly two o'clock, and Mrs. Wilkinson, in the impotence of her prolonged and intense anxiety and fear, had thrown herself, with a groan, across her bed, when a sound in the street caught her ear. Instantly she started up, while a thrill ran through every nerve. Feet were on the...", "...\"you need n't think I sponge on Ewart to the extent of fourteen candles a night.\" I laughed a little under my breath. I knew a little friction would do him no harm. \"And when those fourteen candles burn to within two inches of the socket, as at present, it is my invariable custom, being a Scotsman, to call for the porridge--and for Cale, because he is of our tongue, and needs to discourse with his own, at least once, before going to bed.

Little Diamond sometimes woke in the middle of the night and felt his bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind. Then he could not help wondering if the wind should blow the house down and he should fall down into the manger, whether old Diamond might not eat him up before he knew him in his night gown. And though old Diamond was quiet all night long, yet when he woke up he got up like an earthquake. Then little Diamond knew what <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> it was, or at least what was to be done next, which was--to go to sleep again as fast as he could! Often there was hay at little Diamond's feet as he lay in bed, and hay at his head, piled up in great heaps to the very roof. Sometimes there was none at all. That was when they had used it all and had not yet bought more. Soon they bought more, and then it was only through a little lane with two or three turnings in it that he could reach his bed at all. Sometimes when his...", "...the great guns, which made a dreadful stunning noise, and frightened some of us, who did not care to pass before the cannon and be knocked down even by the wadding.

Cousin Magdalen ran joyously up-stairs to the nursery carrying a very funnily-shaped parcel in her hand. The children were all at tea. She heard their voices and the clatter and tinkle that always accompanies a nursery meal as she came along the passage, and she opened the door so softly that for a moment or two she stood watching the little party before any of them noticed her. How nice and pretty and happy they looked! Martin, a perfect...", "...and went through the office with great appearance of seriousness, but could not express himself; when this was done he called for the Earl of Albemarle and gave him a charge to take care of his papers. He thanked M. Auverquerque for his long and faithful services.

A faint...", "...the minimum requirements of the present day, are a huge development of the system which prevailed in my youth. Breakfast had already grown from the tea and coffee, and rolls and eggs, which Macaulay tells us were deemed sufficient at Holland House, to an affair of covered dishes. Luncheon-parties were sometimes given--terrible ceremonies which lasted from two to four; but the ordinary luncheon of the family was a snack from the servants' joint or the children's rice pudding; and five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> tea had only lately been invented. To remember, as I just can, the Foundress[20] of that divine refreshment seems like having known Stephenson or Jenner. Dinner was substantial enough in all conscience, and the wine nearly as heavy as the food. Imagine quenching one's thirst with sherry in the dog-days! Yet so we did, till about half-way through dinner, and then, on great occasions, a dark-coloured rill of champagne began to trickle into the V-shaped glasses.

It was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning as Jimmie Dale swung the car into a cross street off lower Broadway, and drew up at the curb beside a large office building. He got out, snuggled the cash box under his ulster, went around to the Broadway entrance, glanced up to note that a light burned in a fifth-story window, and entered the building. The hallway was practically in darkness, one or two incandescents only threw a dim light about.

Her associations with her husband's sister were wholly pleasant. For one thing, Alice Crofton was well off, and Enid instinctively respected, and felt interested in, any possessor of money.

My Father was away on a journey, and could not return as early as usual. It was about two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon; the sun was shining brightly, and all the world seemed gay. I was alone at the window, looking on to the kitchen garden, my mind full of cheerful thoughts, when I saw before me, in front of the wash-house, a man dressed exactly like Papa, of the same height and appearance, but more bent and aged.

Along the beach men were either bathing or basking mother-naked on the hot sand--enjoying themselves thoroughly.

I date the start of everything from that morning. About one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the preceding night Thumbwood had waked me from refreshing sleep. A wireless message, in code, had been received at Whitehall. It was addressed to me personally, and was from the Controller of the White Star Air Line at Plymouth.

It only said that a matter of the gravest importance...", "...when nearly all were beautiful or striking, and nearly all of the important folk in Tokio were present?

As Ivan pushed back his chair, the marquis said to him: \"Well, comrade, it is a good thing for the world at large that you only drink once a year and play cards once in three years, for if you did both every day there would be no more wine in Salista's cellar nor no gold left in Rothschild's bank.\" Ivan had, in truth, stripped the three gentlemen. \"Nevertheless, we must have a parting cup,\" continued Salista. \"Where is the...", "...\"I'll go with you.

The demonstration was a big one and reached such pitch that in the evening the police had to interfere. The Czechs sang their patriotic hymn with its additional anti-German verses and raised cheers for President Wilson and Professor Masaryk, the Bohemian delegate now in the United States. Although Wensel Square was thereafter barred to the demonstrators by the police, the demonstrations were repeated at 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, and not until midnight did the mounted and foot police succeed in restoring order. Another account gave other details: At the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Czech National Theatre speeches violently attacking Germany were delivered, and the renewal of the alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary was denounced. Several deputies addressed the crowd, urging resistance to the end and the sacrifice of wealth and...", "...About six in the evening, Rowland's wife pressed her to drink tea. She said, she had rather have a glass of water; for her tongue was ready to cleave to the roof of her mouth. The woman brought her a glass, and some bread and butter. She tried to taste the latter; but could not swallow it: but eagerly drank the water; lifting up her eyes in thankfulness for that!!! The divine Clarissa, Lovelace,--reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold water!--By whom reduced? About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she asked if any body were to be her bedfellow. Their maid, if she pleased; or, as she was so weak and ill, the girl should sit up with her, if she chose she should. She chose to be alone both night and day, she said.

Come back here to supper, if it is not too late.\" It was nearly nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when he began to ascend the vale towards Mistover; but the long days of summer being at their climax, the first obscurity of evening had only just begun to tan the landscape. At this point of his journey Christian heard voices, and found that they proceeded from a company of men and women who were traversing a hollow ahead of him, the tops only of their heads being visible. He paused and thought of the money he carried. It was almost too early even for Christian seriously to...", "...to the king. The family of the count were subsequently reinstated in all his property, fiefs, and rights, which, by virtue of the sentence, had escheated to the royal treasury. Meanwhile a scaffold had been erected in the marketplace, before the town hall, on which two poles were fixed with iron spikes, and the whole covered with black cloth. Two-and-twenty companies of the Spanish garrison surrounded the scaffold, a precaution which was by no means superfluous. Between ten and eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the Spanish guard appeared in the apartment of the count; they were provided with cords to tie his hands according to custom. He begged that this might be spared him, and declared that he was willing and ready to die. He himself cut off the collar from his doublet to facilitate the executioner's duty. He wore a robe of red damask, and over that a black Spanish cloak trimmed with gold lace. In this dress he appeared on the scaffold, and was attended by Don Julian Romero,...", "...from view across the divide when the savages began their attack. The captain of the cavalry, hearing the continuous firing, immediately returned with his command, and at once a fierce battle took place a short distance from the ranch. The troops retreated and went into camp at Valley Station. There were seven white persons living on the ranch at that time: Mr. Mark M. Coad, P. B. Danielson, his wife and two children, besides two hired men. They fought the Indians until five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon without any outside assistance, and had killed several. About noon the savages set fire to the haystack and stable, which caused a dense smoke to settle over the house in which the besieged were sheltered. As the fight progressed, the Indians seemed determined to have the building at any hazard; so they cut a large amount of wood and piled it against the back door, with the intention of burning it down so as to gain an entrance. The door was blockaded with...", "...of the Constitution, had been detained at Annapolis shipping a new crew until July 5th, the day when Broke's squadron left Halifax; then the ship got under way and stood down Chesapeake Bay on her voyage to New York.

On the twentieth of September, Mr. Knight and his friend Stoal, came to see how we were managing matters with Stoddard and Co.; and they tarried with us until the twenty-second. On the night of the twenty-first, I sat up very late, as my work rather pressed upon my hands. I did not retire until after twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night. About twelve o'clock, Joseph came to me, and asked me if I had a chest with a lock and key. I knew in an instant what he wanted it for, and not having one, I was greatly alarmed, as I thought it might be a matter of considerable moment. But Joseph, discovering my anxiety, said, \"Never mind, I can do very well for the present without it--be calm--all is right.\" Shortly after this, Joseph's wife passed through the room with her bonnet and riding dress; and in a few...", "...perspective, and machines for flying in the aire, and other wonderful motions; taken together it is one of the most magnificent and expensive diversions the wit of man can invent.

He listened in horror and amazement. Until this moment he had been ignorant of Phoebe's visit to Parksides on the previous night, and of her return to Camden Town at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning; and he instantly saw that his darling girl was in peril. The name of the paper from which Mr. Beeminster had read the account of the murder was being called in the street by a newspaper boy, and Fred darted out and purchased a copy. After perusing the report he remained quiet for a minute or two, with his head resting in his hand. \"We must be calm, Aunt Leth,\" he said. \"There is in this paper the first notes of a terrible accusation against our dear girl.

Of what happened before the blockade, I remember, too, that on the twenty-second of December, about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, the call was beat. Everybody supposed that it was for the drill, and I set out quietly, with my musket on my shoulder, as usual; but, as I reached the corner of the mayoralty, I saw the troops of the garrison formed under the trees of the square. They placed us with them in two ranks; and then Governor Moulin, Commandants Thomas and Pettigenet, and the mayor, with his tri-colored sash, arrived.

At once, after breakfast, she had closeted herself in her room, and there, her letters unfolded on her knees, she relished hastily her furtive joy. She was to drive at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the mall with her father, her husband, the Princess Seniavine; Madame Berthier-d'Eyzelles, the wife of the Deputy, and Madame Raymond, the wife of the Academician. She had two letters that day. The first one she read exhaled a tender aroma of love. Jacques had never displayed more simplicity, more happiness, and more charm.

Turning into Wellington street, he crossed Waterloo Bridge, and the gray dawn was breaking when he let himself into a big, dingy house not far from the river. Here, remote from his friends, he had chosen to live, in two rooms which he had fitted up more than comfortably with recent purchases. Even Jimmie did not know where he was--never dreamed of looking for him on the Surrey side. His brain was too active for sleep, and he sat up smoking another hour. It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon when Jack awoke from an unrefreshing slumber; his head was heavy, and he would have liked to remain in bed for the rest of the day. He remembered that he had two engagements; he had promised to attend a \"do\" at a studio in Joubert Mansions, Chelsea, where he would meet a lot of Tony Mostyn's set, and make night noisy until the wee hours of the morning. At four o'clock he started to dress for the evening. At five a cab put him down in Pall Mall, opposite the...", "...of the event, I fear I am not altogether clear.

The question then was, \"How are we to spend the day?\" This was speedily answered when the Indians reported that there were any number of sturgeon seen jumping in the shallows among the rocks not far out from the shore. The method of securing them was by spearing them from the canoes. A good deal of calculation was required in managing the canoes so that they would not be upset in the excitement of the sport, and then a great deal of strength had to be exerted...", "...to her full height and looked him straight in the eyes. \"You may go now,\" she said, her voice like ice. \"I shall never speak of this to anyone--provided you never attempt to repeat it.\" The man made no reply.

Then some one produced a fiddle, and they danced. Not only a few danced, but all danced--old and young; and those who stopped to rest patted time on their knees to encourage the others. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, or about \"two hour by sun in the evening,\" as the Wakulla people say, the last bushel of corn was ground. What remained uneaten of the dinner was distributed among those who needed it most, and the picnic was ended.

We decided to go in the early morning because there is a popular belief that the early morning is the right time for bass fishing. The bass is said to bite in the early morning. Perhaps it does. In fact the thing is almost capable of scientific proof. The bass does _not_ bite between eight and twelve. It does _not_ bite between twelve and six in the afternoon. Nor does it bite between six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and midnight. All these things are known facts. The inference is that the bass bites furiously at about daybreak. At any rate our party were unanimous about starting early. \"Better make an early start,\" said the Colonel, when the idea of the party was suggested. \"Oh, yes,\" said George Popley, the bank manager, \"we want to get right out on the shoal while the fish are biting.\" When he said this all our eyes glistened.

The curfew originated in the fear of fire when most cities were built of timber. That it was a most useful and practical measure is obvious when it is remembered that the household fire was usually made in a hole in the middle of the floor, under an opening in the roof through which the smoke escaped. The custom is commonly said to have been introduced into England by William the Conqueror, who ordained, under severe penalties, that at the ringing of the curfew-bell at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening all lights and fires should be extinguished. But as there is good reason to believe that the curfew-bell was rung each night at Carfax, Oxford (see Peshall, _Hist. of Oxford_), in the reign of Alfred the Great, it would seem that all William did was to enforce more strictly an existing regulation. The absolute prohibition of lights after the ringing of the curfew-bell was abolished by Henry I. in 1100.

The examination began; Greek and Latin classes were carefully questioned, and called on to parse and scan to a tiresome extent; then came mathematical demonstrations. Every conceivable variety of lines and angles adorned the blackboards; and next in succession were classes in rhetoric and natural history. There was a tediousness in the...", "...rather to one of the finest examples of Boer tenacity in the whole course of the war. The instant that Kekewich was sure of relief he mustered every available man and sent him out to endeavour to get the gun. It had already been removed, and its retreat was covered by the strong position of Dronfield, which was held both by riflemen and by light artillery. Finding himself unable to force it, Murray, the commander of the detachment, remained in front of it. Next morning (Friday) at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the weary men and horses of two of French's brigades were afoot with the same object. But still the Boers were obstinately holding on to Dronfield, and still their position was too strong to force, and too extended to get round with exhausted horses. It was not until the night after that the Boers abandoned their excellent rearguard action, leaving one light gun in the hands of the Cape Police, but having gained such a start for their heavy one that French, who had other and...", "...\"No; that's just what I don't want. This investigation must not attract attention. Your presence there would only advertise it. After we are through you can have all the data, and do as you wish,\" I insisted, having in mind to assume an attitude that would allow Hiram to work out his own salvation if possible. The only way is to expose a weak or yellow spot, so that he would see it for himself. Superintendent Kitchell again demonstrated that he was not an accident. Before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning he had accomplished almost the impossible. The wire that Hiram worked for a while was soon hot with sworn statements from every man who had anything to do with that car, from its loading until it landed on the wharf. It remained for Hiram, the Agent of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and the local packing-house agent to open the car. I glanced over the mass of stuff before handing it to Hiram. The shipping clerk of the packing-house swore that there was put in...", "...of commendation that set his hands to working the faster, and made the work seem easy. The work had gone on without interruption for weeks, and never slowly, but there were times when it went with a lilt and a laugh; when laborers heaved at a hoisting tackle with a Yo-ho, like privateersmen who have just sighted a sail; when, with all they could do, results came too slowly, and the hours flew too fast. And so it was that Christmas night; Charlie Bannon was back on the job. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he encountered Pete, bearing off to the shanty a quart bottle of cold coffee and a dozen big, thick sandwiches. \"Come on, Charlie,\" he called. \"Max is coming, too; but I guess we've got enough to spare you a little.\" So the three of them sat down to supper around the draughting-table, and between bites Bannon talked, a little about everything, but principally, and with much corroborative detail--for the story seemed to strain even Pete's easy credulity--of how, up at Yawger,...", "...the air?\" He drew aside a curtain and exposed a long corridor leading to the kitchen. Ganimard ran along it and tried the door of the servants' stairway. It was locked. From the window he called to one of his assistants: \"Seen anyone?\" \"No.\" \"Then they are still in the house!\" he exclaimed. \"They are hiding in one of the rooms! They cannot have escaped. Ah! Lupin, you fooled me before, but, this time, I get my revenge.\" * * * * * At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, Mon. Dudonis, chief of the detective service, astonished at not receiving any news, visited the rue Clapeyron. He questioned the detectives who were guarding the house, then ascended to Mon. Detinan's apartment. The lawyer led him into his room. There, Mon. Dudonis beheld a man, or rather two legs kicking in the air, while the body to which they belonged was hidden in the depths of the chimney. \"Ohe!... Ohe!\" gasped a stifled voice. And a more distant voice,...", "...their chief should be landed with certain ceremonies. I do not know. It is impossible to be sure as to the mysterious motives that actuate many of these remote African tribes. At any rate the result was that it gave us a great start and a chance of life, who must otherwise have died upon the spot. Outside the bay the breeze blew merrily, taking us across the lake at a spanking pace, until about midday when it began to fall. Fortunately, however, it did not altogether drop till three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by which time the coast of Mazitu-land was comparatively near; we could even distinguish a speck against the skyline which we knew was the Union Jack that Stephen had set upon the crest of a little hill. During those hours of peace we ate the food that remained to us, washed ourselves as thoroughly as we could and rested. Well was it, in view of what followed, that we had this time of repose. For just as the breeze was failing I looked aft and there, coming up behind us,...", "...her,\" I answered hotly. \"Now _I_ have heard some very different stories. And with all due respect to you, Mr. Ebbington----\" But fortunately at this juncture my presence of mind returned to me, and, a servant approaching to take our empty coffee cups, I was able to seize the opportunity and bring my riotous tongue to a halt. When the boy had gone, Alie turned the conversation into another channel, and after that all was plain sailing once more. To add to our enjoyment, about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> another servant came to inform Mr. Ebbington that a gentleman desired to see him in the smoking-room, and accordingly, bidding us good-night, he went off to interview him. Mrs. Beecher then made an excuse and retired to her room, leaving us alone together. \"Alie,\" I said reproachfully, \"if anything had happened just now you would have had only yourself to blame for it. That man's insolent lying was more than I could stand. In another moment, if that servant had not come in,...", "...get away, was buttoning his fur coat, and holding his hands to the fire for a last warm. They were very kind. They were not jocose with him, as is the horrible way of some elder persons with childhood's troubles. The old doctor who came daily put his hand on his shoulder and told him Mr. Goodwin had been very ill, but that he was going to get better, going to be quite well and strong again presently. John said nothing. He was convinced there was something in the background. \"Twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow, then,\" said the man who was in a hurry, and he took up his hat and went out. \"I have two boys about the same age as you,\" said the old doctor, patting John's shoulder. \"Tom and Edward. They are making a little model steam-engine. I expect you are fond of engines, aren't you?\" \"Not just now, thank you,\" said John. \"I am sometimes.\" \"I wish you would come and see it to-morrow,\" continued the doctor. \"They would like to show it you, I know.

It would make me more comfortable; I should enjoy it more.\" \"Well, I propose a slightly different plan,\" she said. \"I promise you that I will go and get it for you myself at twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-night if you still really want it. Hold on for six hours--five hours--and then, if you ask me, I will take down the forged prescription myself. Only in the interval you must do your best--your best, mind, not to think about it. And you must go to bed at eleven.

As the error of the clock is determined twice a day, shortly before ten o'clock in the morning, and shortly before one o'clock in the afternoon, its error is always small, usually only one or two tenths. These two times are chosen because, though time-signals are sent over the metropolitan area every hour from the Greenwich clock through the medium of the Post Office, at ten and at one o'clock signals are also sent to all the great provincial centres. Further, at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the time balls at Greenwich and at Deal are dropped, so that the captains of ships in the docks, on the river, or in the Downs may check their chronometers. The Time-Ball is dropped directly by the mean solar clock itself. It is raised by means of a windlass turned by hand-power to the top of its mast just before one o'clock. Connected with it is a piston working in a stout cylinder. When the ball has reached the top of the mast, the piston is lightly supported by a pair of...", "...invited to the dance--an almost unheard of privilege. Sue had been thus favored because her brother Billy was to be Annabel's guest, and Blue Bonnet, because Annabel had begged Miss North, almost on her hands and knees to grant her this one last request. It was a long established custom for the young men to arrive at noon, pay their respects to teachers and the girls who had invited them and remain on for a concert, tea, or whatever had been planned for their entertainment. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they left to dress for the dinner which preceded the dance. Annabel lost no time with her toilet. In ten minutes she was dressed, with Blue Bonnet's help, and as sweet a vision as youth, good health and beauty could produce. Blue Bonnet stood before her enraptured. \"Your gown is perfect, Annabel,\" she said, giving an extra pat here and there, or trying to, between Annabel's quick movements. \"I doubt if you'll look a speck prettier to-night in your white lace.

Not discouraged by all these difficulties, Mr. Field went to work with a will, organized a new company, and made a new cable far superior to anything before used, and on July 13, 1866, was begun the trial which ended with the following message sent to New York:-- \"HEART'S CONTENT, July 27. \"We arrived here at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning.

I fell back. \"Do as you will,\" said I. \"Our lives are in your hands.\" Barraclough shouted the answer dictated to him, and there came a sound of angry voices from the other side of the door. An axe descended on it, and it shivered. \"Stand by there,\" said Barraclough sharply, and Lane closed up. Outside, the noise continued, but no further blow was struck, and at last Holgate's voice was raised again: \"We will give you till eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this evening, captain, and good-day to you. If you part with the goods then, I'll keep my promise and put you ashore in the morning. If not----\" He went off without finishing his sentence. \"He will not keep his promise, oh, he won't!\" said a tense voice in my ear; and, turning, I beheld the Princess. \"That is not the trouble,\" said I, as low as she. \"It is that we have not the treasure, and we are supposed to be in possession of it.\" \"Who has it?\" she asked quickly....", "...one sole pen I wrote this book, Made of a gray goose quill; A pen it was when I it took, A pen I leave it still.\" Bells as Time-Tellers. The ringing of the bell in bygone times was general as a signal to commence and to close the daily round of labour. In some of the more remote towns and villages of old England the custom lingers at the ingathering of the harvest. At Driffield, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, for example, the harvest bell is still rung at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning to arouse the labourers from their slumbers, and at seven in the evening the welcome sound of the bell intimates the time for closing work for the day. References to this subject may sometimes be found in parish accounts and other old church documents. In the parish chest of Barrow-on-Humber, Lincolnshire, is preserved a copy of the \"Office and Duty of the Parish Clerk,\" bearing date of 1713, stating:-- \"Item.--He is to ring a Bell Every working day...", "...effected, and the works were scarcely injured. But the council of war assembled on this occasion, declared for an assault, citing the example of Maestricht, which had been taken early in the morning, while the citizens and soldiers were reposing themselves. The attack was to be made simultaneously on four points; the night betwixt the 9th and 10th of May, was employed in the necessary preparations. Every thing was ready and awaiting the signal, which was to be given by cannon at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The signal, however, was not given for two hours later, during which Tilly, who was still doubtful of success, again consulted the council of war. Pappenheim was ordered to attack the works of the new town, where the attempt was favoured by a sloping rampart, and a dry ditch of moderate depth. The citizens and soldiers had mostly left the walls, and the few who remained were overcome with sleep. This general, therefore, found little difficulty in mounting the...", "...could you do otherwise? There are a hundred and eighteen bad hotels, and only one good one. The most renowned and popular hotel of them all is perhaps the worst one known to history. It is winter, and night. When you arrived, it was snowing. When you reached the hotel, it was sleeting. When you went to bed, it was raining. During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys down. When you got up in the morning, it was foggy.

I wonder--\" He looked about him curiously. Although it was only eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the place appeared to be empty. Yet Howland was reasonably assured that it was not empty. He was conscious of sensing in a vague sort of way the presence of others somewhere near him. He was sure that there was a faint, acrid odor lurking above that of burned incense, and he shrugged his shoulders with conviction when he paid a dollar for his pot of tea. \"Opium, as sure as your name is Jack Howland,\" he said, when the waiter was gone. \"I wonder again--how many pots of tea do...", "...something in it, as they had been so very imprudent. They could not at all understand at the Kallems what was the matter with Karl, all of a sudden. He had hardly been in to them the last few days, was seldom at home, and had become every bit as silent, shy, and gloomy as when he first came. The probability was that he was in despair at the prospect of parting from them, and especially from Ragni; but it was strange that this despair should have begun exactly between three and five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Wednesday afternoon. At three o'clock they had played duets together and had been in the best of spirits; at five o'clock she had fixed to go through some of the last remaining work for his examination with him, but he came home so hopelessly absent and inattentive, that they were obliged to give it up.

In this dashing advance over 1,500 Germans were captured. The Australians went over the top about 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The British artillery in this region was very strong and quite smothered the Germans' guns, which were late in getting under way. The Germans had four divisions on this front holding the ground south of Vaux-sur-Somme, garrisoning the village of Hamel and Vaire Wood and the trench system on the other side of Hamel.

Besides the water-clock, Isaac made a sundial. Thus his grandmother was never at a loss to know the hour; for the water-clock would tell it in the shade, and the dial in the sunshine.

At about one o'clock in the morning we met the rest of the troops at the Arroyo of San Benito. All well. _5th day._ We continued our march to the place mentioned [Ansaimas], where we met citizens Cornelio Lucas Altimirano, Manuel Pinto, and Quintin Ortega, all with weapons and horses. Here I remained the rest of the day waiting for the equipage of the Father, which had not yet arrived. _6th day._ We left this place at about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, taking an easterly direction, and at about seven o'clock in the evening we arrived at the place called San Luis Gonzaga, which is situated at the foot of the Sierra on the border of the Tulare Valley.

At twelve o'clock midnight we reached the Tulares at the arroyo...", "...Ned. He would have liked to see Lancashire again, particularly Rochdale, his own town. He wanted to walk its hilly streets, and to see the Asbestos Factory again, and Hollingworth Lake. He would almost rather be found dead there than continue to live among these indigo mountains and pink hotels and chrome-yellow sands. And so he set about his exploit. At the very outset they tried once more to baulk him. For the thing that he intended to do certain timbers were necessary, and at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> one night he passed, none too steadily, to a timber-merchant's, and gave an order to a clerk. The clerk smiled, and sent for his principal. Kerr pointed to various pieces in the yard. \"Ye can send that--an' that--an' that t'other,\" he said thickly; \"ye can get 'em out now--I'll fetch a cart.\" Then, looking at the builder's face, he saw that he too, like the clerk, was smiling....

Lacey talked all the time--his views, his regiment, sports, races, what not. From the top of my mind--the surface responsive to externals--I answered. Within I was following in imagination the struggle of my dear, wayward, unreasonable mistress--of her who wanted both ways, who would lead half a dozen lives, and unite under her sway kingdoms between which there could be neither union nor alliance. It was almost five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by the time Fillingford came out; the sun had begun to lose power; the peace of evening--and something of its chill--rested on the billowing curves of turf and the gently swaying treetops. As we saw him we came to a standstill, and so awaited his approach. Under no circumstances, I imagine, could Lord Fillingford have looked radiant. Even any overt appearance of triumph his taste, no less than his nature, would have rejected; and his taste was infallible in negatives. Yet on...", "...for me. You know I want to. My luck's got to change some time.\" \"Sure thing it has,\" agreed another of the men. \"You certainly have been playing in rotten luck, but when it does change--oh, baby!\" As the five men entered one of the cardrooms several of the inevitable spectators drew away from the other games and approached their table, for it was a matter of club gossip that these five played for the largest stakes of any coterie among the habitues of the card-room. It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning before Bince disgustedly threw his cards upon the table and rose. There was a nasty expression on his face and in his mind a thing which he did not dare voice--the final crystallization of a suspicion that he had long harbored, that his companions had been for months deliberately fleecing him. Tonight he had lost five thousand dollars, nor was there a man at the table who did not hold his I. O.

Mrs. Horton, indeed, retired to her chamber at two, and left the gentlemen to a more serious discourse; but a discourse still less advantageous to poor Miss Milner. She, during this time, was at the scene of pleasure she had painted to herself, and all the pleasure it gave her was, that she was sure she should never desire to go to a masquerade again.

I--who am the cause of the spoliation of this family!\" \"You, brother?\" exclaimed Agricola. \"Did they not wish to rob you also?\" added Dagobert. \"The will,\" cried Gabriel, with increasing agony, \"gave the property to those of the heirs that should appear before noon.\" \"Well?\" said Dagobert, alarmed at the emotion of the young priest. \"Twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> has struck,\" resumed the latter. \"Of all the family, I alone was present.

From her face his eyes wandered greedily down to her snow-white neck, her slender, graceful figure, her beautifully molded arms. Certainly, he mused to himself, his brother was an epicure in love. This woman was dainty enough to tempt a saint. \"How did it happen?\" she asked again. \"It was in the first rush from the burning ship,\" he said hoarsely. \"I was asleep when the fire broke out. It happened at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The diamonds were in the belt which each night I unfastened and put under my pillow. It was more comfortable to do that than to wear it. When the first alarm came I forgot everything--except my own safety. I rushed pell-mell on deck. It was a nasty night. We didn't know where we were, or how grave the situation was. Outside the wind was howling furiously, the siren was blowing dismally, the panic-stricken passengers and sailors were fighting like...", "...my camp on the prairie about nine miles from the city, where there were almost four hundred hired men. In March the cholera made its appearance, and in a malignant form. Some cases occurred in camp, and, as I could not get a physician to go out there, I wrote for Dr. Baker, of Austin, an elderly man, to come over and take charge of it. On his arrival I furnished him with a mule, and gave him directions to find the camp. Night came on, and no doctor returned. The next morning about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he rode up to my office with his umbrella under his arm, his mouth drawn up, the picture of despair. I asked him: \"Are many sick in camp?\" He shook his head in the negative. He was invited to dismount and come into the office, which he did, and told his grievance. It appears that he found camp, attended to the few sick, and started to return to the city. When he reached the Salado, a small stream a few miles from town that was about ten feet wide, his mule declined to cross the...", "...\"There's no doubt whatever that Oliver fell from the parapet,\" said Copplestone. \"The marks of a fall are there--quite unmistakably.\" Greyle nodded, but made no remark, and the two made their way through the still eager crowd and went down to the village post-office. Both were wondering, as they went, about the same thing--the evident anxiety and mental uneasiness of Marston Greyle. CHAPTER XII GOOD MEN AND TRUE Copplestone saw little of his bed that night. At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening came a telegram from Sir Cresswell Oliver, saying that he and Petherton were leaving at once, would reach Norcaster soon after midnight, and would motor out to Scarhaven immediately on arrival. Copplestone made all arrangements for their reception, and after snatching a couple of hours' sleep was up to receive them. By two o'clock in the morning Sir Cresswell and the old solicitor and Gilling--smuggled into their sitting-room--had heard all he had to tell about...", "...his affairs when I had last visited him, I entertained rather gloomy ideas with respect to his present circumstances. I imagined that I should either find him alone in his kitchen smoking a wretched pipe, or in company with some surly bailiff or his follower, whom his friend the brewer had sent into the house in order to take possession of his effects. Nothing more entirely differing from either of these anticipations could have presented itself to my view than what I saw about one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, when I entered the house. I had come, though somewhat in want of consolation myself, to offer any consolation which was at my command to my acquaintance Catchpole, and perhaps, like many other people who go to a house with 'drops of compassion trembling on their eyelids,' I felt rather disappointed at finding that no compassion was necessary. The house was thronged with company, the cries for ale and porter, hot brandy and water, cold gin and water, were...", "...while Fix was with him. It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts. Was this conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England? Perhaps Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified, but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as possible. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the sledge was ready to start. The passengers took their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their traveling-cloaks. The two great sails were hoisted, and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour. The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at most two hundred miles. If the wind held good, the distance might be covered in five hours. If no accident happened the sledge...", "...and all of my own contrivance. The villains have fled, the neighbours will flock to the spot, and you will obtain assistance.' By this time we heard the people of the carriage running towards us. 'Stuart!' cried I, in an awful voice. 'My name indeed!' said he. 'This is completely inexplicable.' 'Stuart,' cried I, 'hear my parting words. _Never again_', (quoting his own letter,) '_will I make you my playmate; never again climb your shoulders, and gallop you round the lawn!_ Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> is past. Go not to Sylvan Lodge to-night. She departed two hours ago. Look to your steps.' I spoke this portentous warning, and fled across the common. Miss Wilkinson! Miss Wilkinson! sounded on the blast; but the wretch had discovered me too late. I ran about half a mile, and then looking behind me, beheld the ruin in a blaze. Renovated by the sight of this horror, I walked another hour, without once stopping; till, to my surprise and dismay, I found myself utterly unable...", "...and it was dark and cold. I had been exercising for twelve hours without rest, and had eaten nothing since the previous day, as I never take breakfast. I made a fire and lay down on a rock by it to relax, and also to dry my clothes. In half an hour I started on again. Rocky and forest-covered ridges lay between me and Grand Lake. In the darkness I certainly took the worst way. I met with too much resistance in the thickets and too little on the slippery places, so that when, at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night, I entered a Grand Lake Hotel, my appearance was not prepossessing. The next day, after a few snow-measurements, I set off to re-cross the range. In order to avoid warm bear-dens and cold streams, I took a different route. It was a much longer way than the one I had come by, so I went to a hunter's deserted cabin for the night. The cabin had no door, and I could see the stars through the roof. The old sheet-iron stove was badly rusted and broken. Most of the night...", "...provided for you if you were elected King, wouldn't they?\" asked Boy. \"I'm sure I don't know. I wish I hadn't gone in for it at all,\" replied the man; \"I'm a shoemaker by trade, and my wife she said to me, 'What a fine thing it would be if you were elected King!' so I voted for myself. I am rather sorry I did so now, because I don't know anything about reigning, and I'm afraid I sha'n't make a very good King if I am elected.\" Before Boy could reply there was a great shout, and two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> struck from the clock tower above the House of Words. \"Now we shall soon know,\" said Boy; and sure enough in a few moments the Lord High Adjudicator came to the top of the steps, and with a very white face announced that everybody had the same number of votes, so that they were _all_ elected Kings; and it turned out afterwards that everybody but Boy and Caesar Maximilian Augustus Claudius Smith (called Thomas for short) had voted for themselves, and as those two had voted...", "...had accompanied the fugitive. The prospect of a long journey would appal them. And Stonor was pretty sure that Mary was not over-working herself at the paddle, so that it was not too much to hope that he was catching up on them at this rate. Thinking of their outfit, Stonor wondered how Imbrie would feed Clare; the ordinary fare of the Kakisas would be a cruel hardship on her. Such are the things one worries about in the face of much more dreadful dangers. It had been nearly six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before Stonor left Myengeen's village, and the sun went down while he was still far from the head of the lake. He surveyed the flat shores somewhat anxiously. Nowhere, as far as he could see, was there any promising landing-place. In the end he decided to sail on through the night. As darkness gathered he took his bearings from the stars. With the going-down of the sun the wind moderated, but it still held fair and strong enough to give him good steerage-way. After an hour or...", "...be the prize. The grand stand was to be saved for adults and girls, and Mick was to be in the _Pumpkin Seed_ at the turn. He knows a good deal about races, as his brother owns a trotter. Mr. May was to keep the time, as he had some kind of a thermometer watch. Such a dinner as Mrs. May gave us! I had Sam's and Nate's pieces of lemon pie, as they couldn't eat anything but meat. Mr. May looked over his spectacles, and asked if I was the boy who was to row a race that afternoon. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> boys began coming, and took seats on the stand. Mick had to tell them about the girls and adults. Those mean Wilson boys had built a stand in the night, and let the crowd in for five cents! So both banks were full. They are the meanest family in America. They promised to keep every one out of their field. We were mad enough, but we couldn't do anything then. Sam and Nate were in the _Arrow_ when we got to the river, and they cheered us as we got into our boat, and Polly...", "...put off going to bed as a final necessity--allowed me to go up stairs, I found inside my dressing-case a folded paper on which these lines were written: \"The prettiest hour of the day at The Headlands is at seven o'clock in the morning, down among the rocks.\" I should have felt no doubt whose hand had put the notelet there even if it had failed to breathe the perfume of violets, which no one who knew Georgy Lenox could hesitate to recognize. CHAPTER XVI. It was full two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before I began to think of sleeping, but nevertheless I was on the rocks next morning at seven; and my punctuality was rewarded by the sight of Miss Lenox walking on the shore in a white dress. I clambered down and joined her before she seemed aware of my presence: then she turned and laughed softly in my face. \"What an early riser you are!\" she exclaimed. \"You have brought excellent habits home from the lazy Old World.\" \"But it would be such a pity to miss 'the prettiest...", "...of the child. If I lost that little one, Kitty, it would be like losing the half of you.\" \"Losing, indeed!\" said Nancy. \"Who's talking about losing?

The murmur of their voices could be heard by the hidden preventive men across the stream, and Mr. Polwhele chuckled at the thought of the fine haul he was about to make. The excisemen with him were old hands, and knew how to keep silence, and the dragoons, although they hated this revenue work, were too well disciplined to hazard the failure of the ambuscade. Their horses had been left tethered half a mile away. The minutes passed; five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> came, and both parties were on the alert for any sound from seaward. The wind blew from the north-east, so that it was not at all surprising that the lugger should be late. But when six o'clock came they began to be restless. It was tiring and comfortless, waiting in the misty gloom of a raw December morning. The sky was pitch dark. Neither party could see the other. The murmurs of the tub-carriers became louder, and the dragoons muttered and grumbled under their breath....", "...and some oil and soap. To this list of imports must be added the inevitable Chinese fire-crackers, without which noisy accessories no Paraguayan holiday would be complete. Throughout South America a passion for fire-crackers and fireworks prevails; and as an example of this mania, M. Forgues relates that when the Argentine troops were on their return to Buenos Ayres after the close of the war, great preparations were made by the authorities to greet them on their arrival at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon with a great display of fireworks. There was a delay in the coming of the troops, however, and so, to satisfy the people, the fireworks were let off a half hour after the appointed time, although the soldiers had not yet made their appearance. Still the troops delayed, and the populace, satiated with pageantry, retired to their homes and to bed. About eleven o'clock at night a tumult of trumpets, cymbals and drums was heard in the dark and deserted streets: it...", "...and Her Highness could open the vault.--I have no doubt the valet had discovered the combination.\" \"But the box,\" Dehra objected; \"it was locked when I got it, and Adolph could not have had the key.\" \"He might have had a duplicate.\" \"I think not,\" said Armand; \"it is a trick lock with a most complicated arrangement, and to make a duplicate would have required the original key.\" \"Well, however that may be is not essential,\" said Courtney; \"the fact remains that, between eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> of one night and ten o'clock of the second day thereafter, the Book disappeared; and the last time it was seen, to our knowledge, it was lying under the King's own hand, on the table in his library, with the open box beside it; and that the latter was found, closed and locked and empty, in its place in the vault, while the most thorough search for the Book has been ineffectual except, it seems, to prove that it is not in the Palace. We can safely assume that His Majesty did not...", "...graceful pleader, meriting judicial honors, or something of that sort. I had forgotten its exact words, but I did not wish to hear Potts read them. So I fled to spend the remainder of that eventful day quietly among rosebushes and tender, budding hyacinths, unspotted of the world, receiving, however, occasional bulletins of the orgy from passers-by. From these and sundry narratives gleaned the following day, I was able to trace the later hours of this scandalous saturnalia. By six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Potts had spent all his money. By six-fifteen this fact could no longer be concealed, and such of his following as had not already fallen by the wayside crept, one by one, to rest. They left the Colonel dreamily, murmurously happy in a chair at the end of the City Hotel bar. Here, he was discovered about six-thirty by Eustace Eubanks, who had incautiously thought to rebuke him. \"For shame, Colonel Potts!\" began Eustace, seeking to fix the uncertain eyes with his finger of...", "...they arrived at a point near the house. \"Here we are,\" Jet said, as he halted and listened for some sound which would give him an inkling of the position of affairs. \"Where is the building?\" \"About a hundred yards in that direction,\" and Jet pointed toward the east. \"Are you certain Harvey and his men are there?\" \"I know the men are inside, if they obeyed orders; but I'm afraid the villains have got Mr. Harvey. Say, we must have walked mighty quick, if it was past three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when you wakened me, for it isn't daylight yet.\" \"I said you was rushing too fast. Now, how are we to get inside?\" \"Go over the wood-pile on this side.\" \"They'll shoot, not knowing who we are.\" \"Whistle twice while you are in the woods, and wait for an answer before coming out of cover. That was the signal agreed upon.\" \"Then, you young cub, I reckon we are through with you,\" and as the man spoke, he clasped Jet tightly around the waist, while his companion...", "...passed through our camp. August 1st. Up to the trenches. Shrapnel flying like flies. A heavy bombardment; bombardment of Hooge.

The English are concentrating 50,000 Indians on our front to attack Hooge and Hill 60. Just let them come, we shall stand firm. At three marched off to the front. Watch beginning again. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> marched off to the Witches' Cauldron, Hooge. A terrible night again. H.E. and shrapnel without number. Oh, thrice-cursed Hooge! In one hour eleven killed and twenty-three wounded and the fire unceasing. It is enough to drive one mad, and we have to spend three days and three nights more. It is worse than an earthquake, and any one who has not experienced it can have no idea what it is like. The English fired a mine, a hole fifteen metres deep and fifty to sixty broad, and this...", "...not have coffee in the library. But now about telephoning.

She would ring him up, tell him she was there, and ask--she clung particularly to the doctor idea, because his presence would justify hers if the doctor hadn't better look in in the morning. Thus it was that, sitting quiet in their basement, the Twites were startled about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that evening by the telephone bell. It sounded more uncanny than ever up there, making all that noise by itself in the dark; and when, hurrying up anxiously to it, Twite applied his ear, all that happened was that an extremely short-tempered voice told him to hold on. Twite held on, listening hard and hearing nothing. 'Say 'Ullo, Twite,' presently advised Mrs. Twite from out of the anxious silence at the foot of the kitchen stairs. ''Ullo,' said Twite half-heartedly....", "...It must not be thought an easy matter to reign a queen over fickle Paris. Does any one suppose that fortunes alone are risked in the great game? The winters are to fashionable women what a campaign once was to the soldiers of the Empire. What works of art and genius are expended on a gown or a garland in which to make a sensation! A fragile, delicate creature will wear her stiff and brilliant harness of flowers and diamonds, silk and steel, from nine at night till two and often three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning.

Although this last was very high I could see nothing but a succession of high ranges of bluffs as far as I could see, except the narrow space through which the river winds its course....", "...Mary paid dear for her procrastination. Paula sent her into town one day with a long list of errands, a transparently factitious list, which, taken in connection with an unusual interest she displayed in the item of lunch, made it more than sufficiently plain to Mary that for the day she wasn't wanted at Ravinia. She concealed, successfully she thought, the shock she felt at these new tactics of Paula's, studied the list and said she thought she should be able to return on the three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train. She made a point however of not coming back until the four-fifteen. It was nearly six before she got back to the cottage, but the contented lazy tone in which Paula from up-stairs answered her hail, made it plain that her tardiness had not been remarked. However Paula had spent her day, the upshot of it was satisfactory. \"Shall I come up?\" Mary asked. \"Come along,\" Paula answered. \"I'm not asleep or anything and besides I want to talk to you.\" \"I think I got...", "...was still a little afraid of her complicated relative. She begged her not to read too late, and went out, promising to conciliate the offended Mrs. Hofer. As she walked down the hall she stooped absently and picked up a scrap of paper, hardly aware that she held it in her hand until she sat down once more before her mirror. Then she glanced at it. To her surprise it was an advertisement of a prize-fight, cut from a newspaper; and on the margin an illiterate hand had scrawled, \"_Nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> sharp._\" She wondered which of the servants was indulging in the distractions of the ring. All except Lady Victoria's maid were Japs. Could the Frenchwoman have found a lover who had introduced her to the forbidden pleasures of the town?

That's why the chalet's here.\" The two men were so tired that Joe's party offered to share dinner with them, relieving them of the task of cooking, since the regular cook employed by the chalet had deserted the day before and all guests now had to shift for themselves. It was quite a party that sat down to table, with Val as waiter and Joe turning the omelettes and tossing the griddle cakes on the stove.

In a short time we came to a house, where George was well acquainted; here we were made welcome and kindly entertained. We laid down to rest about 2 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, after having traveled one hundred and ten miles in two days and two nights. After breakfast, I set out for Far West, leaving George sick with our hospitable friend.

In this manner they travelled, until they arrived at Fairport* about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the following day. * [The \"Fairport\" of this novel is supposed to refer to the town of * Arbroath, in Forfarshire, and \"Musselcrag,\" post, to the fishing village of * Auchmithie, in the same county.] Lovel probably expected that his travelling companion would have invited him to dinner on his arrival; but his consciousness of a want of ready preparation for unexpected guests, and perhaps some other reasons, prevented Oldbuck from paying him that attention.

It is about half-past seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening. The rain, which kept at it pitilessly all the afternoon, has cleared off, and we have left the little whitewashed inn at Glen-Columcille refreshed, and in high fettle, for the further six miles that has to be done before we reach Carrick, where we mean to spend the night. We had arrived at Glen two hours before in a weary enough condition physically after our tramp over the hills from Ardara, and we had almost resolved on the advice of the hostess of the inn--a...", "...that certain papers have been stolen, and that one of the culprits has fled, whilst the other has committed suicide. Who shall say that Mr. Maxwell has fled? Certainly he has departed suddenly for Paris. Unfortunately, Captain Lancing has committed suicide. At the same time, it is a notorious fact that he has had heavy losses at cards and on the turf, which may account for everything. And as to those papers alleged to be stolen, why, Lord Merehaven had them in his own hands at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-night.\" \"An excellent piece of political logic,\" said Lord Merehaven. \"I could not have given a better explanation from my place in the House. But I fear that if I were pressed to say that I had taken steps to discover if those papers were intact----.

The thing has been arranged for some time; the house where the papers were to be handed over to the arch thief was...", "...entrenched on the slopes of Kenesaw Mountain. This was precisely what the Confederate commander was hoping for. The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June. In the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening of a bloody day's struggle. It was soon answered by the Confederate batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the Union infantry advance began. On the left was McPherson, who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly against the mountain. The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front of Logan cut down his men by hundreds. The Federals charged courageously and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges. The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under Thomas. Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of...", "...to the crest of the ridge. Across this a net is stretched, and the bats, flying in swarms by night to clear the top, drop into the cut on reaching it, and so are caught in the net in flying across. We saw several such bat-traps during our trip. In this way these highlanders eke out their meager supply of meat. The bat in question is not the animal we are familiar with, but the immensely larger fruit bat, the flesh of which is readily eaten. Our trail took us up, and sharply; by nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we had crowned the pass, and stopped for chow and rest. In front of us, as we looked back, plunged the deepest, sharpest valley yet seen, around the head of which we had ridden and across which we could look down on the Ifugao country we had just come from; down one side and up the other could be traced the remains of the old Spanish trail, a miracle of stupidity.

Knowing that nothing could be gained by discussing the matter, which had been talked over a score of times previously, Andy changed the subject. Business had opened very well, and he wished to go out and have some circulars printed, by which even a larger crowd might be attracted to the sale. It remained clear for two days, and during that time both of the young auctioneers were kept busy from eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning until eleven at night.

If he procured what he wished, Matt was to buy...", "...were introduced to the stranger.

By two other mutes, who, from their visages, seemed suffering under the pressure of some strange calamity, he was ushered into the...", "...How often should one water? Often enough to keep the ground _moist all the time_, night and day. There is nothing mechanical in taking care of a young plant any more than in the care of a baby. Simply give it what it needs until it is able to take care of itself. The plant may require a little watching and attention for a few days in warm weather.

At 12.30 Boyle showed his colours and fired a gun, but the other made no sign, continuing her efforts to escape, and losing her foretopmast through the press of sail she carried. The _Chasseur_ now came up rapidly, and at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the chase fired a gun and hoisted English colours. Watching her narrowly, Boyle made out only three gun-ports on one side, and there appeared to be very few people on deck. So he cracked on his canvas, anxious to get alongside and make short work of her; and, not anticipating serious fighting, made no great preparations for action.

CHAPTER V THE ENCHANTED ISLAND The striking of seven by the most sonorous and musical of clocks ever heard reminded Roland of the dinner-hour. At seven most of us are preparing for this function, which civilisation has converted almost into an act of praise and worship. Some men, he remembered, were now walking in the direction of the club: some were dressing: some were making for restaurants: some had already begun. One naturally associates seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> with the anticipation of dinner. There are men, it is true, who habitually take in food at midday and call it dinner: there are also those who have no dinner at all. He began to realise that he was not, this evening, going to have any dinner at all. For he was now at the farmhouse, sitting in the square window with Armorel: he had gone back to Tregarthen's and returned with his portmanteau and his painting gear: fortunately he had also taken an abundant lunch at that...", "...been out before.'

On the parchment was written: 'Kingdom of Plurimiregia. Billy King, Respectable Monarch. Not been out before.' 'You'd better go by post,' said the pig. 'The five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> post will do.' 'But why--but how--where is it?' asked Billy. 'I don't know where it is,' said the pig, 'but the Post-Office knows everything.

There we paused some time to receive our ladders, and advanced at sunrise to the assault.

Fort Wessells was furiously stormed three separate times, by a very superior force with great loss of life. The third time it had to succumb, and sixty men were captured. The fort was well supplied with hand grenades, which were used with great effectiveness. It was during this night that the famous ram, \"Albemarle,\" came down the...", "...my impatience grew to get away and visit Emigre's Retreat and Madame Saugrain, and--the Rose of St. Louis.

LOUIS \"What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet.\" But my impatience was of little avail, for before we left Government House Dr. Saugrain invited me to dinner at Emigre's Retreat, and restless and impatient as I might be, I did not dare show myself there until the dinner-hour. Five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> found me sitting in the dear old living-room, awaiting, with trembling the entrance of madame and Pelagie. It was the same dear old room I had pictured to myself so often, and all the grand salons of Paris that I had seen since last I saw it did not make it look any the less cozy and homelike to my eyes. It was a warm spring afternoon, and the western windows were open, and the white curtains were stirring in the breeze, only there was no maiden in white on the low seat by the...", "...in _his_ room. But I've got the apartment, and if it hadn't been for the mistake, I should have been homeless and houseless, and a wanderer on the face of the sand at Bournemouth. Must write to that best of all doctors, MCSIMMUM, and thank him for not coming to-night. As it is I spend a delightful evening with the Members of the B.M.A. here assembled, in the smoking-room. The conversation is chiefly about the use of alcohol and tobacco as poisons. The decision arrived at towards one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> A.M., or, more correctly speaking, the Inn-decision, is that, on this particular occasion, one glass more of something or other, and just one last pipe or cigar, cannot possibly hurt anybody. This is carried _nem. con._: and so, subsequently, we adjourn, not carried but walking, soberly and honestly, to bed. Next morning up with the lark, indeed a trifle earlier, and after examining Bournemouth and finding excellent residences up above in beautiful air where it must always be...", "...to-night! I wanted that myself.\" \"I am not at all sure that my performance will be one of glory,\" smiled Darrin. \"It won't, if Cantor can manage to queer you in any way,\" murmured Denton to himself, as he moved on. In the ward-room that evening the \"impertinence\" of two new ensigns in capturing such prized details was commented upon with a great deal of chaffing. Even Lieutenant Cantor was declared to be much too young to be entrusted with such important work. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the fortunate lieutenant and ensigns were once more sent for, to go over the map and instructions with Captain Gales. At nine o'clock, just before the \"_Long Island_\" was abreast of the Alvarez mill, the first launch was cleared away and lowered, falling behind and lying to. Then Darrin, with his own crew, went down over the side to the launch towing alongside. It was Coxswain Riley who stood by to catch the young commanding officer's arm. \"Hullo, Coxswain,\" was Dave's...", "...in a way by doing it, but his parental heart, as well as is own financial interests, were involved. By mortgaging his house and securing loans on his furniture, carriages, lots, and stocks, he managed to raise one hundred thousand in cash, and deposited it in his own bank to Frank's credit; but it was a very light anchor to windward in this swirling storm, at that. Frank had been counting on getting all of his loans extended three or four days at least. Reviewing his situation at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> of this Monday afternoon, he said to himself thoughtfully but grimly: \"Well, Stener has to loan me three hundred thousand--that's all there is to it. And I'll have to see Butler now, or he'll be calling his loan before three.\" He hurried out, and was off to Butler's house, driving like mad.

Although most friendly at the time the proposition was made that he should combine with...", "...of them already had their hair down,--or, rather loose, for it stood out in thick mats. The hair-dresser had a small oil stove on which lay heating half a dozen iron combs. With a hot comb she teased each strand of wool into perfect straightness and then plastered it down with a greasy pomade. The result was a stiff effect, something like the hair of the Japanese. It required about three hours to straighten the hair of one negress. The price was a dollar and a half. By half-past nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a crowd of negro men, in lodge aprons and with spears, and negro women, with sashes of ribbon over their shoulders and across the breasts, assembled about the Siner cabin. In the dusty curving street were ranged half a dozen battered vehicles,--a hearse, a delivery wagon, some rickety buggies, and a hack. Presently the undertaker arrived with a dilapidated black hearse which he used especially for negroes. He jumped down, got out his straps and coffin stands, directed some...", "...\"Porter does not know how many men you brought. No doubt your force is magnified, the same as his. Assuming the offensive will disconcert him, and also prevent him receiving further reinforcements.\" So it was decided, and the little force took up the march for Brown's Springs, eleven miles away. Couriers were dispatched to find Colonel Shaffer, for even if Bruno had succeeded in delivering Harry's message Shaffer would march for Fulton instead of Brown's Springs. It was about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when the column reached the vicinity of Brown's Springs. Nothing as yet had been heard from Colonel Shaffer, but Guitar determined to attack. Lawrence had been asked by Guitar to act as his aid, to which he gladly assented. Two or three small parties of guerrillas had been sighted, but they took to the brush at the sight of the Federals. The command now moved cautiously forward, but there was to be no battle. Harry, who had been scouting in front, returned with the news...", "...of the hotel bills of fare in Europe and our own country, are served here in their original purity and excellence, which cannot always be said of them in America.

Passing the night at Macon, we left next day for Paris, reaching the city at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> P. M. Here once more we experienced some of the excellent arrangements characterizing great cities in foreign countries. Not a passenger was permitted to enter that portion of the great station till the baggage was all unloaded and sorted, which was done with marvellous celerity and skill, each foreign party's pieces being selected by some clews they had, and piled together. This being done, we were permitted to enter; and a customs officer, as we designated our trunks,...", "...perjury he was about to commit, received him joyfully, but all the same advised him to lie concealed, as Charles in all probability would not be slow to reclaim his hostage: Indeed, the next day, when the king got up, the absence of Cardinal Valentino was observed, and as Charles was uneasy at not seeing him, he sent to inquire what had prevented his appearance. When the messenger arrived at the house that Caesar had left the evening before, he learned that he had gone out at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening and not returned since. He went back with this news to the king, who at once suspected that he had fled, and in the first flush of his anger let the whole army know of his perjury. The soldiers then remembered the twenty waggons, so heavily laden, from one of which the cardinal, in the sight of all, had produced such magnificent gold and silver plate; and never doubting that the cargo of the others was equally precious, they fetched them down and broke them to...", "...\"I hain't skeered of work.\" \"I believe that.

At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the painter, having shown his guest over the premises, said good-night, and went up-town to his own house. Samson lay a long while awake, with many disquieting reflections. Before his closed eyes rose insistently the picture of a smoky cabin with a puncheon floor and of a girl upon whose cheeks and temples flickered orange and vermilion lights. To his ears came the roar of elevated trains, and, since a fog had risen over the Hudson, the endless night- splitting screams of...", "...Cooks and scene-shifters, fiddlers and waiters, were most inextricably mingled; and as in all similar cases, the least important functionaries took the greatest airs upon them, and appropriated without hesitation whatever came to their hands--thus the cook would not have scrupled to light a fire with the violoncello of the orchestra; and I actually caught one of the \"gens de cuisine\" making a \"soufflet\" in a brass helmet I had once worn when astonishing the world as Coriolanus.

The wind had whipped around to the northeast and was blowing a gale. There was a persistent crash of breakers on the beach. To open a door or window was to admit a small cyclone of wind and sand and rain. Miss Marcia sat for a while over the open fire, bemoaning the fact that the roof _did_ leak in spots, though fortunately not over the beds.

It had queer rabbit ears, made from tying up the corners of a pillow slip that had been placed over its head. The eyes were holes cut in the slip. The large hall was lighted by many candles set in hollowed-out pumpkins which had queer grinning faces cut in them. \"Wow, but this is spooky,\" giggled Fat, at which the other boys...", "...Mr. Lincoln, in his family circle, unconscious of the death that crowded fast upon him, watched the pleasantry and smiled and felt heartful of gentleness.

Directly a voice cried, in the same slightly-raised monotone: \"Nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and fifty minutes!\" This also passed from man to man, until it touched the street like a shudder. \"Nine o'clock and fifty-five minutes!\" said the same relentless voice, after the next interval, each of which narrowed to a lesser span the life of the good President.

Suddenly, however, she recollected that she could telephone to Lilla, and she put through a call without delay.

For some time the two walked the weather side of the brig's flush deck, between the stern grating and the mainmast, conversing more or less intermittently upon various topics, until at length Leslie's attention was attracted to the man at the wheel, who, he noticed, was continually glancing over his shoulder with a perturbed air at the water...", "...his whole scheme had overlooked. He turned on his big club foot from the window, clinched his fist and muttered: \"But I'll hang that man for this deed if it's the last act of my life!\" The morning brought dismay to the negro, the carpet-bagger, and the scallawag of Ulster. A peculiar freak of weather in the early morning added to their terror. The sun rose clear and bright except for a slight fog that floated from the river valley, increasing the roar of the falls. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a huge black shadow suddenly rushed over Piedmont from the west, and in a moment the town was shrouded in twilight. The cries of birds were hushed and chickens went to roost as in a total eclipse of the sun. Knots of people gathered on the streets and gazed uneasily at the threatening skies. Hundreds of negroes began to sing and shout and pray, while sensible people feared a cyclone or cloud-burst. A furious downpour of rain was swiftly followed by sunshine, and the negroes rose...", "...Germans, Frenchmen, Scotchmen--all the heterogeneous individuals that compose the population of Maryland--shouted in their maternal tongue, and the cheering was unanimous.

The Queen of Night was looked at through them like a lady of high life. The Americans acted in regard to her with the freedom of proprietors.

And yet the only question was that of sending a projectile--a rather brutal way of entering into communication even with a...", "...and that no force, however large, should induce me to surrender it. So soon as the flag had returned, a brisk fire was opened upon us from the gunboats in the river, and from a five and a half inch howitzer on shore, which was kept up with little intermission through the night. At an early hour the next morning, three sixes (which had been placed during the night within 250 yards of the pickets) began to play upon us, but with little effect. About 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> P.M., discovering that the fire from all his guns was concentrated against the northwestern angle of the fort, I became confident that his object was to make a breach, and attempt to storm the works at that point. I therefore ordered out as many men as could be employed for the purpose of strengthening that front, which was so effectually secured by means of bags of flour, sand, &c., that the picketing suffered little or no injury....", "...few hours she must suffice to herself. She had moreover a great fondness for intervals of solitude, which since her arrival in England had been but meagrely met. It was a luxury she could always command at home and she had wittingly missed it. That evening, however, an incident occurred which--had there been a critic to note it--would have taken all colour from the theory that the wish to be quite by herself had caused her to dispense with her cousin's attendance. Seated toward nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the dim illumination of Pratt's Hotel and trying with the aid of two tall candles to lose herself in a volume she had brought from Gardencourt, she succeeded only to the extent of reading other words than those printed on the page--words that Ralph had spoken to her that afternoon.

When this memento had...", "...themselves in France. At Salisbury Plains Captain J.W. Moffatt was transferred to our Battalion as Chaplain.

There is a cup of coffee ready for you, and your horse will be at the door in fifteen minutes.\" I had thrown myself at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on my cot, fully equipped for the first march on the way to France, and had slept soundly till roused at twelve forty-five by a knock on my door, followed by the voice of the orderly room sergeant. I went to the door of my hut and looked out. The night was dark as a wolf's mouth. The stars in this northern latitude sparkled with unusual brilliancy. On the evening of the 9th, I had been asked to go to the Headquarters of the Third Brigade, where General Turner, V.C., had...", "...iron fastened to the hull of the boat, and to a frame-work above the deck fitted to receive them; a stout iron prow being secured to the bow of the boat, several feet below the water-line.

The assault was made at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, and caused great consternation and alarm among the enemy. The _Richmond_, lying higher up the Pass than the other ships, was first assaulted--some of her planks being started, below the water-line, by the concussion of the ram, though the blow was broken by a coal-schooner, which, fortunately for her, was lying alongside. As the ram drew off, a broadside of the _Richmond's_ guns was fired into her, without effect. After this harmless broadside, the ships all got...", "...years old to-day. Half my life gone, and I am still a dependent on my uncle's bounty. Suppose he should throw me off--leave me out in the cold--where should I be? If he should find the boy--but no, there is no chance of that. I have taken good care of that. By the way, I must look him up soon--cautiously, of course--and see what has become of him. He will grow up a laborer or mechanic and die without a knowledge of his birth, while I fill his place and enjoy his inheritance.\" At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the vessel reached the Quarantine. Most of the passengers decided to remain on board one night more, but John Wade was impatient, and, leaving his trunks, obtained a small boat, and soon touched the shore. It was nearly eight when John Wade landed in the city. It was half-past eight when he stood on the steps of his uncle's residence and rang the bell. \"Is my uncle is Mr. Wharton--at home?\" he asked of the servant who answered the bell. \"Yes, sir.\" \"I am his nephew,...", "...GERMAN BARON. \"The popular tradition of the Wild Huntsman, current in many places, prevails also still at the present day in my village of Zilmsdorf.

Having unburdened ourselves of our defence, we marched on again, and arrived, much fatigued, at the town at 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening. Our arms were stacked on the side of the guard house, and we threw our fatigued bodies as near them as we could, on the ground. An officer was dispatched to the general to inform him of our arrival, and to know whether we could have an immediate audience or not?

She could not help believing in the girl's integrity, and, despite Amy's rendezvous with Hoges, she still felt there must be a rational explanation for her actions. As Susan and Penny left the museum together, the former cast a panic-stricken glance at her watch. \"It's nearly four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and I promised to meet my mother at the library then. I forgot all about it. I have just ten minutes to get there.\" \"Twenty blocks in ten minutes!

I had, therefore, to start at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning in order that I might reach London in the evening. I can still recall some of the emotions of that journey.

Breakfasting at half past five or six o'clock in the morning, we made up our minds not to eat a solid meal again till our day's work should be accomplished; in other words, to content ourselves at noon with some slight refreshment, such as a morsel of bread, or a sandwich and a little weak brandy and water, swallowed in the shade of some grove, and to sup heartily when we should come in to our night's quarters, at six or seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening. The experience of this day sufficed to convince me that in arranging this plan I had not been so successful as the Duke of Wellington used to be with his commissariat. Our bread had become hard and mouldy. Our brandy was as hot as fire, and we could not find a spring of water sufficiently sheltered to cool it.

Scarcely knowing what he did, he caught the lad roughly by the shoulder. \"When did she go?\" he demanded. \"What time? What did she say?\" Tony raised a frightened glance to his questioner's face. \"She went this afternoon,\" gasped he, \"about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> it was.

Having destroyed all the buildings in Fort George and effectually silenced its fire, the Americans discontinued the bombardment about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. The lake front of the British position was then closely reconnoitred by boats from the fleet, sounding the shore in every direction and occasionally venturing within musket shot of some of the batteries which remained silent, partly from scarcity of ammunition and partly through fear of provoking a renewal of the cannonade. Buoys were placed to mark the stations the ships were to occupy next day when they engaged the batteries on the left of Fort George and...", "...a moment's delay.

He had a score of retorts before him, full of liquids in various stages of digestion. He told me he was experimenting with colours for his own amusement, and that he had established a hat factory for Count Cobenzl, the Austrian ambassador at Brussels. He added that the count had only given him a hundred and fifty thousand florins, which were insufficient.

Unfortunately, however, both my servants are out at this moment.\" We chatted on, but it was evident from her conversation that her servants knew little beyond what she did. One statement she made was somewhat curious. She alleged that a few nights before she was awakened about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning by hearing the loud shrill screams of a woman who seemed to be in the room next hers in the adjoining house. She could hear a man's voice talking low and gruffly, and three or four times were the screams repeated, as if the woman were in excruciating pain. \"What visitors came to the house?\" Patterson asked at length. \"Very few. A youngish gentleman came sometimes. He called the other morning just as I was going out.\" \"Who admitted him?\" \"The young...", "...there was much excitement at the despatchers' office in Medicine Bend over the lost train. It had been reported out of White Horse Station on time, and had not reported at Blackwood. For hours the despatcher waited vainly for some word from the bridge timbers. When the train reported at Blackwood Station, the message of Francis explaining the cause of the tie-up seemed like a voice from the tombs. But the strain was relieved and the train made fast time from Blackwood in. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning it whistled for the Medicine Bend yards and a few moments later Bucks ran upstairs in the station building to report for assignment. CHAPTER XV He found Baxter needing a man in the office, and Bucks was asked to substitute until Collins, the despatcher who was ill, could take his trick again. This brought Bucks where he was glad to be, directly under Stanley's eye, but it brought also new responsibilities, and opened his mind to the difficulties of...", "...in so fast, that she could scarcely be kept free, though two pumps were incessantly worked.

About five o'clock in the afternoon the tide began to rise, but, at the same time, the leak increased to a most alarming degree. Two more pumps, therefore, were manned, one of which unhappily would not work. Three pumps, however, were kept going, and at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the ship righted. Nevertheless, the leak had gained so considerably upon her, that it was imagined that she must go to the bottom, as soon as she ceased to be supported by the rock. It was, indeed, a dreadful circumstance to our commander and his people, that they were obliged to anticipate the floating of the vessel, not as an earnest of their deliverance, but as an event which probably would precipitate their destruction.

The Place showed a thin covering of snow, which clung, wet and sticky, to the trees; but by nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> most of it had disappeared, and Prince Ferdinand William Otto was informed that the excursion would take place. Two motors took the party, by back streets, to the landing-stage.

Carpets were lifted, boxes, barrels, and trunks packed, and all the disorderly elements of a regular moving operation called into activity. Every preparation had been made on the day previous to the contemplated flight; the cars were to be at the door by eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the next morning. In anticipation of this early movement, the children had been dragged out of bed an hour before their usual time for rising. They were, in consequence, cross and unreasonable; but not more so than mother, grandmother, and nurse, all of whom either boxed them, scolded them, or jerked them about in a most violent manner. Breakfast was served early; but such a breakfast! the least said about that the better. It was well there were no keen appetites to turn...", "...confines, if they liked. It was my turn to be alone in prison. Immediately after they had been locked into their cells, and the other Matrons had left, Haggerton began to complain of her coffee. \"What is the matter with your coffee?\" I asked. \"It is cold,\" she replied. \"I am sorry; but I can't help it now.\" Upon that she began to fret. \"I haven't eaten any breakfast, nor any dinner, and I've worked hard all day, and staid an hour later,\"--some of them had staid till eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night in the shop--\"and now I can't eat any supper because my coffee is cold. I'll tell the Master, and he'll make an awful fuss.\" Of course I could not allow such talk as that, and I told her to stop. \"I have done the best for you that I could. You had the same chance to eat that the rest had, and the same breakfast and dinner provided for you. I am not allowed to provide anything else.

Bells were rung to celebrate the Archduke's supposed success which, as the event proved, was a strategic victory for Nassau as it delayed the enemy several hours. It was three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon when the advancing Spaniards found themselves face to face with the main army of the republic, drawn up on the very beach outside the city walls. Perceiving their sturdy ranks and unyielding front the Archduke hesitated, but the Spaniards urged him not to let them lose their prey, whom they regarded as hateful rebels and heretics. Thus encouraged, the Archduke gave the order to advance and the battle soon became general. The fate of the day was decided by the...", "...Eh bien. I am a woman of old family, princely rank and fortune--you--\" \"By my father's death,\" said Paul, for the second time that day, \"I am a rich man. We can leave out the question of fortune--except that the money I inherit was made out of a fried-fish shop business. That business was conducted by my father on lines of peculiar idealism. It will be my duty to carry on his work--at least\"--he inwardly and conscientiously repudiated the idea of buying fish at Billingsgate at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning--\"as far as the maintenance of his principles is concerned.\" \"Soit,\" said the Princess, \"we leave out the question of fortune. You are then a man of humble birth, and the rank you have gained for yourself.\" \"I am a man of no name and of tarnished reputation.

About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all was again commotion in the ship; many a strange figure might have been seen in the cabins below. Here Mr. Webberly, doffing his white cotton nightcap, and reeling on the floor, was cut short in the ecstasy of a yawn, and of an outstretched arm, and balancing opposite leg, by a return of the sickness, which had kept him below stairs all night, to Adelaide's great joy. There a fop was calmly settling his hat, so as to display the glossy curls, that were to appear below its...", "...when he went back to camp his mouth was set hard. After breakfast he broke up the party and, sending the Indians off, started again with the two white men.

It was a strenuous journey and Jim was worn out when he climbed the hill to the telegraph camp. It was about six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening and the men had not returned from work, but Carrie was cooking and got up with a cry of welcome when he came out of the woods. She stopped, however, when she saw his gloomy face. \"What's the matter, Jim?\" she asked. \"Are you hurt or ill?\" He dropped the heavy bag of flour he carried and forced a smile. \"Does it look as if I were ill? I've lost two canoes and their loads.\" \"Oh, Jim!\" said Carrie, and added: \"After all, it isn't so very important.\"...", "...you are?\" \"Tell them you don't know,\" shouted the detective. It was evident to Penny and Susan that Michael had no suspicion where he was being taken. Even when the automobile drew near Ferndale he did not appear to grow uneasy. He was so calm and undisturbed that they began to wonder if they had made another mistake. \"Of course the Orphan's Home isn't at Ferndale,\" Penny told herself. \"He probably doesn't know that Mrs. Havers has left the Glenhaven Home.\" It was after nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when the car finally drew up in front of the former matron's home. The girls were afraid that Mrs. Havers might have retired early and so were greatly relieved to see a light burning on the lower floor. \"Michael, why don't you come in with us?\" Penny asked as she alighted from the car. \"Oh, I'll wait out here,\" he replied. \"No, come along,\" Mr. Nichols invited. He took Michael by the arm and steered him up the walk. Penny and Susan went on ahead to ring the...", "...my hotel again, and went to bed, I lay awake half the night endeavouring to arrive at an understanding of it; but, try how I would, I could not hit upon a satisfactory solution. Upon one thing, however, I had quite made up my mind. As soon as the City offices were open, I would call at that of the Santa Cruz Mining Company, and put a few questions to Mr. Bayley which I fancied that individual would find difficult and rather unpleasant to answer. This plan I carried out, and at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I stood in the handsome outer office of the Company. \"I should be glad to see the managing director, if he could spare me a few moments,\" I said to the youth who waited upon me in answer to his question. \"He's engaged, sir, at present,\" the lad replied. \"If you will take a seat, however, I don't fancy he will be very long.\" I did as he directed, and in the interval amused myself by studying a large map of the Argentine Republic, which hung upon the wall. I had...", "...number of guns from the white puffs of smoke, but could not hear the sound. That night we slept on piles of wheat in a mill at Soquel, near Santa Cruz, and, our supplies being short, I advised that we should make an early start next morning, so as to reach the ranch of Don Juan Antonio Vallejo, a particular friend, who had a large and valuable cattle-ranch on the Pajaro River, about twenty miles on our way to Monterey. Accordingly, we were off by the first light of day, and by nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we had reached the ranch. It was on a high point of the plateau, overlooking the plain of the Pajaro, on which were grazing numbers of horses and cattle. The house was of adobe, with a long range of adobe-huts occupied by the semi-civilized Indians, who at that time did all the labor of a ranch, the herding and marking of cattle, breaking of horses, and cultivating the little patches of wheat and vegetables which constituted all the farming of that day. Every thing about the...", "...Matinee and no Adrian. What shall I do? SATURDAY, 11 P.M. Dear Dairy, I have the meazles. I am all broken out, and look horible. But what is a sickness of the Body compared to the agony of my Mind? Oh, dear Dairy, to think of what has happened since last I saw your stainless Pages! What is a sickness to a broken heart? And to a heart broken while trying to help another who did not deserve to be helped.

The trained nurse is asleep on a cot, and her cap is hanging on the foot of the bed. I have tried it on, dear Dairy, and it is very becoming. If they insist on Switzerland I think I shall run away and be a trained nurse. It is easy work, although sleeping on a cot is not always comfortible. But at least a trained nurse leads her own Life and...", "...City with the dead and wounded. We left the wreck blazing and roaring in the shut-in valley at the gulch mouth because there wasn't anything else to do; Kirgan and Jones and one of the firemen handled the engine and pulled out, while the rest of us rode in the day-coach and did what we could for the suffering. At Banta we made a stop long enough to let the boss send a wire to Portal City, turning out the doctors and the ambulances--and the undertakers; and though it was after three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning when we pulled in, it seemed as if the whole town had got the word and was down at the station to meet us. I couldn't see Mrs. Sheila's face when the major helped her off at the platform; her veil was still down.

Afterwards he attended a large dinner party at the house of Mr. Barran, and at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> departed from Leeds by special train for Hawarden. It will be seen that the burden of work laid upon him was enormous, especially considering the fact that he was already in his seventy-second year. Yet his wonderful constitution and untiring energy enabled him to go through the whole programme not only with apparent ease, but with an exuberant vitality that seemed to suggest that if his engagements had been twice as numerous he would have been equal to them all.

I didn't stay to listen, I was too angry to move, that's all. You see, she had given me an appointment to meet her in the summer-house at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night....\" We were at my door.

I tried a few words of gentle persuasion on him, but it made him worse. He bespattered my hands and the axe handle, and I took him by the neck and ran him to the other end of the yard and dumped him in a corner. Any kind of a fuss in that yard had usually a very serious ending; but this had not, for the yard superintendent took my part. I think it was about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the forenoon when I finished my wood, and went in to get breakfast, which consisted of a bowl of gruel and two hard biscuits. One of these biscuits I kept hanging in my study for two years. After breakfast I marched into the office, and said to the superintendent: \"Brother, I want to ask you a few questions which belong to a domain--that mysterious domain that lies between the facts and your 'Annual Report.'\" \"Are you a reporter?\" was his first question. Assuring him...", "...to other boats.

The Dalmatia had steamed into New York at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of the 24th day of April with a broken screw! Imagine my amazement! The net of circumstantial evidence wound around Ragobah seemed to be such as to leave no possibility of escape, and yet, the very first effort made to draw it tighter about him had resulted in his walking, with the utmost ease, right through its meshes! There is no gainsaying such an alibi, and I am, therefore, forced to acknowledge that Rama Ragobah could not, by any possibility, have murdered...", "...yet. It is hard to say why a thing should be worse because it is close, but it certainly is so. Had it been in the next parish, or even further off in this parish, I do not think that I should feel it so much, and then we knew the old man so well; and then, again,--which makes it worst of all,--we all of us are unable to get rid of a suspicion that one whom we knew, and was liked, has been a participator in the crime. It seems that it must have been about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Sunday morning that Mr. Trumbull was killed. It was, at any rate, between one and three. As far as they can judge, they think that there must have been three men concerned. You remember how we used to joke about poor Mr. Trumbull's dog.

This inclosure was also the resort during the night for many Indians who assisted the dancers in their toilets. At 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the ceremonies opened by the entrance upon the avenue of the song-priest who came from the green room.

Their masks were blue ornamented with feathers and were similar to the masks worn by the dancers; their bodies...", "...on my hands and knees, I proceeded to slake my thirst. I took one swallow, and it burnt my throat like molten lead. It was alkali water, and the strongest I ever tasted. It was a bitter disappointment, but it was near night; I was but a few miles from town, and under the cover of darkness I could get water and maybe something to eat. Night at last arrived, and under its sable folds I reached the railroad bed, and proceeded on my way--my place of destination, Merced. About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I reached the outskirts of the town, and, proceeding cautiously to Fourteenth street, through Chinatown, crossed the railroad track below the El Capitan Hotel. Just as I stepped on the track two men passed on their way to town--evidently men from one of the farms beyond Merced. I was then about five hundred yards from my home, and I determined at any risk to find out the fate of my would be brother and poor dear mother, (whom I expected home on Monday night). Crawling on my...", "...and where to look for them, after which the four girls and their guardian, with their packs slung over their backs, stout sticks in their hands to assist them over rough places and also to frighten away troublesome dogs, started out on their journey of ten miles or more.

Shortly after eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they came in sight of a remote farm house tucked away in a valley. Miss Elting decided to call there to get some milk. The woman of the house at first regarded them with suspicion, but she soon thawed under Miss Elting's gentle voice and winning smile. The milk had not been skimmed. All the old milk had been churned that day.

He had questioned her maid very casually, very unconcernedly, and she had told him that her mistress had gone out riding this morning about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> with Mr. Hescott. His questions had been so clever, so altogether without anxiety, that the maid had believed in him, and saw nothing in his words to dwell upon later. Yet Rylton's heart had seemed to cease beating as she answered him. She had gone riding with Hescott. With Hescott! Will she ever come back?

Clearly he was mad enough to \"chew me up.\" Bidding him a mocking good night, I ran down the steps and hurried away.

I realized that if I ever expected to gain our family rights I must fight for them--and fight unflinchingly to the bitter end. It was nearly ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when I reached the Widow Canby's house. I met my Uncle Enos on the porch. He had grown impatient, and was about to start for Darbyville in search of me. In the dining room I told my story. All laughed heartily at the ruse I had played upon the merchant, but were indignant at the treatment I had received. \"Wish I'd been with you,\" remarked my uncle, with a vigorous shake of his head. \"I'd a-smashed in his figurehead, keelhaul me if I wouldn't!\" \"What do you intend to do...", "...to enter through the mist into the parsonage. \"I can, verily, again spend the sultry zephyr-night, not under the coverlet, but under the stars.

I can post myself on a hill and look down into the hamlet. Truly I can then deliver my billet here incognito to some Maienthaler, and take flight again before it is yet day.\" At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening he went, like the sea, from east to west.

Families went dinnerless because housewives either could not get to the shops, or could not get away from them again. Telephones rang, and irate housekeepers enquired when the materials for lunch were coming.

Mr. Hearty was distracted at the thought that none of his customers had received their fruit and vegetables, and Bindle was genuinely sorry for him.

When we got down to it, we found it not only fully manned by Chinese, but full of their women, children, and boxes, so that we could scarcely find room to squeeze ourselves into the stern, and we were so heavily laden that we made very slow progress. It was no use protesting, however: we were only English folk, and the Chinese had it all their own way in those days. About eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we got down to the mouth of the Morotabas, where the schooner lay. Pitch dark and very wet it was, but it was a relief when all the Chinese passengers climbed up the schooner ladder, and the men hauled the boxes up one after another, last of all a very heavy one which it took six men to lift, full of dollars,--so no wonder we were overladen.

Consoled by the aspect of her gentle protectress, she often raised her eyes to watch her slumber, and sent her in secret all the blessings which love showers upon those who protect it, sometimes kissing the curls of her blond hair, as if by this kiss she could convey to her soul all the ideas favorable to the thought ever present to her mind. The Queen's slumber was prolonged, while Marie thought and wept. However, she remembered that at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she must appear at the royal toilette before all the court. She resolved to cast aside reflection, to dry her tears, and she took a thick folio volume placed upon a table inlaid with enamel and medallions; it was the 'Astree' of M. d'Urfe-- a work 'de belle galanterie' adored by the fair prudes of the court. The unsophisticated and straightforward mind of Marie could not enter into these pastoral loves. She was too simple to understand the 'bergeres du Lignon', too clever to...", "...fade from the sky behind the pine-crowned ridge of the Bogdo-ol, we thanked God that for five long months we could leave the twentieth century with its roar and rush, and live as the Mongols live; we knew that the days of discouragement had ended and that we could learn the secrets of the desert life which are yielded up to but a chosen few.

The gale was now at its height, \"blowing like scissors and thumb-screws\"; the captain was on deck; the ship, which was light, rolling and pitching as though she would shake the long sticks out of her, and the sails were gaping open and splitting in every direction. The mizzen-topsail, which was a comparatively new sail and close reefed, split from head to foot in the...", "...London, if we like to think it. Further corroboration was quite superfluous. 'Is there a night packet-boat from this port of yours?' Lady Charlotte asked. The household servants had to be consulted; and she, hurriedly craving the excuse of their tedious mistress, elicited, as far as she could understand them, that there might be and very nearly was, a night packet-boat starting for Flushing. The cook, a native of Harwich, sent up word of a night packet-boat starting at about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> last year. Lady Charlotte saw the chance as a wind-blown beacon-fire under press of shades. Changeing her hawkish manner toward the simple pair, she gave them view of a smile magical by contrast, really beautiful--the smile she had in reserve for serviceable persons whom she trusted--while thanking them and saying, that her anxiety concerned Lady Ormont's welfare. Her brother had prophesied she would soon be 'running at his wife's heels,' and so she was, but not 'with her...", "...arrival in the eighteenth century. He boarded a coach in the early morning in London. His baggage was placed in the boot, and the traveller, armed to the teeth with blunderbuss and pistols, took his seat. With a clattering of hoofs, yelling of ostlers and merry tooting on the horn, the coach dashed out of the yard and wound merrily along throughout the day by field, village, and town. If the journey were a lucky one, the travellers arrived at Oxford without let or hindrance about six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, when they were able to catch a first glimpse of the top of Radcliffe's Library. They then jolted in over Magdalen Bridge--in those days the new bridge--and so made their way to their respective colleges. Wrapped up in thick coats and with ice-cold feet tapping the side of the coach to restore circulation, the excited fresher had ample time for cogitation. The lets and hindrances, over and above the ordinary accidents to horse or vehicle, such as casting a shoe...", "...off after her attack on the Burgundians, and so intercepting her return to the town; but this unfortunately was the very disaster which occurred. In front of the bridge the redoubts were filled by French archers to keep off any attack made by the English, and Flavy had placed a large number of boats filled with armed men, principally bowmen, in readiness along the river to receive their companions should they meet with a repulse in their attack on the Burgundians. It was about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that afternoon when Joan of Arc rode out of Compiegne at the head of five hundred horsemen and foot soldiers. Flavy remained within the town, of which he was Governor. The attack led by the Maid on Margny, with splendid impetuosity, proved a complete success, and the enemy fled for shelter to their companions at Clairvoix. Here the resistance made was far more stubborn. While the French and Burgundians were combating in the meadows at Clairvoix, the English came from Venette to...", "...the cue. He is a hard worker, and, like Trollope, believes that there is nothing like a piece of shoemaker's wax on the seat of one's chair to encourage good literary work. Ordinarily he has a fixed amount of writing for each day's duty. He rewrites many of his chapters, and some of them have been scratched out and interlined again and again. Robert Waldmueller, a leading German novelist, who writes under the pseudonym of \"Charles Eduard Duboc,\" works mostly from eight, nine, or ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning until two o'clock in the afternoon, but never writes at night. Generally he does not plan his work beforehand. When at work he must be unmolested. In composition, he loves to change off, now producing poetry, now plays and essays, as his mood may direct. He writes with great ease and swiftness; and the many books which he has composed testify that he cannot justly be accused of indolence. He attributes his facility of expression to the discrimination which he has...", "...dignified and noble, that if she were to be seen without ornament or any outward marks of distinction, among a great number of ladies of rank, she would be immediately esteemed the chief. She seems born to command, though in her character there is more of liveliness than of gravity. She is courteous, gentle, benevolent and outwardly devout.\" Like almost every one who has attained distinction, Catharine was very systematic in the employment of her time. She usually rose at about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> both in summer and winter; and what seems most remarkable, prepared her own simple breakfast, as she was not fond of being waited upon. But a short time was devoted to her toilet. From eight to eleven in the forenoon she was busy in her cabinet, signing commissions and issuing orders of various purport. The hour, from eleven to twelve, was daily devoted to divine worship in her chapel. Then, until one o'clock, she gave audience to the ministers of the various departments. From...", "...pain of unlimited drabness. It is the only way a sensitive nature can face such a prospect without going mad. Such was Joe. He had slumped. He no longer cared. He no longer cared if skies were blue and if breezes were lazy and outdoors was calling. He no longer cared when the quitting whistle blew. He no longer cared that June was only two weeks off. He would not even have cared if June had been the end of it all. He had settled into his stupor. And then one morning at about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he was summoned to the telephone by the switchboard operator. It was a drowsy morning, full of dronings and rustlings, and he was very heavy lidded as he stepped into the booth reserved for such calls. He had been expecting a message from Indianapolis about some shipment that had gone astray and for which he was putting in a claim. He sank heavily down upon the hard, polished little stool. The air was stuffy and foul about him. \"This Mr. Hooper?\" he heard a voice say. He...", "...along the front lines, for no lights are permitted on any machines, official or otherwise, after a certain point is reached. One of the favorite outdoor sports of this preacher for a month was to lie on his stomach on the front mud-guard of a big Pierce-Arrow through the war-zone roads, bumping over shell-holes, with a little pocket flash-light playing on the ground, searching out the shell-holes, and trying to help the driver keep in the road. It is a delightful occupation about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, with a blizzard blowing, and knowing that the big truck is rumbling along within sight and sound of the German big guns. Trucks make more noise on such occasions than a Twentieth Century Limited. \"No lights beyond divisional headquarters\" was the order, and night after night we travelled along these roads with only an occasional flash of the Ever Ready to guide. And so it is that the flash-light has come to its own, and every private soldier, officer, and...", "...to the match, and that custom would have justified him in letting me hear the news of my daughter's engagement elsewhere and in seeing me further, as the phrase is, before he saw me at all. Remembering as I did that I regarded the views of Josephine's father concerning our little matter twenty-five years ago as a matter of mere detail, only think how far I fell short of the temper of a real philosopher in allowing myself to become violently angry, and to pace the library until one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning after my would-be son-in-law had left it! An especially futile proceeding, as Josephine subsequently remarked, inasmuch as, by my own admission, I had behaved like a veritable lamb in his presence and had told him blandly that if he and my daughter were agreed upon the subject I had not a word to say against it. This was the first break in our peaceful, happy domestic circle. Do you know what the period of an idolized daughter's engagement seems to the...", "...both man and horse were gone, and nothing was left to witness against me but two objects--unpleasant enough in themselves to be sure, and presenting a very ugly, not to say murderous appearance--in one place, the hat saturated with rain and coated with mud, indented and broken above the brim by that villainous whip-handle; in another, the crimson handkerchief, soaking in a deeply tinctured pool of water--for much rain had fallen in the interim. Bad news flies fast: it was hardly four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when I got home, but my mother gravely accosted me with--'Oh, Gilbert!--Such an accident! Rose has been shopping in the village, and she's heard that Mr. Lawrence has been thrown from his horse and brought home dying!' This shocked me a trifle, as you may suppose; but I was comforted to hear that he had frightfully fractured his skull and broken a leg; for, assured of the falsehood of this, I trusted the rest of the story was equally exaggerated; and when I heard my mother...", "...and future. And she is all I have in the world. And he's let me down!\" He reseated himself at the table, and, taking up a telegram, re-read it, as he had done a dozen times before. It was dated from Stowmarket, and said: \"Much regret to tell you that poor Charles has been found dead. Very distressed.--Lady Hornton.\" His partner was dead! Upon his table lay a letter he had received by the last post that evening. A letter of apology it was. On the previous night at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the two partners had met alone in Lombard Street, and Sir Charles had confessed that he had been gambling heavily in Paris, at Deauville, at Aix, at Madeira, at the Jockey Club, at Buenos Ayres, as well as at a private gambling-hell called Evans' in West Kensington, and that the result had been that he had lost everything. He could not face the music. So he had made his bow to the world and ended his life. Purcell Sandys was left to bear the brunt of the whole of the...", "...resolution was soon taken, and I decided to go away. I arose, my heart bleeding but firm. I looked at the house, at her window; I opened the garden gate and placed my lips on the lock as I passed out. When I reached home, I told Larive to make what preparations were necessary as I would set out in the morning. The poor fellow was astonished, but I made him a sign to obey and ask no questions. He brought a large trunk and busied himself with preparations for departure. It was five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning and day was beginning to break, when I asked myself where I was going. At that thought, which had not occurred to me before, I experienced a profound feeling of discouragement. I cast my eyes over the country, scanning the horizon. A sense of weakness took possession of me; I was exhausted with fatigue. I sat down in a chair and my ideas became confused; I bore my hand to my forehead and found it bathed in sweat. A violent fever made my limbs tremble; I could...", "...The comment that went with it was warm and appreciative, so much so in fact that, while the boys were not wholly displeased with it, they felt, as Joe expressed it, that the reporter was \"spreading it on too thick\" and feared that they would have to undergo no end of \"joshing\" from their mates. Their lessons in school that day did not receive all the attention that was due them, for their minds were taken up pretty fully by the events of the last twenty-four hours. But three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> came at last, and with it came the reminder that they were to call on their way home at the Sterling House, in order to see Miss Berwick, in accordance with her request of the day before. Bustling, motherly Mrs. Sterling greeted Bob and Joe with a smile, as they made known their errand. \"So here are the young heroes that the paper has been making so much fuss about,\" she said mischievously, and Bob and Joe blushed to their ears. \"Just wait a minute until I run up and see...", "...through the trees showed the bayou sweeping along, full to the banks, with dense forest trees almost meeting over it. The boat was launched, calked, and reloaded, and we were off again. Toward noon the sound of distant cannon began to echo around, probably from Vicksburg again. About the same time we began to encounter rafts. To get around them required us to push through brush so thick that we had to lie down in the boat. The banks were steep and the land on each side a bog. About one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we reached this clear space with dry shelving banks, and disembarked to eat lunch. To our surprise a neatly dressed woman came tripping down the declivity, bringing a basket. She said she lived above and had seen our boat. Her husband was in the army, and we were the first white people she had talked to for a long while. She offered some corn-meal pound-cake and beer, and as she climbed back told us to \"look out for the rapids.\" H. is putting the boat in order for our start,...", "...public dinners, \"dramatic,\" and \"hotels,\" cleaned out her desk, and took her fancy-work home, and \"Fergy,\" a freckled youth who delighted in calling himself a \"cub,\" although he did little more than run errands and carry copy to the press-room, might even be seen batting madly at an unused typewriter when actual duties failed, so inspiring was the new atmosphere. Mrs. Burgoyne had a desk and a corner of her own, where her trim figure might be seen daily for an hour or two, from ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> until the small girls came in to pick her up on their way home from school for luncheon. Barry found her brimming with ideas. She instituted the \"Women's Page,\" the old familiar page of answered questions, and formulas for ginger-bread, and brief romances, and scraps of poetry, and she offered through its columns a weekly cash prize for contributions on household topics.

This earth, by being lixiviated with common house-ashes, produces a liquid which, on evaporation, yields saltpetre. The cave, I was informed at Potosi, has been visited for this purpose by Colonel Ashley, and it appropriately bears his name. Finding it a perfect \"rock-house,\" and being dry, and affording advantages for some necessary repairs to our gear, and arrangements for the further continuation of our explorations, we, about four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, removed our camp up the valley, and encamped within it. We could shelter ourselves completely in its capacious chambers in case of rain, of which there were indications, and take a calm view of the course it seemed now expedient to pursue. Thus far, we had had a trail, however slight, to follow; but from this point there was none--we were to plunge into the pathless woods, and to trust ourselves alone to the compass, and the best judgment we could form of...", "...your Honour, an' they screeching always; they crossed out the field below over-right the white pony, and faith ye couldn't hardly see Michael Leary for the shweat!

I felt that as far as I was concerned the surprise would be mutual; I had had nothing but misfortune since ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning, and there seemed no reason to believe that the tide had turned. The pony proved to be a white mule, a spectral creature, standing in malign meditation trace-high in bracken; I proceeded in its direction at a trot, through clumps of bracken and coarse grass, and as I drew near it uttered a strangled and heart-broken cry of greeting. At the same moment Lady Jane fell headlong on to her nose and the point of her right shoulder. It is almost superfluous to observe...", "...room was not even waxed, the walls were still hung with dingy tapestries; she used the country furniture, burned tallow candles, and followed the customs of the town,--adopting provincial life, and not shrinking from its pettiness or its many disagreeable privations. Knowing, however, that her guests would pardon luxuries if provided for their own comfort, she neglected nothing which conduced to their personal enjoyment, and gave them, more especially, excellent dinners. Toward seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on this memorable evening, her guests were all assembled in a wide circle around the fireplace. The mistress of the house, sustained in her part by the sympathizing glances of the old merchant, submitted with wonderful courage to the minute questioning and stupid, or frivolous, comments of her visitors. At every rap upon her door, every footfall echoing in the street, she hid her emotions by starting topics relating to the interests of the town, and she raised such a lively...", "...and Betty Bruce, being of a height and age, headed a line alternately.

At dinner-time John scampered home to roast fowl and bread sauce, and Betty and Cyril and Nancy carried their lunch bag to a shady corner and ate bread and jam sandwiches with relish, finishing up with a banana each. It was not until afternoon school was well over that Betty found John in any...", "...story the missionary can tell of the harps and golden streets of that strange heaven of the white man where whale-meat is unknown and blubber enters not. In July, resurrection comes to Herschel,--saxifrages, white anemones through the snow, the whoop of the mosquito-hawk, and the wild fox dodging among the dwarf-junipers and uncovered graves! And the Midnight Sun? It is not a continual blare of light for twenty-four hours. It sweeps through the midnight heavens, but between ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening and four in the morning there is a sensible change. Colour tints and lines of demarcation on sea and ships are harder to distinguish, shadows less clearcut. Birds roost and even flowers close, Nature whispering to both that, if they would reproduce after their kind in the short Arctic summer, energies must be conserved. Surely the world holds nothing more beautiful than this Polar night, this compelling gloaming, the \"cockshut light\" of Francis Thompson. Here the...", "...in spite of its patriotic and poetic associations it is a quarter where the scrupulous house-keeping of London seems for once to fail. In such streets as we passed through, and I dare say they were not the best, the broom and the brush and the dust-pan strive in vain against the dirt that seems to rise out of the ground and fall from the clouds. But many people live there, and London Bridge, by which we crossed, was full of clerks and shop-girls going home to Southwark; for it was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on a Saturday, and they were profiting by the early closing which shuts the stores of London so inexorably at that hour on that day. We made our way through them to the parapet for a final look at that stretch of the Thames where Cromwell as unwillingly as unwittingly perhaps stepped ashore to come into a kingdom.

Six laughing and not very tired boys piled aboard the wagon that afternoon, with what looked like a \"mountain\" of prime birch bark roped on. For seven more working days Dick & Co. toiled faithfully, at the end of which time they discovered that they had about \"cleaned\" Katson's Hill of all the really desirable bark. \"Your canoe will be dry enough to launch in the morning,\" said Driggs, as he received the last load at his stable. \"Come down any time after eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and we'll put it in the water.\" Were Dick & Co. on hand the next morning?

I accordingly assumed a high tone--laughed at the entire affair--said it was a \"way we had in the army\"--that \"we never meant any thing by it,\" &c. &c. In a few minutes I perceived the bait was taking. Mr. Fitzpatrick's west country blood was up: all thought of the legal resource was abandoned; and he flung out of the room to find a friend, I having given him the name of \"one of ours\" as mine upon the occasion. Very little time was lost, for before three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that afternoon a meeting was fixed for the following morning at the North Bull; and I had the satisfaction of hearing that I only escaped the malignant eloquence of Holmes in the King's Bench, to be \"blazed\" at by the best shot on the western circuit. The thought was no way agreeable, and I indemnified myself for the scrape by a very satisfactory anathema upon the high sheriff and his ball, and his confounded saucepans; for to the lady's sympathy for my sufferings I attributed...", "...which made them all uneasy;--and she did connect it with the presence of Mr. Spooner. But, in pitiable ignorance of the facts that were clear enough to everybody else, she went on watching and wondering, with a half-formed idea that the house would be more pleasant as soon as Mr. Spooner should have taken his departure. He was to go after lunch. But on such occasions there is, of course, a latitude, and \"after lunch\" may be stretched at any rate to the five o'clock tea. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mr. Spooner was still hanging about. Madame Goesler and Phineas, with an openly declared intention of friendly intercourse, had gone out to walk together. Lord and Lady Baldock were on horseback. Two or three old ladies hung over the fire and gossiped. Lady Chiltern had retired to her baby;--when on a sudden Adelaide Palliser declared her intention of walking into the village. \"Might I accompany you, Miss Palliser?\" said Mr. Spooner; \"I want a walk above all things.\" He was...", "...was first named Closeleigh by the railway company; but the name was not popular.

The rooms are clean and comfortable and filled with sweet mountain and river air. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that evening the steamer _Dawson_ struggled up the river and landed within fifty yards of the hotel. We immediately went aboard; but it was nine o'clock the next morning before we started, so we had another night in White Horse. The Yukon steamers are four stories high, with a place for a roof garden. I could do nothing for some time but regard the _Dawson_ in silent wonder.

But I kept my own counsel, determined to make investigations alone. We drove back to town and lunched in the restaurant at the Piccadilly Hotel. Teddy had suggested the Automobile Club, but I had overruled him, and we went to the Piccadilly instead. At the club there was far too much flying \"shop\"--and I wanted time to think. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I ran Roseye home, dropping Teddy on the way, and then returned to Shaftesbury Avenue. As I entered, Theed told me that his father had been up to say that on the previous night there had been some strangers about the shed at Gunnersbury. He had heard footsteps around the place at about three o'clock in the morning, but on going out he could discover nobody. He had taken out his big heavy Browning pistol which I had bought for him, and he had told his own son that he...", "...dropped the subject. But, in accordance with a resolution which he had formed during his walk, he told his wife that he meant to go to Paris on the morrow. And on noticing her surprise, he pretended that he wished to see to a certain business matter, the settlement of an old account. But the truth was, that he could no longer endure the spectacle of his wife's lingering agony, which brought him so much suffering. He wished to act, to make a supreme effort at reconciliation. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the following morning, when Mathieu alighted from the train at the Paris terminus, he drove direct to the factory at Grenelle. Before everything else he wished to see Denis, who had hitherto taken no part in the quarrel. For a long time now, indeed ever since Constance's death, Denis had been installed in the house on the quay with his wife Marthe and their three children. This occupation of the luxurious dwelling set apart for the master had been like a final entry into...", "...a little pressing work.

None of them arrived until long after the hour, and at 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> nineteen of the two hundred and sixty got into the large hall and were comparatively lost. They adjourned to a small room where they remained but a few minutes and then dispersed. They acknowledged they had been misled by the strikers, some of whom had arranged the meeting for the purpose of ascertaining how much disaffection there was in the ranks of the employers. The small attendance was a great disappointment to those in charge of the strike. But they determined to secure...", "...bring about a revelation on the part of Athos. She might say that Athos had hanged her; but then Athos would tell that she was branded. She thought it was best to preserve silence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill; and then, all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance. In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o'clock she was at the fort of the Point; at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she had embarked; and at nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its course toward England. 46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d'Artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber.

And all because of Oliver Drew! Oliver stepped from the train at Halfmoon Flat this afternoon, two weeks after the fight. He had helped Jessamy and her mother through the difficulties arising from the tragedy, had appeared as witness at the inquest, and had then hurried to Los Angeles with his sealed envelope. Now, returning, he caught Poche in a pasture close to the village and saddled him. It was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. He had lunched on the diner, so at once he lifted Poche into his mile-devouring lope and headed straight for Poison Oak Ranch. What changes had taken place since first he galloped along that road, barely four months before! Few with whom he had come in contact were still pursuing the even tenor of their ways, as then. He thought of the fight and of the spectacular death of Digger Foss.

New buildings of brick seemed to have sprung up like mushrooms along its course. Where formerly had been spacious fields of kowliang--the long-stalked millet of the country--with Chinese fangtzes few and far between, there were now wide bare stretches upon which Russian industry was erecting storehouses, engine-sheds, tile-covered residences for the officials. Some thirty-five miles from Moukden is Tieling, which, when Jack's train passed through at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning--having taken just six hours to run that distance--seemed to be nothing but a collection of scaffolding, with Chinese bricklayers already at work, trowel in hand. Between Tieling and Harbin stretches an immense plain, fertile for the most part, and hitherto left almost unspoiled. Nowhere does the line pass through a Chinese village; these were purposely avoided by the Russian engineers from motives of policy, and in deference to native susceptibilities.

This advance turned the flank of the French troops near Subijana de Alava, and of those on the Puebla mountain, and both fell back in disorder for two miles, until they made a junction with the main body of their army. Still the British troops pressed forward, the French again fell back, and for six miles a running fight of musketry and artillery was kept up, the ground being very broken, and preventing the concerted action of large bodies of troops. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon the French stood at bay on the last heights before Vittoria, upon which stood the villages of Ali and Armentia. Behind them was the plain upon which the city stood, and beyond the city thousands of carriages, animals, and non-combatants, women, and children, were crowded together in the extremity of terror as the British shots rang menacingly over their heads. The French here defended themselves desperately, and for a while the allied advance was checked by...", "...in its immediate vicinity, and diffuses something like warmth around.

Covering ourselves by keeping well under the bank, we pushed ahead as rapidly as possible, and made pretty good progress, the night finding us still on the way and our enemies yet on our track. I, being the youngest and smallest of the party, became somewhat tired, and without noticing it I had fallen behind the others for some little distance. It was about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and we were keeping very quiet and hugging close to the bank, when I happened to look up to the moonlit sky and saw the plumed head of an Indian peeping over the bank. Instead of hurrying ahead and alarming the men in a quiet way, I instantly aimed my gun at his head and fired.

I was not only...", "...Flighty, and Will Scamper; we had a famous supper, and resolved to make a night of it. The weather was hot, stormy, and goblinish; it led us to tell ghost-stories, which we did till our marrow froze, and our parched throats cried out, like the horse-leech's two daughters, \"Give! give!\" Purely to raise our courage and moisten our palates, we had a couple of bottles additionally. I recollect that after this we told some stories partaking more of the flesh than the spirit, and that at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning I agreed to ride home on Daylight, hand in hand, like the fire-office insignia, with Scamper, who was mounted on Wildfire. I remember something of trying to force Daylight to cross that which I took to be a ferry. I recollect something of our dispute upon this subject, but faintly; I can only guess how the matter ended by the result,--for he is gone, and I am _here_! I suppose I must have struggled, flopped, and floundered about a good deal before I could have...", "...that she and William James are right--hypnotism and mind-cure are the same thing; no difference between them. Very well; the very source, the very center of hypnotism is Paris. Dr. Charcot's pupils and disciples are right there and ready to your hand without fetching poor dear old Susy across the stormy sea.

You never show any, either in your eyes or your movements; do you ever feel any?\" I was able to say that I had forgotten what that feeling was like. Don't you remember how almost impossible it was for me to tire myself at the Villa? Well, it is just so in New York. I go to bed unfatigued at 3, I get up fresh and fine six hours later. I believe I have taken only one daylight nap since I...", "...fail before ten o'clock this night.\" From the bosom of her gown she drew the letter which she had written during the previous night, and handed it to the young girl. \"The letter,\" she added slowly, \"is for Messire don Juan de Vargas, chief of the Council of His Highness the Lieutenant-Governor. He lodges in Brussels at the sign of the 'Blue Firmament,' over against the Broodhuis. Let your uncle explain to Michel Daens, the butcher, that if this letter is not delivered before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this evening, he will be made to suffer the severe penalty imposed by the law on all those who neglect to do their duty to the State. Take the letter, child!\" Indeed, this last peremptory order was necessary, for Grete, hearing to whom the letter was addressed, hardly dared to touch it. Indeed there would be no fear that Michel Daens would fail to execute the noble lady's commands with punctuality and utmost speed. The name of don Juan de Vargas was one that would make any...", "...of victory, commanded a splendid palace to be built for the duke, at her own expense, to be called Blenheim. It would fill a large volume to relate all the victories of the Duke of Marlborough, none of which, however, exceeded the Battle of Blenheim in importance. One, some years afterward, called the Battle of Malplaquet, was a better contested fight, and perhaps ranks next; in truth, after this battle, France never again ventured to meet Marlborough in the field. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning of September 11, 1709, the confederated troops (for Eugene, with his army, was still with Marlborough) began to raise their batteries, under cover of a thick fog, which lasted till half-past seven. When it cleared away, the armies found themselves close together, each having a perfect view of the other. Marshal Villars commanded the French army. He was adored by his troops, who placed unbounded confidence in him; and as he now rode along their ranks the air rang...", "...of the night and the wretched condition of the road, I had little hope of saving anything more than the troops, and directed him therefore to destroy all wagons and artillery which he might find blocking up the road and preventing the passage of the men. In this way about 200 wagons and 14 pieces of artillery were lost, many of the wagons being burned and the artillery spiked and otherwise mutilated; the mules and horses were brought away. By 7 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> A. M., of the 11th, we had reorganized at Ripley, and the army presented quite a respectable appearance, and would have been able to accomplish an orderly retreat from that point but for the unfortunate circumstances that the cartridge boxes were well nigh exhausted. At 7 o'clock the column was again put in motion on the Salem road, the cavalry in advance, followed by the infantry. The enemy pressed heavily on the rear, and there was now...", "...their friends in the city, Albert and his sister took passage in a stage coach next morning, and journeyed in a short time as far as the village of ----, and from thence proceeded on to the residence of their father.

We cannot wonder, therefore, at the records of incessant dram-drinking during coach travel which we always find in any minute accounts. An English eye-witness, Captain Basil Hall, thus described the beginning of a trip from Providence to Hartford in October, 1829:-- \"The nominal hour of starting was five in the morning; but as everything in America comes sooner than one expects, a great tall man walked into the room at ten minutes before four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to say it wanted half an hour of five: and presently we heard the rumbling of the stage coming to the door upwards of thirty minutes before the time specified. Fortunately there were only five passengers, so we had plenty of room; and as the morning was fine we might have enjoyed the journey much, had we not been compelled to start so miserably early. At the village of Windham we dined in a cheerful sunny parlour on a neatly dressed repast excellent...", "...part of the county rode hot haste to Jackson to warn him of renewed attempts upon his life. The messenger did not reach him in time. When he found him the bloody work had been accomplished--Marcum was dead. The story of the assassination is horrible and pathetic. As has been said, despite all warnings Marcum had begun to feel safe again and resumed his interrupted law practice. He had business at the court house in connection with the reopening of the contest cases. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Monday morning, May 4th, 1903, he proceeded to the court house with affidavits for filing. From the clerk's office he walked to the front door of the court house, and, facing the street, engaged in conversation with his friend, Capt. B. J. Ewen. The corridors stretching out at his back were full of men. Marcum was leaning on Ewen's shoulder. The two men had been conversing for possibly three minutes, when, at 8.30 A. M., a shot rang out in the rear of the corridor. Marcum...", "...liquor he had drunk had given him a fictitious youth for the time; and it was more in the light of a rough frolic of which he was to be the leader, that he limped along ( always lame from old attacks of rheumatism), chuckling to himself at the apparent stillness of the town, which gave no warning to the press-gang at the Rendezvous of anything in the wind. Daniel, too, had his friends to summon; old hands like himself, but 'deep uns', also, like himself, as he imagined. It was nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when all who were summoned met at the church steps; and by nine o'clock, Monkshaven, in those days, was more quiet and asleep than many a town at present is at midnight. The church and churchyard above them were flooded with silver light, for the moon was high in the heavens: the irregular steps were here and there in pure white clearness, here and there in blackest shadow. But more than half way up to the top, men clustered like bees; all pressing so as to be near enough to...", "...Romans. Finding that his offers were all rejected, Titus spent seven days in the destruction of a large portion of Antonia, and then prepared for a night attack. As the whole army could not make the assault, thirty men were picked from each hundred. Tribunes were appointed over each thousand, Cerealis being chosen to command the whole. Titus himself mounted a watchtower in Antonia, in order that he might see and reward each act of bravery. The assault began between two and three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The Jews were on the watch and, as soon as the massive columns moved forward, the cries of the guards gave the alarm; and the Jews, sleeping in and around the Temple, seized their arms and rushed down to the defence. For a time, the Romans had the advantage. The weight of their close formation enabled them to press forward against the most obstinate resistance and, even in the darkness, there was no fear of mistaking friend for foe; while the Jews, fighting in...", "...you mean?\" cried Beulah, clutching his arm. \"Don't look so savage, child. She will either be convalescent or beyond all aid. I hope and believe the former. Watch her closely till I see you again. Good-night, dear child.\" He stepped to the door, and, with a slight inclination of his head, Dr. Hartwell followed him. It was a vigil Beulah never forgot. The night seemed interminable, as if the car of time were driven backward, and she longed inexpressibly for the dawning of day. Four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> came at last; silence brooded over the town; the western breeze had sung itself to rest, and there was a solemn hush, as though all nature stood still to witness the struggle between dusky Azrael and a human soul. Clara slept. The distant stars looked down encouragingly from their homes of blue, and once more the lonely orphan bent her knee in supplication before the throne of Jehovah. But a cloud seemed hovering between her heart and the presence-chamber of Deity. In vain she...", "...going with General Taylor to Fort Yuma having joined us. We went to Santa Monica, which is the fashionable watering-place of these parts. Here we drove on the beach, which is thirty miles long. A gentleman of Los Angeles was attached to our party and showed us the sights. We saw all kinds of ranches--orange, grape, and bee ranches. Then we drove to a Mexican settlement, where they gave us a gorgeous dinner, really worthy of more time than we could give it, for we had to leave at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> for Los Angeles, where we dined again. The next day we started off on another tour. We drove through twenty-five miles of banana, pineapple, pomegranate groves and vineyards. We tasted all the wines and fruit-syrups, and drank native port and champagne. We had a special train and arrived at Merced the next morning, to start on our Yosemite Valley tour. _May 20th._ Just our luck! The first rain for four months pours down to-day. We drove, nevertheless, from 7 A.M. until...", "...without due cause so far as I can note, has a most grating sound upon the ear. In short, I do not care for this young man; freely and frankly I confess it here. I had meant to stay on until he had betaken himself away, being minded to have a few words in private with Miss Hamm touching upon Miss Primleigh's peculiar and inexplicable attitude toward us, but since he persisted in remaining on and on, I, having a proper regard for the proprieties, was constrained shortly after eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to depart. As I was upon the point of going, he halted me, saying in effect: \"Doctor, you're a college professor--I want to ask you a scientific question and see if you can give me a scientific answer.\" \"Pray proceed,\" I said, smiling gently in Miss Hamm's direction. \"Why,\" he said, \"is a mouse that spins?\" He then paused as though awaiting my reply, and when I confessed myself unable to hazard an answer, or even to understand so peculiar a problem, with a great...", "...for some task or of not knowing how to do any intricate, unheard-of thing which suddenly it occurred to her must be done. When a servant would plead her case Beatrice always told her that for days at a time she left her alone in her beautiful home with nothing to do but keep it clean and eat up all her food and very likely give parties and use her talking machine and piano--which was quite true--and that she must consider this when she was asked to stay on duty until three or four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning or be up at five o'clock with an elaborate breakfast for Beatrice and her friends just returning from a fancy-dress ball. On a sunny day she often sent the maids driving in her car, and if a blizzard came up she was certain to ask them to walk downtown to match yarn for her, not even offering car fare. She would borrow small sums and stamps from them and deliberately forget to pay them back, at the same time giving her cook a forty-dollar hat because it made...", "...for you is not likely to last long. At any rate, you might as well mention to those who have known you as a courier, that you intend to establish yourself either in Paris or Berlin. For as you speak both French and German as well as English, that would in any case be the course that a prudent man would adopt, after being mixed up in an affair that ended badly for the brigands. Well, in the first place, you had better go at once to the legation and accept their terms. Come here at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow, and I will give you further instructions.\" Thus it happened that when Frank came home next time from school, he was surprised at having the door opened to him by a grave-looking servant in plain clothes, who said in English, with a very slight foreign accent: \"The Signora Percival is in the drawing-room, sir.

During the dancing the men cover their loins with a wrapping of plantain leaf, which makes them look like women. The women run about all night keeping the coconut shells alight. About five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning the performance comes to an end, and then a number of women sweep out _Elpanam_, collecting the ashes and other rubbish, which are thrown into the sea. The men, with much excitement, take the outriggers from the canoes, and placing some of these under the _Elpanam_ houses, bear others to the village, covering all with palm leaves. All portable property, pots, etc., is taken out of the houses in _Elpanam_, and, closing the doors, the people march away to the...", "...words of Paul: \"It is sown in corruption; it is raised in in corruption; it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.\" They laid the flowers on the fresh earth, even the white roses, and then they drove back to the city. CHAPTER XIV A SATURDAY AFTERNOON I The sight of a certain old gentleman as he walked along the shady side of Twenty-second Street about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on a broiling Saturday afternoon in midsummer was one not easily to be forgotten. A younger man, tall and vigorous, clad in a thin suit of blue serge, walked by his side. They were followed by a shouting troop of small boys who overran the pavements, and some of whom were armed with baseball bats. The big trolley car was hailed by a dozen dirty little hands. Even the grumpy passengers were disarmed. The conductor took Mr. Bentley's bill deprecatingly, as much as to say that...", "...me the first information of the state of affairs in Pittsburgh. Of course I could see a dim light in town, but the extent of what had occurred I didn't understand--I could hardly believe--and I could hardly believe that the large force of well drilled men under General Brinton could not control any mob that might be brought against them. At twelve o'clock and about ten minutes, these troops from Walls station came down to Torrens station. Q. Twelve o'clock Sunday night? A. Twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> noon on Sunday. At that time I knew, from the officers I had sent out after Brinton, that Brinton was not going to come back to Pittsburgh. I had official information from the staff of the Sixth division that the Fourteenth regiment and the Nineteenth had been disbanded by General Brown, and there was no military force in the city of Pittsburgh. I didn't deem that the troops from Walls station were of any assistance to me whatever, at that time. I thought they were a great...", "...mean everything to Joanne. To take her to his cabin would mean---- Inwardly he swore at himself as he hurried back to the station, and his face burned hotly as he thought of the chance such a blunder on his part would have given Quade and Culver Rann to circulate the stories with which they largely played their scoundrelly game. He sent another and longer telegram. This time it was to Blackton. He ate dinner with Stevens, who had his new outfit ready for the mountains. It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before he brought Joanne up to the station. She was dressed now as he had first seen her when she entered Quade's place. A veil covered her face. Through the gray film of it he caught the soft warm glow of her eyes and the shimmer of gold-brown tendrils of her hair. And he knew why she wore that veil. It set his heart beating swiftly--the fact that she was trying to hide from all eyes but his own a beauty so pure and wonderful that it made her uncomfortable when under the...", "...was entered lately by a man named Harper, acting under the authority of the state, and a large amount of money was taken out.

I wouldn't marry you if Rosewater stood on its head.\" \"I was rather brutal about it, and I must honestly confess that I'm not...", "...Litwiler's and mess left us to-day, being anxious to get along. We shall probably overtake them at St. Laring, which is about ninety miles from this place. The weather is pleasant and warm with a fair chance for grass. Fuller and J. Ingalls undertook to go to Court House Rock this afternoon, which looks to be but a few miles from us, but after traveling about twelve miles they thought it looked quite as far as when they started, and they turned back; they got into the camp about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night. 3d. Drove twenty-five miles, and passed the Chimney Rock. We camped about two miles back from the river on the bottom, and about four miles from a large bluff resembling the fortification which we named Fort Whitey, from its white appearance. Several of the boys went out on a wild goose chase to the bluffs for wood, there being a few straggling cedars in sight which appeared to be not over two miles distant; they started about four P.M. and got back at ten o'clock...", "...new one for the occasion. On asking Mrs. McClean who her dress-maker was, that lady promptly informed her, \"Lizzie Keckley.\" \"Lizzie Keckley? The name is familiar to me. She used to work for some of my lady friends in St. Louis, and they spoke well of her. Can you recommend her to me?\" \"With confidence. Shall I send her to you?\" \"If you please. I shall feel under many obligations for your kindness.\" The next Sunday Mrs. McClean sent me a message to call at her house at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> P.M., that day. As she did not state why I was to call, I determined to wait till Monday morning. Monday morning came, and nine o'clock found me at Mrs. McC.'s house. The streets of the capital were thronged with people, for this was Inauguration day.

Never...", "...hardly resembles the work of men, it is more like a piling up of rocks, and I cannot attempt to describe what we saw so imperfectly, but must say that, high as my expectations had been raised, the city of Edinburgh far surpassed all expectation. Gladly would we have stayed another day, but could not afford more time, and our notions of the weather of Scotland were so dismal, notwithstanding we ourselves had been so much favoured, that we had no hope of its mending. So at about six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening we departed, intending to sleep at an inn in the village of Roslin, about five miles from Edinburgh. The rain continued till we were almost at Roslin; but then it was quite dark, so we did not see the Castle that night. * * * * * _Saturday_, _September_ 17_th_.--The morning very fine. We rose early and walked through the glen of Roslin, past Hawthornden, and considerably further, to the house of Mr. Walter Scott at...", "...to his interests. Phil, who was generally more successful than Giacomo, often made up his smaller comrade's deficiencies by giving him a portion of his own gains. It was a raw day. Only those who felt absolutely obliged to be out were to be seen in the streets; but among these were our two little fiddlers. Whatever might be the weather, they were compelled to expose themselves to its severity. However the boys might suffer, they must bring home the usual amount. But at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the prospects seemed rather discouraging. They had but twenty-five cents between them, nor would anyone stop to listen to their playing. \"I wish it were night, Filippo,\" said Giacomo, shivering with cold. \"So do I, Giacomo. Are you very cold?\" \"Yes,\" said the little boy, his teeth chattering. \"I wish I were back in Italy. It is never so cold there.\" \"No, Giacomo; you are right. But I would not mind the cold so much, if I had a warm overcoat like that boy,\" pointing out...", "...in his turn, and the battle of Malplaquet ends in a furious mix-up of mounted men, which gradually separated into two undefeated lines, each retiring from the contest. It will be wondered why a conclusion so curiously impotent was permitted to close the fighting of so famous a field. The answer to this query is that the effort upon either side had passed the limits beyond which men are physically incapable of further action. Any attempt of the French to advance in force after two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> would have led to their certain disaster, for the allies were now in possession of their long line of earthworks.[14] On the other hand, the allies could not advance, because the men upon whom they could still count for action were reduced to insufficient numbers. Something like one-third of their vast host had fallen in this most murderous of battles; from an eighth to a sixth were dead. Of the remainder, the great proportion suffered at this hour from an exhaustion that...", "...capital of the Channel smuggling trade, where he became the local agent of his brothers. But events moved rapidly in France under the Revolution. During the Terror, with many other English, he was arrested and remained under detention for over two years. With the fall of Robespierre he and his other English fellow-prisoners were set at liberty. This smuggling Ulysses brought his wanderings to an end on the 22nd August, 1795. He disembarked on that day at Falmouth, he tells us, \"at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, where I met my dear little Bessie, then between eight and nine years old.\" The following day happened to be Sunday, and he at an early hour set out for his native place, reaching Breage a little before eleven o'clock, and meeting his brother Frank on his way to church. Harry Carter settled at Rinsey, became a farmer, and continued to reside there until the day of his death in April, 1829. John Carter, known as \"The King of Prussia,\" plays a much larger...", "...same as it was on the eve of the declaration of war. At Goito, at Monzambano, and in the other villages of the extreme frontier, the Italian authorities are still discharging their duties. Nothing is changed in those places, were we to except that now and then an Austrian cavalry party suddenly makes its appearance, with the only object of watching the movements of the Italian army. One of these parties, formed by four squadrons of the Wurtemberg hussar regiment, having advanced at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning on the right bank of the Mincio, met the fourth squadron of the Italian lancers of Foggia and were beaten back, and compelled to retire in disorder towards Goito and Rivolta. In this unequal encounter the Italian lancers distinguished themselves very much, made some Austrian hussars prisoners, and killed a few more, amongst whom was an officer. The same state of thing, prevails at Rivottella, a small village on the shores of the Lake of Garda, about four miles...", "...at practice,\" said the coach. \"But I'll insist that all fellows who do make arrangements to take in the show, make a point of getting back by their accustomed hour.\" \"Okay!\" accepted Phil. \"We'll tackle Speed on the proposition after practice ... tell him we've just learned of the football program ... and that we're leaving in time to catch the seven o'clock show. Wouldn't he like to go along?\" \"That's right,\" Coach Brock approved. \"You can explain to Speed that the seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> show will be over around nine o'clock which gives you a whole hour to drive the twenty miles back.

You are doing this, remember, for the team!\" Phil and Milt stiffened with a sense of their responsibility. \"You...", "...were finishing dinner, three shots rang out in the silence. They were a signal. Instantly brisk firing broke out from the nullahs on the face of the square occupied by the Guides Infantry. Bullets whistled all about the camp, ripping through the tents and killing and wounding the animals. The Guides returned the fire with steadiness, and, as the shelter trench they had dug in front of their section of the line was higher than at other parts, no officers or men were hit. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a bugler among the enemy sounded the \"Retire,\" and the fire dwindled to a few dropping shots. All were congratulating themselves on a termination of the event, when at 10.30 the attack was renewed with vigour on the opposite side of the camp, occupied by the 38th Dogras. The enemy, who were largely armed with Martini-Henry rifles, crept up to within 100 yards of the trenches. These were only about eighteen inches high, but afforded sufficient cover to the soldiers. The...", "...find in any of the evangelists a passage where this resurrection is foretold in so public and decided a manner. Matthew himself relates only the answer of Jesus to those who demanded a sign; it consisted, as we have elsewhere remarked, in referring them to \"Jonas, who was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so,\" said he, \"shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" Now Jesus, having died on Friday, at the ninth hour, or three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, and risen again the second day early in the morning, was not \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" Besides, the obscure manner in which Jesus expressed himself in this pretended prediction, could not enable the priests and pharisees to conclude that he must die and rise again, or excite their alarm; unless it is pretended, that on this occasion these enemies of Jesus received the interpretation of the mysterious prediction by a particular...", "...Uncle Bernard, shall we go to the drawing-room now? The children use this room to prepare their lessons. We will have coffee in the drawing-room!\" cried Mrs Connor eagerly. And the elders filed across the hall, leaving poor Betty reduced to tears of misery, while the boys comforted her by jibes and jeers in true schoolboy fashion. In the drawing-room a ghastly silence prevailed, broken by fitful efforts of conversation. Mr Farrell had asked that a cab should be ordered by nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to take him back to his hotel; but, though the time drew nearer and nearer, he still vouchsafed no explanation of the unexpected visit. Surely--surely, before going away he would say something, and not once more disappear into the mist, and let the veil of silence fall around him? The same thought was in every mind, the same wondering anticipation; but it was only when the cab was announced and Mr Farrell rose to say good-bye that he appeased their curiosity. \"I came here...", "...the last few days had been devoted--to mark the gradual but certain progression of civilization and christianity--and to breathe forth, unwitnessed and uninterrupted, the scarce coherent words of thankful adoration for the providential care which had hitherto sustained and directed us.

We reached Tortoise Reach by 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> A.M. where we passed the day. During our morning's walk I again had the luck to knock over a kangaroo.

It is worthy of remark that most of those I killed were does, with young ones of different ages, which afforded Mr. Bynoe the means of making some interesting observations on the manner in which they are brought forth, which will be found further on in the part of the work relating to Houtman's Abrolhos, where more...", "...mess of fish from anybody.\" \"You shut up!\" roared the big boy. And then he started to row away. \"You'll not get a chance to rob us of these berries,\" called out Jack after him. \"What do they mean about robbing somebody of fish?\" asked one of Bob's companions. \"Oh, that was only a joke,\" answered the rich youth. \"Just wait--I'll fix them for it!\" As soon as Bangs and his cronies had disappeared Randy and Jack went back to their berry picking. They worked steadily until five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, and by that time had a great number of quarts to their credit. \"The folks at home will be pleased,\" said Jack. \"My mother loves fresh berries. She says they are much better than those which are several days in the market.\" \"And she is right.\" The boys had brought along several large and small kettles, and had left three of these down near the boat, filled with the fruit. Each walked to the shore with a kettle full of berries in his hand. \"Well, I...", "...Francisco. The man was promptly released, and two hours afterwards Major Abaza sailed on the _Saghalin_ for Okhotsk, leaving us to do the best we could with our half-wrecked stranded ship and her mutinous crew. The cargo of the bark was still only half discharged, and we continued for the next five days to unload in boats, but it was hard, discouraging work, as there were only six hours in the twenty-four during which boats could reach the ship, and those six hours were from eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> P.M. to five in the morning. At all other times the ship lay on her beam-ends, and the water around her was too shallow to float even a plank. To add, if possible, to our difficulties and to our anxiety, the weather became suddenly colder, the thermometer fell to zero, masses of floating ice came in with every tide and tore off great sheets of the vessel's copper as they drifted past, and the river soon became so choked up with icy fragments that we were obliged to haul the...", "...Indian camp. Caleb gave each of them a few matches and this parting word: \"I'll stay here till you come back. I'll keep up a fire, and toward sundown I'll make a smoke with rotten wood and grass so you kin find your way back.

As they were going Blackhawk called to the others, \"First to carry out his job wins a _grand coup_!\" \"Let the three leaders stake their scalps,\" said the Woodpecker. \"All right. First winner home gets a scalp from each of the others and saves his own.\" \"Say, boys, you better take along; your hull outfit, some grub an' your blankets,\" was the Medicine Man's last suggestion. \"You may have to stay out all night.\" Yan would rather have had Sam...", "...buzz and bur-r-r, and then lay still and shining opposite the middle bench.

Warned by Jim Hulker that the rector had taken Hoover to the Clarendon, Briggs scouted miserably down the avenue on their trail, filled with no one knew what nervous apprehension of trouble to come, and, dodging in at the office a moment later, ascertained from a bell boy that they had gone into a parlor on the second floor. Briggs knew what that meant. The Doctor was cross-questioning his sullen...", "...and screamed for the remainder of the passage. Mr. Hardy was observed, some hours afterwards, in an attitude which induced his friends to suppose that he was busily engaged in contemplating the beauties of the deep; they only regretted that his taste for the picturesque should lead him to remain so long in a position, very injurious at all times, but especially so, to an individual labouring under a tendency of blood to the head. The party arrived off the Custom-house at about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the Thursday morning dispirited and worn out. The Tauntons were too ill to quarrel with the Briggses, and the Briggses were too wretched to annoy the Tauntons. One of the guitar-cases was lost on its passage to a hackney-coach, and Mrs. Briggs has not scrupled to state that the Tauntons bribed a porter to throw it down an area.

Certainly to be put to bed awake and smiling at seven o'clock, and thereupon to go to sleep, and sleep soundly, till seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next morning, shows an amount of virtue in a baby which is unhappily rare, though captious readers may attribute it rather to good health and digestion, which may also be credited, perhaps, with much virtue in older people.

In fact, aside from a poor widow and a royal orphan who wept in the corner of the Louvre, no one appeared to be aware that Charles I. had ever lived and that he had perished on the scaffold. The two friends made an appointment for ten o'clock on the following day; for though the night was well advanced when they reached the door of the hotel, Aramis said that he had certain important visits to make and left Athos to enter alone. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next day they met again. Athos had been out since six o'clock. \"Well, have you any news?\" Athos asked. \"Nothing. No one has seen D'Artagnan and Porthos has not appeared.

At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I had my third instalment of Christmas fare, consisting of another eight ounces of bread and three quarters of a pint of tea. The last mouthfuls were consumed to the accompaniment of church bells.

The true believers were wending their way to God's house, and the heretic, who had dared to deride their creed and denounce their hypocrisy, was...", "...at eight. A league baseball game followed after lunch and with a morning and an afternoon so crammed with pleasure Paul would have felt amply repaid for the trip had no evening's entertainment followed. The evening, however, turned out to be the best part of the day; at least, when Paul tumbled into bed that night, wearied out by his many good times, he asserted that the crowning event of his holiday had given him more interesting things to think about. It was not until nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Saturday evening that they could go to the newspaper office. \"Before that hour,\" explained Mr. Wright, \"there will be very little for us to see.

When the first hour of morning came the storm was still going on. We were all pretty much tired out by that time, but there was no such thing as trying to sleep. The waves still were batting us around and we didn't know whether we were one mile or a thousand miles from shore. At 2 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning all the queer goings on stopped just the way they began--all of a sudden. We lay to until daylight; then we took our reckonings and started off again. We were about 700 miles off Cape Henlopen. \"No, sir; you couldn't get me through a thing like that again for $10,000.

It was late when he went to sleep himself, happier than he had dreamed he could be. He awoke once in the night to replenish the fire, but he was sleeping soundly at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning when the door of the car opened and half a dozen men filed in. They had not made any noise. Even the big snow-plough tearing open the way from Kiowa had not disturbed the four sleepers. The first man in was the conductor.

They resented his attempts to interest himself in their doings outside classes.

There was much talk, the subjects ranging from the value of the \"spitball\" in pitching to the influence of Bible study on literary style. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> ginger ale and cookies--the latter especially made by a woman in the town and transferred each Friday from her house to the school in a laundry box by Mr. Matthews--were served. Perhaps some of the guests were present more on account of the ginger ale and molasses cookies than for any other reason, for the cookies had long since gained a wide fame, but none questioned their motives.

All evening the chaplain had been with him, offering the solace of divine mercy and forgiveness; but though he was grateful for the good man's ministrations, Durwent felt that he wanted to be alone. He hardly knew why; but there were many things to think of, things which would be remembered more easily if he were by himself. Towards eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he made the request of the chaplain, who left him, promising to return shortly after midnight; and, with his hands clasped behind his back, Dick walked slowly up and down the hut. His mind journeyed to Roselawn--and Elise. At least--and at the thought he struck his hands together with joy--she would never know. She would think he had died in China. For several minutes he walked without his thoughts taking any other form than that, but gradually the realisation of his...", "...was not to be disturbed, that the house was to be kept quiet. Strange, she thought, that he could sleep like an exhausted child, while she, awake, was a mass of pain. Her heart ached, her eyes burned, her very body felt sore. She arranged for his sleep, but she wanted him to wake up; she begrudged every moment of his absence. Alas! she thought, how long would she continue to do so? Yet with her suffering came a wonderful ease, an ability to deal with the details of life. When at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> her maid came in and, pulling the curtains, exclaimed with Gallic candor, \"Oh, comme madame a mauvaise mine ce matin!\" she smiled at her with unusual gentleness. Later, when Mathilde came down at her accustomed hour, and lying across the foot of her mother's bed, began to read her scraps of the morning paper, Adelaide felt a rush of tenderness for the child, who was so unaware of the hideous bargain life really was. Surprising as it was, she found she could talk more easily...", "...thought of the great affliction of the Siegwart family--Angela in tears, and the father broken down with grief. It drove him from Frankenhoehe. In a quarter of an hour he was at the house of the proprietor. A servant came weeping to meet him. \"You cannot speak to my master,\" said she. \"We had a bad night. My master is almost out of his mind; he has only just now lain down. Poor Eliza! the dear, good child.\" And the tears burst forth again. \"When did the child die?\" \"At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning; and how beautiful she still looks in death! You would think she is only sleeping. If you wish to see her, just go up to the same room in which you were yesterday.\" After some hesitation, Frank ascended the stairs and entered the room. As he passed the threshold, he paused, greatly surprised at the sight that met his view. The room was darkened, the shutters closed, and across the room streamed the broken rays of the morning sun. On a white-covered table burned...", "...they had seen a short time before. He came straight to where the Americans sat smoking and, bowing low, held before them an envelope. The address was \"Grenfall Lorry Esq.,\" but the man was in doubt as to which was he. Lorry grasped the envelope, tore it open, and drew forth a daintily written note. It read: \"My Dear Mr. Lorry: \"I was very much surprised to see you this morning--I may add that I was delighted.

LUCKY VALLEY. November 13. Our walk this morning fully realized all my expectations of the preceding evening, for by 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> A.M. we reached the dining place of the second day. To record the satisfaction we felt in escaping a second journey over Thirsty Flat, by following the valley we had seen yesterday evening, we named it Lucky Valley. After a brief halt, we pushed on, and by eleven, were at our old quarters in Mussel Bend. We heard the voices of natives in all directions, far and near, and as I found the party still astonishingly fresh, and eager to proceed, I thought it best to keep going. We...", "...very much then. She was tired and dazed, and had nothing to live for, and was powerless to think and plan for herself: she was ready to go wherever she was bidden, and ask no questions and make no trouble. So she went and sat down in a dark corner, without making any reply. With eyes closed and her tired head resting against the wall, she remained for half an hour in that impassive state, saying no word in answer to Mrs. Clark's occasional remarks, as she moved about preparing the six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> meal.

When work began, men began to wear clothes; thus progress commenced. Industry and happiness go hand in hand. Men who feel that they are doomed to daily toil, and that there is no so-called emancipation from the daily routine, imagine that happiness would be theirs if they did not have to work. The man whose employment compels him to get up at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning imagines if he could just get out of that slavery he would ask for no greater happiness. But if he ever does reach that condition he will find out what true misery is. Some years ago the warden of the Iowa penitentiary told me that he had a prisoner serving a long term, who begged a day off. He wanted to stop the regular routine. He wanted to be set free in the courtyard for one day. He wanted to look straight up at the sky, and to breathe the air of the...", "...thought more of me than that. \"If I did not reason as I do in regard to this gravel,\" he went on, \"I should have to assume a balloon!--My dear fellow, the science of the aerostation of dirigible balloons is not yet developed enough for me to consider it and suppose that a murderer would drop from the clouds!

The fact of the presence of the chambermaid--who had come to clean up The Yellow Room--in the laboratory, when Monsieur Stangerson and his daughter returned from their walk, at half-past one, permits us to affirm that at half-past one the murderer was not in the chamber under the bed, unless he was in collusion with the chambermaid. What do you say, Monsieur Darzac?\" Monsieur Darzac shook his head and said he was sure of the...", "...There is a charge for your shield today!_\" and with this cheerful exhortation I rose. After breakfast, I called Kitty, and she helped me to pack the trunk that was to go with me, wherever my destiny led. Kitty thought Kendal was its limit, and she made a remark about the quantity of the children's clothing, and the small number and plainness of my own gowns. I made no explanation, but said, \"Now, Kitty, look after your own things. You must be ready to leave the house with me by ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> tomorrow morning. After my train has left, you can then take the carriage direct to the Greenock Station for your own journey.\" There was very little more for me to do, and the day threatened to be sixty hours long.

It was to be a kind of farewell walk over the well known pavements and I thought if I saw a pretty brooch or bracelet made of Scotch...", "...own devices in the cold, while Sir Philip was sure to run into a discussion with the shepherd over the turnips, which were too much of a novelty to be approved by the Hampshire mind.

Night came on, but the pursuit was still continued, though the dangers of a dark and tempestuous night were increased by the vicinity of the shoals of St. Lucar. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the headmost ships began to engage. Early in the action the Spanish ship _St. Domingo_, of seventy guns and seven hundred men, blew up, and all on board perished; the English ship opposed to her nearly suffering the same fate.

I was quite cured of my misadventure with the horrible widow, and I found that if love's pleasures are fleeting so are its pains. I will go farther and maintain that the pleasures are of much longer duration, as they leave memories which can be enjoyed in old age, whereas, if a man does happen to remember the pains, it is so slightly as to have no influence upon his happiness. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the Mayor of Thun was announced. He was dressed in the French fashion, in black, and had a manner at once graceful and polite that pleased me. He was middle-aged, and enjoyed a considerable position in the Government. He insisted on my reading the letter that M. de Chavigni had written to him on my account. It was so flattering that I told him that if it had not been sealed I should not have had the face to deliver it. He asked me for the next day to a supper composed of men...", "...a purse containing a hundred louis, and a suit of emeralds worth a similar sum.

He ran up to me with outstretched arms, congratulating me upon my success, and putting at the same time several questions, to which, either from mere womanly caprice, or presuming upon my recent elevation to the character of prime favorite, I refused to reply. My folly drew down on me his severe anger, and...", "...and thinking they should soon be among rocks or coral-reefs had stopped; a dreadful uproar then arose, and everyone on the ship shouted different directions for steering. My husband desired them to steer north that we might find land, as none of them had any idea of our longitude.

I ordered the bulkhead be cut open, to give passage to the water that it might drain out of the room; and withal ordered to clear away abaft the bulkhead, that we might bail: so now we had both pumps going and as many bailing as could; and by this means the water began to decrease; which gave me some hope of saving the ship. I asked the carpenter's mate what he thought of it; he said \"Fear not; for by 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night I'll engage to stop the leak.\" I went from him with a heavy heart; but, putting a good countenance upon the matter, encouraged my men, who pumped and bailed very briskly; and when I saw occasion I gave them some drams to comfort them. About 11 o'clock at night the boatswain came to me and told me that the leak still increased; and that the plank was so rotten it broke away like dirt; and that now it was impossible to save the ship; for they could not come at the leak...", "...he thought. \"If he wants me to speak to him, he'll have to say so.

He warned them against rowdyism, told them they must be back promptly at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and said he hoped they'd have a good time! After which, much surprised and not a little embarrassed, the committee backed out of the room and returned joyfully to spread the tidings. A second committee, headed by Saunders, had already been appointed to arrange for the banquet in case permission was secured and by Tuesday everything was complete.

At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the order was given to fall back, which was done in order, the men disputing every inch of the ground; we had but four pieces of artillery, and that without ammunition. The enemy poured grape and cannister into our retreating columns, mowing down the men like grass. More than one-half of the division were killed and wounded; several hid in the woods and were captured next day.

Since then the only incident in his life was when he moved, in 1868, because his landlord had tried to raise his rent. Every day his alarm clock, with a frightful noise of rattling chains, made him spring out of bed at 6 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> precisely. Twice, however, this piece of mechanism had been out of order--once in 1866 and again in 1874; he had never been able to find out the reason why. He would dress, make his bed, sweep his room, dust his chair and the top of his bureau. All this took him an hour and a half. Then he would go out, buy a roll at the Lahure Bakery, in which he had seen eleven different owners without the name ever changing, and he would eat this roll on the way to the office.

Soon the two friends rang for bed-candles. Robinson staggered with drowsiness. Meadows eyed them from behind a newspaper. Half an hour later Mr. Meadows went to bed, too--but not to sleep.

To his great surprise the servant told him master had not slept at home. While he was talking to her Meadows galloped up to the door, jumped off, and almost pulled Crawley upstairs with him. \"Lock the door, Crawley.\" Crawley obeyed, but with some reluctance, for Meadows, the iron Meadows, was ghastly and shaken as he had never been shaken before. He sank into a chair. \"Perdition seize the hour I first saw her!\" As for...", "...go to half allowance of provisions until it should be known what quantity could be saved from the wreck; also, that three locks should be put on the store-house and barn; one key to be in the possession of Captain Hunter, another in possession of a person to be named by the lieutenant-governor, and the third to be kept by a person to be named by the convicts. These resolutions were agreed to, and signed by the lieutenant-governor and the rest of the officers assembled. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning of the 22d, all persons on the island were assembled near the lower flag-staff, on which the union was hoisted: the marines were drawn up in two lines, leaving a space in the center, at the head of which was the union. The colours of the detachment were then unfurled, and the Sirius's crew were drawn up on the right, and the convicts on the left, the officers being in the center. The proclamation was then read, declaring, that the island was to be governed by...", "...but a swift, covert glance that passed between them did not escape Ned's attention. During the remainder of the day he remembered it more than once. When dinner was over they all went down to the rocks, and Batters and Joe proudly displayed their skill at fishing. In two hours they caught fifteen large bass. For bait they used crabs and lizards, which they had brought from the mountains. In the evening Randy entertained the country lads with a mouth organ performance, and at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the visitors went to their camp on the other side of the brook. It had been a long day, and the Jolly Rovers were glad to get to bed. They were too drowsy to think about the possibility of another visit from the mysterious boat, and in a very few minutes all were sound asleep.

His father never allowed him to sleep under more than two blankets, and locked the front door at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in summer and six in winter. The supreme merit of this system in insuring the survival of the fittest was seen in its results. Heriot's elder brother passed away at the age of two in the course of a severe winter.

It was not until another hour had passed that Rupert began to lose his keen, high spirits. He was so used to war in the open, to the instant summons and the quick answer, that he could not gauge the trouble of York's garrison, the slowness of men and horses who had gone through months of wearisome inaction. It is not good for horse or man to be stabled overlong out of reach of the free pastures and the gallop. About half after three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> some of his company brought in to Rupert a big, country-looking fellow, and explained that they had captured him spying a little too close to the Royalist lines. \"What mun we do to him?\" asked the spokesman of the party, in good Wharfedale speech. \"We've hammered his head, and ducked him i' th' horse-pond, and naught seems to serve.

It was a May morning in Glenville. Pretty, picturesque Glenville, low lying by the lake shore, with the waters of the lake surging to meet it, or coyly receding from it, on the one side, and the green-clad hills rising gradually and gently on the other, ending in a belt of trees at the very horizon's edge.

The Glenville school-house was one of the earliest public buildings erected in the village, and it had been \"located\" in what was confidently...", "...Griffin relieved Major-General Warren in command of the 5th corps. The report of this reached me after nightfall. Some apprehensions filled my mind lest the enemy might desert his lines during the night, and by falling upon General Sheridan before assistance could reach him, drive him from his position and open the way for retreat. To guard against this, General Miles's division of Humphreys's corps was sent to reinforce him, and a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning (April 2), when an assault was ordered on the enemy's lines. General Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps, sweeping everything before him, and to his left towards Hatcher's Run, capturing many guns and several thousand prisoners. He was closely followed by two divisions of General Ord's command, until he met the other division of General Ord's that had succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines near Hatcher's Run. Generals Wright and Ord immediately...", "...for what is to come.\" And so, clearing their brows, they went into the house and listened to the music, and joined in the talk until ten o'clock struck and every one got up to go, and so ended the last happy evening at Sandynugghur.

About half a dozen entered the cosy little parlour, and there they remained for a couple of hours. While sitting in that cosy little parlour they really did enjoy themselves. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they had a bit of the raw beef broiled, and in that guise it was pleasant enough; and the water was hot, and the tobacco was grateful and the stiffness of the evening was gone. The men chatted together and made no more speeches, and they talked of matters which bore a true interest to them. Sharpit explained to them how each man might be assisted in his own business if this rich London tailor could be brought in for the borough.

In 1816 a young commercial traveler named Gaudissart, who frequented the Cafe David, sat drinking from eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> till midnight with a half-pay officer. He was so rash as to discuss a conspiracy against the Bourbons, a rather serious plot then on the point of execution. There was no one to be seen in the cafe but Pere Canquoelle, who seemed to be asleep, two waiters who were dozing, and the accountant at the desk. Within four-and-twenty hours Gaudissart was arrested, the plot was discovered. Two men perished on the scaffold. Neither Gaudissart nor any one else ever suspected that worthy...", "...mufflers put on, pipes lighted, and they then went up upon deck.

The word was quietly passed around, however, that for those who wished real work, there was an old \"solitary\" which had been placed, and those who liked might go after him.

But Mr. Goddard was exceptionally fortunate. Something did happen. He was roused at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning by a violent knocking at his door. He looked out of his window and saw Constable Moriarty standing in the street with a bicycle. \"What on earth do you want at this hour?\" said Mr. Goddard.

About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the sun burst through the fog and revealed the mighty panorama in the valley below. Franklin's forty thousand men, reinforced by two divisions of Hooker's grand division, were in front of Jackson's thirty thousand.

The array of dogcarts daily drawn up outside the little station, in punctual awaiting of the five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train, betrayed the business atmosphere.

To our right some great rocks were covered with seals and sea lions, and back of them were hills of yellow sand. A beautiful great mountain rose green to our left, and the water beneath us swirled and eddied in numerous whirlpools made by the tide. Everybody was on deck and close to the rail.

Morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches, and of her footstep on the gravel, then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved, and then also disappeared.

However, I was soon asleep. About three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I was awakened by the stealthy footsteps of two men on the ladder.

Even the most stupid amongst us now began to fear that we had been humbugged. The streets became ever more densely crowded with retreating troops and trains; from all sides they came and wanted to use the main road that was also being used by us, and the consequence was that the road became too congested and that we were continually pushed more...", "...the great dispute whether Besse, whom we both love, should be raised to be chamber-mayde or no.

But, Lord! what a shame, methinks, to me, that, in this condition, and at this age, I should know no...", "...replied: 'You can do as you please, but you will be ill again and will not be able to get up tomorrow.' That was true, sensible and prudent, clear-sighted, I must confess. Nevertheless I could not resist, and I drank my bottle. It all came from that. \"Well, I could not sleep. By Jove! it kept me awake till two o'clock in the morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that I should not have heard the angel sounding his trump at the last judgment. \"In short, my wife woke me at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and I jumped out of bed, hastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and jumped on board Delila. But it was too late, for when I arrived at my hole it was already occupied! Such a thing had never happened to me in three years, and it made me feel as if I were being robbed under my own eyes. I said to myself: 'Confound it all! confound it!' And then my wife began to nag at me. 'Eh! what about your 'Casque a meche'? Get along, you drunkard! Are you satisfied, you great...", "...upon whom Napoleon threw the blame of the defeat at Waterloo, because he strictly fulfilled his orders, by pressing the Prussians at Wavre, unheeding the cannonade on his left, which might have led him to conjecture that the more important contest between the Emperor and Wellington was at that moment raging. It was at six o'clock in the evening of the 16th that the Drake of Wellington received the first information of the advance of the French army; but it was not, however, until ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that positive news reached him that the French army had moved upon the line of the Sambre. This information induced him to push forward reinforcements on Quatre Bras, at which place he himself arrived at an early hour on the 16th, and immediately proceeded to Bry, to devise measures with Marshal Blucher in order to combine their efforts. From the movement of considerable masses of the French in front of the Prussians it was evident that their first grand attack would be...", "...in talking to a companion, some years older than himself, and didn't observe Grant. Grant was by no means prepossessed in favor of this young man, whose red and mottled face, and bold glance made him look far from respectable. \"Do you know those fellows?\" asked Harry Becker. \"The youngest one is from Colebrook.\" \"He is in bad company. I hope he is not an intimate friend of yours?\" \"Far from it. Still, I know him, and am sorry to see him with such a companion.\" At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mr. Reynolds proposed to go home. He beckoned to Grant to accompany him.

When Rhoda and Phoebe, in their deep mourning, entered the parlour, they were startled to find the number of persons already assembled. Not only all the household and outdoor servants, but all the inmates of the Maidens' Lodge, excepting Mrs Marcella, and several others, stood up to receive the young ladies as they passed on to the place reserved for them. Mr Dawson handed the girls to their places, and...", "...me.\" \"The motives of men are intricate and complicated,\" answered Levy, with unusual seriousness. \"It suffices to the wise to profit by the actions, and leave the motives in shade.\" There was silence for some minutes. Then the two drew closer toward each other, and began to discuss details in their joint designs. (TO BE CONTINUED.) [Illustration] OCEAN LIFE. BY JOHN S. C. ABBOTT Sat. Eve, March 20, 1852. Atlantic Ocean. At precisely seven minutes after 12 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-day, the steamer Arctic left New York for Liverpool. Our whole ship's company, passengers and crew, amounted to one hundred and eighty. The day was clear and cold. A strong north wind swept from the snow-clad hills over the rough bay. Icicles were pendent from the paddle-wheels, and the spray was freezing upon the decks. As the majestic steamship left the wharf, the crowd assembled there gave three cheers, and two guns were fired from on board. With the engines in active...", "...to habit as old gentlemen, possess more of its spiritual element, and are warned by dreams, omens, creepings of the flesh, unwonted chills, suicide of china, and other shadowing signs, when a break is to be anticipated, or, has occurred. The landlady of the Aurora tavern was visited by none of these, and with that beautiful trust which habit gives, and which boastful love or vainer earthly qualities would fail in effecting, she ordered that the pint of Madeira should stand from six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening till seven--a small monument of confidence in him who was at one instant the 'poor old dear'; at another, the 'naughty old gad-about'; further, the 'faithless old-good-for-nothing'; and again, the 'blessed pet' of the landlady's parlour, alternately and indiscriminately apostrophized by herself, her sister, and daughter. On the last day of the month a step was heard coming up the long alley which led from the riotous scrambling street to the plentiful cheerful...", "...an opportunity of returning. I have, therefore, seized this occasion of being civil to one of his friends. In the next place, if you will fix a day, when I can meet Mr. Halcomb and his daughters at your house, I will pay you a visit in return with pleasure, although it is a distance of sixty miles. We innkeepers, you know, travel not only expeditiously, but very cheaply. \"Enough,\" said my father. \"Give me your hand, we will chearfully place ourselves at your disposal till four or five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon.\" The business was thus settled, to the great joy of poor Coward, who was almost dumb with fear, lest my father should decline such an opportunity of seeing Windsor and the Royal Family. To Windsor they accordingly went, and were greatly entertained with what they saw, which was every thing that was to be seen about the Castle, as Mr. Botham was well acquainted with the upper servants in attendance there; they also got a seat at the Chapel Royal, very near...", "...behind him a clear red glow indicating the position of the couch-heap: a glow without a flame, increasing and diminishing in brightness as the breeze quickened or fell, like the coal of a newly lighted cigar. If those cottages had been his, he thought, he should not care to have a fire so near them as that--and the wind rising. But the cottages not being his, he went on his way to the station, where he was about to resume duty for the night. The road was now quite deserted: till four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning, when the carters would go by to the stables there was little probability of any human being passing the Three Tranters Inn. By eleven, everybody in the house was asleep. It truly seemed as if the treacherous element knew there had arisen a grand opportunity for devastation. At a quarter past eleven a slight stealthy crackle made itself heard amid the increasing moans of the night wind; the heap glowed brighter still, and burst into a flame; the flame...", "...you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.\" Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in about fifteen minutes, and so he MUST go home--he must go right away. But it didn't do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street he would tear again, and give...", "...for the 'least of these' isn't fit to live. It would be better that a stone be tied about his neck and that he be cast into the midst of the sea. That's what the Good Book says, Johnny, and it's true, almighty true.\" \"Coming up to the central alarm to-night?\" he asked after a moment's silence. Johnny nodded. \"Good.\" \"Going to bring a friend,\" said Johnny, easily. \"Who?\" \"A girl pal.\" \"Girl?\" The chief frowned. \"Wait till you know her,\" grinned Johnny. Eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night found Johnny and Mazie in the place of the central alarm. The Chief was there too and was as much pleased with Johnny's choice of a pal as he might have been had Mazie been his own daughter. As for Mazie, she was thrilled to the tips of her fingers by this place of ticking instruments, clanging gongs and leaping light. \"See those red, white and green spots of light up there?\" said the Chief. \"Well, those are located on the map of the city. They stand for fire...", "...into the sea, were named _Hope's Wharf, Duff's Wharf, Rae's Wharf, &c_.; and these wharves had been fixed on different sides of the rock, so that, whatever wind should blow, there would always be one of them on the lee-side available for the carrying on of the work. _Hope's Wharf_ was connected with _Port Erskine_, a pool about twenty yards long by three or four wide, and communicated with the side of the lighthouse by _Watt's Reach_, a distance of about thirty yards. About eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning the bell rang for breakfast. Such of the men as were not already up began to get out of their berths and hammocks. To Ruby the scene that followed was very amusing. Hitherto all had been calm and sunshine. The work, although severe while they were engaged, had been of short duration, and the greater part of each day had been afterwards spent in light work, or in amusement. The summons to meals had always been a joyful one, and the appetites of the men were...", "...raised her head to bless him; and the impatient Holloway loudly called to him to return to his horses, swearing that he would not give him one farthing for himself if he did not. The anxiety which Holloway felt to escape detection kept him in pain; but Holloway never measured or estimated his pleasures and his pains; therefore he never discovered that, even upon the most selfish calculation, he had paid too dear for the pleasure of sitting upon a coach-box for one hour. It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning before the chaise arrived in town, when he was set down at the house at which the stage-coach put up, walked home, got in at his bedchamber window--his bedchamber was upon the ground-floor. Mr. Supine was fast asleep, and his pupil triumphed in his successful _frolic_. Whilst Holloway, in his dreams, was driving again, and again overturning stage-coaches, young Howard, in his less manly dreams, saw Dr. B., the head master of Westminster school, advancing towards...", "...purchased the necessary provisions, especially Gamble's preserved meats, which keep fresh for a year, I went on the 4th of May, at 4 P. M. on board the steam ship, Sir Francis Drake, to go to Plymouth, distant one hundred and fifty miles. The engine is of seventy horse-power. The ship was not very comfortably arranged; the main cabin was so near the boiler that the heat was intolerable. Our passengers amounted to thirty persons, only eight of whom were cabin passengers. About five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a gun was fired as a signal for sailing, and we stood out to sea. Spithead road with the shipping lay to the left, and our course was between the land and the Isle of Wight. Cowes with its beautiful gardens presented an agreeable sight, about a mile to the westward of which stands a castle called Egypt. It began to grow dark. We saw on the right hand the extremely bright lights of _Hurst-castle_, and on the left the light-house of the Needles, on the western extremity of the...", "...wall as he tumbled into the corner. And so there they lay, all three. Then the old gentleman spun himself round with velocity in the opposite direction; continued to spin until his long cloak was all wound neatly about him; clapped his cap on his head, very much on one side (for it could not stand upright without going through the ceiling), gave an additional twist to his corkscrew moustaches, and replied with perfect coolness: \"Gentlemen, I wish you a very good morning. At twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-night I'll call again; after such a refusal of hospitality as I have just experienced, you will not be surprised if that visit is the last I ever pay you.\" \"If ever I catch you here again,\" muttered Schwartz, coming, half frightened, out of the corner--but, before he could finish his sentence, the old gentleman had shut the house door behind him with a great bang: and there drove past the window, at the same instant, a wreath of ragged cloud, that whirled and rolled away...", "...great men would not spend their days in catching little fishes--am I not right, batuchka?\" \"A thousand times right,\" said the other, his grandeur growing, \"but instead of catching little fishes, what do you say of a man who can let loose a large fish--an iron fish--a fish that can speak with a loud noise and make the whole world tremble--!\" Paul quickly raised his finger to his lips. \"Let's go outside,\" he said. \"Some one may hear us here...\" CHAPTER XXXV At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mary had gone to Helen's. \"If I'm not back at ten, I sha'n't be home tonight,\" she had told Hutchins as she left the house. At half past eight Archey called, full of the topic which had been started that afternoon. Hutchins told him what Mary had said. \"All right,\" he said. \"I'll wait.\" He left his car under the porte cochere, and went upstairs to chat with Miss Cordelia and Miss Patty. At twenty to ten, Hutchins was looking through the hall window up the drive when he...", "...occasion to give to Prince Trautmannsdorf for you the assurance that my thoughts are always with you. God has endowed me with strength to endure the cruel emotion which this separation from all my family calls forth. In Him I confide. He will sustain me and give me courage to fulfil my mission. My consolation shall be the thought that the sacrifice is in your behalf. I reached Ried very late, and I was much distressed by the thought that I was departing from you perhaps forever. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I arrived at the French camp at Braunau. I stopped a few minutes in the Austrian pavilion, and there I had to listen to the reading of the documents about the limits of the neutral zone, in which a throne had been set. All my people then came up to kiss my hand, and I could hardly control myself. I shuddered, and I was so much moved that the Prince of Neufch\u00e2tel had tears in his eyes. Prince Trautmannsdorf delivered me to him, and my household was presented. Heavens, what a...", "...and the warden of the prison. Even at this hour the news had spread throughout the city and idlers were gathering to see the rich and beautiful woman who would ascend the scaffold. I still clung to the slender hope that Gabriela and Blanca were not the same person. But when I went toward the prison I staggered like a drunken man and was compelled to lean upon the shoulder of one of the officials, who asked me anxiously if I were ill. VI We arrived at the prison at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The large reception room was brilliantly lighted. The guard, holding a black box in which was the skull of Senor Romeral, was awaiting us. The judge took his seat at the head of the long table; the prosecuting attorney sat on his right, and the chief of police stood by with his arms folded. I and the secretary sat on the left of the judge. A number of police officers and detectives were standing near the door. The judge touched his bell and said to the...", "...help being sorry for the dogs always, though perhaps there's no need. But they may well have more in them than they know how to make us understand, for we can't say half what we feel, with all our words.\" Seth came down now, and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah; he wanted Adam to know how much better she was than all other women. But after a few words of greeting, Adam drew him into the workshop to consult about the coffin, and Dinah went on with her cleaning. By six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as clean as she could have made it herself. The window and door were open, and the morning air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood, thyme, and sweet-briar from the patch of garden by the side of the cottage. Dinah did not sit down at first, but moved about, serving the others with the warm porridge and the toasted oat-cake, which she had got ready in the usual way, for she had asked Seth to tell her just what his...", "...hours later, he flinched when pressure was made in the right axilla. Lymphatic enlargement was now made out, and by the evening of the seventh day the bubo in the axilla had increased markedly in size, the swelling approximating 3 by 7 centimetres. Glands now became palpable in other portions of the body, particularly in the cervical region, and a few hours later there were inguinal and femoral buboes. The patient became rapidly worse, and died at 7 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of the eighth day of his illness. At the necropsy, the glands of the right axilla and those of the right side of the neck were found enlarged; the other lymphatic glands were also enlarged, but to a lesser degree. There was consolidation of the lower lobe of the right lung, and the spleen was about twice its normal size. In brief, the necropsy findings of a typical case of septicaemic plague were present. Smears from the spleen...", "...The Democrats in the Senate, led by Mr. Gorman, the most skilful of their leaders, endeavored to defeat the bill by the tactics of delay. If the debate could be prolonged so that it was impossible to get a vote without the loss of the great Appropriations Bills, or some of them, the bill, of course, must be laid aside. So the Republicans, on the other hand, as is usual in such cases, refrained from debate, leaving their antagonists to take up the time. Every afternoon at about five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> some Democrat would come to me saying that he was to take the floor, but that he did not feel well, or was not quite ready with some material, and ask me as a personal favor to let the matter go over until the next morning. This happened so often that I became satisfied it was a concerted scheme, and made up my mind that I would not yield to such a request again. But one afternoon Senator Wilson of Maryland, a quiet and most estimable gentleman, whom I had known very well,...", "...might be. Under the able tuition of her husband, she talked French fluently now. Madame Carimon's habitation--very nice, small and compact--was in the Rue Pomme Cuite. The streets have queer names in some of these old French towns. It was near the college, which was convenient for Monsieur Carimon. Here they lived, with their elderly servant, Pauline. The same routine went on daily in the steady little domicile from year's end to year's end. \"Jules goes to the college at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> every week-day, after a cup of coffee and a petit pain,\" said madame to her guests, \"and he returns at five to dinner. He takes his dejeuner in the college at twelve, and I take mine alone at home. On Sundays he has no duty: we attend the French Protestant Church in a morning, dine at one o'clock, and go for a walk in the afternoon.\" \"You have no children, Mary?\" Mary Carimon's lively face turned sad as she answered: \"There was one little one; she stayed with us six...", "...with us several miles, to point out a place suitable for fording the Arkansa, and to give us any other information or assistance in their power to communicate. Being made to understand that it was the design of some of the party to visit the sources of Red river, he pretended to give us information and advice upon that subject; also to direct us to a place where we might find a mass of rock salt, which he described as existing on one of the upper branches of Red river. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we arrived at the ford, where we halted to make a distribution of the baggage and other preparations requisite to the proposed division of the party. Our Kaskaia visitor, with his handsome and highly ornamented wife, encamped near us, erecting a little tent covered with skins. They presented us some jerked bison meat, and received in return some tobacco and other inconsiderable articles. A small looking-glass, which was among the presents given him, he immediately stripped of...", "...Lizzie, \"but I wouldn't say I could talk it very fast.\" \"Never mind how slow you go,\" said the doctor, \"so long as you get it out in the end.

Dutch?\" Lizzie shook her head. \"That's a pity. Never mind. I'll put you down for French, anyway. I'll take you up with me to the workhouse hospital at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this evening. I want you to speak French to a man that's there, one of the sailors out of the ship that was wrecked.\" \"I mightn't be fit,\" said Lizzie, doubtfully. \"Oh, yes, you will. Just look up the French for religion before you start, and get off the names of the principal kinds of religion in that language.

Well, there was no more happened last night; but it wasn't more than nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning before that same sergeant was off up to the big house and I wouldn't wonder but it was to tell the strange gentleman that's there whatever it was he heard him last night. He had that kind of a look about him anyway.\" \"I don't like the way things is going on,\" said Sweeny. \"What is it that's up at the big house at all?\" \"They tell me,\" said Walsh, \"that he's a mighty high up gentleman whoever he is.\" \"He may be, but I'd be glad if I knew what he's doing here,...", "...carried a big cargo of ammunition and naval stores for Admiral Dewey's fleet. Four transports bearing about 4,000 men passed through the Golden Gate shortly after 1 o'clock on the 15th of June, amid scenes of great enthusiasm and patriotism unequaled in the history of San Francisco. The four vessels which carried the troops were the China, Colon, Zealandia and Senator. The fleet was accompanied down the bay by a large number of tugboats and bay steamers. It was a few minutes past 1 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when the China hoisted the blue Peter and warned the fleet to get under way. The Senator had slipped into the stream and straightened out for the run to Manila. When she reached the stream the China swung away from her anchorage and started down the bay, followed by the Colon and Zealandia and a long line of tugboats and steamers. At 1:30 p.m. the fleet was off Lombard street and a few minutes later it was steaming past Meiggs' wharf. Thousands of people, attracted by the...", "...he said, \"and leave your old Daddy here to think.\" With a parting kiss, Shirley left him, and rejoined Mabel on the porch. CHAPTER VIII.--A ROAD ADVENTURE. The morning following the girls' arrival, Mr. Willing and Mr. Ashton, who was feeling much better, were seated with the girls around the breakfast table. \"Mabel and I are going to town this morning,\" said Shirley. \"All right,\" said Mr. Willing. \"I'll tell Frank to hitch up. What time will you be ready?\" \"Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> will be early enough, I reckon,\" said Shirley. \"We probably won't be home until late this afternoon.\" It was the first time the girls had been in the little town of Paris, except for a few minutes on their way back from Illinois, since school had closed for the summer vacation. Therefore, they called on some of their girl friends, and spent a very pleasant day. They did some shopping and it was after five o'clock when they started for home. \"It looks as though there was...", "...pressed the one against the others, there fell from the pale sky only a warm, fine shadow of a gentle, serene nature. The air of meditation was profound, as if the old town had become simply a continuation of the Cathedral; the only sound of carriages that could be heard came up from Beaumont-la-Ville, the new town on the banks of the Ligneul, where many of the factories were not closed, as the proprietors disdained taking part in this ancient religious ceremony. Soon after four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the great bell of the northern tower, the one whose swinging stirred the house of the Huberts, began to ring; and it was at that very moment that Hubertine and Angelique reappeared. The former had put on a dress of pale buff linen, trimmed with a simple thread lace, but her figure was so slight and youthful in its delicate roundness that she looked as if she were the sister of her adopted daughter. Angelique wore her dress of white foulard, with its soft ruchings at the neck...", "...was intense, and the rowers fast losing their strength. At one o'clock I landed at my former encampment. The padre had, of course, left the oars, sail, and blankets. My skiff was rigged in a moment; and out of the blankets, those in the long-boat managed to make a sail, an oar and a long pole tied together answering for a mast. In doubling the northern point of the bay, I perceived the Mexican schooner and many boats, pretty far at sea. No doubt they were searching for me. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening we landed at Monterey, amidst the acclamations of a wondering crowd. I was a general favourite, and my loss had occasioned much alarm; so that when I landed I was assailed with questions from every quarter. The women petted me, some kissed me (by-the-bye, those were d'un certain age), and all agreed that I should burn half a dozen of candles on the altar of the Virgin Mary. There was one, however, who had wept for me; it was Isabella, a lovely girl of fifteen,...", "...took pains to impress upon us how anxious they were for our safe arrival in camp, informing us that their heads would be the price of any accident that should happen to us. At last the torches were seen flickering on the opposite hill, and soon afterwards we commenced our march in picturesque procession, passing over rugged ascents, across brawling rocky streams, and down dark romantic glens, until we began to think that the existence of Pheer Phing was a fiction. It was about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when I perceived we had entered a town which, by its brick pavement and high houses, I concluded to be a large one. After crossing three ranges of mountains, each nearly two thousand feet high, we did not much speculate upon anything but the distance still to be travelled; and the numerous lights twinkling in the distance were a welcome evidence of the proximity of Jung's encampment. The minister came out and received us cordially, expressing his regret at our misadventure and...", "...would be inviting danger. He was now tolerably certain that from one end of the continent to the other his presence was known. His life and his property, they would be after both. Even now there might be men in this strange town seeking him. The closer he got to New York, the more active and wide-awake they would become. He walked the streets, his glance constantly roving. But apparently no one paid the least attention to him. Finally he returned to the railway station; and at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that evening he left the platform of the 125th Street Station, and appraised covertly the men who accompanied him to the street. He felt assured that they were all Americans. Probably they were; but there are still some stray fools of American birth who cannot accept the great American doctrine as the only Ararat visible in this present flood. Perhaps one of these accompanied Hawksley to the street.

C. Dickens (Richmond, Va.); some conjuring; and then finished off with country-dances; of which we had two admirably good ones, quite new to me, though really old. Getting the words, and making the preparations, occupied (as you may believe) the whole day; and it was three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before I got to bed. It was an excellent entertainment, and we were all uncommonly merry. . . .

Of all the country-houses and estates I have yet seen in England, I think this is by far the best. Everything undertaken...", "...face beamed. His devotion to Gladys Norman was notorious. The girl rose and raised to Malcolm Sage a pair of dark eyes from which tears were not far distant. \"I'm so ashamed, Mr. Sage,\" she began, her lower lip trembling ominously. \"I've never done such a thing before.\" \"I've been working you too hard,\" he said, as he held back the door. \"You must go home and rest.\" She shook her head and passed out, whilst Malcolm Sage returned to his seat at the table. \"Working till two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning,\" he remarked as he resumed his seat. \"She won't have assistance. Strange creatures, women,\" he added musingly, \"but beautifully loyal.\" Sir James had dropped into a chair on the opposite side of Malcolm Sage's table. Having selected a cigar from the box his late chief-of-staff pushed across to him, he cut off the end and proceeded to light it. \"Good cigars these,\" he remarked, as he critically examined the lighted end. \"They're your own brand, Chief,\" was...", "...the office of Bellman and Scavenger for this Town in place of William Spicer, who {54} resigned his place at Church on Easter Monday.\" [The Easter Vestry had had under their consideration complaints of Spicer's conduct, and there was a full meeting now assembled.] \"It is Agreed upon _nem. con._ that the Place and Business of a Bellman and Scavenger is to go about the Town in the Night as Bellman, from Lady Day to Michaelmas Day from the Hours of Eleven o'clock at Night until four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the Morning, and from Michaelmas Day to Lady Day from the Hours of Eleven o'clock at Night until five o'clock in the Morning, and to ring his Bell every time he calls the Hour, and to do his Utmost endeavour to prevent any Robery to be done in the Town. \"And as Scavenger to Devout his whole time in the Day to Keep all the Streets, Lanes, and Drains in the Town Clear; and not to Suffer any Dirt to be in Heaps in any part of the Town, and to his utmost Endeavour to prevent...", "...and trees and other horrors of the darkness he held his arm before him, but soon it was driven to his side. Wet whips cut his brow so that he had to protect it with his hands, until it had to bear the lash again, for they would not. Now he had forced up his knees, and would have succumbed but for a dread of being pinned to the earth. This fight between the man and the rain went on all night, and long before it ended the man was past the power of thinking. In the ringing of the ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> bell Gavin had lived the seventh part of a man's natural life. Only action was required of him. That accomplished, his mind had begun to work again, when suddenly the loss of Babbie stopped it, as we may put out a fire with a great coal. The last thing he had reflected about was a dogcart in motion, and, consequently, this idea clung to him. His church, his mother, were lost knowledge of, but still he seemed to hear the trap in front. The rain increased in violence,...", "...all. The fifth from the end bore the number he sought--Mr. Birnes chuckled; and there, alongside it, stood William Johns, swapping Billingsgate with the driver of a hansom, the while he kept one eye open for a prospective fare. It was too easy! Mr. Birnes paused long enough to congratulate himself upon his marvelous acumen, and then he approached the driver. \"You are William Johns?\" he accused him sharply. \"That's me, Cap,\" the cabby answered readily. \"A few minutes past four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this afternoon you went up Fifth Avenue, and stopped at the corner of Thirty-fourth Street to pick up a fare--a young man.\" \"Yep.\" \"You drove him to the corner of Sixty-seventh Street and Fifth Avenue,\" the detective went on just to forestall possible denials. \"He got out there, paid you, and you went on up Fifth Avenue.\" \"Far be it from me to deceive you, Cap,\" responded the cabby with irritating levity. \"I done that same.\" \"Who was that man?\" demanded Mr. Birnes...", "...day, singing as merrily as if the sun were not beating on them like a blazing fire. When we came up a month ago we had such a heavy load of timber for building purposes that they could hardly get a seat. One chief on the road asked me to put a part of it at his beach as they would never be able to take it up, but the boys sturdily answered, \"The canoe is good, let us go on.\" They pulled eight hours on end without stopping to eat a bite. About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we all lay down, after holding worship in the canoe, and didn't they sing! And then the moon began to show through the mist about 3 A. M., and they jumped and pushed off, and then for eight hours pulled and sang and laughed and shouted in their high spirits, wakening the echoes of dreadful-looking places, where mud and ooze hold the crocodile and other creatures. It was the same coming back, and when they all arrived at Use they broke a little hole in...", "...again worked together. At dawn, Driscoll's, who were leading, captured twelve Boers asleep round their wagons; they were an outpost of Delarey's, and they had no idea that any British could be in the vicinity. They said that a commando of Delarey's was ten miles ahead. This commando, however, managed to slip through between two columns. Through the day the net was drawn tighter, and by the evening of the 23rd Major Gilbert and his men had ridden over 60 miles in twenty-one hours. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they bivouacked in the rain in some scrub at Matjespruit. There had been a heavy hailstorm during the afternoon. On the next afternoon Klerksdorp was reached. Some hundreds of Boers had been caught altogether, besides three 15-pounders, two pom-poms, and a quantity of ammunition. Perhaps the greatest effect produced, however, was upon the nerves of the Boers. They got into a state of \"nervous tension,\" as they never knew when or where the British would turn up next. A...", "...in to spend their daily pennies. \"I guess it'll be one session, Maida,\" Dorothy whispered. \"Oh goody, Dorothy!\" Mabel lisped. \"Don't you love one session, Maida?\" Maida was ashamed to confess to two such tiny girls that she did not know what \"one session\" meant. But she puzzled over it the whole morning. If Rosie and Arthur had come in she would have asked them. But neither of them appeared. Indeed, they were not anywhere in the lines--Maida looked very carefully. At twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the school bell did not ring. In surprise, Maida craned out of the window to consult the big church clock. It agreed exactly with the tall grandfather's clock in the living-room. Both pointed to twelve, then to five minutes after and ten and fifteen--still no bell. A little later Dicky came swinging along, the sides of his old rusty raincoat flapping like the wings of some great bird. \"It's one-session, Maida,\" he said jubilantly, \"did you hear the bell?\" \"What's one...", "...\"You're right, ma'am,\" said Jimmy; \"it'll be better for you.

Let us get some sleep, if any of us are able to sleep.\" CHAPTER XXIV It was three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon of the day which followed their capture, and the two Members of Parliament showed no signs of becoming reconciled to their situation. Mr. Sanders grumbled and occasionally swore. Mr. Dick passed from bursts of violent rage to fits of lamentation over the desolate condition of Mrs. Dick. Dr. O'Grady and Patsy Devlin bore with them patiently for a long time. But there are limits to human endurance. After a consultation with Patsy, the doctor undertook to speak...", "...proceed on our journey but a span of horses in our company in care of Henry Terry being missing we concluded not to start. I sent out three men to hunt them. Soon after they were brought into camp by another person. I then sent Henry Terry to hunt for the men but it was after two o'clock before they returned. We fed a little corn and then started. The company is far ahead of us. We traveled very slowly our teams were so weak. However, we soon came into sight of the camp but it was six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before we got there, having traveled about seven miles. The camp was formed on a beautiful prairie, President Young's camp being on a little eminence. President Kimball's about three quarters of a mile north of his and ours about a quarter of a mile east. There is some little grass for our cattle here, but little. We sent those of our company about a mile southeast and had a guard over them through the night. President Haws, Captains Egan and Kay and Jackson Redding went out a...", "...weight--one sixteen. You understand. I wonder what the paternal Keats was like. I don't remember, and I must look him up to see. It's funny how sturdy-oak fathers can have ferny-mimosa sons. Mothers can stand producing poets, but it is hard on fathers. I felt that I must help out Judge Vandyne, and with that resolve I headed Redwheels out along Providence Road. As I had told mother, the sobs and tears of the April day had been wilfully misleading demonstrations, for by ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the whole face of nature wore a sun-sweetened smile that was positively entrancing. The young April world seemed to spring dripping from a bath that glistened all over with crystal water gems. Winter is staid and dignified and grand with its stark trees and mantle of brown earth, and summer is glowing and glorious; but very young spring is so sappy and curly and yellow and green and lavender that you take it to heart and let it nestle there to suck its pink apple-blow thumb,...", "...at the home of a friend of theirs, whose father was very rich. Toyo whispered, \"Oh, Lotus Blossom, I believe he's bringing us an invitation to Chrysanthemum's party. You know she is going to have one on her birthday.\" Sure enough, the man came up to the children, and, making a low bow, presented them with two daintily folded papers and then departed. They hastened to open them, and found, with delight, that they were really and truly asked to their friend's party. It was to be at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon of the following Thursday. Lotus Blossom ran to her mother, just as her American cousins might do, and cried, \"Oh, mamma, my precious, honourable mother, what shall I wear? See this; do look at my invitation.\" It was a rare thing indeed to see the child so excited. Her mother smiled, and answered, \"My dear little pearl of a Lotus Blossom, I have almost finished embroidering your new silk garment. It shall be finished, and you shall have a new yellow crape...", "...it was,-- \"Come, Margaret, isn't it 'most time to go home?\" Mrs. Canning merely looked into her husband's face, but made no answer. More earnestly than ever the ladies now appeared to enter upon the various themes for conversation that presented themselves, all of which were very frivolous to the mind of Canning, who was exceedingly chafed by his wife's indifference to his suggestion about going home. He determined, however, to say no more if she sat all night. Toward eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she made a movement to depart, and after lingering in the parlor before she went up stairs to put on her things, and in the chamber after her things were on, and on the stairs, in the passage, and at the door, she finally took the arm of her husband and started for home. Not a word was uttered by either until they had walked the distance of two squares, when Margaret, unable to keep back what she wanted to say any longer, spoke thus,-- \"James, I will thank you, another time,...", "...the thing they would do, for while the search would be keen among the islets near the land, and the villages there, no one would think of looking for them on the seaward islands. \"I have no doubt they are there now.

I suppose it is about one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> now, but I have not noticed the hour. It was past eleven before we first met the gondola, and we must have been a good deal more than an hour lying there waiting for them.\" A quarter of an hour's walking took them to the palazzo of Polani. They rang twice at the bell at the land entrance, before a face appeared at the little window of the door, and asked who was there. \"I wish to see Signor Polani at once,\" Francis said. \"The signor retired to rest an hour ago,\" the man...", "...this smooth, snowy escarpment, which rose directly out of two or three fathoms of water, lay our only route to Yamsk. The prospect of getting over it without meeting with some disaster seemed very faint, for the slightest caving away of the snow would tumble us all into the open sea; but as there was no alternative, we fastened our dogs to cakes of ice, distributed our axes and hatchets, threw off our heavy fur coats, and began cutting out a road. We worked hard all day, and by six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening had cut a deep trench three feet in width along the face of the escarpment to a point about a mile and a quarter west of the mouth of the Viliga. Here we were again stopped, however, by a difficulty infinitely worse than any that we had surmounted. The beach, which had previously extended in one unbroken line along the foot of the cliffs, here suddenly disappeared, and the mass of snow over which we had been cutting a road came to an abrupt termination....", "...through a pass in the mountains, towards Murun. By the way I sat down by the brook, and there ate my bread and raisins, and drank of the crystal stream; but either the coldness of this unusual breakfast, or the riding after it, did not at all agree with me. The heat oppressed me much, and the road seemed intolerably tedious. At last we got out from among the mountains, and saw the village of Murun, in a fine valley on the right. It was about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when we reached it. As the _mehmandar_ could not immediately find a place to put me in, we had a complete view of this village. They stared at my European dress, but no disrespect was shown. I was deposited at last with a Khan, who was seated in a place with three walls. Not at all disposed to pass the day in company, as well as exposed, I asked for another room, on which I was shown to the stable, where there was a little place partitioned off, but...", "...he grew weaker from hour to hour, and occasionally repeated passages from the Bible, in German and Latin. After midnight he seemed to revive a little: Dr. Jonas, the Countess of Mansfeld, the pastor of the church at Eisleben, and his sons, stood near his bed. Then Jonas said: \"Beloved Father, do you acknowledge Christ, the Son of God, our Redeemer?\" Luther answered \"Yes,\" in a strong and clear voice; then, folding his hands, he drew one deep sigh and died, between two and three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of the 17th of February. [Sidenote: 1546.] After solemn services in the church at Eisleben, the body was removed on its way to Wittenberg. In every village through which the procession passed, the bells were tolled, and the people flocked together from all the surrounding country.

He turned as Quincy entered. \"How is my uncle?\" asked Quincy. \"He is better off than us poor mortals,\" replied Mr. Waters with a long-drawn countenance. \"What do you mean?\" asked Quincy. \"Is he dead?\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Waters, \"he died about four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this mornin'.

He ate his lunch because he was hungry. Nothing prevents people who are hungry from eating as soon as they have got something to eat. Only Daddy Rousseau used to say: 'I don't know whether it is because of the atmosphere of the room, but I must have something fresh and appetizing.'\" \"I understand,\" said Felicie. \"Little flower-girls are what you want.

Immediately after the signing of the war resolution by President Wilson the Navy Department proceeded to put various plans into execution.

He prescribed a sedative mixture, but the girl got worse, and, after a further convulsion, died on the following morning.

The old man found his grandson much improved, both in spirits and garb. In his fresh, cool, summer gray, erect, stalwart, and clear-eyed, he won a grunt of approval from his mentor. \"There's...", "...Then you will be able to form your own opinion. On the evening of July 23, 1914, Austria handed her note to Serbia. It demanded in overbearing and insulting terms that Serbia should place under Austrian control her schools, her law-courts, her police, in fact her whole internal administration.

It is nearly twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when he reaches the door of a common two-story house in Marion-street. The door is opened before he can turn the bolt with his night-key, and the whitest possible little hand presses his. He draws it within his own, and places his arm around the daintiest little waist that ever submitted to the operation.

We have got so far east, now--a hundred and fifty-five degrees of longitude from San Francisco--that my watch can not \"keep the hang\" of the time any more. It has grown discouraged, and stopped. I think it did a wise thing. The difference in time between Sebastopol and the Pacific coast is enormous. When it is six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning here, it is somewhere about week before last in California. We are excusable for getting a little tangled as to time. These distractions and distresses about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid my mind was so much affected that I never would have any appreciation of time again; but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehending when it was dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, and I am tortured with doubts and fears no...", "...and that the fire did not begin thereabouts. Yet the fellow, who, though a mopish besotted fellow, did not speak like a madman, did swear that he did fire it: and did not this like a madman; for, being tried on purpose, and landed with his keeper at the Tower Wharf, he could carry the keeper to the very house. Asking Sir R. Viner what he thought was the cause of the fire, he tells me, that the baker, son, and his daughter, did all swear again and again, that their oven was drawn by ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night; that, having occasion to light a candle about twelve, there was not so much fire in the bakehouse as to light a match for a candle, so that they were fain to go into another place to light it; that about two in the morning they felt themselves almost choked with smoke, and rising, did find the fire coming upstairs; so they rose to save themselves; but that, at that time, the bavins--[brushwood, or faggots used for lighting fires]--were not on fire in the yard. So that...", "...bright with nervousness. Her cheeks alternately paled with fear and flooded red with anxiety.

She was not looking at its helpful hills, at its appealing curves, at its brilliant colors. She was watching the roadway.

NEWBURY'S OLD ELM Among the venerable relics of Newbury few are better known and more prized than the old elm. It is a stout tree, with a girth of twenty-four and a half feet, and is said to have been standing since 1713. In that year it was planted by Richard Jacques, then a youthful rustic, who had a sweetheart, as all rustics have, and adored her as rustics and other men should do. On one of his visits he stayed uncommonly late. It was nearly ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when he set off for home. The town had been abed an hour or more; the night was murky and oppressively still, and corpse-candles were dancing in the graveyard. Witch times had not been so far agone that he felt comfortable, and, lest some sprite, bogie, troll, or goblin should waylay him, he tore an elm branch from a tree that grew before his sweetheart's house, and flourished it as he walked. He reached home without experiencing any of the troubles that a superstitious fancy...", "...may be arrested at any moment.\" The shadowy figure was already going its way, and as a gas ray fell upon it, Pierre thought that he recognised the pale, pinched face of Victor Mathis. And at the same time, yonder in Abbe Rose's peaceful dining-room, he fancied he could again see the gentle face of Madame Mathis, so sad and so resigned, living on solely by the force of the last trembling hope which she had unhappily set in her son. III. PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT ALREADY at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on that holiday-making mid-Lent Thursday, when all the offices of the Home Department were empty, Monferrand, the Minister, sat alone in his private room. A single usher guarded his door, and in the first ante-chamber there were only a couple of messengers. The Minister had experienced, on awaking, the most unpleasant of emotions. The \"Voix du Peuple,\" which on the previous day had revived the African Railway scandal, by accusing Barroux of having pocketed 20,000 francs, had...", "...Don't you think it's easy to get a job.\" I was momentarily sobered by the earnestness with which he brought home to me the relentlessness of our civilization. It seemed incredible. I should have learned a lesson in that store.

They were troubled with no visions of better things. When the travelling men came in from the \"road\" there was great hilarity. Important personages, these, looked up to by the city clerks; jolly, reckless, Elizabethan-like rovers, who had tasted of the wine of liberty--and of other wines with the ineradicable lust for the road in their blood. No more routine for...", "...that it did not deceive him now. He was certain that this was the letter that fixed the date of her coming with Artois. He opened the two other letters and glanced over them, and then at last he tore the covering from Hermione's. A swift, searching look was enough. The letter dropped from his hand to the seat. He had seen these words: \"Isn't it splendid? Emile may leave at once. But there is no good boat till the tenth. We shall take that, and be at Cattaro on the eleventh at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon....\" \"Isn't it splendid?\" For a moment he sat quite still in the glare of the sun, mentally repeating to himself these words of his wife. So the inevitable had happened. For he felt it was inevitable. Fate was against him. He was not to have his pleasure. \"Signorino! Come sta lei? Lei sta bene?\" He started and looked up. He had heard no footstep. Salvatore stood by him, smiling at him, Salvatore with bare feet, and a fish-basket slung over his arm....", "...The next day my Lady Suffolk desired I would write her a patent for appointing Lady Temple poet laureate to the fairies. I was excessively out of order with a pain in my stomach, which I had had for ten days, and was fitter to write verses like a Poet Laureate, than for making one; however, I was going home to dinner alone, and at six I sent her some lines, which you ought to have seen how sick I was, to excuse; but first I must tell you my tale methodically. The next morning by nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Miss Hotham (she must forgive me twenty years hence for saying she was eleven, for I recollect she is but ten), arrived at Lady Temple's, her face and neck all spotted with saffron, and limping. \"Oh, Madam!\" said she, \"I am undone for ever if you do not assist me!\" \"Lord, child,\" cried my Lady Temple, \"what is the matter?\" thinking she had hurt herself, or lost the ring, and that she was stolen out before her aunt was up. \"Oh, Madam,\" said the girl, \"nobody but you can assist...", "...or asking leave: thus comes it that the little birds are happy, and sing all the livelong day!\" But the life of man in a natural state is like that of the birds; he equally enjoys nature. \"The earth spreads a continual feast before him.\" What, then, has he gained by that selfish and imperfect association which forms a nation?

I was visiting her once in the Christmas holidays, when I was a schoolboy in the upper class, and we had retired for the night. At one o'clock my aunt suddenly appeared at my bedside, waked me, and told me to get up. The first snow had fallen, and she had had the horses harnessed for us to go sleighing, which she particularly enjoyed. Resistance was useless, and the swift flight over the snow by moonlight proved to be very enjoyable. Between four and five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning we were at home again. Winter brought many other amusements. I remember with particular pleasure the Christmas fair, which now, as I learn to my regret, is no longer held. And yet, what a source of delight it once was to children! What rich food it offered to their minds! The Christmas trees and pyramids at the Stechbahn, the various wares, the gingerbread and toys in the booths, offered by no means the greatest charm.

Upon the boat's leaving the beach the natives dispersed for the night but Jack, as usual, was perceived to separate himself from his companions and to walk away without exchanging a word with them. December 31. The weather at daylight the next morning (31st) was too unsettled and the breeze too strong from the westward to think of moving from the anchorage. Jack and another native were down on the rocks at an early hour, hallooing and waving to us, and at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> some natives appeared on the opposite shore with spears and knives to barter, but we had no communication with them. During our visit we have obtained from these people about one hundred spears, thirty throwing-sticks, forty hammers, one hundred and fifty knives, and a few hand-clubs, the value of each being at from half to one-eighth of a biscuit.

There were quantities of purple crocuses in flower, and the hawthorn was covered with flower and looked very home-like indeed.

We proceeded by an early train on the Chatham and Dover Railway, and by nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning had reached our destination--Dover. It was, I think, one of the coldest and most miserable mornings I ever experienced. The sea was very rough, the waves lashing on the roadway; and the rain came down in torrents.

The stage drive, one morning in Kentucky, began at four, and by six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the sun poured down against the side of the coach in which the lady was seated. As the heat increased, in the same degree her irritability was manifested. At last she asked a Southern gentlemen who was by her to let down the curtain.

If you go through the gate of the porcelain factory and over the courtyard, and through the mill in the fourth courtyard that leads out into Spring Street, there you will see where the planking is torn down, and you can get into the churchyard easily.\" \"Hans, you're a genius!\" exclaimed Solling in delight. \"Here, Simsen, you know that factory inside and...", "...was speaking to her in a low voice. \"You are mad,\" replied Marguerite. \"You know quite well that I don't want you.

Come, gentlemen, supper!\" And, slipping away from Gaston, Marguerite made him sit on her right at table, me on her left, then called to Nanine: \"Before you sit down, tell them in the kitchen not to open to anybody if there is a ring.\" This order was given at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. We laughed, drank, and ate freely at this supper. In a short while mirth had reached its last limit, and the words that seem funny to a certain class of people, words that degrade the mouth that utters them, were heard from time to time, amidst the applause of Nanine, of Prudence, and of Marguerite. Gaston was thoroughly amused; he was a very good sort of fellow, but somewhat spoiled by the habits of his youth. For a moment I tried to forget myself, to force...", "...not change the fate of the day. The Prussian infantry had lost but little in the cut-and-thrust encounters, and at once resumed the attack against Liebert's Division. But in this onslaught they sustained heavy losses; for instance, all three battalions of the 6th Regiment had to be commanded by lieutenants.

When between one and two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the fighting in Bazeilles had at first taken a favourable turn, General de Wimpffen reverted to his original plan of driving from the village the Bavarians, now exhausted by a long struggle, and of breaking a way through to Carignan with the Ist, Vth, and XIIth Corps; while the VIIth Corps was to cover the rear of this movement. But the orders issued to that effect in part never reached the Corps; in part did so so late that circumstances forbade their being carried out.

The \"dress-rehearsal\" began at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Sunday evening; and from the very start everything went wrong. But Thyrsis did not know the peculiar fact about dress-rehearsals, that everything always goes wrong; and so he suffered untellable agonies at the sight of the blundering and stupidity.

I had only known him with any sort of intimacy for the last five or six years, during which I saw a good deal of him. He was a remarkable man, not so much from great ability as from a singular healthiness of mind and body and the greenness of his old age. I never saw so old a man in possession...", "...winter in Coventry. But I shall be back to-night as I have promised Dan to spend that time with him.\" \"We shall be glad to have you, as you know.\" Soon after Mrs. Frost had left the breakfast-room and Tom had started forth with horse and sleigh, Dan returned. The Marquis promptly reminded him of the suggestion that he should be taken over the Inn. It seemed to Dan an uninteresting way to entertain his guest and the morning was a busy one. However, he promised to be ready at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to show the Marquis all there was in the old house. As Dan went about the offices and stables, performing himself much of the work that in prosperous times fell to grooms and hostlers, he found himself thinking about his new guest. Dan knew enough of French history to be aware there were frequent occasions in France when partisans of the various factions, royalist, imperialist, or republican, found it best to expatriate themselves. He knew that in times past many of the most...", "...from Johnson's--all under command of Pickett. The infantry came by the White Oak road from the right of General Lee's intrenchments, and their arrival became positively known to me about dark, the confirmatory intelligence being brought in then by some of Young's scouts who had been inside the Confederate lines. On the 31st, the rain having ceased, directions were given at an early hour to both Merritt and Crook to make reconnoissances preparatory to securing Five Forks, and about 9 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Merritt started for the crossroads, Davies's brigade supporting him. His march was necessarily slow because of the mud, and the enemy's pickets resisted with obstinacy also, but the coveted crossroads fell to Merritt without much trouble, as the bulk of the enemy was just then bent on other things. At the same hour that Merritt started, Crook moved Smith's brigade out northwest from Dinwiddie to Fitzgerald's crossing of Chamberlain's Creek, to cover Merritt's left,...", "...he had heard his father speak well. But he also saw, despite the dusk, blue uniforms and the gleam of bayonets. And as he looked he saw, too, earthworks and the signs that many men were present. He lay long among the bushes until the night thickened and darkened and he resolved to inspect the earthworks thoroughly. No very strict watch seemed to be kept, and, in truth, it did not seem to be needed here so near to Washington, and so far away from the Southern army. Before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> everything settled into quiet, and he cautiously climbed a great beech which was in full and deep foliage. The boughs were so many and the leaves so dense that one standing directly under him could not have seen him. But he went up as far as he could go, and, crouched there, made a comprehensive survey. It was a fine moonlight night and he saw the earthworks stretching for a long distance, thorough and impregnable to anything except a great army. Beyond that was a silver...", "...eight o'clock in the morning, on the 11th, land was seen, from the mast- head, bearing west, and at noon from the deck, extending from W. 3/4 N. to W. by S., about twelve leagues distant.[1] I made no doubt that this was Davis's Land, or Easter Island; as its appearance from this situation, corresponded very well with Wafer's account; and we expected to have seen the low sandy isle that Davis fell in with, which would have been a confirmation; but in this we were disappointed. At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, the island bore from north 62 deg. W., to north 87 deg. W., about five leagues distant; in which situation, we sounded without finding ground with a line of an hundred and forty fathoms. Here we spent the night, having alternately light airs and calms, till ten o'clock the next morning, when a breeze sprung up at W.S.W. With this we stretched in for the land; and by the help of our glass, discovered people, and some of those Colossean statues or idols mentioned...", "...the _Daily Record Union_, which on Sept. 3, 1879, two days after the event, gave a brief account of it. There was newspaper enterprise for you! An atrocious crime reported in a neighboring city two days afterward! Were such things too common to excite interest? Or was it felt that the recital of them did not tend to boom the great State of California? CHAPTER II The Graniteville Stage On that fateful first of September, 1879, the stage left Graniteville, as usual, at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. Graniteville, in Eureka Township, Nevada County, is the Eureka South of early days. The stage still makes the daily trip over the mountains; but the glamour and romance of the gold fields have long since departed. On the morning mentioned traffic was light, for people did not travel the twenty-eight miles through heat and dust to Nevada City for pleasure. Too often it was a case of running the gauntlet from the gold fields to the railroad terminus and safety....", "...with a certainty of success; and planned a masterly march, by which he would place himself on Frederick's left and rear, drive him into the bend made by the Saale, and annihilate his army. In his enthusiasm at this happy idea, he sent off a courier to carry the news, to Versailles, that he was about to annihilate the Prussian army, and take the king prisoner. Frederick's dinner was prolonged. There was nothing to be done, and patience was one of the king's strong points. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> an officer, who had remained on watch on the housetop, hurried down with news that the enemy had suddenly turned to the left. The king went up to the roof with his officers, and at once divined the intention of his foes. It was a glorious moment for him. At last, after three weary months, he was to meet them in battle. Instantly his orders were given, and in half an hour the Prussian army was all in movement, with the exception of some irregular corps which were left to...", "...ache of Gertie Slayback's high young heart. On a Saturday evening that was already pointed with stars at the six-o'clock closing of Hoffheimer's Fourteenth Street Emporium, Miss Slayback, whose blondness under fatigue could become ashy, emerged from the Bargain-Basement almost the first of its frantic exodus, taking the place of her weekly appointment in the entrance of the Popular Drug Store adjoining, her gaze, something even frantic in it, sifting the passing crowd. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Fourteenth Street pours up from its basements, down from its lofts, and out from its five-and-ten-cent stores, shows, and arcades, in a great homeward torrent--a sweeping torrent that flows full flush to the Subway, the Elevated, and the surface car, and then spreads thinly into the least pretentious of the city's homes--the five flights up, the two rooms rear, and the third floor back. Standing there, this eager tide of the Fourteenth Street Emporium, thus released by the...", "...out fine. I cannot bear to think that those dainty creatures--many of whose effigies may doubtless be found, at this day, in the neighbouring cloisters, lying on their backs, with crossed hands and chipped noses (attributed, by the vergers of the abbey, as a matter of course, to the iconoclast malice of Oliver Cromwell)--should have had their hoods, kirtles, and day's pleasure spoiled by the \"wind, snow, and sleete\" of a \"ruggie and tempestuous day.\" Depend upon it that, towards ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning (the hour at which, according to the early habits of the period, the coronation ceremony would have come to a close), the sky began to clear up. In a literal and physical sense only, be it understood. Metaphorically, as far as Sir John Falstaff was concerned, the sun was never destined to shine more; for the sun of poor old Jack's existence was Henry Plantagenet, fifth king of England by that name, and the face of that sun Jack Falstaff was never to see but...", "...and the sea deep. A line of rocks in the form of the top of a lance, and connecting themselves with the land by a narrow isthmus, stretch out there into the water, ending abruptly with a large peak-shaped breaker. Nothing is commoner in the architecture of the sea. In attempting to reach the plateau of the peaked rock from the shore, it was necessary to follow an inclined plane, the ascent of which was here and there somewhat steep. It was upon a plateau of this kind, towards four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, that a man was standing, enveloped in a large military cape, and armed; a fact easy to be perceived from certain straight and angular folds in his mantle. The summit on which this man was resting was a rather extensive platform, dotted with large masses of rock, like enormous paving-stones, leaving between them narrow passages. This platform, on which a kind of thick, short grass grew here and there, came to an end on the sea side in an open space, leading to...", "...added. The captain shook his head. He was the most ungracious person they ever had known. But when Harriet said they had better get word to Mr. McCarthy at once, the captain changed his mind quickly. He said he would come for them whenever they gave him the word. He told them, further, that they would have to bring their own provisions when they went out for a sail, but that he could show them how to catch some fish if they desired to do so. \"We shall be ready to go out about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow morning,\" Mrs. Livingston told him. \"If there is anything you wish us to do, you might call to the young women who occupy the cabin there on the Lonesome Bar. I am very glad you are going to remain aboard your boat, for we are not equipped for putting up strangers. But if there is anything you wish in the way of supplies, do not hesitate to send word to me. We have quite a quantity. We are obliged to go beyond the highway for our drinking water, and it is a trifle...", "...all the suavity of Mark Lemon to calm the storm, his award always being final. Jerrold used to say: \"It's no use our quarrelling, for we must meet again and shake hands next Wednesday.\" The last editions of the evening papers were always brought in, so that the cartoon might apply to the latest date. On the Thursday morning following the editor called at the houses of the artists to see what was being done. On Friday night all copy was delivered and put into type, and at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Saturday proofs were revised, the forms made up, and with the last movement of the engine the whole of the type was placed under the press, which could not be moved till the Monday morning. By means of the Wednesday meetings, the discussions arising on all questions helped both caricaturist and wit to take a broad view of things, as well as enabled the editor to get his team to draw well together and give uniformity of tone to all the contributions. CHAPTER...", "...I don't see Cummin; send him up.\" \"Cummin!--Richard Cummin!\" was echoed round the decks; but no Richard Cummin appeared. The hands were called out to muster; Cummin did not answer to his name. Strict search was made for him, but he was nowhere to be found. The first and most natural conclusion was, that he had deserted to the Columbine; but it was too late now to ascertain. But that belief was a good deal shaken, when one of the men, who happened to have been awake at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the night before, said that he had heard a loud splash in the water, and ran immediately to the \"port\" to look out; but all was silent again; and, if it was, as he now supposed, Cummin, he must have gone down immediately. He did not give the alarm at the time, for he was half-asleep when he heard the noise, and thought he must have been mistaken. While the man was giving this evidence on the quarterdeck, up came Goldie with a piece of paper, which he had found on the pillow of...", "...them at their will and pleasure, and publicly concerted their plans. Business was quite suspended; the greater part of the shops were closed; most of the houses displayed a blue flag in token of their adherence to the popular side; and even the Jews in Houndsditch, Whitechapel, and those quarters, wrote upon their doors or window-shutters, 'This House is a True Protestant.' The crowd was the law, and never was the law held in greater dread, or more implicitly obeyed. It was about six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, when a vast mob poured into Lincoln's Inn Fields by every avenue, and divided--evidently in pursuance of a previous design--into several parties. It must not be understood that this arrangement was known to the whole crowd, but that it was the work of a few leaders; who, mingling with the men as they came upon the ground, and calling to them to fall into this or that parry, effected it as rapidly as if it had been determined on by a council of the whole number,...", "...they passed an Indian village which they were told was called Chicago--no doubt named by some of the Klondikers who were practically cast away here twenty years earlier. John put it down on his map under that name, as indeed it is charted in all the authentic maps of that upper region. They were told that a good number of Indians come here to make their winter hunt. An uneventful day, during which the boat logged a great many miles in her steady progress, was passed, until at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they tied up at the next to the last of the Hudson's Bay posts on the Mackenzie River, known as Arctic Red River, located at sixty-seven degrees and thirty minutes north latitude. \"Oh, look, look, fellows!\" exclaimed John, as they pulled into the landing here. \"Now we're beginning to get some real stuff! I feel as though we were pretty near to the end of the world. Look yonder!\" He pointed to where, along the beach at the foot of the bluff, there lay two encampments of...", "...brother takes her out, her father takes out the oldest or most honored lady present. The successful host and hostess see to it that all their guests are introduced to each other, if this is possible, so that the best of cordiality and the least restraint may characterize their mingling. _Breakfasts and Luncheons_ Breakfasts may be homelike, informal affairs, or quite ceremonious. The hour of this meal is at any time before one o'clock, usually twelve or twelve-thirty. After one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the affair becomes a luncheon. Men are invited to a breakfast, but usually at a luncheon the guests are all women. A real breakfast menu, such as is often served on Sunday mornings in the country, consists of fruit, cereal, a chop, or steak, or fishballs, with potatoes, eggs in some form, muffins or hot rolls, and coffee, waffles or hot cakes, or, in New England, doughnuts. The menu for luncheon consists usually of soup, fruit, lobster in cutlets or croquettes, with...", "...of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking. There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers. If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he would take him, in the mental disposition in which he now found himself, for a messenger sent by the devil. Milady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope--her only means of safety. But Lord de Winter might suspect him; Felton himself might now be watched! Toward four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the time Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it; he only satisfied himself by Milady's pulse that the case was not serious. In the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her. She had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast...", "...to them.\" \"But just think,\" said Jack, \"of six hundred people being starved to death. It's almost impossible to believe it.\" \"I reckon,\" said Hugh, \"that we'll find a good many of our old friends dead when we get to the camp.\" \"Yes,\" said Joe, \"a good many.\" All day long the horses trotted briskly up the level road along the Teton River. The sun was hot, but a cool breeze blew down from the mountains to the west and the whole country was fresh, green, and charming. About three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they camped on the river at the edge of a grove of cottonwood trees, and unhitching the horses, Joe and Jack picketed them on the fresh green grass. Hugh, meanwhile, had brought some wood and built the campfire, and before long supper was ready. As they sat about after eating, Hugh smoking his pipe, the boys lounging in the warm sunshine, and all watching the sun as it sank toward the west, and the shadows of the cottonwoods grow longer minute by minute, Hugh said to Jack,...", "...to detach from the mouldering floor. The wine was delicious old Neuchatel, and the fowl was stuffed with truffles, and I felt convinced that my two nymphs must have some rudimentary ideas on the subject of stimulants. I should have passed the time pleasantly enough if it had not been for the occasional visits of a rat, who nearly made me sick with his disgusting odour. I remembered that I had been annoyed in the same way at Cologne under somewhat similar circumstances. At last ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> struck, and I heard the pastor's voice as he came downstairs talking; he warned the girls not to play any tricks together, and to go to sleep quietly. That brought back to my memory M. Rose leaving Madame Orio's house at Venice twenty-two years before; and reflecting on my character I found myself much changed, though not more reasonable; but if I was not so sensible to the charms of the sex, the two beauties who were awaiting me were much superior to Madame Orio's nieces....", "...and _pr\u00eatres_, scuffling and shoving together. Careless at once of grammar and of grace, I pulled and shouted with the best, till at length our plunder was caught, corded and poised on an herculean neck. We followed in the wake, H. trembling lest the cord should break, and we experience a pre-Alpine avalanche. At length, however, we breathed more freely in rooms _au quatri\u00e8me of Hotel de l'Univers_. After dinner we drove to the cathedral. It was St. John's eve. \"At twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-night,\" said H., \"the spirits of all who are to die this year will appear to any who will go alone into the dark cathedral and summon them\"! We were charmed with the interior. Twilight hid all the dirt, cobwebs, and tawdry tinsel; softened the outlines, and gave to the immense arches, columns, and stained windows a strange and thrilling beauty. The distant tapers, seeming remoter than reality, the kneeling crowds, the heavy vesper chime, all combined to realize, H. said, her...", "...least by name. There was Steve Murray, the labor leader, whom rumor said was one of Feinheimer's financial backers--a large man with a loud voice and the table manners of a Duroc-Jersey. Jimmy took an instinctive dislike to the man the first time that he saw him. And then there was Little Eva, whose real name was Edith. She was a demure looking little girl, who came in every afternoon at four o'clock for her breakfast. She usually came to Jimmy's table when it was vacant, and at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she always ate alone. Later in the evening she would come in again with a male escort, who was never twice the same. \"I wonder what's the matter with me?\" she said to Jimmy one day as he was serving her breakfast. \"I'm getting awfully nervous.\" \"That's quite remarkable,\" said Jimmy. \"I should think any one who smoked as many cigarettes and drank as much whisky as you would have perfect nerves.\" The girl laughed, a rather soft and mellow laugh. \"I suppose I do hit it up...", "...and no order of friars could have done more justice to the repast than we did.... But the component parts of a party of pleasure must be very curiously selected, the mosaic of the society very nicely fitted, or it will inevitably terminate unpleasantly; and the elements of discord are more dangerous, their effects more lasting, than even the coughs and colds and rheumatisms produced by those watery elements, sworn foes to all picnics and gipsy parties in our foggy island. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we remounted our horses, and retraced our path through the woods; and who could ruminate on petty disputes, or complain of trifling accidents, or not forget any disagreeable individuals who might have been found among our numerous party, when the splendid panorama of Mexico burst upon us, with all its mountains, lakes, and plains, its churches, and towers, and gardens, bathed in a flood of golden light, the rich crimson clouds of sunset resting upon the snow of the volcanoes,...", "...house, gentle-mans,\" he said, \"belongs to Senora Rojas.\" Though the house was one hundred yards from the road, as though fearful of being overheard, the negro spoke in an impressive whisper. \"She is the lady of General Rojas. He is a great General, gentle-mans, and now he be put in prison. President Alvarez, he put that General Rojas in prison, down in the water, an' he chain him to the rock, an' he put that lady in exile. President Alvarez he be very bad man. \"Every day at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that lady and the young ladies they stand on that cliff and pray for that General Rojas. You like me to drive you, gentle-mans, out here at six o'clock,\" he inquired insinuatingly, \"an' see those ladies pray?\" \"Certainly not!\" exclaimed Roddy indignantly. But Peter, more discreet, yawned and stirred impatiently. \"I am just dying for something to eat!\" he protested. \"Let her out, driver.\" For appearance's sake they drove nearly to the outskirts of Otrabanda, and then, as...", "...to their shining eyes in snow.

You may tell the proprietor if you see fit to do so, but no one else must know.\" \"But the secret service men must be told.\" \"Not now,\" Ned replied. \"I have an idea that I can restore the lieutenant to his friends without any row being made over the matter.\" \"But how? I don't understand.\" \"At least,\" Ned urged, \"wait until two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow morning.

If I fail, why, then you must notify the secret service men and look for me in some of the pools about Gatun.\" The clerk finally consented to this arrangement, and in ten minutes Ned and his chums were speeding toward Gatun on a railroad motor car.

They were exceedingly desirous of them, judging, no doubt, that they would greatly improve their own breed, which is rather small. Feenou also got from us two rabbits, a buck and a doe; and, before we sailed, we were told that young ones had been already produced. If the cattle succeed, of which I make no doubt, it will be a vast acquisition to these islands; and as Tongataboo is a fine level country, the horses cannot but be useful. On the 10th, at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, we weighed anchor, and, with a steady gale at S.E., turned through the channel, between the small isles called Makkahaa and Monooafai, it being much wider than the channel between the last-mentioned island and Pangimodoo.

And even if I were interned how would that help you? Be sensible and get ready to accompany me to New York on the five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train.

He said he was compelled to get the dye formulae and would return within a few days. \"I shall come too,\" Mrs. Kinney observed. \"I left a lot of my things at the flat and I shall need them.\" It seemed to Trent that she was not deceived by his words; and while he would have preferred to leave her in Maine he...", "...Brown read it again at the breakfast table. \"'Mr. Graham desires to announce,'\" she read, \"'that two young ladies have suggested the name he has been most pleased with--Swallow and _Hirondelle_.

The coffee turned out to be the greatest kind of joke; one of the men asked Hewson if he could say on his honor that it was really any better than St. John's coffee there before them, and another professed to be in a secret more recondite than had yet been divined: it was that long grim girl, who served it; she had lured Hewson from his rest at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning; and this humorist proposed a Welsh rarebit some night at the inn, where they could all see for themselves why Hewson broke out of the house and smashed a trellis before sunrise.

In fact it was only his surface mind which was employed with what was going on; as before, his deeper thought was again absorbed with his great experience. He could not, if his conscience had otherwise suffered him, have spoken...", "...their bearing and expression. I led them on to speak of the President, rejoicing when I elicited open murmurs and covert threats at his base ingratitude to the men on whose support his power rested.

As usual, Captain Fish, annoyed beyond measure at his bad luck and the head winds, had been holding on to take advantage of a favorable slant in a whole-sail breeze, which was developing into a hard gale. He had time and distance to make up and he was going to lose no opportunity with either. As the wind was rising, and the sea, too, he had remained on deck during Salver's watch, and at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning the watch had taken in the royals and the flying jib. At two o'clock the captain, staring up through the darkness at the jumping, quivering to'gall'nt masts, decided that the time had come to furl the light canvas and take a double reef in the tops'ls, in preparation for the blow obviously at hand. He waited so long, however, before coming to this decision, that he realized that he had perilously little time left in which to get the canvas off her without...", "...He knelt beside her. \"You have been too kind to me--Elise,\" he said unsteadily. \"I went away from you because I feared lest I should lose command of myself; lest I should forget that I was--what I am.\" At the sound of his voice pronouncing her name a strange, sudden happiness shone in her eyes.

About eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a slight breeze sprung up from the westward, and the vessel was standing under reefed mainsail, whole foresail, and topsail, and jib. Towards nine, the wind shifted to the southward, and a small dark cloud was observed hovering over the land.

About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mr. Magruder's brother was surprised to observe Mrs. Magruder softly stealing up stairs, with the members of the \"sewing circle\" following her noiselessly in single file. In her hand Mrs. Magruder carried a volume. If her brother-in-law had conceived the idea that the book might contain the tender strains of some sweet singer amid whose glowing imagery this woman reveled with the ecstasy of a sensitive nature, he would have been mistaken, for the work was entitled \"Thompson on...", "...hindered in doing what he agreed to do, he should come and mention his reason, or if he could not come himself, he should send word by some other. In the case, that he would neglect to do the one or the other, we would send, to inquire for the reason of his having neglected his duty. This was to be mentioned for the right comprehension of the unexpected events which we must in this connexion of things report as briefly as possible. In the night from Palm Sunday to Monday I was at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by a shock suddenly awakened and I heard the voice: \"Arise and take from the catalogue those who had neither brought their contributions, nor the excuse why they could not do so, and excommunicate them on the next Sunday solemnly from Christ's Church.\" I arose directly, made light, took them from my catalogue and put them on another paper. Then I became suddenly very drowsy and returned to bed. When I arose at the usual time, I reflected upon the unexpected communication, and I...", "...That night the pains passed away, and her usual health returned. On Holy Thursday the same sufferings were experienced, commencing in the afternoon and becoming very intense during Thursday night. On Friday the stigmata appeared on the surfaces of both hands and on the upper surface of both feet. Blood also oozed from her side. During the day her sufferings were indescribable, and were witnessed by a large number of people.[59] The stigmata and suffering continued unabated until twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Friday night, when she suddenly experienced some relief, and was able, for the first time in twenty-four hours, to take a little water. On the next day she attended divine service in church, and has since been in the enjoyment of excellent health. The marks of the stigmata remain on her hands and side. She has never, at any time during her sufferings, been unconscious, except when they were so intense as to cause momentary delirium. She prayed continually, and her...", "...which offended him most.\" Therefore there were rumours in the air that the chancellor's fall was imminent; nor were the efforts of his son-in-law, the Duke of York, able to protect him, for the friends of my Lady Castlemaine openly told his majesty \"it would not consist with his majesty's honour to be hectored out of his determination to dismiss the chancellor by his brother, who was wrought upon by his wife's crying.\" It therefore happened on the 26th of August, 1667, as early as ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, Lord Clarendon waited at Whitehall on the king, who presently, accompanied by his brother, received him with characteristic graciousness. Whereon the old man, acknowledging the monarch's courtesy, said he \"had no suit to make to him, nor the least thought to dispute with him, or to divert him from the resolution he had taken; but only to receive his determination from himself, and most humbly to beseech him to let him know what fault he had committed, that had...", "...be brought back when one wished. He was a boy without reason, who sometimes, if the whim seized him, would gallop off like an untamed animal. And old Mme. Rougon, overruled and furious at having been unable to make any preparation, was at last obliged to yield, in the necessity in which she found herself of leaving the matter to chance. \"Well, be it as you wish, then! Good Heavens, how unfortunately things have turned out!\" Martine hurried away to order the landau, and before three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> had struck the horses were on the Nice road, descending the declivity which slopes down to the bridge over the Viorne. Then they turned to the left, and followed the wooded banks of the river for about two miles. After this the road entered the gorges of the Seille, a narrow pass between two giant walls of rock scorched by the ardent rays of the summer sun. Pine trees pushed their way through the clefts; clumps of trees, scarcely thicker at the roots than tufts of grass,...", "...She wore a black velvet bonnet and Chantilly veil, a crimson silk pelisse trimmed with rich furs, a boa of Russian sable; and, over all, a loose pelisse, lined with fur. Mazzuolo and his wife thought that this augured well for the contents of her trunks.

The stage was very long, and it was eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before they reached their first relay of horses, by which time the young traveller had decided that she had great reason to be satisfied with her companions. The Italian was polite and entertaining; he had travelled a great deal, and was full of anecdote; and being naturally lively and garrulous, the design he entertained of taking away the life of his charge did not prevent his making himself agreeable to her in the meantime. With his well-seared conscience, he neither felt...", "...and Taylor from their post. This movement compelled William Thompson and Newby to abandon their station at the Shenandoah bridge, and seek shelter in the armory. The Galt House was then occupied by Captain Botts's company, while Captain Avis took a position near the crest of Bolivar Heights, overlooking the town, from where he opened fire upon the armory. Newby was killed by this fire before he reached the armory enclosure. It is said that his body was shockingly mutilated. About 1 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Leeman sought to effect his escape. He left the arsenal and attempted to cross the Potomac, a short distance above the bridge, and succeeded in getting as far as a small island in the river, where he was overtaken and killed by a Mr. A. G. Schoppert. The body of the late captain, his commission in his pocket, as it lay upon the rocks in the river, became an object for target practice, by citizens, and by members of the volunteer military companies then assembling. During the...", "...the most of what was at his hand, grumbled and shook his head; but Uncle Clair only smiled, and said, \"You'll be wiser when you are older, my boy. Knowledge comes with years.\" Mrs. Gregory's presents caused Mrs. Clair to think that she was sorry for her neglect of Bertie, and meant to be kinder to him in future; besides, Uncle Gregory had said there might be other arrangements when he returned, so that it was with a very hopeful heart that Bertie entered the office punctually at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the 2nd of January, and was taking his old corner to await the arrival of his uncle, when the head clerk conducted him into the inner room, and pointed out a seat at a desk near a window looking into a narrow court. \"Go through all those letters,\" the clerk said, pointing to a huge heap; \"select the circulars, open them, and place them on that stand; arrange all the English and foreign letters on Mr. Gregory's table, and then address those envelopes from that book on your...", "...a forgiving smile through her tears. \"You're a dreadful Buttinsky, Daddy Ricks!\" she protested.

At the corner of California and Drumm Streets he saw Matt Peasley and hailed him. The latter came to the carriage door and looked in. \"It's all right, Matt,\" Cappy said with a cunning wink. \"I've fixed Florry's clock for her. There won't be the slightest trouble.\" Matt Peasley wrung his hand gratefully. \"I quit the Sea Fox last night,\" he announced gladly. \"Going into...", "...being against human being. It is my belief that autocracy and the dynasty of the Hohenzollerns will crumble into ruin as a result of today's negotiations, just as surely as though we sacrificed God knows how many more lives to achieve a greater measure of military triumph.\" The Prime Minister rang the bell. \"You are an honest man, Julian Orden,\" he said, \"and a decent emissary. You will reply that we take the twenty-four hours for reflection. That means that we shall meet at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow evening.\" He held out his hand in farewell, an action which somehow sent Julian away a happier man.

At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mr. Underhill walked up for his little girl, whose cheeks were pink and her eyes shining like stars. He sat on the stoop and talked a little while with Mr. Dean, and said most cordially the other girls must come and take tea with Hanny. And if they liked he would take them out driving some day. That was a most delightful proposal. Jim let the whole school know the next week that his \"big brother\" had won a prize of one hundred dollars. And when Joseph passed with honor and...", "...this night Bonaparte sent in haste for Real. In his usual manner, by brief questions he soon learned the number of royalists confined in the tower of the Temple or at Bicetre, their names, and on what suspicions they had been arrested. Quickly satisfied on all these points he ordered that before daylight four of the most deeply implicated of the prisoners should be taken before a military commission; if they revealed nothing they were to be shot in twenty-four hours. Aroused at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, Desmarets was told to prepare the list, and the first two names indicated were those of Picot and Lebourgeois. Picot was one of Frotte's old officers, and during the wars of the Chouannerie had been commander-in-chief of the Auge division. He had earned the surname of \"Egorge-Bleus\" and was a Chevalier of St. Louis.

I am alone in the world--let me suffer; can bear it.\" We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by--that was the town, you know--and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right.

At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Channing ceased writing and stood up, shivering and shaking with a violent chill. He cursed himself for this weakness, and called aloud for the captain. \"I can't stop now,\" he cried. He seized the rough fist of the captain as a child clings to the hand of his nurse. \"Give me something,\" he begged. \"Medicine, quinine, give me something to keep my head straight until it's finished. Go, quick,\" he commanded. His teeth were chattering, and his body jerked with sharp,...", "...of battle. We regained the village, which sheltered us for a time. The enemy started in pursuit. Unluckily, as we issued from the village, our guns traversing a hollow road, we were stopped by ditches and channels full of mud, in which the guns stuck fast. As I was trying to disengage them the English reached us, and surrounded us so as to cut off all retreat. Then I surrendered with 3 or 4 officers and about 40 soldiers who were with me, and the guns. It was about 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon of the 15th of January, 1761, a moment whose malign influence it was as it were impossible to resist, since it was that of the surrender of Pondicherry,[117] a place 300 leagues away from us.\" Gholam Husain Khan has left a graphic description of this incident. \"Monsieur Law, with the small force and the artillery which he could muster, bravely fought the English themselves, and for some time he made a shift to withstand their superiority....", "...distraught, a hundred children permanently injure their eyes watching the moving films, and hundreds more seriously model their conduct upon the standards set before them on this mimic stage.

The first step was to join Washington on the Hudson and at any rate alarm Clinton as to an imminent attack on New York and hold him to that spot. After nearly a year of idleness the French soldiers were delighted that now at last there was to be an active movement. The long march from Newport to New York began. In glowing June, amid the beauties of nature, now overcome by intense heat and obliged to march at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, now drenched by heavy rains, the French plodded on, and joined their American comrades along the Hudson early in July. By the 14th of August Washington knew two things--that a great French fleet under the Comte de Grasse had sailed for the Chesapeake and that the British army had reached Yorktown. Soon the two allied armies, both lying on the east side of the Hudson, moved southward. On the 20th of August the Americans began to cross the river at King's Ferry,...", "...shook hands with him, but spoke not a word. Late the same night Sidney penned a letter to Michael Snowdon. In the morning he read it over, and instead of putting it into an envelope, locked it away in one of his drawers.

The business was that of walking aimlessly about Clerkenwell, in mud and fog. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he came to Farringdon Road Buildings, and with a glance up towards the Hewetts' window he was passing by when a hand clutched at him.

So were the books, photographs, etc. Billy and I took in the sights, and felt mighty interested in it all. It was better than a circus to us. At about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we meandered homeward. We talked late that night about what we had seen, and it was after midnight before we fell asleep. Billy was unaccountably restless that night and kept a-tossing and a-rolling. He kept this up so long that finally I got huffy and asked him what the trouble was.

The old tranquil existence at the Peel had become impossible for him now. It was intolerable to him to be cut off from all direct communication with Miss Stedman, and one day he went boldly to Chesnut Hill. He went there, not under cover of the darkness, as cowardly lovers do, but in the broad openness of such daylight as is ever to be seen in Sootythorn. I think, however, that it would have needed still greater courage on his part to present himself there about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening; for in the day-time Mr. Stedman was usually at his factory, whereas about eight in the evening a friend might count upon the pleasure of finding him at Chesnut Hill.

It has been remarked as singular, that Lord Langdale (the Master of the Rolls) did not attend in his place on so important an occasion, and take his share in the responsibility of the decision.

It was a heavy iron strong-box, standing on four legs, and was painted in dark green stripes and ornamented on the top surface and lock with leaves and flowers. The sum stolen meant a small fortune in those days. The counting-house had a window...", "...through swamps and forests, they found themselves at daybreak only two miles from their point of departure.

'twas not worth coming for after all, for it is all full of holes!\" As he said this, the cock crew; whereupon the fiend, turning round to the man, exclaimed: \"If it had not been for the bird you have got there under your arm, I would have your skin too.\" But, thanks to the cock, the man got home safe again....", "...the men, none looked so well as those of a deep crimson colour on some of the horsemen; but the clear white tobes of the mahommedan priests, of whom not less than a hundred were present on the occasion, were extremely neat and becoming. The sport terminated without the slightest accident, and the king dismounting was a signal for the people to disperse. CHAPTER XXXV. The travellers left Kiama on Saturday June 5th, and arrived at Kakafungi, the halting place, shortly after ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The distance from Kiama was about ten miles. It was a straggling, but extensive and populous town, and was delightfully situated on an even piece of ground. The inhabitants were so clean and well behaved, and their dwellings so neat and comfortable, that before the Landers had spoken many words to one of them, they were prepossessed in their favour. Nor was this opinion in any degree lessened, when after they had been introduced into a commodious and excellent...", "...gas possesses an elevating force of about 700 grams for every cubic meter. But hydrogen possesses an ascensional force estimated at 1,100 grams per cubic meter. Pure hydrogen prepared according to the method of the celebrated Henry Gifford filled the enormous balloon. And as the capacity of the \"Go-Ahead\" was 40,000 cubic meters, the ascensional power of the gas she contained was 40,000 multiplied by 1,100 or 44,000 kilograms. On this 29th of April everything was ready. Since eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the enormous aerostat had been floating a few feet from the ground ready to rise in mid-air. It was splendid weather and seemed to have been made specially for the experiment, although if the breeze had been stronger the results might have been more conclusive. There had never been any doubt that a balloon could be guided in a calm atmosphere; but to guide it when the atmosphere is in motion is quite another thing; and it is under such circumstances that the experiment should...", "...which will end before it has begun, since it's very apparent his only reason for flight must be that he killed Philip Darwin,\" I said with a laugh. \"Oh, no,\" responded McKelvie, coolly, \"he is clever and unprincipled, and all kinds of a blackguard, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if he had a couple of murders to his name, but this I do know. He did not murder Philip Darwin.\" CHAPTER XXXVII M'KELVIE'S TRIUMPH When we drove into the grounds of the Darwin home at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night, McKelvie ordered me to hide my car behind the garage and then to join him in the passageway. As I obeyed I saw him helping Lee, with Cora's aid, to mount the steps to the back door, for he wanted the two of them for purposes of identification, since both had been victims of the unprincipled man we had come there to-night to try to trap. I parked my car where it could not be seen by anyone approaching the house and then returned to the servants' wing and entered...", "...his own dwelling. And the king withdraws to the interior of his palace by that gate which I have already mentioned -- that which stands between the two buildings that are in the arena (TERREYRO); the courtesans and bayaderes[442] remain dancing in front of the temple and idol for a long time. This is what is done during the morning of each day of these nine days, with the ceremonies I have mentioned, and each day more splendid (than the last). Now, returning to the feasts. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon every one comes to the palace. They do not admit every one at once (they allowed us to go into the open part that is between the gates), but there go inside only the wrestlers and dancing-women, and the elephants, which go with their trappings and decorations, those that sit on them being armed with shields and javelins, and wearing quilted tunics.[443] As soon as these are inside they range themselves round the arena, each one in his place, and the wrestlers...", "...reason, except perhaps, that we were too tired to move, and we sat there, in the dark, listening to the rumbling of heavy wheels over in the Federal lines, and talking about the events of the last few days, speculating about what was to come. Then our thoughts ran on other days, and scenes, and the folks at home, and we talked about these until we became quite sentimental. Several times it was suggested that we had better go to sleep, but we talked ourselves wide awake. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> it was again suggested, but Dan said he did wish we had something to eat first. This was a most agreeable thought, and in discussing the same it was discovered that I had a corncake, Dan had some coffee, and Beau some sugar. So we resolved, before lying down, to go back under the hill, some fifty yards behind the works, where a fire was kept burning or smoldering all the time, and have a little supper of bread and coffee, which we proceeded to do. We made up the fire, got water...", "...eleven o'clock till two beat perpendicularly upon the top of my feet, betwixt the shoes and the trousers. Not feeling it disagreeable, or being in the least aware of painful consequences, as I had been barefoot for months, I neglected to put on a pair of short stockings which I had with me. I did not reflect that sitting still in one place, with your feet exposed to the sun, was very different from being exposed to the sun while in motion. We went ashore in the Essequibo about three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, to choose a place for the night's residence, to collect firewood, and to set the fish-hooks. It was then that I first began to find my legs very painful: they soon became much inflamed and red and blistered; and it required considerable caution not to burst the blisters, otherwise sores would have ensued. I immediately got into the hammock, and there passed a painful and sleepless night, and for two days after I was disabled from walking. About midnight, as...", "...a course by which they may avoid dangers and find safety.\" The narrative of the expedition was published in five volumes in Philadelphia, 1845. The extracts which follow are from Vol. V., chapter VIII. From 1844 to 1874 the Government of the United States published twenty-eight volumes reciting in detail the scientific results of the expedition.] At daylight, on the 13th of January, 1842, we were again under way, with a light air, and at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> reached the roadstead, where we anchored in six fathoms of water, with good holding ground. A number of vessels were lying in the roads, among which were several Americans loading with hemp. There was also a large English East Indiaman, manned by Lascars, whose noise rendered her more like a floating Bedlam than anything else to which I can liken it. The view of the city and country around Manila partakes both of a Spanish and an Oriental character. The sombre and...", "...I spent an uncomfortable night, on account of my constrained posture, the insects which annoyed me, and the steersman, who always played an agreeable tune upon his bugle whenever he approached a lock. During the night we passed an aqueduct bridge, which stands over a solace, called Little Falls. Towards morning we passed through a well-cultivated region, with some neat houses, called German flats, and which was settled by some Germans during the time of Queen Anne. At about twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at noon we arrived at Utica, nine miles from the place where we passed a lock, which is the last that occurs in the next seventy miles. The land appeared to be marshy, and consisted of sand and pebbles. Utica, which is intersected by the canal, is a flourishing town, of about four thousand inhabitants, and stands upon the site where Fort Schuyler, a redoubt against the Indians, was formerly situated. In 1794, there was a small tavern here, which was the only dwelling house in...", "...while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against -------- --------. after which the articles shall be exhibited; and then the Presiding Officer of the Senate shall inform the managers that the Senate will take proper order on the subject of the impeachment, of which due notice shall be given to the House of Representatives.

Before proceeding to the consideration of the articles of impeachment the Presiding Officer shall...", "...rim of the Yangtze gorge and there the view of the great chasm was even more magnificent than that we had left. While its sides are not fantastically sculptured and the colors are softer than those of the Grand Canon of the Colorado, nevertheless its grandeur is hardly less imposing and awe-inspiring. If Yuen-nan is ever made accessible by railroads this gorge should become a Mecca for tourists, for it is without doubt one of the most remarkable natural sights in the world. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon we saw three clusters of houses on a tableland which juts into a chasm cut by a tributary of the great river. One of them was Phete and it seemed that we would reach the village in half an hour at least, but the road wound so tortuously around the hillside, down to the stream and up again that it was an hour and a half before we found a camping place on a narrow terrace a short distance from the nearest houses. Next day we could not go to the village to find...", "...entreating him also to atone for his crime by an unreserved and full confession which should help to liberate from the sin of rebellion against the Divine laws and the sacred Majesty of the Ruler, our Christ-loving land--the prisoner opens his lips for the first time during this morning's audience and in a loud, clear voice rejects the venerable Chaplain's ministrations. \"At eleven o'clock the Court pronounces in summary form the death sentence. \"The execution is fixed for four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, subject to further instructions from superior authorities.\" Councillor Mikulin dropped the page of foolscap, glanced down his beard, and turning to Razumov, added in an easy, explanatory tone-- \"We saw no object in delaying the execution. The order to carry out the sentence was sent by telegraph at noon. I wrote out the telegram myself. He was hanged at four o'clock this afternoon.\" The definite information of Haldin's death gave Razumov the feeling of...", "...E dward. 3. R ebecca. 4. S elina. 5. E mma. 6. V era. 7. E velyn. 8.

He was standing on some scaffolding when a platform gave way under his very feet, and he broke his spinal cord. In other words he was hanged. His Solicitor urged him to make a Will and the prison Chaplain added his earnest entreaties, but Mr. Hibbert turned a deaf ear to all such suggestions. Even the sight of his Wife and only child did not affect his determination, and he died...", "...you needn't wait any longer.\" So the other Italian went out, too. And then Peter T. Brown turned loose and talked the way he done when me and Jonadab first met him. He just spread himself. He told of this bargain that he'd made and that sharp trade he had turned, while we set there and listened and laughed like a parsel of fools. And every time that Ebenezer'd get up to go to bed, Peter'd trot out a new yarn and he'd have to stop to listen to that. And it got to be eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and then twelve and then one. It was just about quarter past one and we was laughing our heads off at one of Brown's jokes, when out under the back window there was a jingle and a thump and a kind of groaning and wiggling noise. \"What on earth is that?\" says Dillaway. \"I shouldn't be surprised,\" says Peter, cool as a mack'rel on ice, \"if that was his royal highness, the count.\" He took up the lamp and we all hurried outdoors and 'round the corner.

If the first day of a year or month begins and ends at midnight, does not every other day?

The result was the council broke up in one big row and Martha Scroggs spent the afternoon unengaged. About five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Bailey came over to the track, where we were going through the last sad rites, and hauled me aside. \"Take off those togs, kid,\" he said. \"I've got a stunt.

(585) We now halted and remained in line for perhaps two hours, expecting to have a battle that day. The boys of the Twelfth seemed confident. There was no disposition shown by any to flinch. They no doubt were cheered by the thought that for once, since joining Grant's army, they were about to get a whack at the Rebs without having to fight them behind breast works; when about 9 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> A.M., the order came very unexpectedly and to our great gratification and relief, to cease firing until further orders. We did not then know that a flag of truce had been sent by Gen.

It was seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next evening when the partners observed an unusual stir in the camp. They came into the mess-house to find that the men had eaten in unusually short order; and from the bench outside, usually filled at that hour with laughing loungers, there was not a sound. A strange stillness had invaded the colony of the Croix d'Or, almost ominous. Preoccupied, and each thinking over his individual trials, the partners ate their food and arose from the table. Out on the doorstep they...", "...derived from it the liveliest pleasures. I returned home on foot, with a light step, my head full of sonorous phrases, and my mind haunted by delightful visions.

The Baron, primed with a bottle of champagne, and arrayed in a costume which Mr Bunker had assured him was the very latest extreme of fashion, and which included a scarlet watered silk waistcoat, a pair of white silk socks, and a lavender tie, was in a condition of cheerfulness verging closely on hilarity. Mr Bunker, that, as he said, he might better serve as a foil to his friend's splendour, went more...", "...can see the dancing.\" The matter was settled. CHAPTER XII ONE MAN'S MEAT ... That night after the Marshalls had gone back to their somewhat shabby boarding-house, \"things\" happened to the two people they had left in the great hotel. Sylvia and Judith never knew the details, but it was apparent that something portentous had occurred, from the number of telegrams Aunt Victoria had managed to receive and send between the hour when they left her in the evening, and eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning, when they found her, hatted and veiled, with an array of strapped baggage around her. \"It's Arnold again!\" she told them, with a resigned gesture. She laid down the time-table she had been consulting and drew Mrs. Marshall to the window for a low-voiced explanation. When she came back, \"I'm so sorry, dears, to cut short even by a single day this charming time together,\" she told the girls. \"But the news I've been getting from Arnold's school--there's...", "...almost in the manner of a vulture.

And what a day for an excursion!\" By nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all was ready. Along the land a mild south wind was blowing. Though the day was probably the 5th of October or thereabout, no signs of autumn yet were blazoned in the forest. The morning was perfect, and the travelers' spirits rose in unison with the abounding beauty of the day. Stern had given the Pauillac another final going over, tightening the stays and laterals, screwing up here a loosened nut, there a bolt, making certain all was in perfect order. At nine-fifteen,...", "...of Dordtrecht, may have thought of his theology, it had at least taught him forgiveness of his enemies, kindness to his friends, and submission to the will of the Omnipotent. Every moment of his last days on earth had been watched and jealously scrutinized, and his bitterest enemies had failed to discover one trace of frailty, one manifestation of any vacillating, ignoble, or malignant sentiment. The drums had been sounding through the quiet but anxiously expectant town since four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning, and the tramp of soldiers marching to the Inner Court had long been audible in the prison chamber. Walaeus now came back with a message from the judges. \"The high commissioners,\" he said, \"think it is beginning. Will my Lord please to prepare himself?\" \"Very well, very well,\" said the prisoner. \"Shall we go at once?\" But Walaeus suggested a prayer.

The garret, looking over the gateway, was approached by a passage having a door opening into the street,...", "...I asked for him, Parks told me that he had not seen him since the day before. I confess that Godfrey's indifference to the fate of the cabinet surprised me greatly; besides, I was hoping that he would wish to meet the fascinating Frenchman. More fascinating, if possible, than he had been on Monday, and I soon found myself completely under his spell. There had been less delay than he had anticipated in getting the cabinet off the boat and through the customs, and it was not yet three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when we reached the Vantine house. \"I haven't seen Mr. Godfrey,\" Parks repeated, \"but there's others here as it fair breaks my heart to see.\" He motioned toward the door of the music-room, and, stepping to it, I saw that the inventory was already in progress. The man in charge of it nodded to me, but I did not go in, for the sight was anything but a pleasant one. \"The cabinet is in the room across the hall,\" I said to M.

Yet thus we made a shift to bear up with the side of the vessel against the wind for a while; but the wind still increasing about one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, we put right away before wind and sea, continuing to run thus all the afternoon and part of the night ensuing. The wind continued increasing all the afternoon, and the sea still swelled higher, and often broke, but did us no damage; for the ends of the vessel being very narrow, he that steered received and broke the sea on his back, and so kept it from coming in so much as to endanger the vessel: though much water would come in, which we were forced to keep...", "...illumination of the sky which he attributed at the time to an auroral glare. Lowe, in Nottinghamshire confirmed Hind's statement of the appearance of the heavens on the same day. The sky had a yellow auroral glare-like look, and the Sun, though shining, gave but feeble light. The comet was plainly visible at 7.45 p. m. (during sunshine), and had a much more hazy appearance than on any subsequent evening. Lowe adds that his Vicar had the pulpit candles lighted in the Parish Church at 7 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> (it was a Sunday), though only five days had elapsed since Midsummer day, which itself proves that some sensation of darkness was felt even while the Sun was shining. So far as I remember there has been no such thing as a comet panic during the present generation, at any rate in civilised countries, but it is on record that there was a very considerable panic in 1832 in connection with the return of Biela's Comet in the winter of that year. Olbers as the result of a careful...", "...now we had both pumps going and as many bailing as could; and by this means the water began to decrease; which gave me some hope of saving the ship.

About 11 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night the boatswain came to me and told me that the leak still increased; and that the plank was so rotten it broke away like dirt; and that now it was impossible to save the ship; for they could not come at the leak because the water in the room was got above it. The rest of the night we spent in pumping and bailing. I worked myself to encourage my men, who were very diligent; but the water still increased, and we now thought of nothing but saving our lives. Wherefore I...", "...and presenting so many characters is being disclosed upon its stage. It was said that Mrs. Holton emerged from Amzi's house daily to take the air. She had been observed by credible witnesses at the stamp window of the post-office; again, she had bought violets at the florist's; she had been seen walking across the Madison campus. The attendants in the new Carnegie library had been thrilled by a visit from a strange lady who could have been none other than Mrs. Holton. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the afternoon of January 2, Mrs. Holton drank a cup of bouillon at Struby's counter, informed the white-jacketed attendant that it was excellent, and crossed Main Street to Montgomery's Bank under the admiring eyes of a dozen young collegians who happened to be loafing in the drug-store. Amzi escorted his sister at once to his private room at the rear, poked the fire, buttoned his coat and sat down. \"Well, Lois, how goes it?\" His question was the one he habitually asked...", "...was gone for good, though while the belief was growing there would come another shrieking outrush and a low roaring in the chimney, and such a shrill and doleful whistling in the casements, which there was no art in carpentry to hermetically seal against the winds of that wild, rugged western coast, as might have made one imagine the air to be filled with the ghosts of departed boatswains plying their silver pipes as they sped onwards in the race of black air. Some while before seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> it had settled into a gale, that was slowly but obstinately gathering in power, as I might know by the gradually raised notes in the humming it made, and by the ever-deepening thunder of warring billows rushing into breakers and bursting upon sand and crag. It came along in a furious play of wet, too, at times; the rain lashed the windows like small shot, and twice there was a brilliant flash of lightning that seemed spiral and crimsoned; but, if thunder followed, it was lost...", "...the same wherever he fixed his summer residence, was to rise with the dawn, and, after making himself an early cup of coffee, to enjoy the fresh delights of early morning by going for a long walk in the surrounding forest.

By four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he was generally in Frau Schumann's balcony for afternoon coffee and to pass an hour with her in music, conversation, or walking. More often than not he returned to supper at half-past seven, when his place was laid at table, as a matter of course, at Frau Schumann's right hand.

Having reached the Gare du Nord at six o'clock in the morning, we scrutinized the faces at the exit with the same gratifying result. Thus freed from anxiety, we enjoyed at the Hotel Continental a prolonged sleep, which was haunted by pleasing dreams. By eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that evening we found ourselves at the Gare de Lyon, disposing our belongings in a compartment of the wagon-lit which ended its course at Ventimiglia.

I turned round, and there was the very friend whom Jerningham had identified but too correctly at Calais. I took the bull by the horns. I greeted him with the utmost...", "...and, as Mr. Lemons, who was eloquent on the subject, said, it was calculated to appeal to a man's most delicate sensibilities.

Firing with siege guns was commenced at about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and kept up briskly through most of the day. While listening to the firing, expecting momentarily to be called upon, the orders came to hitch up, get two days' rations in haversacks, and ready to march in half an hour. 11 A. M. At this time L. N. Keeler rode up for one man to go foraging. Sergeant Hamilton detailed me. We started with two teams and three men, Bowman, Leffart and myself. We went to the northeast one and one fourth miles, crossed the railroad, found our corn in...", "...blue eyes, into the clear well-spring of the heart beneath. So we threw our arms around her and sobbed without a word! We knew very well that the young clergyman, whose Sunday sermons and gentle admonitions had won all hearts, had been for months a weekly visiter to our fireside circle. With baby Georgie on his knee, and Georgie's brothers and sisters clustered about him, he had sat through many an evening charming the hours away, until the clock startled us with its unwelcome nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> warning; and the softly spoken reminder, \"Girls, it is bed-time!\" woke more than one stifled sigh of regret. Then sister Ellen must always go with us to lay Georgie in his little bed; to hear him and Annette repeat the evening prayer and hymn her lips had taught them; to comb out the long brown braids of Emily's head; to rob Arthur of the story book, over which he would have squandered the \"midnight oil;\" and to breathe a kiss and a blessing over the pillow of each other...", "...o'clock, was directed squarely upon the outer lines of British trenches, bringing havoc and horror in the wake of the exploding shells. It was under this galling bombardment that the men of the second section adjusted their packs, buckled the last strap of their equipment, took firm bold of their rifles, and crouched against the front wall of their trench, ready for the final spring.

It was a sharp blast of a whistle, made by the commanding officer. The next moment, led by Lieutenant Butler, the men were up, sliding over the parapet, worming their way through gaps in their own wire entanglements, and forming in the semblance of a line outside. It all took but a minute, and then the rush toward the enemy trenches began. It seemed as though every gun of every calibre in the German army was let loose upon them. The artillery shortened its range...", "...were most encouraging. On April 18th we rose at half past 5, and commended ourselves to the Lord in prayer for the long journey to San Francisco--undertaken after much waiting upon God--before us; and at half past 8 left St. Louis in a Pullman's car. In the course of the morning we crossed the Missouri, and, the weather being lovely, with vegetation in perfection, the journey was delightful. In the evening we alighted at the supper station to partake of some refreshment, and at 9 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> retired to rest. The little room we occupied was comfortable, and the sleeping arrangements were excellent. Our windows remained shut, but as the six ventilators above them were left open, there was thorough ventilation; and, after passing a good night, at 9 o'clock the next morning we reached Council Bluffs. There, after breakfast, at half past 9, we got into the same train; but, having to take seats in one of the other carriages until the Pullman cars were unlocked, a...", "...Combermere, of Liverpool, which anchored here last night, sailed this afternoon to prosecute her voyage along the coast.

We could see nothing but the sea, which in the night looked as black as ink as it surged among the rocks.

Here he stayed for some minutes. \"We be saafe, I reckon,\" he grunted when he came back; \"ther's nobody here, nobody 'toal. We'll go back to the rock again.

Long flats bounded by slight undulations extended some to the northward, and others to the westward; but their inclination was imperceptible. I passed some hills and plains; and ascending one of the hills, I obtained a fine view.

It was now 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> P.M., and my Blackfellows had left me, as usual; my horse was foot-sore, and neither the poor animal nor myself had tasted water for the last thirty-six hours. Under these circumstances, though I ardently desired to push on to the north-west ranges, I thought it prudent to return; and after a short rest to my horse, during which I chewed some dry pieces of beef, I rode on my way back until 9 o'clock, and then encamped.

In the opposite corner drunken soldiers chatted with the maids of the barracks. M. de Keratry, bent with his eighty years, was seated near the stove on an old worm-eaten chair; the chair tottered; the old man shivered. Towards four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a regiment of Chasseurs de Vincennes arrived in the courtyard with their platters, and began to eat, singing, with loud bursts of merriment. M. de Broglie looked at them and said to M.

The passengers, however, urged their request, the sailors seconding them. The wind was fair, and they could easily run across the Channel, and then, after they landed, the captain could pursue his course to the place of his destination. The captain finally consented; the helm was altered, the sails were trimmed, and the little vessel bore away toward its new destination on the coast of France. It was now five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. The English coast soon disappeared from the horizon, and the next morning, at daylight, they could see the French shore. They approached the land at a little port called Fecamp. The wind, however, failed them before they got quite to the land, and they had to anchor to wait for a turn of the tide to help them in. In this situation, they were soon very much alarmed by the appearance of a vessel in the offing, which was coming also toward the shore. They thought...", "...shamed the fugitives, and re-animated the panic-stricken soldiers. Recovering from their first terror, the soldiers calmly awaited the approach of the Mogul storming-party. An obstinate conflict ensued at the foot of the breach. Again and again did the Moguls press onward--again and again they were driven back by a galling fire of shot and rockets. The ditch was soon more than half filled with dead and dying warriors. Although fresh storming parties succeeded one another from four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon till dark, they were all repulsed with fearful slaughter. At last the Moguls withdrew, discomfited, to their camp.

The valour of Chand Beeby formed the chief subject of conversation...", "...behaviour of the inquisitive foreigner.

To begin with Sunday--early rising was encouraged on this day, as throughout the week, namely, five o'clock in winter and four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in summer. The younger children first assembled in the great hall, where was always a good warm fire in the winter. Here they found Nicholas Ferrar awaiting them, to whom they repeated such chapters or Psalms as they had been given to learn. After this they returned to their rooms to make themselves \"more comely in their best attires.\" Breakfast, and private reading or conversation in their own rooms, went on till nine o'clock, when the bell called them together again....", "...a mystery. On the evening of November 1 a British squadron consisting of the vessels _Good Hope, Otranto, Glasgow_, and _Monmouth_, all except the _Good Hope_ coming through the straits, sighted the enemy. The British ships lined up abreast and proceeded in a northeasterly direction. The Germans took up the same alignment eight miles to the westward of the British ships and proceeded southward at full speed. Both forces opened fire at a distance of 12,000 yards shortly after six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> off Coronel near the coast of Chile. The _Gneisenau_ was struck by a 9.2-inch shot from the _Good Hope_. The _Scharnhorst_ and _Gneisenau_ picked the _Good Hope_ as their first target, but finding that they could do no damage at that range and that they were safe from the fire of the British ship, they came to within 6,000 yards of her. Her fire in reply was augmented by that of the _Monmouth_.

We spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes, opened two quarts of the red wine, set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a ready-made Martini by the colonel's plate, and called him to grub. Colonel Rockingham drew up his campstool, wiped off his specs, and looked at the things on the table. Then I thought he was swearing; and I felt mean because I hadn't taken more pains with...", "...as to invest money in the Funds. Any ordinary person would have feared ridicule, but Castanier knew by experience that a desperate man takes everything seriously. A prisoner lying under sentence of death would listen to the madman who should tell him that by pronouncing some gibberish he could escape through the keyhole; for suffering is credulous, and clings to an idea until it fails, as the swimmer borne along by the current clings to the branch that snaps in his hand. Towards four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that afternoon Castanier appeared among the little knots of men who were transacting private business after 'Change.

Having arrived within what he considered, from his computations, fifteen or twenty miles of the coast, he hove to, at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, to await the break of day, and then bore up, proceeding cautiously on account of a thick fog. As this cleared away, the crew had the satisfaction of seeing the great Sugar-Loaf Rock, which stands on one side of the harbor's mouth, so nearly right ahead that they had not to alter their course above a point in order to hit the entrance of the port.

As she had not prepared the chapter, she could, of course, not answer any of the questions asked; but in spite of that she felt she had never grasped any lesson so thoroughly before: every little detail seemed impressed upon her memory, and she was quite sorry when the class came to an end, and Mademoiselle arrived to take French translation. Eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was the signal for ten minutes' interval for lunch, and most of the girls began at once to leave the room.

It had been decided that each sloop should carry a crew of five, and Jack had selected Andy, Pepper, Dale and Stuffer to accompany him.

An evening or two afterward she returned at about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> from a theatre party, to find that her mother had not yet retired. Mrs. Van Corlear's usual bed-time was a very exact ten o'clock. The mother and daughter talked for a little while together in low tones. When Pauline went into her own chamber that night, her face was pale and her heart was beating. At a great afternoon reception which took place two days later, Courtlandt, who made his appearance after five o'clock, coming up town from the law-office in which he managed by...", "...the carnage that would have ensued. So great was Washington's anxiety at this time that he is said not to have slept during forty-eight hours, and rarely to have dismounted from his horse. One account of the retreat is as follows: \"A disadvantageous wind and rain at first prevented the troops from embarking, and it was feared that the retreat could not be effected that night. But about eleven o'clock a favorable breeze sprung up, the tide turned in the right direction, and about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, a thick fog arose which hung over Long Island, while on the New York side it was clear. During the night, the whole American army, nine thousand in number, Washington embarking last of all, with all the artillery, such heavy ordnance as was of any value, ammunition, provision, cattle, horses, carts, and everything of importance, passed safely over. \"All this was effected without the knowledge of the British, although the enemy were so nigh that they were heard...", "...giggled and were sharply rebuked: I gave vent to an inarticulate guttural sound and was also rebuked. After parade I went to my barrack-room, changed my uniform, and disappeared to escape ridicule. \"What cheer, Condor?\" were the first words that greeted me at reveille next morning, and my room-mates kept it up. Sometimes the ridicule worked overtime. Often I was on the edge of a wild outburst of passion and resentment, but I mastered these things and went on with my duties. At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the forenoon of the day following my assignment, we \"mustered kits.\" This is the ordinary pre-embarkation inspection. After inspection we packed our kits and were stood to attention. Several corrections were made in the instructions of the previous day. My heart almost stopped beating when my name was called a second time. \"A mistake was made----\" The officer got no farther. \"I knew it, begorra!\" I exclaimed, with flushed face and beating heart. The officer came...", "...it, was a deep and precipitous chalk-pit, now disused. This pit was some little distance from the road itself, and was not noticeable by persons unacquainted with the locality. It had been there no one knew how long, and was a favourite resort of adventurous children, a footpath to the village passing not far from its edge. Towards this chalk-pit the startled party of rescue from the house hurried with one consent, several of them carrying lanterns or extemporised torches. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was striking in the distant church-tower as they gathered round the spot from which the cries for help had proceeded. A terrible sight was dimly revealed to them in the uncertain glare cast upon it by the lights which they carried. Hanging over the edge of the chalk-pit was the squire's carriage. One horse had broken away from the traces, but the other was struggling violently, and seemed likely, in its plungings, to force the carriage still further over the precipitous side...", "...unsafe. Plans were drawn and steps taken to build a new church edifice. On the first Sunday in March, 1871, the old house of worship, on the corner of Nineteenth and I streets was abandoned, and the congregation went to worship in the Stevens School building. The corner-stone of the new building was laid on the 5th of April, 1871, and the new edifice dedicated on the 19th of November, 1871, five months after the work had begun. The dedicatory exercises were as follows: At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> precisely. Rev. D. W. Anderson, pastor in charge, announced that the hour for the religious exercises to commence had arrived, and he took pleasure in introducing his predecessor. Rev. Samuel W. Madden, of Alexandria, Va., who gave out the 934th hymn, which was sung with considerable fervor and spirit, the entire congregation rising and participating; after which, Rev. Jas. A. Handy, read from the 6th chapter, 2d Chronicles, and also addressed the throne of grace. \"Lift up...", "...took us to the tent of Lord Henry Seymour, who is an old friend of his; he breakfasted here to-day, and his plain English civility, and quiet good sense, was a fine contrast to the mob, etc. Dapple, [Footnote: Maria Edgeworth's horse.] your old acquaintance, did not like all the sights at the camp as well as I did. _Oct 3, '98._ My father went to Dublin the day before yesterday, to see Lord Cornwallis about the Court of Enquiry on the sergeant who harangued the mob. About one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-day Lovell returned from the Assizes at Longford with the news, met on the road, that expresses had come an hour before from Granard to Longford, for the Reay Fencibles, and all the troops; that there was another _rising_ and an attack upon Granard: four thousand men the first report said, seven hundred the second. What the truth may be it is impossible to tell, it is certain that the troops are gone to Granard, and it is yet more certain that all the windows in this house...", "...to come back through the Free State, and by the 15th was only at Johannesburg. This upset plans. Beyers had to act quickly. He had his chauffeur overhaul his motor car, equip it with new tubes and covers, in readiness for \"a long journey.\" In a short time the car was on its way to bring General de la Rey from Johannesburg to Pretoria, where Beyers would meet him. There was no time to be lost. It was too late to stage the rebellion for the 15th, but Beyers arranged for it to be at 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of Wednesday, the 16th. General de la Rey arrived in Pretoria. General Beyers met him and asked him to go immediately with him to Potchefstroom. The car came within sight of Johannesburg. A police cordon had been thrown around the town for the purpose of capturing three desperadoes, known as the \"Foster gang,\" who were trying to escape in a motor car. The police were instructed to stop all motors and to examine in particular any car containing three men....", "...and a whispered account of the last trick he'd played the old woman. But Gunton, poor fellow, who had laughed and played his foolish jests, and got into mischief industriously all through his short life, had laid his mirth aside to-day. He had done but indifferently well the few tasks allotted him, shirking them when he could; the business he had now on hand was a very serious one, and there was no slipping out of it. He had to die. He told his friend so in so many words. \"What's <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> now?\" he asked. \"Eleven? By two I shall be dead.\" Dan tried not to believe. \"I'll go for the doctor--I'll fetch a nurse!\" he said. The other stayed him with his difficult speech. \"Don't waste time. It's no good,\" he said. \"I've seen men die like this. I know. Owen was here till ten minutes ago. I told him last night it was all up. You know what an old ass it is--he wouldn't listen. He listens now. He's wired for ----\" (naming a man locally celebrated in the profession)....", "...then set forth to walk briskly from Gwynne Street to the old Red House. She purposely chose the morning for her expedition. She was not making a call--she was going on business. She did not mean to ask for Mrs. Brand even, first of all; she intended to ask for Mr. Cuthbert Brand. Wyvis would probably be out; but Cuthbert, with his sedentary habits and his slight lameness, was more likely to be at home painting in the brilliant morning light than out of doors. It was nearly twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when she reached her destination. She went through the leafless woods, for that was the shortest way and the pleasantest--although she had thought little of pleasantness when she came out, but still it was good to hear the brittle twigs snap under her feet, and note the slight coating of frost that made the rims of the dead leaves beautiful--and it was hardly a surprise to her to hear a child's laugh ring out on the air at the very spot where, months before, she and Nora had...", "...between the two bodies of troops took place during the next two hours. Two dynamite guns finally were put in position by the Americans and five shots were fired. These completely silenced the enemy and they withdrew, leaving the town in possession of our forces. Coamo was captured on August 9, after a dashing fight, in which the 16th Pennsylvania volunteers won honors, holding the lead in General Wilson's advance on the town. The skirmishing with the enemy's outposts began at 8:30 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The American troops were armed with Krag-Jorgensen rifles and were supported by artillery. They went into the fight with spirit under the eye of General Ernst, and routed the enemy, killing twelve of them, including the Spanish commander, Colonel Illeroa, capturing the town, and taking 200 prisoners. No Americans lost their lives, but six were wounded, one seriously. General Wilson's troops destroyed the Spanish batteries on the heights facing Aibonito, on...", "...the end of the month the bank gold was heaviest and the most notes in the safe. The smartest way would be to go into the bank just before shutting-up time--three o'clock, about--and hand a cheque over the counter. While the clerk was looking at it, out with a revolver and cover him. The rest was easy enough. A couple more walked in after, and while one jumped over the counter and bailed up the manager the other shut the door. Nothing strange about that. The door was always shut at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> sharp. Nobody in town would drop to what might be going on inside till the whole thing was over, and the swag ready to be popped into a light trap and cleared off with. That was the idea. We had plenty of time to think it over and settle it all, bit by bit, beforehand. So one morning we started early and took the job in hand. Every little thing was looked through and talked over a week before. Father got Mr. White's buggy-horses ready and took Warrigal with him to a place...", "...as if Octave's dark eyes might suddenly glisten in the obscurity. When she had assured herself that all was tranquil, and that the throbbing of her heart was all that disturbed the silence, she continued preparing her plan of defense. She decided that she would be ill the next day and keep to her bed, if necessary, until her persecutor should make up his mind to beat a retreat. She solemnly pledged herself to be firm, courageous, and inflexible; then she tried to pray. It was now two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. For some time Clemence remained motionless, and one might have thought that at least she was asleep. Suddenly she arose. Without stopping to put on her dressing-gown, she lighted a candle by the night-lamp, pushed the bolt of her door and then went to the windows, the space between them forming a rather deep projection on account of the thickness of the walls. A portrait of the Duke of Bordeaux hung there; she raised it and pressed a button concealed in the...", "...to dinner, and if she would kindly send a little cold lunch to our room at bedtime that would be quite sufficient. During her absence for dinner the reaction came. When my stepmother returned she seemed to have suddenly grown older, and she looked at us through haggard and sunken eyes. Surely this was a terrible punishment she was undergoing, and I pitied her. Mr. Cobb had an important engagement to keep, she said, and hoped we would excuse him. Slowly the evening wore away and at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we were shown to our room, greatly fatigued by this trying experience. It was a room fronting the street on the third floor, which I had occupied before I left home. The walls had been painted white since then, with a frieze of gold along the ceiling. My father used to sleep in the room directly under it. Rayel had been silent and absent-minded all the evening, rarely speaking except in reply to some question. \"I feel sad for some cause I do not understand,\" said he,...", "...at any straw of comfort. \"I'm awful glad I've got into the habit of going to church and Sunday School this summer,\" said Peter very soberly. \"I wish I'd made up my mind before this whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist. Do you s'pose it's too late now?\" \"Oh, that doesn't matter,\" said Cecily earnestly. \"If--if you're a Christian, Peter, that is all that's necessary.\" \"But it's too late for that,\" said Peter miserably. \"I can't turn into a Christian between this and two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow. I'll just have to be satisfied with making up my mind to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist. I wanted to wait till I got old enough to make out what was the difference between them, but I'll have to chance it now. I guess I'll be a Presbyterian, 'cause I want to be like the rest of you. Yes, I'll be a Presbyterian.\" \"I know a story about Judy Pineau and the word Presbyterian,\" said the Story Girl, \"but I can't tell it now.

Returning now to our boat, it left about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> for a place a little higher up the river where they had to take in some wheat, and where we were to go on foot, with the Quaker's wife. We reached it about noon, and found the boat laden, and lying high up on the land, so that we had to wait until the tide was half flood. We saw there a piece of meadow or marsh, which a Dutch woman had dyked in, and which they assured us had yielded an hundred for one, of wheat, notwithstanding the hogs had done it great damage. The boat...", "...the fireplace with his eyes on the hearthstone, and his face was working under the stress of some emotion. In his hand he held a small bunch of violets. \"God bless you,\" said the doctor softly. Then with a quick change of tone he added, \"We'll save him yet. Please God we'll save him yet.\" Then he drew Philippa to one side, and began to give her some instructions, and some professional details as to the condition of his patient, to which the girl listened attentively. \"At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this evening I'll come and take you to him,\" he said presently. \"I can only allow you to stay a few moments, and I need hardly impress on you the strict necessity that he should not be allowed to excite himself in any way.

You may expect me at five this afternoon.\" \"I wish Marion were here.\" The Major turned to Philippa when they were left alone. \"I think in...", "...to lose; and then he begged her to give up her wild attempts at renewing the old ties of friendship. The letter, considering what the secret really was, seemed a wretched mockery to the writer, but he signed it and sent it by his servant. Then he strolled to his club, and read the papers before dinner. But he was not easy. There was upon him the weight of impending misfortune. He dined, and tried to drown care in claret, but with poor success, Then he issued forth--it was nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and still light--and walked gently homewards. He walked so slowly that it was half-past nine when he let himself into his chambers in the Albany. His servant was out, and the rooms looked dismal and lonely. They were not dismal, being on the second floor, where it is light and airy, and being furnished as mediaeval bachelorhood with plenty of money alone understands furniture. But he was nervous to-night, and grim stories came into his mind of spectres and strange visitors...", "...drove their assailants back again and again. At twelve o'clock the assault slackened. The soldiers had long left and, so far as could be seen from the roof of the house, had entirely evacuated the town; and as this fact became known to the mob, the thought of the consequences of their action cooled their fury; for they knew that, probably, the troops would land from the British ships next day. Each man had his plunder to secure, and gradually the crowd melted away. By two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all was quiet; and although, occasionally, fresh fires burst out in various quarters of the town, there could be little doubt that the great bulk of the population had followed the example of the army, and had left the city. Then the besieged gathered in the great office on the ground floor; and, as it was agreed that there would be probably no renewal of the attack, they quietly left the house, locking the doors after them, and made their way down to the shore. They believed...", "...night between the 15^th and 16^th of September passed without disturbance. Six or seven hundred men, consisting of the Trained Bands, the Edinburgh volunteers, and some volunteers who came in from the towns of Musselburgh and Dalkeith, were upon guard at the different gates of the city. On Monday the 16^th the rebels advanced slowly towards Edinburgh, giving time for the terror of their approach to operate upon the minds of unwarlike citizens, in a divided city. Between ten and eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the forenoon, a message was delivered from the young Pretender to the people of Edinburgh, acquainting them that if they would admit him peaceably into the city, they should be civilly dealt with, if not they must lay their account with military execution. Instantly the clamour rose, and crowds of people ran about the streets crying out, that it was madness to think of resistance, since the dragoons were fled; and some of them meeting Provost Stuart, as he returned from...", "...of the latter he learned to repeat. \"We had so few books,\" he says, \"that to read them once or twice was nothing. We thought they were all to be got by heart.\" The yearly almanac was regarded as \"an acquisition.\" Once when Ezekiel and he had a dispute, after retiring, as to a couplet at the head of the April page, Daniel got up, groped his way to the kitchen, lighted a candle, looked at the quotation, found himself in the wrong, and went back to bed.

Sadly we bade adieu to Alexander O'Mulligan and went to our hotel to bed, yet not to sleep.

He directed my attention to the obituary notice of H.E. the Illyrian Ambassador, who, it appeared, had met his death at the Illyrian Embassy in Portland Place at 11.30 o'clock the previous evening, in peculiarly tragic and distressing circumstances. It appeared that his Excellency, a noted shot who took a keen interest in...", "...in every direction. An old tumble-down house had been put in tolerable order, and some second-hand desks and benches arranged in the usual fashion. Just around this point, there was quite a nest of cottages belonging to the mill workmen. The children straggled in shyly, eying the new master.

Fortunately he was at home, and wired that he would leave Waterloo by the two o'clock train. The remainder of the day passed very slowly. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night someone whistled from the pines, and I knew at once that it was Vane. Craddock was with him. I conducted them both into Sir Eldred's room, where they were closeted together for some time, neither Sir Eldred nor I being allowed to enter. At last eleven o'clock arrived, and Sir Eldred went to fetch the Parrys. Both strongly demurred. Parry declared he was unwell, and Mrs. Parry said she had never heard of such a thing; but Sir Eldred insisted, and they were obliged at...", "...Take a taste of cordial,\"--and Brotteaux drew from the pocket of his plum-coloured coat a flask of brandy, which lay there alongside his Lucretius. \"Drink.

I ordered the boatswain to assist the gunner; and by 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the powder-room was clear. The carpenter's mate, gunner, and boatswain went down; and soon after I followed them myself and asked them whether they could come at the leak: they said they believed they might, but cutting the ceiling; I told the carpenter's mate (who was the only person in the ship that understood anything of carpenter's work) that if he thought he could come at the leak by cutting the ceiling without weakening the ship he might do it, for he had stopped one leak...", "...and they went in to supper. Here they were soon seated next their own special friends, and Gritzko seemed to throw off all restraint. He drank a great deal, and then poured out a glass of brandy and mixed it with the champagne.

The company all went to the galleries again to watch the departure of the King and Queen. And, leaning on the marble balustrade next the Prince, Tamara suddenly noticed a thin crimson stream trickle from under his sleeve to his glove. He saw it, too, and with an impatient exclamation of annoyance he moved back and disappeared in the crowd. The rest of the ball for Tamara was a ghastly blank, although they kept it up with immense spirit until very late. She...", "...had transformed her in the night.

Not to lose time, I rode on to procure another, and at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> reached the village of Silan. In the suburbs I discovered unexpectedly the towering memorial of another ruined city, and riding into the plaza, saw at one angle, near the wall of the church, the gigantic mound represented in the plate opposite, the grandest we had seen in the country.

At daybreak Lieutenant-colonel Dundas led out part of his garrison to forage the neighboring country. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the wagons and bat horses laden with Indian corn were returning, covered by Tarleton and his dragoons as a rear-guard, when word was brought that an enemy was advancing in force. The report was confirmed by a cloud of dust from which emerged Lauzun and the Frence hussars and lancers. Tarleton, with part of his legion, advanced to meet them; the rest, with Simcoe's dragoons, remained as a rear-guard in a skirt of woods.

He had been bowling along comfortably and somewhat sleepily the previous night, when suddenly his car bumped into a muddy rut from which he found it impossible to extricate the machine.

Editors grow gray-headed trying to keep up with the swift passing of events, and they are always very careful to tell their readers that the events which they are chronicling are the latest events.

Neb, therefore, prepared a magnificent repast--the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked ham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they had, but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory peccaries. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House. The kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent. To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving himself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the guests. These suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring his share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him. \"What's the matter?\" asked Cyrus Harding. \"The...", "...need me for anything. Well, I left Hare last night after only a couple of hours' talk, listening to the same old story of boss-rule, and giving him, if I do say it, some cracking good practical pointers. By the way, we were interrupted at that. Hadn't got started before Hare remembered that he'd promised to bring some girl home from somewhere, and dragged me off a mile down the road, only to find out afterwards that she'd gone home with somebody else. Made me tired. I left him about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and started down Main Street for the river, meaning to come straight back here. But as I was footing it along, thinking over my talk with Hare and attending to my own business, who should brace me but that pale-faced rascal we saw playing dead in the rowboat. This time the _poseur_ was lying flat on some packing-cases in front of a store, and who do you suppose he turned out to be?\" \"The brains of the machine,\" said Varney.

Baladan, it should be said by the way, was not the real king of Babylon. The throne was occupied by his father, whose face had changed into that of a dog. Therefore the son had to administer the affairs of state, and he was known by his father's name as well as his own. (81) This Baladan was in the habit of dining at noon, and then he took a nap until three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> of the afternoon. On the day of Hezekiah's recovery, when he awoke from his sleep, and saw the sun overhead, he was on the point of having his guards executed, because he thought they had permitted him to sleep a whole afternoon and the night following it. He desisted only when he was informed of Hezekiah's miraculous recovery, and realised that the God of Hezekiah was greater than his own god, the sun.

Recovering himself, he sang it in its abbreviated and rationalistic form, on the market-place and in front of the _Pany's_ house. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he was surrounded by a crowd of loafers, who led him up and down the town, blowing his nine blasts, and after each one giving full swing to the old time song which now had become a battle-cry. At ten a larger crowd rescued him from amidst his co-religionists, and after each blast made him sing the Lutheran version; at eleven o'clock they still held him. At twelve the Magyar youths took him in hand and compelled him to sing a Magyar song. They kept him until two, when the...", "...the collision. I had not heard of the collision at that time. I had been hunting Mr. Thaw in the afternoon, and then had gone to Allegheny, and I had to procure the aid of a gentleman to go with me to learn where Mr. McCullough and Mr. Layng lived. Q. Did you get the proposition before the collision from the strikers? A. The strikers gave me the proposition previous to the collision, I think. Q. What time did you present it? A. I presented it--it must have been, perhaps, four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> or five--it was in the afternoon. Q. What response did you get--reply? A. They told me they could do nothing at all in the matter, nor did they seemed disposed to do anything. They conversed about the matter as indifferently as if it was a thing on the other side of the Atlantic--took no interest in it, but referred me to President Scott. Q.

The horses were turned loose to graze and drink, and the Englishmen partook heartily of tswala and soon dozed off to sleep. The Boers, inside the hot hut, could do nothing, so they too went to sleep. It was a funny situation, had it not been so serious. These enemies were peacefully asleep within a few feet of one another. About three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> there was a general stirring and every one waked up. The British troopers had never seen the inside of a royal kraal before, and they asked Jafta if they might be shown about. The king immediately assented and appointed some of his indunas to act as guides. It was all new and interesting to the Englishmen and they were soon about fifty yards away from Jafta's hut. This was the chance the Boers were waiting for. They slipped out and gathered up the Britishers' equipment,...", "...for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic. \"Good-day, sir; good-day,\" said he. \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.\"...", "...sit up and wait for it,\" she said coolly. \"He has got the trains confused.\" \"Good heavens!

These purchases made, there remained twenty pounds in her purse. She summoned the servants to the dining-room and told them that their master would return home shortly and would pay their wages. On the morning of the second day after her sudden decision, a van was brought to the door for her few effects, and at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she had turned her back upon the house that she had grown to loathe. Two days later she was thoroughly installed in her new one. Here she had succeeded in fitting up a studio, which was an imitation, a cheap and pathetic reproduction, exact in almost every detail, of the one in which she had passed the happiest hours of her old life in Elm Avenue. Each item of furniture occupied precisely the same spot as in the St. John's Wood studio, and the whole effect was tasteful,...", "...will gladly take the jewels to her,\" he exclaimed. \"And I may say, count, that had you searched the whole world over, you could not have found one whose beauty was more fitted to show them off to advantage.

I placed the oaken box of jewels in the leathern case which had been made to contain it, strapped and locked it, and handed it to him together with its key. He was profuse in his compliments and thanks--almost obsequious, in truth--and I discovered another defect in his character--a defect which, as his friend in former days, I had guessed nothing of. I saw that very little encouragement would make him a toady--a...", "...eyes about her. Alas, poor Judith! \"Teacher's pet,\" terrible phrase, was whispered as the class filed out, and when Nancy and Josephine rushed down to the tuck shop for an ice-cream cone they affected not to see Judith, who at first followed disconsolately, and then fled to her room, where, with head buried under the pillows, she sobbed herself into a misery of self-pity and supposed homesickness. Five o'clock bell rang. Horrors! She had forgotten that Aunt Nell was to be here at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to take her out for dinner. Aunt Nell would be cross at being kept waiting. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Would she never find her gloves? Where was her new scarf? She must have left them down in the cloakroom after morning walk. A hurried flight to the cloakroom, another search, and an entirely discomfited Judith presented herself in the drawing-room. Aunt Nell would look displeased, she thought, as she entered. Judith really did not care that Aunt Nell had been inconvenienced, but...", "...and when they got home it was Daisy who described the strange way Mr. Sleuth had been taken. \"I don't suppose he'll be long before he comes home,\" said Bunting heavily, and he cast an anxious, furtive look at his wife. She looked as if stricken in a vital part; he saw from her face that there was something wrong--very wrong indeed. The hours dragged on. All three felt moody and ill at ease. Daisy knew there was no chance that young Chandler would come in to-day. About six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Mrs. Bunting went upstairs. She lit the gas in Mr. Sleuth's sitting-room and looked about her with a fearful glance. Somehow everything seemed to speak to her of the lodger, there lay her Bible and his Concordance, side by side on the table, exactly as he had left them, when he had come downstairs and suggested that ill-starred expedition to his landlord's daughter. She took a few steps forward, listening the while anxiously for the familiar sound of the click in the door which...", "...one of you!\" As it was full ten o'clock the boys accepted the suggestion, and in a few minutes afterward, Camp Venture sank into silence, while Harry stood guard out there under the cliff, and the stars glittered above him in a wintry sky. Meantime the logs blazed and sputtered lazily in the great fireplace, and the night wore on, with no disturbance in the hut except when a sentinel came in, woke up his successor, replenished the fire and crept into his broomstraw bed. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the boys were startled out of sleep by the crack of a rifle, and the instant response of both barrels of a shotgun. They were up and out in a moment, for it was their habit just then to sleep in their clothes and even in their boots, and for each to keep his gun by his side ready for instant use. Running as fast as possible, they quickly joined Ed Parmly, who was on picket at the time, and hurriedly questioned him. He reported that the rifle shot had come from the edge of...", "...will come with me.\" By nine o'clock Clive had landed his troops. They bivouacked on the shore, in expectation of storming the fort next day. At daybreak an officer was sent into the fort with a flag of truce to demand its surrender. This being refused, the admiral ordered his ships to warp within a cable's length of the walls in three fathoms and a quarter water, and the attack was renewed by sea and land, Clive gradually advancing and worrying the enemy with his cannon. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a magazine in the fort blew up, and not long after, just as Clive was about to give the order to storm, a white flag was seen fluttering at one of the bastions. A messenger was sent to the governor to arrange the capitulation, but when he was met by prevarication and pleas for delay the bombardment was once more resumed. A few minutes of this sufficed to bring the defenders to reason, and by five o'clock the English flag flew upon the walls. Clive postponed his entry until...", "...The magistrate was two or three times obliged to reprove her, and command her to be silent, and, so passionate did she become, that her husband, ashamed of her, put his hand on her shoulder, and entreated her to be calm. Mr. Hill dismissed the complaint by giving some good advice to both parties, much to the annoyance of the mistress. The second complaint was brought by a man against a servant girl, for disobedience of orders, and insolence. It appears that she was ordered, at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, to do some work. She was just leaving the house to call on some friends, as she said, and refused. On being told by her mistress that she only wanted to go out for bad purposes, she replied, that \"It was no matter--the allowance they gave her was not sufficient to support her, and if they would not give her more, she must get a living any way she could, so she did not steal.\" She was sentenced to the house of correction for one week.

From Bergen we went to Christiansand, where the Fram was docked, and, as already mentioned, the remaining outfit, with the dogs and dog-food, was taken on board. The number of living creatures on board when we left Norway was nineteen men, ninety-seven dogs, four pigs, six carrier pigeons, and one canary. At last we were ready to leave Christiansand on Thursday, August 9, 1910, and at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that evening the anchor was got up and the motor started. After the busy time we had had, no doubt we were all glad to get off. As our departure had not been made public, only the pilot and a few acquaintances accompanied us a little way out. It was glorious weather, and everyone stayed on deck till far into the light night, watching the land slowly disappear. All the ninety-seven dogs were chained round the deck, on which we also had coal, oil, timber and other things, so that...", "...What I mean, they carded the rolls, spun the thread--spun it on an old hand-turned wheel--and then they would reel it off of the broach onto the reel and make hanks out of it.

The porter--a man of great experience--saw that the young man, who evidently belonged to the higher classes of society, was in a state of great excitement; and as nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night did not seem to him the most suitable hour for visiting a lady who, besides, was alone in her room, he replied that he did not think the lady could be seen now.

He went out and found the person to be the lady he had accompanied to Carriford earlier in the evening, Mrs. Manston. She asked, when would be another train to London? The first the next morning, he told her, was at a quarter-past six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> from Budmouth, but that it was express, and didn't stop at Carriford Road--it didn't stop till it got to Anglebury. \"How far is it to Anglebury?\" she said. He told her, and she thanked him, and went away up the line. In a short time she ran back and took out her purse. \"Don't on any account say a word in the village or anywhere that I have been here, or a single breath about me--I'm ashamed ever to have come.\" He promised; she took out two sovereigns. \"Swear it on the Testament...", "...had some job to do. And then he always went to bed very early, often before the children. There was nothing remaining for him to stay up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed the headlines of the newspaper. And the children felt secure when their father was in bed. They lay and talked softly a while. Then they started as the lights went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take the nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> shift. They listened to the voices of the men, imagined them dipping down into the dark valley. Sometimes they went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing tinier and tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness. Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in the warmth. Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis. The others were all quite strong; so this was another reason for his mother's difference in feeling for him. One day...", "...remedies that were being discussed and acted upon in the shifting conference within the library. It was after four o'clock when Bojo left, after persuading Patsie of the uselessness of further vigil. He felt too tremulously awake for need of sleep. He went down the Avenue and in the convalescing gray of the weak and sickly dawn passed the growing lines of depositors still obstinately clinging to their posts, feeling as though he were walking a world of nightmares and alarms. About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he came back to the Court for a tub and a cup of coffee. There he received news of Fred DeLancy, who had been in frantically the night before begging for loans to back up his disappearing margins. Neither Marsh nor Granning could come to his assistance and he had left absolutely unnerved, vowing that he would be wiped out if he could not raise only ten thousand dollars before the morrow. Bojo shook his head. He had no desire to help him. The few thousands he still retained...", "...haven't you?' asked Racksole. 'I've seen three campaigns, sir,' was the reply, and, with a gesture of pardonable pride, the grey-haired fellow pointed to the medals on his breast. 'Well, supposing you were on sentry duty and some meddlesome person in camp asked you what you were doing--what should you say?' 'I should tell him to clear off or take the consequences, and pretty quick too.' 'Do that to-morrow morning, then, if necessary,' said Racksole, and departed. It was then about one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a.m. The millionaire retired to bed--not his own bed, but a bed on the seventh storey. He did not, however, sleep very long. Shortly after dawn he was wide awake, and thinking busily about Jules. He was, indeed, very curious to know Jules' story, and he determined, if the thing could be done at all, by persuasion or otherwise, to extract it from him. With a man of Theodore Racksole's temperament there is no time like the present, and at six o'clock, as the bright morning sun brought...", "...prepared by Darlot. This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M. Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little favourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries prepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse was laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation. At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up, and that they should proceed to the cemetery. It was the season of the longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before the gates of the Temple palace. One of the municipals wished to have the coffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the...", "...All that running around had cost me quite a bit of money. I needed to make up for some of the loss so I worked ten hours a day at my regular job, got off at five in the afternoon, ate supper at the company cafe, drove seven miles and went to work at another plant that belonged to the same company. This second job paid time-and-a-half, and I could work an hour or all night, they didn't care which. The work was there to be done and laborers were scarce. I usually worked until ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and got to bed by eleven, so I wouldn't lose too much sleep. However, on Saturdays I worked all night. Then one day I got this telegram from Ima that read something like this, \"Can you meet me at the Union Depot on Thursday, March 19th at 5:45?\" Well, on my way down to my other place of work I had noticed a telegraph office. So I stopped in one afternoon and sent Ima a reply. After all, she had asked a question; the least I could do was to answer it. But I didn't see...", "...to risk it and remain, the faithful sergeant promising to send scouts out and warn us should the enemy be approaching. I was fully determined that, having left Mafeking, where I might have been of use, I would run no risks of capture or impertinence from the burghers, who would also certainly commandeer our cart, pony, and mules. Then followed another endless night; the moon set at 1 a.m., and occasionally I was roused by the loud and continuous barking of the farm dogs. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Vellum's dusky countenance peered into the room, which opened on to the stoep, as do nearly all the apartments of these hotels, to ask if the mules should be inspanned, for these natives were all in wholesale dread of the Boers. Hearing all was quiet, I told him to wait till the sergeant appeared. About an hour later I opened my door to have a look at the weather: the wind had dropped completely, the sky was cloudless, and a faint tinge of pink on the distant horizon denoted...", "...else; something strenuous, tragic even; as though \"Life at its grindstone set\" had been at work on the radiant pair, evoking the Meredithian series of intellect from the senses,--\"brain from blood\"; with \"spirit,\" or generous soul, for climax.

CHAPTER XVI A week had passed. Mrs. Friend at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning had just been having a heart to heart talk with the landlady of the inn on the subject of a decent luncheon for three persons, and a passable dinner for four. Food at the inn was neither good nor well-cooked, and as criticism, even the mildest, generally led to tears, Mrs. Friend's morning lot, when any guest was expected, was not a happy one. It was a difficult thing indeed to get anything said or settled at all; since the five-year old Bobby was generally...", "...on it and when the second party came across opened fire on them, wounding several men close to F----, the Quebecker, who as junior sub. was bringing up the rear. He, however, kept the men from dropping the explosive, and the party reached the mine shaft without any further casualties. Our three days' bombardment, which had started on the night of the 13th, now died down slightly, and the Germans, having had ample time to bring up their reinforcements, waited for the attack. At 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> our two companies in the front line drew off to the right and the men of the Central Ontarios took their places, while the communication trenches leading up were choked with the Toronto men who were to form their supports. Our artillery now tuned up again and caught the Germans by surprise. They, in turn, shelled us heavily, causing many casualties owing to the crowding of the trench.

While in camp great stress was laid on drills. The brigade drill was the most important. Every day at 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the whole brigade was marched to a large old field, and all the evolutions of the brigade drill were gone through with. Crowds of citizens from the surrounding country came to witness our maneuvers, especially did the ladies grace the occasions with their presence. The troops were in the very best of spirits--no murmurs nor complaints. Clothing and provision boxes began coming in from home. A grand corps review took place soon after our encampment was established, in which...", "...and active life, was probably too busy to consider such a matter as a new pupil. Then my mother wrote. In reply came a very concise and businesslike communication. Yes, Lilli had received the letter from me, but, owing to my eccentric handwriting, had been unable to decipher it. My mother's penmanship was clearer, and so Lilli wrote that she would be willing to hear me sing, without promising to accept me as her pupil, however. An appointment was made for us to call at half-past nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning at her home in Grunewald, half an hour's ride from Berlin, and, though the day was cold and wintry, my mother and I were there promptly on time.

Ah! she had better have stopped then, if she had only known it. Old Katie groaned in the spirit and went to the dressing room as she was bid. She sat down before the fire and looked at the clock on the chimney piece. It was just seven. \"Dat funnelly dinner will keep my ladyship an hour at the very latest bit. It will be eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> afore she comes back, Laws-a- massy, what shall I do?\" grunted the old woman impatiently. Slowly, slowly, passed that hour of waiting. The clock struck eight. \"She'll be here every minute now,\" said old Katie, with a sigh of relief. But minute after minute passed and Claudia did not come. A half an hour slipped away. Old Katie in her impatience got up and walked about the room. She heard the rustle of silken drapery, and peeped out. It was only Mrs. Dugald, in her rich...", "...the _Britannia's_ captain. In this position Garth would have faced Lord Severance, and sat diagonally opposite Miss Sorel, who was on the captain's left. But the favoured man had ignored his privilege. It was understood that he preferred snatching vague sandwiches and glasses of beer at odd hours in the smoking-room, or on deck; therefore it would be hard to identify him. Meanwhile, however, celebrity seekers gathered near those three chairs on the sunny port side of A deck. By ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the crowd had thickened; but it was not till close on eleven that a tall figure in uniform, preceded by a steward with rugs, sat down in the chair ticketed \"Major the Earl of Severance.\" Many Americans were on board, homeward bound after months of Red Cross and other war work, and they knew in their hearts, no doubt, that titles, once valued by snobs, were absolutely out-of-date in this newly-democratised world. Nevertheless, they threw glances at Lord Severance. Their...", "...really break out there--no overt act was done nor any trains prevented from going out until the Saturday after the Thursday it broke out on this side? A. It broke out here on Thursday, and I think the first there was Friday morning. Q. Were you talking or did you talk on this Thursday or Friday with those classes of railroad men you had previously had conversation with, in regard to what was going on? A. On Friday I had some talk. I went out on a train that leaves here at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, on the Fort Wayne road, and had considerable talk with some of the freight train conductors. Q. What did they say about the difficulties that had occurred here? A. There is a schedule of quite a number of freights following immediately after that passenger train, and of course they talked about the strike being in fact over here, and talked with some of the men at the station before the train left there. I was on the lookout to see whether the trains were...", "...at once, that would be a solution?\" Sophy hugged him and replied with perfect gravity that she thought it would certainly be \"a solution.\" \"Well, I'm glad,\" sighed Bobby, settling back upon his pillow. \"'Cause if you _hadn't_ thought so, I don't think I'd have slept a wink to-night. I'll write Granny first thing to-morrow. She's leaving after lunch. She told me to be sure to tell you so you'd send your letters to her at Dynehurst when you wrote.\" But three days later, about six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, a motor from the Hiltons' swept again round the lawn at Breene, and in this motor was Lady Wychcote. This time, it happened to be Sophy and Amaldi who were sitting out under the big beech. Bobby was there, too. He was leaning with both arms on Amaldi's knee, and looking up eagerly into the young man's face. Amaldi had been telling him some of the adventures of Orlando Furioso. This time Amaldi had not come down from London for the day, but had also...", "...he heard a faint stir near him, as some restless soldier turned on his side in his sleep, and now and then a muttered word from an officer who passed near in the darkness. Hours never passed more slowly. Colonel Kenton had gone back toward the Northern lines, and the boy surmised that he would be one of the first in the attack at dawn. He began to wonder if dawn would ever really come. Stars and a fair moon were out, and as nearly as he could judge from them it must be about three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. Yet it seemed to him that he had been lying there at least twelve hours. He shut his eyes again, but sleep was as far from him as ever. After another long and almost unendurable period he opened them once more, and it seemed to him that there was a faint tint of gray in the east. He sat up, and looking a long time, he was sure of it. The gray was deepening and broadening, and at its center it showed a tint of silver. The dawn was at hand, and every nerve in...", "...King George to rule over us, have these reptiles a king to rule over them.\" \"And where did you see him?\" said I. \"I will tell you,\" said the old man, \"though I don't like talking about the matter. It may be about seven years ago that I happened to be far down yonder to the west, on the other side of England, nearly two hundred miles from here, following my business. It was a very sultry day, I remember, and I had been out several hours catching creatures. It might be about three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, when I found myself on some heathy land near the sea, on the ridge of a hill, the side of which, nearly as far down as the sea, was heath; but on the top there was arable ground, which had been planted, and from which the harvest had been gathered--oats or barley, I know not which--but I remember that the ground was covered with stubble. Well, about three o'clock, as I told you before, what with the heat of the day and from having walked about for hours in a...", "...thoughts still ran upon the extraordinary incident, he applied spurs to his horse's side, and gradually increased his pace from a trot to a gallop, and from that to almost high speed, until he emerged from the wood upon a track of open country. When he reached this spot the day had already appeared above the eastern horizon; and reassured, as the light waxed stronger, the dragoon, by degrees, fell into his customary travelling pace, and resumed the equanimity of his temper. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the day he reached Blackstock's, where he arrived in a heavy rain, that had been falling for the last three hours, and which had drenched him to the skin. So, rapidly dismounting and giving his horse into the charge of some of the idlers about the door, he entered the common room in which were assembled the greater part of the militia guard and of Habershaw's troopers. His first movement was to take the burly captain aside, and to communicate to him certain orders from the...", "...doubtful as to what the authorities would say, however,\" he told Henry, when his orders had been taken. \"What can they say, but be well pleased if the infernal thing is cleared up?\" \"It is too good to be true.\" \"So I should think, but I share Mary's optimism. I honestly believe that Signor Mannetti knows a great deal more about the Grey Room than he has let us imagine.\" \"How can he possibly do that?\" asked his uncle. \"Time will show; but I'm going to back him.\" At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the following morning the visitor appeared. He walked with a gold-headed, ebony cane and dressed in a fashion of earlier days. He was alert and keen; his mind had no difficulty in concentrating on his subject. It appeared that he had all particulars at his fingers' ends, and he went back into the history of the Grey Room as far as Sir Walter was able to take him. \"We are dealing with five victims to our certain knowledge,\" he said, \"for there is very little doubt that all...", "...\"No--I'll have the boy bring in some sandwiches,\" Thorpe decided. \"I want my next meal west of Temple Bar when I get round to it. I've soured on the City for keeps.\" \"I wouldn't say that it had been so bad to you, either,\" Semple smilingly suggested, as he turned to the door. Thorpe grinned in satisfied comment. \"Hurry back as soon as you've finally settled with Rostocker and the other fellow,\" he called after him, and began pacing the floor again. It was nearly four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when these two men, again together in the Board Room, and having finished the inspection of some papers on the desk, sat upright and looked at each other in tacit recognition that final words were to be spoken. \"Well, Semple,\" Thorpe began, after that significant little pause, \"I want to say that I'm damned glad you've done so well for yourself in this affair. You've been as straight as a die to me,--I owe it as much to you as I do to myself,--and if you don't think you've...", "...son arrived from Saint Cloud with a grand retinue. The courtyard of the palace, the garden, and the terraces were filled with applauding spectators. Free performances were given at all the theatres, at which songs referring to the event were loudly cheered. Paris was illuminated, and in all the public places food was given away to the populace. Wine flowed in the fountains, and everywhere was drunk the health of the young king and of his happy parents. The baptism took place at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next evening; at two in the afternoon troops of the line and the Imperial Guard formed a double row from the Tuileries to Notre Dame.

Tell him that.\" \"Yes, Monsieur the Commandant,\" I answered, shutting the door. His burly figure and air of good humor comforted me a little; but in all the other houses I went to, at the Horwiches, the Frantz-Tonis, the Durlaches, everywhere I heard only lamentations. The women especially were in misery; the men said nothing, but walked about with heads hanging down, and without even looking to see what I was doing. Toward ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> there only remained two persons for me to see: Monsieur de la Vablerie-Chamberlan, one of the ancient nobility, who lived at the end of the main street, with Madame Chamberlan-d'Ecof and Mademoiselle Jeanne, their daughter. They were _emigres_, and had returned about three or four years before. They saw no one in the city, and only three or four old priests in the environs.

We then rode to the glen, to see how it looked under such a change, and remained some time watching the current as it swept along. On our return to the party I found that it would be impossible to make a lengthened journey; for, having parted with two drays, we had necessarily been obliged to increase the loads on the others, so that they sank deep into the ground. I therefore halted, after having gone about four miles only. About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> p.m. we were surprised by the sudden return of Joseph, from the home returning party; but, still more so at the melancholy nature of the information he had to communicate. Mr. Poole, he said, had breathed his last at three o'clock. This sad event necessarily put a stop to my movements, and obliged me to consider what arrangements I should now have to make.

I felt the next day like an escaped prisoner, and believed I had found the secret that would in time give me perfect health.

The consequence, however, of the prisoners was so great, that the natives did not think proper to trust to the return of our people for their release; or, at least, their impatience was so great, that it hurried them to meditate an attempt which might have involved them in still greater distress, had it not been fortunately prevented. Between five and six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, I observed that all their canoes in and about the harbour began to move off, as if some sudden panic had seized them. I was ashore, abreast of the ship at the time, and enquired in vain to find out the cause, till our people called to as from the Discovery, and told us, that a party of the natives had seized Captain Clerke and Mr Gore, who had walked out a little way from the ships.

I shall be afloat, and shall see but little of you, which is the only sad part of the business. You will have to report yourself to your landlord at eight every morning and at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, and only to leave the house between those hours, and not to wander more than six miles from home.

The conviction of the hopelessness of his plight was taking a strong hold upon him, and he was growing hungry. He stamped wearily round the top of the tower to warm his chilling body, pondering a hundred futile plans of escape, breaking off to consign to perdition the deceptive angel child, and meditating many different revenges. At the end of an hour he went down the ladder, and flung himself on the pile of heather in a paroxysm of despair. Till nearly ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he went now and again to the top of the tower, and shouted. He was beginning to grow very hungry. At ten o'clock he buried himself in the heather, and slept for an hour. He awoke cold and stiff, and his sensitive stomach, used to the tenderest indulgence, was clamouring angrily. He was learning what the cold and hunger, which, by a skilful manipulation of the laws of his adopted country, he had been able to mete out to many foolish innocents with no grudging hand, really...", "...Lightly to the warrior stept, Took a face-cloth from the face; Yet she neither moved nor wept.

The house was a comfortable one, and during Charles's early childhood his surroundings were prosperous; for his father, John Dickens, a clerk in the navy pay-office, was temporarily in easy circumstances. When Charles was but two, the family moved to London, taking lodgings for a time in Norfolk Street, Bloomsbury, and finally settling in Chatham. Here they lived...", "...Ricaras are known to have lived therein 1797, and the village seems to have been deserted about five years since; it does not contain much timber. We encamped on a sandbar making out from the upper end of this island; our journey to-day being twelve miles. Friday, October 5. The weather was very cold: yesterday evening and this morning there was a white frost. We sailed along the highlands on the north side, passing a small creek on the south, between three and four miles. At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we heard some yells and saw three Indians of the Teton band, who asked us to come on shore and begged for some tobacco, to all which we gave the same answer as hitherto. At eight miles we reached a small creek on the north. At fourteen we passed an island on the south, covered with wild rye, and at the head a large creek comes in from the south, which we named Whitebrant creek, from seeing several white brants among flocks of dark-coloured ones. At the distance of twenty miles...", "...down into the cabin.

Do you call us badly off when we have a roof over our heads? Some of the professors at the Academy, men who wear three-cornered hats and swords now, were much worse off than we are.

John Arthur's insanity was as short-lived as it was violent. He lay for the rest of the day quiet and half stupefied. When night came on, he sank into a heavy slumber. At twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night, all was quiet in and about the manor. Cora Arthur was sleeping soundly, dreamlessly, as such women do sleep. In the room adjoining hers, Celine Leroque sat, broad awake and listening intently. At last, satisfied that her mistress was sleeping, Celine arose and stole softly into the room where she lay.

Then she drew from a pocket, something wrapped...", "...be so placed that the storm might strike it obliquely. But the counter-currents, directed towards it by the slope, could not be so well avoided, and so violent were they that every instant it seemed as though it would be dashed to pieces.

Just then--it was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning--the rain began to fall in torrents, and this in addition to the wind and lightning, made the storm truly frightful. To continue the journey at present was utterly impossible. Besides, having reached this pass, they had only to descend the slopes of the Ural Mountains, and to descend now, with the road torn up by a thousand mountain torrents, in these eddies of wind and rain, was utter madness. \"To wait is indeed serious,\" said Michael, \"but it must certainly...", "...Hastily calling the attention of the man with the red necktie to them, he hurried around the corner, and the other followed.

It was close upon eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when I stepped out of the rear vestibule of the Boston Theatre, and, passing through the narrow court that leads to West Street, struck across the Common diagonally. Indeed, as I set foot on the Tremont Street mall, I heard the Old South drowsily sounding the hour.

However,...", "...at night near a Mr. Robinson's. (To-day we had to march about nine miles out of the way, on account of some one destroying a bridge in the rear of the retreating army.) The officers got a very good supper at Mr. R.'s, by paying one dollar each, in Greenbacks. He would not take anything else. The men got but little to eat. \"On the morning of the 7th, the officers hired a team to take them to Holly Springs, for which they paid $20. We arrived there at 11 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night. Here we were taken to Col.

Captain Lowe told him that we were not in a condition to resent an insult, and did not wish to be insulted.

Beg the General to excuse me; tell him I am not well and am obliged to retire.\" She was interrupted in her reflections by the entrance of a servant who brought a telegram. Feverishly she broke open the envelope and read: \"Missed nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train, started at noon, and will be with you at eight o'clock.\" She looked at the timepiece. It was ten o'clock, and Philip had not yet arrived. The telegram was from Dover. What could have happened since? \"Then, Philip may perhaps not be here at all to-night,\" she said to herself; \"I shall be forced to pass the rest of the evening with General Sabaroff. Is it an accident ... or a diabolical plot? No, no, the thought is too horrible. I must, I will chase it out of my mind....", "...his advice, but in the situation I was in I had no choice. We found the three scoundrels in the place where the driver had told me we should see them. I gave them a searching glance, and thought they looked like true Sicarii, ready to kill anyone for a little money. They started in a quarter of an hour, and half an hour later we set out, with a peasant to guide us, and so struck into a cross road. The mules went at a sharp pace, and in seven hours we had done eleven leagues. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we stopped at an inn in a French village, and we had no more to fear. I gave our guide a doubloon, with which he was well pleased, and I enjoyed once more a peaceful night in a French bed, for nowhere will you find such soft beds or such delicious wines as in the good land of France. The next day I arrived at the posting-inn at Perpignan in time for dinner. I endeavoured in vain to think who could have paid my assassins, but the reader will see the explanation when we get...", "...survive. Waxel, alone, held the vessel up to the wind. Where were they? Why did this coasting along unknown northern islands not lead to Kamchatka? The councils were no longer the orderly conferences of savants over cut-and-dried maps. They were bedlam.

The fog lifted and the air was clear. The wind veered northeast, and on November 4, to their inexpressible joy, a dim outline sharpened to...", "...winter months. Occasionally, when he heard her utter sentiments such as these--and when he saw her keenly sensitive to the flattery bestowed upon her by the people assembled at Mr. Lemuel's little gatherings, he had asked himself whether it was possible she could ever marry Sir Keith Macleod. But he was too wise to risk reawakening her rebellious fits by any encouragement. In any case, he had some experience of this young lady; and what was the use of combatting one of her moods at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when at six o'clock she would be arguing in the contrary direction, and at seven convinced that the _viv media_ was the straight road? Moreover, if the worst came to the worst, there would be some compensation in the fact of Miss White changing her name for that of Lady Macleod. Just as quickly she changed her mood on the present occasion. She was looking again far over the darkly blue and ruffled seas toward the white-sailed yacht. \"He must have gone away in the dark to...", "...thus: 'Your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at four-thirty.

His heart beat fast, and then did not seem to beat at all. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he got up and dressed deliberately, noiselessly. Holly and Mam'zelle would be in the schoolroom, and the servants asleep after their dinner, he shouldn't wonder. He opened his door cautiously, and went downstairs.

A loud meteoric report, as if from the explosion of some aerial body, was heard about noon this day. The sound seemed to proceed from the south-west. It was attended with a prolonged, or rumbling sound, and was generally heard. Popular surmise, which attempts to account for everything, has been very busy in assigning the cause of this phenomenon. A high degree of cold has recently been experienced. The thermometer stood at 28 deg. below zero at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning. It had risen to 18 deg. at day-break--being the greatest observed degree of cold during the season. It did not exceed 4 deg. above zero during any part of the day. _5th_.

The tramp remained crawling on his knees in the mud, looking for the notes which were blown about by the wind and soaking in the puddles, and for an hour after his spasmodic cries of \"Ech! ech!\" were still to be heard in the darkness. CHAPTER III. THE DUEL THE NEXT DAY, at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, the duel took place as arranged. Things were hastened forward by Gaganov's obstinate desire to fight at all costs. He did not understand his adversary's conduct, and was in a fury. For a whole month he had been insulting him with impunity, and had so far been unable to make him lose patience. What he wanted was a challenge on the part of Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, as he had not himself any direct pretext for challenging him. His secret motive for it, that is,...", "...Supposing some fool should go rummaging about his bunk and discover the box? Suppose ... But he dared not suppose. There was nothing to do but wait. If he created any curiosity on the part of his mates he was lost. He would have to divide with them all, from the captain down to the cook's boy. It was a heart-rending thought. From being the most open and frank man aboard, he became the most cunning. From being a man without enemies, he saw an enemy even in his shadow. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he turned in and slept like a log. In the morning he found his opportunity. For half an hour the forecastle was empty of all save himself. Feverishly he pried back the boards, found the brace beam, and gently laid the box there. It was a mighty curious-looking box. Once he had stoked up the Chinese coast from the Philippines, and he judged it to be Chinese in origin. He tried to pry open the cover and feast his eyes upon the treasure; but under the leather and ivory and...", "...sure.\" \"I am thinking of making a trip to the mines with my friend Carter,\" continued Folsom. \"Very likely we shall start to-morrow.

He was required to pay in advance, and willingly did so. CHAPTER XIV JOE'S SECOND DAY Joe woke up at seven o'clock the next morning. Though his bed was hard, he slept well, for he was fatigued. He stretched himself and sat up on his pallet. It is needless to say that he had not undressed. Three or four men were lying near him, all fast asleep except one, and that one he recognized as...", "...to accomplish to the utmost of his limitations--he must reasonably suppose his limitations. Sometimes they were close and real; at this moment they were far off and vague, and almost dissolved by the force of his joyous intention.

When it was done he found it ravishing, and raged because he could not decently leave for town before four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next day. He worked off the time before dinner by putting his things together, and the amiable people had never found him so delightful as he was that evening. After amusing one of the robust young ladies for half an hour at prodigious cost, he found himself comparing their conversation with the talk he might have had in the time with Elfrida Bell, and a fresh sense of injury visited him at having been high-handedly debarred from that pleasure for so many weeks. It staid with...", "...said the General, as Druce arose to go with the securities in his handbag. \"No. But we'll stick strictly to business after this, and leave social questions alone.

I'll have some good champagne on board.\" \"I thought sailors imagined Friday was an unlucky day!\" \"My sailors don't. Will eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> be too early for you?

But when he recollected that Druce himself was going, he said, \"Where could a telegram reach us, if it were necessary to telegraph? The market is a trifle shaky, and I don't like being out of town all day.\" \"The fact that we are both on the yacht will steady the market. But we can drop in at Long...", "...Buel joined us this day. At daylight, September 13th, continued the march. At 10 A. M. arrived at Franklin, Kentucky, which place is on the Nashville and Louisville Railroad. It was reported that a large body of the enemy were hovering around the town. A halt was ordered, and scouts sent out in all directions. Each section of our battery went to the outer edge of the town on picket guard. After remaining one hour, and nothing seen or heard of the enemy, resumed our march. At 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, camped two and a half miles from Bowling Green. Distance made this day, twenty-five miles. Early the morning succeeding proceeded on the march, but went into camp one mile from Bowling Green. While here we suffered for the want of wholesome water--the only spring of good water being two miles from camp. We were obliged to use water for cooking purposes from a pond that was stagnant.

And you--you will keep silence--about--everything here?\" The dark eyes searched her face anxiously. \"Remember, even the doctor knows nothing.\" \"I will keep silence about everything,\" Christina answered solemnly, stooping for the second time to touch the beautiful face with her lips. CHAPTER XI. \"YOU CAN TRUST DR. FERGUSSON.\" When at about seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, Dr. Fergusson, and the servant Elizabeth, once more reached the house amongst the woods, Christina was dressed and ready to admit them by the little green gate in the wall. She had made herself ready for the day at a very early hour, stealing out of her beautiful charge's room whilst the latter was sleeping peacefully, and Fergusson smiled approvingly when he caught sight of the girl's trim figure and smiling face. He alighted quickly from the car, and helped...", "...of taking porridge they eat cakes made with sugar and plums.

I hadn't been there long before the smallest of the two chaps I'd seen in the street came on to the platform, and began looking about him. By the face of him he didn't seem at all pleased at not finding the other man waiting for him. A train drew up at the platform,...", "...you. Come, let us go,\" urged Majkowska. They walked slowly, for the rain had stopped entirely and the July sun was drying the mud in the streets. The counselor wiggled about, gazed into Janina's eyes and smiled significantly; he bowed to acquaintances he met on the way and before the younger ones he assumed the pose of a conquerer. The \"Versailles Restaurant\" was empty. They seated themselves near the balcony and the counselor ordered a very choice breakfast. It was after three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when they returned to the theater. The rehearsal of the day's performance was in full swing. Cabinski was about to grumble at them for coming late, but Majkowska gave him such a crushing look that he merely frowned and walked away. Her mother approached her with a letter. Majkowska read it, immediately scribbled a few words in reply and handed them to the old woman. \"Deliver this right away, mother,\" she said. \"Mela, but suppose I don't find him in?\" asked her mother....", "...coffer, of walnut wood, also barred with iron, but fastened with only three locks, which were all comfortably picked by way of the keyhole.

It was ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when they mounted the ladder; it was about midnight before Tabary beheld them coming back. To him they gave ten crowns, and promised a share of a two-crown dinner on the morrow; whereat we may suppose his mouth watered. In course of time, he got wind of the real amount of their booty and understood how scurvily he had been used; but he seems to have borne no malice. How could he, against such superb operators as Petit-Jehan and De Cayeux; or a person like Villon, who could have...", "...Rokugo ferry, half way between Kanagawa and Yedo, except as the invited guest of one of the legations.

From thenceforth the life of the cigarette-maker can be divided into different epochs. The first, which lasted for a year, dated from the time of her marriage until the \"mantilla appeared.\" During this epoch she did not go out much, nor was she often seen in public. On Sundays she attended early mass, and the rest of the time she was shut up in the house. When she decided to don the aforementioned mantilla and attend eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> mass she was the cynosure of all eyes, in church as well as on her way through the streets; and the event was talked about for eight days afterward. The second epoch, which lasted three years, was from the \"mantilla episode\" to that of \"the gloves.\" The sight of such an adornment on the large dark hands of the ex-cigarette-maker produced an indescribable sensation in the feminine element of the neighborhood; in the streets, in church, and on visits, the ladies met each other...", "...to lose its power; and when they went ashore at six o'clock to cook their supper, they had sailed about fifteen miles.

At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Tom and Jim lay down in the bottom of the boat, and Joe came aft to take Tom's customary place at the sheet. Harry, of course, steered. All went well. The breeze was light but steady, and Harry kept the boat in the middle of the river to avoid another shipwreck. The watch below did not sleep much, for they had had a long nap at noon, and, besides, the novelty of their position made them wakeful. They had just dropped asleep when eleven o'clock arrived, and they were awakened...", "...mother went up to his room-door and rapped. \"It's late, Tom; are you not well?\" she called. \"I've a beastly headache. I'll be down directly,\" he answered, and when he did appear Mrs. Henderson was quite shocked at his appearance. He looked ill, haggard, and nervous, and ate nothing, drinking his tea, in sullen silence. All the rest of the morning it was the same thing. He did not go out, but seemed in a state of restless excitement that he could not suppress. Then about twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a rumor reached Stourton Grange that a murder had been committed in Fern Dene. The gardener heard it outside and hurried into the kitchen to tell his news. It was not known at first who it was. A woman's body had been found in the Dene, that was all, and when Mrs. Henderson went into her larder to inspect its contents and order the dinner, her cook followed her and told her mistress what she had heard. Mrs. Henderson turned actually faint as she listened. Tom's strange...", "...time. He hurried to the auto, and with Bob for company made the run to town in record time.

CHAPTER IX SOME GIRLS Tom thought the fifteen-mile trolley ride to Fairview was an unusually long one, but, as a matter of fact, it was soon accomplished, for he caught an express, and about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night arrived in the town where the co-educational institution was located. \"Now to find Phil's sister,\" he said half aloud, as he headed for the college. He knew the way well, for he had been there several times before in the previous spring, when his team played baseball. \"Hello, Parsons,\" a voice greeted him as he was walking up the campus. \"Where you bound for?\" The speaker was Frank Sullivan, manager of the Fairview ball team. \"Oh, I just came over to see...", "...neck. I gave a grunt and went on with my dream. It was a jolly dream, and nobody got up early in it. \"We will now bathe,\" repeated Archie. \"Go away,\" I said distinctly. Archie sat down on my knees and put his damp towel on my face. \"When my wife and I took this commodious residence for six weeks,\" he said, \"and engaged the sea at great expense to come up to its doors twice a day, it was on the distinct understanding that our guests should plunge into it punctually at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> every morning.\" \"Don't be silly, it's about three now. And I wish you'd get off my knees.\" \"It's a quarter-past seven.\" \"Then there you are, we've missed it. Well, we must see what we can do for you to-morrow. Good-night.\" Archie pulled all the clothes off me and walked with them to the window. \"Jove, what a day!\" he said. \"And can't you smell the sea?\" \"I can. Let that suffice. I say, what's happened to my blanket? I must have swallowed it in my sleep.\"...", "...know! I am afraid it might prove very severe. What is the appeal from one of your sentences?' 'There is none. I am a Mede and a Persian combined. Byo, why don't you give Mr. Rollo some cream with his peaches, and postpone me till another time?' 'She'll have to postpone me, too,' said Rollo. 'I must go. Shall I come for you at four o'clock? It will be too hot, I am afraid, before; and we have a good way to go.' CHAPTER XXIX. JEANNIE DEANS. It wanted some time of four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> yet, when Miss Kennedy came quietly into Mr. Falkirk's study and sat down by the window. 'Are you at leisure, sir?' she said, intertwining her fingers in a careless sort of way among the vines that hung there. 'My dear, I have been at leisure so long that I wish I could say I was busy. But I am not busy. What is it, Miss Hazel?' 'Only a few business questions, sir,' she said, attending to the vines. 'Will you let me ride with Major Seaton on Thursday?' 'Would you...", "...listening.\" \"At that door?\" \"Yes. Twice I have seen him to-day. He was at Boulogne; I saw him looking at your boxes. Then just after supper he came in--when I was speaking to the waiter.\" \"Then we have been followed,\" Peggy answered, breaking down utterly. \"Pauline, I feel that something dreadful is going to happen. Stay with me--don't go back to your room. Soothe me, Pauline, as you used to when I was little and afraid of the dark.\" CHAPTER IV It was about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning. The heat of the night before had given place to that incomparable freshness which spring mornings have in Paris. The windows of Mrs. Admaston's sitting-room were open, and a delightfully scented air, from the lilac blossoms and all the flowers of the gardens in the Tuileries, flooded and floated into the room. Rooms have an aspect of this or that emotion according to the hour in which the events of the soul have taken place within them. There are some...", "...stretched to include those extra fives and tens whose expenditure was in the interest of true economy. For a few days after her arrival Theodosia had kept her bed, in a reaction from the strain of the journey that made her too weak to care to do anything but lie in a half-drowsing and peaceful condition, hearing the sound of the children's voices as if they were very far off. Lois brought up the dainty meals herself, and talked the little talk women use on such occasions, and at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> each afternoon Zaidee appeared with a tiny lacquered tray on which stood an egg-shell cup filled with fragrant tea, and a biscuit, and watched Dosia, as she ate and drank, with benignant satisfaction. The younger Reginald was still afraid and was lured near her bedside only to rush off again; but with Zaidee there was a loving comradeship. It was well that Dosia had even lost interest in Mr. Barr's call the next afternoon, for he did not come, and afterwards she grew ashamed...", "...wills of both her parents, aroused his keenest antipathy. To put her in her place, to teach her that children must obey their parents in the Lord, was a duty to society, to the State. What Uncle Elbert wanted with such a child, he could not conceive; but since he did want her, have her he should. Tilting back his office chair and running his hand through his hair, Varney longed to spank her. This thought came to him, definitely and for about the seventh time, at half-past one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the third day, Monday. At the same moment, his telephone-bell rang sharply. It was the sailing-master to say that his good spouse had come aboard and that everything on the _Cypriani_ was in readiness for the start. \"I'll be on board inside of an hour,\" said Varney. He telephoned to Uncle Elbert, telephoned to Peter, and locked up his desk. To his office he casually gave out that pressing business matters were calling him out of town for a day or two. The two young...", "...towards her, dashed off a sprawling, \"Stop Mr Salt at any cost.--LISLE,\" and flashed it off to the League agency at Farnham. A couple of minutes must pass before she could get any reply. She picked up the cause of her excitement, and for the second time read the message it contained: \"If you want to keep your Mr Salt from being arrested on a charge of murder, warn him that Inspector Moeletter from Stafford will be waiting for him on the road between Farnham and Guildford at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this afternoon with a warrant. No one believes in it, but he will be taken on in his motor to Willesden, and on to Stafford by the 7.30, and kept out of the way for a week while things have time to happen at Hanwood. There will be just enough evidence to get a remand, as there was to get a warrant. This is from a friend, who may remind you of it later and prove who he is by this sign.\" The letter finished with a rough drawing of a gallows and a broken rope. It was written in...", "...and for that had hazarded everything ... her good name, even her whole future! For who could say whether the family would not renounce her, and she would lose her music lessons, if the truth came out?... The truth.... But what could come out? What had happened, then? What had she to reproach herself with? And with the comforting feeling of a clear conscience she was able boldly to answer: \"Nothing.\" And, of course, there was still time.... She could leave Vienna directly by the seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train, be back by ten in her own home, in her own cosy room, with her beloved boy.... Yes, she could; to be sure, Fritz was not at home ... but she could have him brought back.... No, she would not do it, she would not return at once ... there was no occasion to do so--to-morrow morning would be quite time enough. She would say good-bye to Emil that very evening.... Yes, she would inform him at once that she was returning home early next morning, and that her only reason in...", "...and lest any one should suspect I had ran away from the Moors, I took a northerly direction, and went cheerfully along, driving my horse before me, followed by all the boys and girls of the town. When I had travelled about two miles, and got quit of all my troublesome attendants, I struck again into the woods, and took shelter under a large tree, where I found it necessary to rest myself; a bundle of twigs serving me for a bed, and my saddle for a pillow. I was awakened about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by three Foulahs, who, taking me for a Moor, pointed to the sun, and told me it was time to pray. Without entering into conversation with them, I saddled my horse and continued my journey. I travelled over a level, but more fertile country, than I had seen for some time, until sunset, when, coming to a path that took a southerly direction, I followed it until midnight, at which time I arrived at a small pool of rain water, and the wood being open, I determined to rest by it for...", "...of good wishes from the warm-hearted Highlanders. Instead of looking carefully for the road, the good Doctor was soon nine fathoms deep into the reasons why the mountaineers and coast folk of all northern countries should be more blindly superstitious than the dwellers in plains and in towns; and so it happened that, coming to a fork in the track, he disregarded the advice of his horse, and, instead of taking the right hand, as he should have done, he held straight on, and, about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, found that not only had he lost his road, but that the track had died out altogether, and that he was completely abroad in the bush. He was in a very disagreeable predicament. The fog was thicker than ever, without a breath of air; and he knew that it was as likely as not that it might last for a day or two. He was in a very wild part of the mountain, quite on the borders of all the country used by white men. After some reflection, he determined to follow...", "...leads up to the expected denouement.\" He then recited to the wondering earl the whole of the curious events which had happened during the preceding twenty-four hours. It was late when they got to bed, but they rested well, and, after the manner of their race, fortified themselves with a good breakfast against the trials of the day, whatever these might prove to be. A few minutes before the appointed hour they quitted a _fiacre_ in the vicinity of the Rue Barbette, and at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Brett passed the _concierge_, whilst Fairholme took up his stand outside. The barrister was received with smiling complacence by Hussein-ul-Mulk. On this occasion he was conducted to another room of the flat, and he promptly noted that the windows looked out to the rear of the building, whereas during his previous visit he could survey the street. \"This promises badly,\" said Brett to himself, but he betrayed not the slightest unwillingness to fall in with the arrangements...", "...bloody mouth. And the rainy night which followed the battle we sheltered ourselves under the same oilcloth. But I can't help thinking of these gentlemen as being like all Virginians, which is illustrated by a remark of a great Massachusetts man, old John Adams, in answering some opponent, said: \"Virginians are all fine fellows. The only objection I have to you is, in Virginia every goose is a swan.\" Colonel Venable says: \"I am confident the charge of the Virginians was made before 9 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a.m.\" Mr. Bernard says, in speaking of the time: \"Mahone's Brigade left the plank road and took to the covered way.\" \"It is now half-past 8 o'clock.\" In a note he says: \"probably between 8.15 and 8.30.\" \"At the angle where the enemy could see a moving column with ease the men were ordered to run quickly by, one man at a time, which was done for the double purpose of concealing the approach of a body of troops and of lessening the danger of passing rifle balls at these...", "...find a place for me. Take my arm, sir.\" Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. \"She came out here,\" he said, looking about him, \"turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in her steps.\" It was ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door. \"Good night, citizen,\" said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively. \"Good night, citizen.\" \"How goes the Republic?\" \"You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being...", "...frost-pencilings all over the window panes. After breakfast, I sent to Mrs. Martindale a note of inquiry about Albert. A verbal answer came from the distracted mother, saying that he was still absent, and that inquiry of the police had failed to bring any intelligence in regard to him. It was still hoped that he had gone home with some friend, and would return during the day. Steadily the snow continued to fall, and as the wind had risen since morning, it drifted heavily. By ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> it was many inches deep, and there was no sign of abatement. My suspense and fear were so oppressive that, in spite of the storm, I dressed myself and went out to call on my friend. I found her in her chamber, looking very pale, and calmer than I had hoped to find her. But the calmness I soon saw to be a congelation of feeling. Fear of the worst had frozen the wild waves into stillness. \"God knows best,\" she said, in a voice so sad that its tones ached through my heart. \"We...", "...Fortescue was at breakfast, a note was handed to him by Broussard's soldier attendant. It read: \"Last night I had a visit from Lawrence. He has a great affection for his wife and child, and wanted me to talk with his wife about a family matter in which he feels he can not advise her. Can you kindly suggest some way by which I may have a private talk of a few minutes with Mrs. Lawrence?\" Colonel Fortescue scribbled on the back of the note: \"Come to my office in my house at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and I will have Mrs. Lawrence here.\" Broussard felt a little chagrined when he received this note. Suppose Anita should see him? She had already seen Mrs. Lawrence put her hand on his shoulder. There was, however, no gainsaying the C. O., and at ten o'clock Broussard rang the bell at the Commandant's house. Sergeant McGillicuddy opened the door for him and showed him into the little office across the hall, saying: \"Them's the Colonel's orders, sir.\" At the same...", "...have been----\" She groaned so that Miss Kelly lifted her head from her own pillow and listened intently, trying to determine whether the sufferer was asleep or awake. \"He's not stupid,\" she swept on, closing mutinous lips against the repetition of sound. \"He knew Enid could do nothing--nothing more. I don't understand. Oh, I don't understand! I wonder now why I said I heard nothing. \"I wonder why I lay unconscious on the floor near the dining room door all those hours--until ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning. It was because the knowledge was too much for me to stand--just as it is too much now. And I can't share it with anybody. I'll never be able to get it off my conscience. If I did, they'd hang him--or the other one who----\" At that thought, she screamed aloud, a wild, eerie sound that chilled the blood of even Miss Kelly, accustomed as she was to the cries of suffering and despair. The nurse was at the hysterical girl's side in a moment, holding her quivering...", "...me, you have no choice. Let me remind you that had you behaved honestly there would have been no reason for putting you to the inconvenience of this tiring journey. You have brought it on yourself.\" Coja Solomon sullenly went up the shore. Desmond then paid the men handsomely: they had indeed worked well, and they were abundantly satisfied with the hire they received. Leaving Coja Solomon to his bitter reflections, Desmond dropped down to Santipur, arriving there about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. Just before dawn ten hackeris, each yoked with two oxen, drew up near the Company's ghat. They were accompanied by a crowd of the inhabitants, lively with curiosity about the engagement of so many vehicles. The gumashta came up with the first cart, his face clouded with anxiety. He recognized the Babu at once, and said that while he had fulfilled the order he had received on Mr. Merriman's behalf, he had done it in fear and trembling. The whole country knew that...", "...wear and tear of constitution which he had since suffered, he will comprehend, better than Bruce himself seems to have done, why his spirits now began to fail him, and why, like an exhausted taper, life burned dimly in the socket. Bruce and his party were three or four miles from Derdera when the sun rose: there had been little rain that night, and they found very few torrents in their way; but it was slippery and troublesome walking, the rich soil being trodden into mire. About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they entered the broad plain of Maitsha, leaving the lake behind them. Here great part of the country was in tillage, and had been apparently covered with plentiful crops; but all had been cut down by the army for their horses, or, out of recklessness or vengeance, trodden under foot, so that a green blade could scarcely be seen. They met a number of persons this day, chiefly straggling soldiers, who, in parties of three and four, were seeking, in all the bushes and concealed...", "...after a heavy shelling of Bellevue, which he now knew was lost to him--a bitter surprise to his regimental and divisional commanders. It is uncertain what delayed his counter-attacks, but the mud had something to do with it, for on the German side as well as on ours there are swamps in which tall men sink to their necks, and bogs in which they are stuck to their knees, so badly that some of our prisoners lost their boots in getting free of this grip. It was at about four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon that the first German column tried to advance upon Bellevue from the northern end of the spur. They were caught in our barrage and shattered. Half an hour later another heavy attack was delivered against the Canadians on the main Passchendaele Ridge, and this was repulsed after close and fierce fighting, in which fifty prisoners were taken by our side. All through the night, after those vain efforts to get back their ground, the enemy shelled the Canadian...", "...Burns. I thought it an interesting coincidence that I should admire the child unconscious of his relationship to the man who had the day before impressed me so favorably. And, speaking of Mr. Burns, I reproduce below an item which appeared in one of the London papers the day after I returned Mr. Burns' call. He sent it to me with the remark that it probably differed from the personal items to which I was accustomed. It reads:-- \"Mr. Burns' Mysterious Visitor. \"Just before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this (Friday) morning a hansom cab (plentifully bespattered with gilt coronets) stopped outside the residence of Mr. Burns, Lavender Hill. A person alighted and was received with every appearance of cordiality by Mr. Burns, who escorted him into the house. We believe the visitor was Lord Rosebery; he certainly bore a striking resemblance to that childlike peer. Possibly, however, it was only the King of Italy. In diplomatic circles it has been known for a long time that his...", "...Marianne was expecting her eleventh child before long, she decided to accompany her husband. It would have pained her to be unable to give this proof of affection to her cousins, who, all things considered, had treated Blaise and his young wife very kindly. Moreover, she was really grieved by the terrible catastrophe. So she and her husband, after distributing the day's work among the servants, set out for Janville station, which they reached just in time to catch the quarter-past ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train. It was already rolling on again when they recognized the Lepailleurs and their son Antonin in the very compartment where they were seated. Seeing the Froments thus together in full dress, the miller imagined that they were going to a wedding, and when he learnt that they had a visit of condolence to make, he exclaimed: \"Oh! so it's just the contrary.

Ever ready for self-deprecation, she began to think that indeed she had behaved in a very ugly, unwomanly and aggressive manner, and her meekness cost her no effort now when she said gently: \"I am sorry, Bela!

Explanations were soon over and the kind gentleman took affairs in his own hands. The plan was that all of them should take the ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train back to Paris. Mr. Kinsella went off immediately to telegraph Mrs. Brown of Judy's whereabouts. The friends in Rue Brea had begun to be very uneasy about Judy. All they knew was what Elise could tell them of the girl's sudden determination to cut the art school and spend the morning in the country. Dark came and no Judy.

This train got into Oak Run at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, when the station was closed and the platform usually deserted. \"Let us ask around and see if anybody was here when the train came in,\" suggested Tom.

In the evening, attended by the pilot, Felix and Captain Scott went over to the town again, instructed to visit the hotels and ascertain, if they could, whether the veiled Arab was lodging at any of them.

It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. Ilombekabasi was astir. Men and boys were moving this way and that. The night was dark, but by the light of the small lamps kept burning before a few of the principal huts it could be seen that every face was tense with excitement and a subdued energy.

Las Cases returned to the Bellerophon at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning of the 14th, to inquire whether any reply had been received to the communication made by Napoleon. Captain Maitland stated that he expected to receive it every moment, and added that, if the Emperor would then embark for England, he was authorized to convey him thither.

He even went into the family history of Torsielli and explained about the correspondence with the long-lost brother, in which he acted as amanuensis, for he had come to the conclusion that in the long run honesty (up to a certain point) would prove the best policy. Thus he told the detective many things which the latter did not know or even suspect. Strollo's account of what had happened was briefly as follows: He and Toni had reached New York about twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and had spent an hour or so in the neighborhood of Mott Street looking at the parade of \"San Rocco.\" Then they had started for Yonkers and gone as far as the terminal of the Second Avenue El. It was about five o'clock in the afternoon. They had got out and started to walk. As they proceeded they suddenly had seen a man standing under a tree and Torsielli had said to Strollo: \"That man standing under that tree looks like my brother.\" Strollo had replied: \"You know I am...", "...she set about her household duties in her usual self-contained and steadfast way.

CHAPTER XXVII. A BIG BRIBE. It seemed to Janetta as if she had almost expected to see Lady Caroline Adair drive up to her door about four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next day, in the very victoria wherein the girl had once sat side by side with Margaret's mother, and from which she had first set eyes on Wyvis Brand. She had expected it, and yet her heart beat faster, and her color went and came, as she disposed of her pupils in the little dining-room, and met her visitor just as she crossed the hall. \"Can I speak to you for five minutes, Miss Colwyn?\" said Lady Caroline, in so suave a voice that for a moment Janetta felt reassured.

My affairs are in order.\" Then, Rudolph said, \"he let go and died.\" On his desk the coroner found a letter, dated at five o'clock that afternoon. It stated that he had just shot his wife; that any will she might secretly have made would be invalid, as he survived her. He meant to shoot himself at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and would, if he had strength, fire a shot through the window in the hope that passers-by might come in and see him \"before life was extinct,\" as he wrote. \"Now, would you have thought that man had such a cruel heart?\" Antonia turned to me after the story was told. \"To go and do that poor woman out of any comfort she might have from his money after he was gone!\" \"Did you ever hear of anybody else that killed himself for spite, Mr. Burden?\" asked Rudolph.

How queer I didn't think of it! Why, it will be just the thing!\" And the face of the youngest Rover brightened up considerably. Just what move to make next would depend in a great measure on how Tom felt when he roused up. His brothers watched him anxiously, but made no move to wake him. It was about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the forenoon when a shout was heard, and, looking through the bushes, the boys beheld Jack Wumble and Ike Furner. Each had a pack on his back. \"Hello!\" cried Dick, and ran out to meet them. \"Oh, so there ye are!\" exclaimed Jack Wumble. \"Thought ye must be somewhere around here. How are ye, all right?\" he went on, anxiously. \"Yes. A little scratched up, that's all.\" \"An' Sam, an' Tom?\" \"Sam is a bit scratched up, too.

The yacht threw off her moorings. By three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they had left the estuary of the Seine and entered the Channel. At that moment, Holmlock Shears lay sound asleep in the berth to which he was fastened down. * * * * * On the following morning, the tenth and last day of the war between the two great rivals, the _Echo de France_ published this delicious paragraph: \"A decree of expulsion was pronounced by Arsene Lupin yesterday against Holmlock Shears, the English detective. The decree...", "...our trunks down a little more and to pay extra luggage on, I happened to glance at the sun, and it was just above the horizon. It looked to be about four o'clock in the afternoon, and we had had nothing to eat since nine o'clock, and even then only a cup of coffee. I felt myself suddenly grow faint and weak. \"Heavens!\" I said, \"see what time it is! We have shopped all day and we have forgotten to get our luncheon.\" My companion glanced at her watch. \"It's only half past eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by my watch.

He wanted to leave me the dinner and come for the plates in the evening; but not caring to share the meal with the vile mob around me I made him wait till I had done and come again at the same time the next day, as I did not require any supper. The servant obeyed. Marazzini said rudely that I might at least have kept the bottle of wine; but I gave him no answer. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Manucci appeared, accompanied by a Spanish officer. After the usual compliments had passed between us I asked the officer if I might write to my friends, who would not allow me to stay much longer in prison if they were advised of my arrest. \"We are no tyrants,\" he replied; \"you can write what letters you like.\" \"Then,\" said I, \"as this is a free country, is it allowable for a soldier who has received certain moneys to buy certain articles to pocket the money and...", "...I thought I recognized her.\" \"Yes. I haven't got a horse of my own, you know,\" said Jenny deliberately. \"Oh!\" Jenny suddenly felt her hatred rise almost to passion. \"I must be going,\" she said. \"I've got to visit an old woman who's dying. A rector's daughter, you know--\" \"Ah! yes.\" Then Jenny mounted from a rock (Lady Richard held the mare's head and settled the habit), and rode slowly away downhill. (III) Dick approached the Rectory next day a little before twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> with as much excitement in his heart as he ever permitted to himself. Dick is a good fellow--I haven't a word to say against him, except perhaps that he used to think that to be a Guiseley, and to have altogether sixteen hundred a year and to live in a flat in St. James's, and to possess a pointed brown beard and melancholy brown eyes and a reposeful manner, relieved him from all further effort. I have wronged him, however; he had made immense efforts to be proficient at...", "...hours, pleasantly conversing, mostly on religious subjects. It is a little extraordinary, with what openness some of these dear people speak to us of the state of their minds. When the circle was seated, we formed a pretty large company.

I trust a parting blessing was felt amongst us. 30_th_.--From 9 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> till half-past 12, we received visits in succession, I think not fewer than fifteen. At half-past 2, Mad'e de Tavel accompanied us to the Penitentiary prison. For cleanliness and order, I think, it exceeds all I ever saw of the kind. I fear the religious instruction is very superficial; none but formal prayers and written sermons are used. 31_st_.--Attended Mad'lle Berthom's Scripture class, at the Institution for the Destitute.

She had herself closed the passage window at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, as usual. She had several times previously found it partly open in the morning, after having thus shut it over-night; but never before, Mr. Ward's bed unslept in. Her last interview with Mr. Axworthy was then narrated, with his words--an imprecation against rifle practice, as an excuse for idle young rascals to be always out of the way.

Gawaine especially distinguished himself. His strength, always greater than that of ordinary men, became doubled between the hours of nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning and noon, and the same phenomenon again took place between three in the afternoon and even-song. He generally contrived to engage in battle at those times of the day when his prowess was greatest, and of course wrought terrible havoc among the heathen, devoting his attention especially to the giants, who were numerous in their ranks, and cutting them to pieces in a fashion which rivalled the exploits of his uncle at Carohaise.

He was too frightened to speak,...", "...\"Then I did a bit of scrounging.

The Devil's Tavern was a resort for actors, authors, bohemians, lords and ladies, who did not retire early to their downy couches. The night we arrived the tavern was crowded, as the Actors' Annual Ball was in progress, and many fair women and brave men belated by Bacchus could not find their way home, and were compelled to remain all night and be cared for by the host of the Devil.

The wind blew strong from the north-west. As soon as we had passed the Mewstone we were sheltered from a very heavy sea which ran from the westward. At eight o'clock at night we were abreast of the south cape when the wind became light and variable. Saw several fires inland. The Mewstone is a high bold rock that lies five leagues to...", "...replied, \"our hunting not only isn't over, it hasn't even started. Patience!

He left before the dinner was over, so that Phillida did not have a moment alone with him. The next evening she expected him to...", "...in front.

In answer to the counsel for the prosecution, he stated that he was at the Vintry Mill at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of the 6th of July, not professionally, but as taking interest in the Ward family. He had seen the body of the deceased, and considered death to have been occasioned by fracture of the skull, from a blow with a blunt heavy instrument. The superintendent had shown him a rifle, which he considered, from the marks on it, as well as from the appearance of the body, to have produced the injury. The rifle was the one shown to him; it was the property of Leonard Ward....", "...always looms big, and of course he was quite right in saying that it's likely to get you all gummed up.

It was now eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and the ranch-house was dark. Without dismounting, Brian Oakley called, \"Hello, Henry!\" There was no answer. Moving his horse close to the window of the room where he knew the rancher slept, the Ranger tapped on the sash. \"Henry, turn out; I want to see you; it's Oakley.\" A moment later the sash was raised and Carleton asked, \"What is it, Brian? What's up?\" \"Is Sibyl stopping with you folks, to-night?\" \"Sibyl!

The mate's watch went first, among them my stout friend Joe, whom I tearfully begged not to get drunk and kick up a row, for my sake. Looking back I wonder at my temerity, for it must have been like getting between a tiger and a shin-bone; but he took it very meekly, and actually promised that he would come aboard sober. During their absence the ship was strangely quiet, very little work of any kind was done, and the waiting watch were as sulky as bears.

But that was a year in the past. Bud had cabin fever now and did not know what ailed him, though cause might have been summed up in two meaty phrases: too much idleness, and too much mother-in-law.

In the kitchen of the little green cottage on North Sixth Street where Bud had built the home nest with much nearly-Mission furniture and a piano, Bud was frying his own hotcakes for his ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> breakfast, and was scowling over the task.

Then, he went on to state, how the number of people who came out with beer-jugs, averaged twenty-one in five minutes, which, being multiplied by twelve, gave two hundred and fifty-two people with beer-jugs in an hour, and multiplied again by fifteen (the number of hours during which the house was open daily) yielded three thousand seven hundred and eighty people with beer-jugs per...", "...plain, the mysterious delicate light of sunrise on the backs of the sheep and goats.

He wrote to the colonel's lawyer, asking him to come down. Hallett had left the house at once, though Lisle earnestly begged him to stay till the funeral was over.

In the mean time, the ships were got under sail, and wrought up to the island.

It was seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when he reached Salamanca, and, tired as he was, bespattered with mud from head to foot, he proceeded at once to the general's quarters. There he learnt that Sir John was attending a reception given by the Marchesa de Almaran, one of the grandes dames of the city. Leaving the horse at a neighbouring inn, Jack made his way to the Marchesa's palace, hoping that the commander-in-chief's explicit instructions would excuse any want of ceremony there might be in his action. He...", "...us you will have to remain all night in Cincinnati.\" Shirley turned to Mabel. \"Let's get our things and hurry and catch the trolley car,\" she said. The two girls boarded the delayed train and hastily collected their belongings. The conductor was courteous enough to see them to a taxicab, which soon whirled them across the city. Here they found that they could get an electric car in fifteen minutes, which, barring accidents, would get them in Cincinnati in ample time for the six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train south. The girls climbed aboard the car, settled themselves comfortably, and fell to talking. At last the car started, and soon they were beyond the city and whirling along rapidly. For an hour they rode, the car stopping occasionally to take on or to discharge passengers; and then, suddenly, slackening slightly to round rather a sharp curve, the car dashed forward again; and there came a sharp cry from passengers in the front seats. At the same instant the...", "...Appleyard. \"There he set them down, and there he left them. That's all.\" \"Well, that's something, anyway,\" remarked the chief. \"It carries the thing on another stage. Now we'll leave that and attend to our own business.\" The Pompadour Private Hotel, like most establishments of its class in Bayswater, was a place of peace and of comparative solitude during the greater part of the day. It was busy enough up to ten o'clock in the morning, and it began to be busy enough again by six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, but from ten to six more than two-thirds of its denizens were not to be found within its walls. The business man had gone to the City; the professional women had departed to their offices; nothing of humanity but a few elderly widows and spinsters, and an old gentleman or two were left in the various rooms. Everything, therefore, was quiet enough when the chief, accompanied by Chettle, drove up, entered the hall, and asked to see the manager and manageress. As...", "...we drew reins on our noble ponies at the door, I was received with: \"I just knew that was Pet Fulton by the laugh;\" and as I slipped down, right into their arms, I thought after all the ride was well worth the taking, and the morning a grand one. Rising before the sun, I watched its coming, and the mirage on the river, showing distinctly the river, islands, and towns; but all faded away as the mirage died out, and then the ride over the green prairie, bright with flowers, and at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> breakfasting with old friends. We swung around the circle of Indiana county friends, the Butterbaughs and Fairbanks, until Monday. Must say I enjoyed the _swing_ very much. Took a long ramble over the bluffs that range east and west, a half mile south of Mr. J. B.'s home. Climbed bluff after bluff, only to come to a jumping off place of from 50 to 100 feet straight down. To peer over these places required a good deal of nerve, but I held tight to the grass or a soap weed...", "...and taking a hand in the desultory firing in the street. The sheriff had a couple of men ironed and one man down and the landlord of the hotel was doing a great deal of explaining that he had never seen the bandits before. Just by way of stimulating his memory Bud threw a bullet close to his heels, and the landlord thereupon grovelled and wept while he protested his innocence. \"He's a damn liar, sheriff,\" Bud called across the hoof-scarred road. \"He was talking to them about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> last night. There were three that chased me into town, and they got him up out of bed to find out whether I'd stopped there. I hadn't, luckily for me. If I had he'd have showed them the way to my room, and he'd have had a dead boarder this morning. Keep right on shedding tears, you old cut-throat! I was sitting on the court-house porch, last night, and I heard every word that passed between you and the Catrockers!\" \"I've been suspicioning here was where they got their...", "...although occasionally I catch one of them staring at me with an expression which says as plainly as words, \"What on earth does a woman want of score reading?\" The chorus is well under way. To-day is Thursday, and while you have been singing with the faithful in the Cecilia Society I, too, have been at a rehearsal, only we call it a _Probe_ here, and the atmosphere is somewhat different from that of Pilgrim Hall. The _Oberster Chor_ (which means the upper chorus) met at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-day. The room where we sit is on the top floor and at the end is an organ. I think the orchestra class generally practises here. The air is always frightfully close and hot, for there are about two hundred of us and never a window open. That is the German idea. What a splendid thing a Fresh Air Fund would be over here! The piano against the wall is on a raised platform about which the chorus forms a half circle. Professor Becht, one of the organ teachers, presides. Such a...", "...besides breakfast in the forenoon and dinners, there were \"beverages\" or \"nuntion\" after dinner, and supper before going to bed --\"a toie brought in by hardie Canutus,\" who was a gross feeder. Generally there were, except for the young who could not fast till dinnertime, only two meals daily, dinner and supper. Yet the Normans had brought in the habit of sitting long at the table--a custom not yet altogether abated, since the great people, especially at banquets, sit till two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon; so that it is a hard matter to rise and go to evening prayers and return in time for supper. Harrison does not make much account of the early meal called \"breakfast\"; but Froude says that in Elizabeth's time the common hour of rising, in the country, was four o'clock, summer and winter, and that breakfast was at five, after which the laborers went to work and the gentlemen to business. The Earl and Countess of Northumberland breakfasted together and alone at...", "...confirmed when I returned after midnight. Bindo did not question me about the person he had sent me to watch for. He merely said-- \"Ewart, you and I have a long run before us to-morrow. We must be away at seven. The quicker we're out of this place, the better.\" I saw he had hurriedly packed, and that his receipted hotel bill lay upon the dressing-table. \"Where are we going?\" \"I'll tell you to-morrow. Give this wire to the night-porter and tell him it's to be sent at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to-morrow morning.\" I read the message. It was to Mademoiselle, to say that he could not call, as he was compelled to go to Hyeres, but that he would dine at the Bristol that evening. \"And,\" he added, \"get your traps together. We're leaving here, and we leave no trace behind--you understand?\" I nodded. Was the game up? Were we flying because the police suspected us? I recollected the long-nosed man, and a serious apprehension seized me. I confess I slept but little...", "...three in the morning, and arrived at our billets about seven. I knew this commission was on the _tapis_--French word meaning carpet--so I hung round not daring to turn in. At eleven o'clock I had orders to push off home to get my kit. You'll guess I didn't want asking twice. I made my way to the railhead at once in case of any hitch, and had to wait some time for a train. It was a goods train when it came, but it did quite well and deposited me outside the port of embarkation about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night. I walked on into the port and found the ship that was crossing next morning. I went below in search of a cabin. There was a French sailor there to whom I explained my need.\" \"How?\" I asked, for I do not share Ernest's opinion of his mastery of the French language, but he ignored this. \"It was dark down there,\" he went on, \"too dark for him to see that I was in a private's uniform, so I put on a bit of side and he took me for an officer.\" \"A French officer?\"...", "...still, and they sat together in silence for several hours, until Marquard came and insisted that Edwin must spend the night with him. \"To-morrow!\" replied the latter. \"Let me have my own way to-day. Go all of you, and leave me. Rest assured this course is best for me; I'll go to sleep, and my quiet companion will not disturb me.\" At first Marquard would not listen to such a proposal, but Edwin was firm in his resolution, and they at last left him alone with the dead. It was ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on a cold, dark winter's night; the wind drove snow flakes into the open windows, and ever and anon the candles flickered as if they would be extinguished. Edwin, wrapped in Balder's cloak, had thrown himself on his bed without undressing, and now lay listening to the wind, the spluttering of the candles, and the distant rolling of the carriages in the crowded city. No restful sleep visited his excited senses, only a hasty changeful dream, in which scenes from his earliest...", "...no, not to have saved his life. The trance lasted only a few minutes, but he came out of it sighing, and then asked in a voice of awe and wonder, \"_Who is that man waiting for me, Papa?_\" He was assured there was no one waiting, but he replied, \"_Yes, there is a man waiting for me. He is in the next room_.\" Then his father noticed that his eyes had a new, deep look in them, as if some veil had been rent, and he with open face had beheld things wonderful and secret. About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they took him away from me into the next room. He clung to my feet, and begged to stay with me, and I--Oh, I strove as mortals strive with the impossible to speak, to plead, that he might remain! But it could not be. His father lifted him in his arms, and through the next five awful hours he held him there. No! no! It is not writable, unless one could write with blood and tears. At midnight it was over.

In the fall we loaded up two wagons with them and with oxen as the motive power started one afternoon for St. Anthony. We had to make our way down towards Fort Snelling until we came within two miles of the fort. Then we turned towards our destination. It was a long and tedious trip. We camped out over night and did not reach the west bank of the Mississippi River opposite St. Anthony until three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next afternoon. We fed our cattle in a grove not far from where the Nicollet House now stands, then started for the ferry, which swung across the Mississippi River about where the stone arch bridge now is. The island was heavily timbered and the road ran across at an angle, coming out at a bridge on First Street South. We got up onto the street just about the time the men were coming out of the mills, sold our watermelons and went home with $10.00 each, the proceeds of our...", "...of a lead pencil and could only be lighted by thrusting the sulphur into the flame.

According to the _Pall Mall Gazette_, Mr. Holden said, \"In the morning I used to get up at 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in order to pursue my studies, and I used at that time the flint and steel, in the use of which I found very great inconvenience. Of course, I knew, as other chemists did, the explosive material that was necessary in order to produce instantaneous light, but it was very difficult to obtain a light on wood by that explosive material, and the idea occurred to me to put sulphur under the explosive mixture. I did that and showed it in my next lecture on chemistry, a course of which...", "...see the girl you would have picked Dance with another boy Without a single smile for you, Determined to annoy.

He understood. Even this sturdy little soldier cowered before the obscure menace of the hidden Hill People. Terry resented, vaguely, that others did not respond to the spell of the Hills as he did. The five minutes had freshened the wonderful little steeds, so they mounted and pushed on through the heat with eyes half shut against the glare of sand and water. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they pulled up in front of Terry's quarters. A note from the secreto lay on his table. He opened it and read that Malabanan had not returned, that the place was deserted. He had anticipated this, knowing that the band would now operate from some secret rendezvous in the maze of the forests. His problem now was to locate their meeting place: his patrols must search them out. Information would be passed quickly to them by the inhabitants of the gulf--every planter, laborer,...", "...a network of long, hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied with a sort of gummy flour. This flour was the starch-like sago, an edible substance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples. For the time being, Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into pieces, as if he were making firewood; later he would extract the flour by sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous ligaments, let it dry out in the sun, and leave it to harden inside molds.

Nobody appeared on our arrival. The enormous sheet-iron cylinder seemed deserted. Our provisions loaded on board, I went below to my stateroom. There I found my supper ready. I ate and then fell asleep. The next day, January 6: nothing new on board. Not a sound inside, not a sign of life.

It was four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when Dr. Fernbeck came again. This time he was accompanied by Dr. Oliver Rowland. The two medical men spent half-an hour in the sick-room, and then came down, saying that, as Sir Francis Granby had seen the patient in his former illness, it could do no harm if he saw him now in this. Dr. Rowland would remain in attendance while Dr. Fernbeck went to fetch Sir Frederick, and a cabman was sent for Mr. Macklin, of the firm of Macklin and Dowell, solicitors to the patient, as the...", "...way, and I confess that, yet awhile, I feel too young to strike my grand coup.

But a single winged word from her mother overleaped her successive intrenchments. She turned and kissed her cousin, and deposited an irrepressible tear on his moustache. Then she went and said her prayers to her mother: it was evident she was being admirably brought up. Rowland, with the permission of his hostess, lighted a cigar and puffed it awhile in silence. Cecilia's interest in his career seemed very...", "...of my colleagues, we assent to the proposal, and leave all details in your Honour's hands.\" The President lifted his eyes, and ran them swiftly along the rigid faces turned to him. Then, in the breathless hush, he spoke for the first time in his strange voice, now as passionless as a frozen river. \"Is there any other proposal?\" There was a murmur of assent as the men rose to their feet. \"Thank you, gentlemen,\" said the secretary.

Even the...", "...that the modern university is a university of books. Now the frank recognition of the book and not the lecture as the substantial basis of instruction opens up a large and interesting range of possibilities. It releases the process of learning from its old servitude to place and to time.

The young man who reads at eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning in luxurious rooms in Trinity College, Cambridge, will have no very marked advantage over another young man, employed during the day, who reads at eleven o'clock at night in a bed-sitting-room in Glasgow.

In vain he pinched, shook, shouted, and swore; inarticulate grunts and apoplectic denunciations against the disturber of his rest were the only answers to his urgent appeals as to the necessity of Mr. Brown Bunkem's getting ready to appear before the magistrate. Visions of contempt of court, forfeited bail, and consequent disbursements, flitted before the mind of the agitated Mr. Adolphus Casay. Ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> came; Bunken seemed to snore the louder and sleep the sounder. What was to be done? why, nothing but to get up an impromptu influenza, and try his rhetoric on the presiding magistrates of the bench. Influenced by this determination, Mr. Adolphus Casay started for that den of thieves and magistrates in the neighbourhood of Bow-street; but Mr. Adolphus Casay's feelings were anything but enviable; though by no means a straitlaced man, he had an instinctive abhorrence of anything...", "...and currant jelly, mashed potatoes, green peas, little new beets, and the most delicious custard pie for dessert, all rich, velvety yellow with a golden-brown top. The guest ate as if he enjoyed it, and asked for a second piece of pie, just as if he were one of them. It was unbelievable! He helped clear off the table too, and insisted on Carol's giving him a wiping-towel to help with the dishes. It was just like a dream. The young man tore himself reluctantly away about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and went home, but before he left he took Shirley's hand and looked into her eyes with another of those deep understanding glances, and Shirley watched him whirling away in the moonlight, and wondered if there ever would be another day as beautiful and exciting and wonderful as this had been, and whether she could come down to sensible, every-day living again by morning. Then there was the story of the day to tell all over again after he was gone, and put in the little...", "...recurred to his mind. He wondered how they had set about beginning, and he wished he could ask Del Ferice himself. He could not go to the man's house, but he might possibly meet him at Maria Consuelo's. He was surprised to find that he had almost forgotten her in his anxiety to become a man of business. It was too early to call yet, and in order to kill the time he went home, got a horse from the stables and rode out into the country for a couple of hours. At half-past five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he entered the familiar little sitting-room in the hotel. Madame d'Aranjuez was alone, cutting a new book with the jewelled knife which continued to be the only object of the kind visible in the room.

It is half-past to-day.\" Orsino looked at his watch. \"Do you notice whether I come or not?\" he...", "...alone there was any hope of obtaining a view into the interior of the island, all the other hills being thickly covered with wood. On approaching the south-west corner of the cove, a small opening was found leading into a considerable piece of water; and by one of its branches we reached within little more than a mile of the desired sandy eminence. After I had observed the latitude 35 deg. 50' 2\" from an artificial horizon, we got through the wood without much difficulty, and at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> reached the top of the eminence, to which was given the name of _Prospect Hill_. Instead of a view into the interior of the island, I was surprised to find the sea at not more than one and half or two miles to the southward. Two points of the coast towards the east end of the island bore S. 77 deg. E., and the furthest part on the other side, a low point with breakers round it, bore S. 33 deg. W., at the supposed distance of four or five leagues. Between these extremes a large...", "...until he was awaked with the information that the battle was gained. This fact, which was related to me in the evening, did not astonish me in the least; for I have already remarked that when he was compelled to yield to the necessity of sleep, that imperious want of nature, the Emperor took the repose which was so necessary to him when and where he could, like a true soldier. Although the result was decided, the battle was continued until five o'clock in the evening. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the Emperor had his tent erected near a solitary inn, which had served as headquarters for the Emperor Alexander during the two preceding days. I received orders to attend him there, and did so with all speed; but his Majesty, nevertheless, passed the whole night receiving and congratulating the chief generals, and working with his secretaries. All the wounded who were able to march were already on the road to Dresden, where all necessary help awaited them. But on the field...", "...as his volunteer aide. Losing his temper in the dispute, he accused the latter of being either a tory or a coward. \"No,\" replied the brave old man, \"I feel toward you all as a father, and will not lead you into a scrape from which I cannot extricate you.\" His discretion, however, was overpowered by repeated taunts, and he at length, about nine o'clock, gave the word to march. The march was rather dogged and irregular. There was ill-humor between the general and his officers. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they came to a place where the road was carried on a causeway of logs across a deep marshy ravine, between high level banks. The main division descended into the ravine, followed by the baggage-wagons. They had scarcely crossed it, when the enemies suddenly sprang up in front and on each side with deadly volleys of musketry and deafening yells and war-whoops. In fact, St. Leger, apprised by his scouts of their intended approach, had sent a force [of Johnson's greens, rangers,...", "...either.\" And Susan was very angry and disdainful, and did not speak to George all dinner-time. As for poor George, he followed her into the house with a heart both sick and heavy. This Berkshire farmer had a proud and sensitive nature under a homely crust.

He shivered with vague fears, and wished the sun would set at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and the sorrowful day come to an end. CHAPTER II. THE meal passed almost in silence; Robinson was too hungry to say a word, and a weight hung upon George and Susan.

While the Good News was being made ready for its thousand mile flight to Atkinson, Tim wired Carson that he was on his way with the plates and would arrive about noon the next day. At one a. m. Tim and Dugan sped away from the Nogales field and their friends of the border patrol. Dawn found them well on their way toward Atkinson and at 11:30 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Tim sighted his home field. When they taxied up to the apron, Tim found Carson waiting for him. The managing editor had ordered a dark room for developing the plates rigged up at the field and in less than half an hour, a complete set of pictures were on their way to the News office while another set, still damp, were placed on board a special plane to be rushed to Chicago where they were to be placed on the telephoto wires.

It was still thirty miles distant from the yacht, whose stem was rapidly cutting her way over the water at the rate of sixteen knots an hour. Gradually the form of the island grew more distinct on the horizon. The orb of day sinking in the west, threw up its peculiar outlines in sharp relief. A few peaks of no great elevation stood out here and there, tipped with sunlight. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> John Mangles could discern a light smoke rising from it. \"Is it a volcano?\" he asked of Paganel, who was gazing at this new land through his telescope. \"I don't know what to think,\" replied the geographer; \"Maria Theresa is a spot little known; nevertheless, it would not be surprising if its origin were due to some submarine upheaval, and consequently it may be volcanic.\" \"But in that case,\" said Glenarvan, \"is there not reason to fear that if an eruption produced it,...", "...to eat. Daylight brought no abatement in the storm. The ice was deep under a coating of slush, and quite impassable for dogs and men, and the sea was pounding and battering at the outer edge, as the roar of smashing ice testified, though quite shut out from view by driving snow. There was nothing to do but follow the shore, a long way around, and off they started. Here and there was an opportunity to cut across small coves and inlets where the ice was safe enough, and at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon they reached Crow Island, a small island three-quarters of a mile from the mainland.

She braided her hair in innumerable plaits and took her weary little bones off to bed. \"But I'm sure I shan't sleep a blessed wink, Miss Shirley, ma'am, for fear that something'll go wrong at the last minute . . . the cream won't whip . . . or Mr. Irving'll have a stroke and not be able to come.\" \"He isn't in the habit of having strokes, is he?\" asked Diana, the dimpled corners of her mouth twitching. To Diana, Charlotta the Fourth...", "...at their meetings we may form some opinion of the indolent manner in which they trifled away their time. We are fortunately enabled to do this, by a letter in which Patru describes, in a very amusing manner, the visit which Christina of Sweden took a sudden fancy to pay to the Academy. The Queen of Sweden suddenly resolved to visit the French Academy, and gave so short a notice of her design, that it was impossible to inform the majority of the members of her intention. About four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> fifteen or sixteen academicians were assembled. M. Gombaut, who had never forgiven her majesty, because she did not relish his verses, thought proper to show his resentment by quitting the assembly. She was received in a spacious hall. In the middle was a table covered with rich blue velvet, ornamented with a broad border of gold and silver. At its head was placed an armchair of black velvet embroidered with gold, and round the table were placed chairs with tapestry backs....", "...She had carefully refrained from knowing anybody in the hotel. So how to go about it she did not know; but she knew enough after luncheon to have her hair done by somebody besides her maid, selected the most American gown in her repertoire, took a sunshade hitherto disdained, and glanced in the mirror at a picture in white, with gold hair, violet eyes, and a skin of snow and roses. Further she did not know how to equip herself, except by going out doors at five o'clock. And at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she went. From the tennis courts young men and girls looked at her. On the golf links youth turned to observe her slim and dainty progress. She was stared at from porch and veranda, from dock and deck, from garden and walk and orange grove and hedge of scarlet hibiscus. From every shop window in the village, folk looked out at her; from automobile, wheeled chair, bicycle, and horse-drawn vehicle she was inspected. But she knew nobody; not one bright nod greeted her; not...", "...in his fist and the leer even stronger. If he expected me to race downstairs as soon as he was out of ear-shot, he was mistaken, for I hit the sack like the proverbial ton of crushed mortar.

Now that we had something solid to work on, I could look forward to some concrete action instead of merely feeling pushed around.

I was anxious to get going so I dressed and shaved in a hurry and cancelled the eight o'clock call. Then I asked the operator to connect me with 913. A gruff, angry male voice snarled out of the earpiece at me. I began to apologize profusely but the other guy slammed the phone down on the hook hard enough to make my ear ring. I jiggled my hook angrily and when the operator answered I...", "...of life. And these are the women who catch men of the world with their youth and innocence.\" Her face grew hard, she looked almost plain, and for the moment her thirty years showed themselves unmistakably. She tore the offending note into fragments, and threw them into a dainty little waste-paper basket--everything about the flat was dainty. \"But I will get even with Mr Guy Rossett before long,\" she cried vindictively, as she returned to her seat. It was somewhere about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning when she indulged in these bitter reflections, when she had to admit, in the face of that letter, that her ambitious schemes had gone astray. At the same hour, a tall and corpulent gentleman, attired in an elegant morning coat and silk hat, descended the steps of his house at Walton, stepped into the Rolls-Royce car waiting for him, drove to the station, and took the train to London. He was known in his business, and in the neighbourhood, as Mr Jackson,...", "...of wine and mineral water. When the champagne came, and that is served at a later stage in Germany than it is with us, speeches of congratulation were made to the host on his safe return, and every guest in reach clinked their glasses with his. After dinner men and women rose together in the German way, and drank coffee in the drawing-room. The men lighted cigars. A little later in the evening slender glasses of beer and lemonade were brought round, and just before everyone left at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> there was tea and a variety of little cakes and sandwiches, not our double sandwiches, but tiny single slices of buttered roll, each with its scrap of caviare or smoked salmon. A ball supper or a Christmas supper in Germany consists of three or four courses served separately, and all hot except the sweet, which is usually _Gefrorenes_. Salmon, roast beef or veal, venison or chicken, and then ice would be an ordinary menu, and every course would be divided into portions and...", "...upon an iron lever. The last 20 miles very hilly.

Madame Derville gave a cry and fainted. One <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was striking when the jury retired to their room. None of the women had left their places; several men had tears in their eyes. The conversations were at first very animated, but, as there was a delay in the verdict of the jury, their general fatigue gradually began to invest the gathering with an atmosphere of calm.

At 1:30 p.m. the fleet was off Lombard street and a few minutes later it was steaming past Meiggs' wharf. Thousands of people, attracted by the blowing of whistles, rushed to points of vantage on the city front and cheered the departing boats. Soldiers crowded the fort at the point and shouted and waved their hats as the squadron passed out through the Golden Gate.

The Colon took four companies of the Twenty-third Infantry and two companies of the Eighteenth Infantry, both of the regular army, and Battery A...", "...from a romantic point of view, was an inspiring one, although it must have been a jealous sight for the German captain. But now we were drawing in toward the approaches to New York harbour; our race had been with daylight as well as with steam. For I'd promised myself that, by hook or crook, we would arrive that night. I scanned the horizon anxiously for a pilot boat--in those days the New York pilot boats were small but exceptionally sea-worthy two-masted schooners; and at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, with half an hour of daylight still remaining, caught sight of one standing toward us on the weather bow. We came together rapidly. By this time we had left the _Energie_ a couple of miles astern.

Each morning at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all the flowers that have bloomed that day are picked off, so as to ensure the next day's blooms shall not be deprived of any nourishment. The bells are very large and extremely brilliant, blue, purple, magenta, all the possible intense shades of each. The flowers are almost a little crude, some verging on vulgarity in their flaring tones. Many of them are delightful, and some so large they are said to reach 8 inches or so across a single bloom; such huge ones I did not see,...", "...an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.\" The conclusion of the momentous transaction was as deliberate and simple as had been its various stages of preparation. The morning and midday of January 1, 1863, were occupied by the half-social, half-official ceremonial of the usual New Year's day reception at the Executive Mansion, established by long custom. At about three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, after full three hours of greetings and handshakings, Mr. Lincoln and perhaps a dozen persons assembled in the executive office, and, without any prearranged ceremony the President affixed his signature to the great Edict of Freedom. No better commentary will ever be written upon this far-reaching act than that which he himself embodied in a letter written to a friend a little more than a year later: \"I am naturally antislavery. If slavery is not wrong,...", "...Thousand Souls,'\" answered Kitten. \"And what a funny name Pisemsky had--Alexey Feofilaktitch! \"Where are you going?\" cried Startsev in horror, as she suddenly got up and walked towards the house. \"I must talk to you; I want to explain myself....

What for?\" It was clear: Kitten was playing a prank. Who would seriously dream of making an appointment at night in the cemetery far out of the town, when it might have been arranged in the street or in the town gardens? And was it in keeping with him--a district doctor, an intelligent, staid man--to be sighing, receiving notes, to hang about cemeteries,...", "...break?\" \"I hope not--I've never hoped it more! I had a word with Owen, too, after I left her, and I think he understands that he must let her go without insisting on any positive promise.

The need of shielding Sophy will help him to control himself. He's coming to his senses, poor boy; he's ashamed of his wild talk already. He asked me to tell you so; no...", "...I'm quite sure of it.\" \"You are not,\" he said severely. \"You have been asleep in a February night, in the open air, with less clothing on than I wear in the tropics.\" I had got up by this time, refusing his help, and because my feet were numb, I sat down on the parapet for a moment. Oh, I knew what I looked like--one of those \"Valley-of-the-Nile-After-a-Flood\" pictures. \"There is one thing about you that is comforting,\" I sniffed. \"You said precisely the same thing to me at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning. You never startle me by saying anything unexpected.\" He took a step toward me, and even in the dusk I could see that he was looking down at me oddly. All my bravado faded away and there was a queerish ringing in my ears. \"I would like to!\" he said tensely. \"I would like, this minute--I'm a fool, Mrs. Wilson,\" he finished miserably. \"I ought to be drawn and quartered, but when I see you like this I--I get crazy. If you say the word, I'll--I'll go down and--\"...", "...In this huge area there were only about a score of candles, which reminded me of will-o'-the-wisps, which deceived the eye rather than illuminated the room. I have never seen anything more chilling and depressing than this drawing-room, in which the ladies' conversation was very languid indeed. I kept thinking that the portrait of Charles the First and the bust of the Black Prince would come and join us at coffee before the fire. At last the men came, and after them the tea, and at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a sort of supper. At eleven a general move was made to bed, which seemed to be a relief for every one. During this long evening I thought many times of the description given by Corinne of her mother-in-law's chateau. At dinner nothing was talked of but county balls and Leamington Spa, and other petty gossip of the neighbourhood. Feature by feature it recalled Madame de Stael's description.

One, two, tree--Heep! Heep! Heep! Oo--ray-y-y!\" I did not join in \"the cheer Americain,\" but I did burst out laughing, a proceeding which caused the young lady at my left to pat my arm and nod delighted approval. She evidently thought I was becoming gay and lighthearted at last. She was never more mistaken. It was nearly two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and I had had quite enough of L'Abbaye. I had not enjoyed myself--had not expected to, so far as that went. I hope I am not a prig, and, whatever I am or am not, priggishness had no part in my feelings then. Under ordinary circumstances I should not have enjoyed myself in a place like that. Mine is not the temperament--I shouldn't know how. I must have appeared the most solemn ass in creation, and if I had come there with the idea of amusement, I should have felt like one. As...", "...whole thing is still fresh in my memory. If this letter is slightly incoherent it is because I have had so many interruptions. The maids can hardly undress me, they are so anxious to tell me all they have seen. It certainly was a magnificent sight to-day, and the fears for the Emperor gave such a dramatic note to the whole thing. My eyes are rather tired, looking so hard, I suppose. Wednesday, May 23d. Well, Dear, I have had my audience. It was most interesting. I started at 11 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the gala carriage, Hubert driving me, as he wanted to go once to the Kremlin with the carriage before the day of the Coronation. It seems there is a slight rise in the road just as one gets to the gate, which is also narrow. I wore the blue brocade with bunches of cherries, the front of mousse velvet, and a light blue crepe bonnet, neither gloves nor veil.

Benckendorff said I must have one of...", "...one on board now anxious, as they became aware that they were near to their destination. The former life was resumed, and the hours of watch were marked out as they had been. The sun still shone, never setting, but by this time the adventurers were used to perpetual day. Dirola kept to herself, not saying a word to anybody. \"I think I'll drop the ship down a bit and see what sort of a country is beneath us,\" announced Mr. Henderson about four o'clock, though whether it was four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning or the afternoon, no one knew. However, it did not matter much. \"If there is an open sea around the north pole, as some believe,\" he went on, \"we ought to see some signs of it now.\" He let some gas out of the bag, and the _Monarch_ slowly settled toward the earth. The inventor opened the trap door that covered the plate glass in the floor of the cabin, and peered down. When within five hundred feet of the ground he signaled to stop the descent of the ship....", "...on the trails of elephants which had been here in the rainy season, and then would sit down in the path, and in his broken Sichuana say, \"No water, all country only; Shobo sleeps; he breaks down; country only;\" and then coolly curl himself up and go to sleep. The oxen were terribly fatigued and thirsty; and on the morning of the fourth day, Shobo, after professing ignorance of every thing, vanished altogether. We went on in the direction in which we last saw him, and about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> began to see birds; then the trail of a rhinoceros. At this we unyoked the oxen, and they, apparently knowing the sign, rushed along to find the water in the River Mahabe, which comes from the Tamunak'le, and lay to the west of us. The supply of water in the wagons had been wasted by one of our servants, and by the afternoon only a small portion remained for the children. This was a bitterly anxious night; and next morning the less there was of water, the more thirsty the...", "...mind and character, whilst in poetry I prefer Jean Ingelow and Mrs. Browning.\" The long-standing friendship with Helen Marion Burnside--the well-known writer of many clever tales for children, booklets, verses, and songs--began when they were in their early womanhood.

We rushed out of the tent in every condition of dishabille and were in time to see Geyser put forth his full strength.

The proof of this is that in the time of Domitian a soldier's _year's_ pay divided by three hundred and sixty gives an even number of _ases_.

It sounded extremely simple, as all such plans do, when the wish is father to the thought, and in his calculations he went no further than Plougastel. After that, one would see. So the long afternoon stole past. At seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the lieutenant of the guard touched Little Tapin upon the shoulder, and, more by instinct than actual perception, he sprang to his feet and saluted. \"Voyons, mon petit,\" said the officer, not unkindly. \"It is time thou wast off. Thou knowest thy duty--eh? There is no need of instructions?\" \"Oh, ca me connait, mon lieutenant,\" answered Little Tapin quaintly, and, presently, he was striding away to his post, under the arc de Triomphe, past the statues, and the flowerbeds, and...", "...the reverend father the same answer as I had given the King of Corsica's son, and left him angry with this Marquis of Misery who had given me so much needless trouble. I was minded to have done with him, and resolved to let him know through his mistress that I would not be his reference, but I could not find an opportunity that day. The next day I took my two nymphs for a ride, and asked Pembroke to dinner. In vain we waited for Petina's mistress; she was nowhere to be found. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I got a letter from her, with a German letter enclosed for her mother. She said that feeling certain that her mother would not give her consent to her marriage, she had eloped with her lover, who had got together enough money to go to Naples, and when they reached that town he would marry her. She begged me to console her mother and make her listen to reason, as she had not gone off with an adventurer but with a man of rank, her equal. My lips curled into a smile of pity and...", "...hurry.

The yellow door, as the old woman had said, was not to be mistaken.

It was a real refreshment, and Ellen wanted one. \"Why, it's dear little--ain't it--her that lives down...", "...jaw that had impressed me so formidably the year before. And again his face relaxed almost quizzically as he caught sight of mine. \"Bub,\" said he, getting to his feet, \"those little marks are on my foot yet. And just you tie into one idea: Dickey Darrell's got it coming.\" His face darkened with a swift anger. \"God damn his soul!\" he said, deliberately. It was no mere profanity. It was an imprecation, and in its very deliberation I glimpsed the flare of an undying hate. About three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that afternoon Jimmy's prediction was fulfilled.

This fact we ascertained incidentally, as we learned the nationality of our comrades by their brogue, and their religion by their lively ejaculations during the night. We stowed ourselves into the rigid box, bade a sorrowing good-night to the landlady and her daughters, who stood at the inn door, and went jingling down the street towards the open country. The moon rises at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in Nova Scotia. It came above the horizon exactly as we began our journey, a harvest-moon, round and red. When I first saw it, it lay on the edge of the horizon as if too heavy to lift itself, as big as a cart-wheel, and its disk cut by a fence-rail. With what a flood of splendor it deluged farmhouses and farms, and the broad sweep of level country! There could not be a more magnificent night in which to ride towards that geographical mystery of our boyhood, the Gut of...", "...of this terrible case, we shall present to them so much of his story as we have been able to learn:-- The first murder which he charged against Burke, although it is surmised that several had been committed before that time, was that of a girl named Paterson, who was about eighteen or twenty years of age. It appears, that this girl, with one of her associates, Janet Brown, had been lodged in the Canongate police-office, on Tuesday night, the 8th of April. They were kept till six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning, when they went to the house of one Swanstoun, to procure spirits. Here they were met by Burke, who asked them to drink. He afterwards prevailed on them to go with him to breakfast, and gave them two bottles of spirits to carry along with them. They accompanied him to his brother Constantine Burke's house, in the Canongate. This man was a scavenger, and went out at his usual hour to work. After they had been in the house for some time, Burke and his wife began...", "...with some, the last thought is for their mother, others are influenced by the example of just men who have sacrificed themselves for the race, but the feeling is the same in every case, though each one expresses it according to his own manner of thinking.

All the troops as they left the wood came and formed near us, and the cavalry were mustering on our right as if to attack Sombref. Up to half-past two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> not a gun had been fired, when an aid-de-camp of the Emperor arrived on the road to Fleurus, at full speed, and I thought immediately, \"Our turn has come now. May God watch over us, for, miserable wretches that we are, we cannot save ourselves in such a slaughter as is threatening.\" I had scarcely made these reflections when two battalions on the right set off on the road, with the artillery, toward Sombref, where the Uhlans and Prussian cavalry were deploying in front of...", "...fierce, and for which he was to sacrifice twenty years of a poet's life.

He was thinking how he could communicate the information agreed upon without arousing the suspicions of the two confederates. Finally he decided upon a story which seemed to him satisfactory. It was nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when he entered the room where Jack Morgan and Marlowe, having got tired of playing cards, were leaning back against the wall in their chairs, smoking clay pipes. The room was full of the odor of a villainous quality of cheap tobacco when Julius reappeared. \"Well, Julius,\" said Jack, removing his pipe from his mouth and regarding him eagerly, \"what luck?\" \"Good,\" said Julius briefly \"What have you found out?\" \"I found out that the swag is in a safe upstairs on the...", "...of 40 guns, under the command of Captain Charles Lydiard, after completing her stores for a few months' cruise, sailed from Falmouth on the 24th of December, to resume her station off Brest. The wind was adverse, blowing very hard from the W.S.W., until the morning of the 28th, when Captain Lydiard made the Island of Bas, on the French coast. As the gale was increasing rather than subsiding, he determined to return to port, and accordingly shaped his course for the Lizard. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> P.M. land was discovered, apparently about five miles west of the Lizard, but owing to the thickness of the fog, there was a difference of opinion as to the land that was seen, and therefore the ship was wore to stand out to sea. She had not been long on this tack before land was descried right ahead. It was now evident that their position was extremely dangerous,--the ship was completely embayed, and the wind raged with increasing fury. Every exertion was made to keep the...", "...away through the sunshine that burnished the mesa. CHAPTER VIII July passed. Followed August, with days likewise hot and unvarying except for a scarcely appreciable retardation of dawn. Perro Creek now showed no water at all in its shallow bed; the garden planted by the Stevensons was long dried up; the sagebrush was dustier than ever; and Bryant and Dave were hauling in a barrel on a sledge water for their use from a pool in the canon. From daybreak until about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning the engineer and his assistant worked on the canal line.

In the white part of a cliff, they fancied some resemblance to an {265} animal, and noticed a harbour opposite, in which they anchored.

But we have put the question independently of these considerations, by seeking among the days which preceded the full moon of the end of August, 699, which was the one in which the shifting of the currents of which Caesar speaks could have been produced at the hour indicated in the \"Commentaries.\" Supposing, then, the fleet of Caesar at anchor at a distance of half a mile opposite Dover, as it experienced the effect of the shifting of the currents towards half-past three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, the question becomes reduced to that of determining the day of the end of the month of August when this phenomenon took place at the above hour. We know that in the Channel the sea produces, in rising and falling, two alternate currents, one directed from the west to the east, called _flux_ (_flot_), or current of the rising tide; the other directed from the east to the west, named _reflux_ (_jusant_), or current of the falling tide.

Shortly after ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Miss Grig visited the small room, shook hands with Lilian and Millicent, and permitted the two new typists to be presented to her.

The rascal who secured the booty, threatening his victim all the while with a knife at his throat, instantly ran away, but the citizen succeeded in holding on to the other two men until his outcries brought the police to the spot.

At noon we found the latitude to be 15 deg. 5' S., and were detained here by the calm till one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> p.m., when we got a breeze at N. by W., with which we steered up to within two miles of the head of the bay; and then I sent Mr Cooper and Mr Gilbert to sound and reconnoitre the coast, while we stood to and fro with the ship. This gave time to three sailing canoes which had been following us some time, to come up. There were five or six men in each; and they approached near enough to receive such things as were thrown to them fastened to a rope, but would not advance...", "...when the hour came for foreign languages, her brief triumph ceased.

We then talked about the present state of affairs, and very amusing he was, sparing nobody and talking with his usual abundance and...", "...in maintaining the rights of the Colonies. I want you to make their acquaintance. By seeing and talking with such men you will be worth more to yourself and everybody else. Your going to market and meeting such gentlemen will be as good as several months of school. You'll see more people than you ever saw on the muster-field; ships from foreign lands will be moored in the harbor. You'll see houses by the thousand, meetinghouses with tall steeples, and will hear the bells ring at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, getting-up time, at noon for dinner, and at nine in the evening, bed-time. Two regiments of redcoats are there. The latest news is that they are getting sassy. I can believe it. At Ticonderoga and Crown Point they used to put on airs, and call the Provincials \"string-beans,\" \"polly-pods,\" \"slam bangs.\" They turned up their noses at our buckskin breeches, but when it came to fighting we showed 'em what stuff we were made of. Don't let 'em pick a quarrel, but...", "...on the outcome of the meeting which I'm going to ask you to call for say, two o'clock this afternoon on the floor of the foundry building,\" he said. \"Will you stay in town and get the men together, while I go home and see mother and shape up my talk?\" Caleb Gordon acquiesced, glad of a chance to have somewhat to do. And so, in the very beginning of things, it was the son and not the father who took the helm of the tempest-driven ship. XX DRY WELLS As early as one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, the elder Helgerson, acting as day watchman at the iron-works, had opened the great yard gates, and the men began to gather by twos and threes and in little caucusing knots on the sand floor of the huge, iron-roofed foundry building. Some of the more heedful set to work making seats of the wooden flask frames and bottom boards; and in the pouring space fronting one of the cupolas they built a rough-and-ready platform out of the same materials. As the numbers...", "...He put the oblong note-book carefully in his pocket, and stood by the table in an attitude of 'any further instructions, please?' while one eye wandered to the unopened letter that was signed 'Albinia Minks, with heartfelt gratitude.' 'And, by the by, Minks,' said his master, turning as though a new idea had suddenly struck him and he had formed a hasty plan, 'you might kindly look up an afternoon train to Crayfield. Loop line from Charing Cross, you know. Somewhere about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> or so. I have to--er--I think I'll run down that way after luncheon.' Whereupon, having done this last commission, and written it down upon a sheet of paper which he placed with care against the clock, beside the unopened letter, the session closed, and Minks, in his mourning hat and lavender gloves, walked up St. James's Street apparently _en route_ for the Ritz, but suddenly, as with careless unconsciousness, turning into an A.B.C. Depot for luncheon, well pleased with...", "...Awakened at 4 a. m.] [Sidenote: Turnip soup the chief article of diet.] After that things settled down into a steady and dull routine. We were routed out at 4 o'clock in the morning. The sentries would come in and beat the butts of their rifles on the wooden floor and roar \"Raus!\" at the top of their voices. If any sleep-sodden prisoners lingered a second, they were roughly hauled out and kicked into active obedience. Then a cup of black coffee was served out to us and at 5 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we were marched to the mines. There was a dressing room at the mine where we stripped off our prisoners' garb and donned working clothes. We stayed in the mines until 3.30 in the afternoon and the \"staggers\"--our pet name for the foremen--saw to it that we had a busy time of it. Then we changed back into our prison clothes and marched to barracks, where a bowl of turnip soup was given us and a half pound of bread. We were supposed to save some of the bread to eat with our...", "...here with a Mr F-----, an Austrian gentleman, and two Polish gentlemen, the one an officer and the other a medical man. They are brothers and had both served in the French army. We have agreed to travel to Vienna together on board of the raft which starts every week from Munich to Vienna. This raft brings to every day between twelve o'clock and two near some town or village on the banks of the river, in order to allow the passengers to dine, and anchors every evening at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> near some town or village to sup and sleep. You have only to tell the _Flossmeister_, or Master of the Raft, at what inn you mean to put up, or if you have no preference, he will recommend you one; and at five the next morning he goes his rounds to the different inns to collect his passengers, and at six gets under weigh. VIENNA, 2nd August. I left Munich on the 25th July and arrived on the 6th day of our journey, 30th July, at Vienna, The _Floss_, or raft, on board of...", "...Boston.\" And in August she said: \"I am to begin in Boston in September.... It seems to me that is a little too early for Boston, isn't it? Will there be anybody in town then? I don't know as it's my business, which is simply to speak my piece and take my money.\" Her first reading actually took place in Springfield, not Boston, and the next day she unexpectedly arrived at our cottage at Manchester-by- the-Sea. She had read the previous evening in a large public hall, had risen at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning, and found her way to us. Her next readings were given in Boston, the first, in the afternoon, at the Tremont Temple. She was conscious that her effort at Springfield had not been altogether successful,--she had not held her large audience; and she was determined to put the whole force of her nature into this afternoon reading at the Tremont Temple. She called me into her bedroom, where she stood before the mirror, with her short gray hair, which usually lay in...", "...\"That is enough! that is enough, my friend! I would do anything to put a stop to such an affair; but I never knew M. du Croisier's real character until a few minutes ago. To you I can make the admission: there is nothing to be done.\" \"But what if there is?\" \"I would give half the blood in my veins that it were so,\" said she, finishing her sentence by a wistful shake of the head. As the First Consul, beaten on the field of Marengo till five o'clock in the evening, by six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> saw the tide of battle turned by Desaix's desperate attack and Kellermann's terrific charge, so Chesnel in the midst of defeat saw the beginnings of victory. No one but a Chesnel, an old notary, an ex-steward of the manor, old Maitre Sorbier's junior clerk, in the sudden flash of lucidity which comes with despair, could rise thus, high as a Napoleon, nay, higher. This was not Marengo, it was Waterloo, and the Prussians had come up; Chesnel saw this, and was determined to beat...", "...I?\" answered Page. \"I owe you a good deal more than that, my dear boy, and when you have been admitted we will go into a partnership if you want to do it.\" \"Here's my hand on it,\" said Frank, rising, \"and I mean it, too, and if you will have patience with me I'll stick it out or own up I'm no good in this world.\" He seemed overjoyed and for two hours they sat and talked it over. \"When may I begin?\" he said finally. \"I want to go at it right away.\" \"To-morrow morning at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> sharp,\" replied Albert, smiling, \"and I warn you I shall keep you grinding eight full hours, six days a week, and no let-up until July first. But tell me, when did this sensible and eminently laudable idea enter your head?\" \"Well, to be exact, it came to me in the parlor of your house in Sandgate, just at dark, the last evening I was there, and a remark your sister made to me was the cause of it.\" A droll smile crept over Albert's face at this frank admission, but he made...", "...the only friend of his they knew, of his dangerous situation. Mr. Oliver, on the receipt of their very pressing letter, immediately dispatched a Post Office Express to Mr. Gibbon of Petersfield, and the Express (returned by the care of Mr. Bayley and Griffiths of the Cocoa Tree) reached me last night very late at Sheffield Place. I came up to Town this morning, but was too late. Your kinsman and my friend had already terminated a blameless and happy life by a very easy death about three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Tuesday afternoon. There was so little appearance of a visible illness that Dr. Fothergill could only call it a sudden but general decay of Nature. After consulting with Sir Stanier Porten[182] we both judged it would be right to take no steps with regard to his Effects till you could be informed of what had happened. We went to his Lodgings this afternoon, and in the presence of the Landlord, the Apothecary and Mr. Newton's Clerk, we examined every probable place in search...", "...the name of the owner,\" he said presently. \"I'd like mighty well to say thank you to him. It isn't usual for people nowadays to have as much respect for sentiment in an old duffer like me as the fellow has. He sort of makes me feel as if I hadn't sold at all.\" Buck Ogilvy came out of the Bon Gusto restaurant with Moira, just as Bryce, with George Sea Otter at the wheel of the Napier, drove up to the curb. They left Moira at her boarding-house, and rolled noiselessly away. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> they arrived at Cardigan's log-landing and found Jim Harding, the bull-donkey engineer, placidly smoking his pipe in the cab. Bryce hailed him. \"That you, Jim?\" \"You bet.\" \"Run up to Jabe Curtis's shanty, and tell him we're here. Have him gather his gang and bring two pairs of overalls and two jumpers--large size--with him when he comes.\" Harding vanished into the darkness, and Buck Ogilvy climbed up into the cab and glanced at the steam-gauge. \"A hundred and forty,\"...", "...in a \"good case.\" \"Give me a bad pneumonia, and I'm happy!\" said she, frankly, and she meant what she said. At those rare intervals when Billie fell into a fitful sleep, I used to steal out of the room and pay a visit to the dining-room, where, on two arm-chairs on opposite sides of the fire, the poor father and his friend sat drearily smoking, and waiting until the small hours of the morning. It was useless to tell Mr Thorold to go to bed. His wife had breathed her last at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, and he was possessed by a dread that Billie would do the same. At three or thereabouts he might be persuaded to move, but until then it was but a waste of breath to ask it. Poor fellow! To have his old friend by his side was the best comfort that was left, but how he must have missed his wife, and how endlessly, breathlessly long the hours must have seemed, sitting with folded hands, with nothing to do but to wait! Even I--an outsider--was oppressed by the...", "...sailed from the Fatherland. They called him the doctor, and if he were not or had not been a charlatan, he resembled one; the second was our skipper, Padechal, who had told us so many lies; and now this infamous woman. They all belong to this people who, it is said, pretend to special devoutness; but we found them, the sailor, and the rest, like all other Englishmen, who, if they are not more detestable than the Hollanders, are at least no better. _20th, Thursday._ It was about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the forenoon before the flood began to make. The wind was southwest, but light. We weighed anchor and towed through Hellgate, when the wind and tide served us until we passed Whitestone,[400] as far as which the tide, from the direction of New York, usually reaches. We sailed bravely by and obtained the ebb tide in our favor which carried us this evening beyond Milford.

The morning dawned still and clear, and garnished and set in order as though such things had never been. Only our white towel fluttered like a flag of truce in the direction the mighty elements had departed. XVI THE VALLEY Once upon a time I happened to be staying in a hotel room which had originally been part of a suite, but which was then cut off from the others by only a thin door through which sounds carried clearly. It was about eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening. The occupants of that next room came home. I heard the door open and close. Then the bed shrieked aloud as somebody fell heavily upon it. There breathed across the silence a deep restful sigh. \"Mary,\" said a man's voice, \"I'm mighty sorry I didn't join that Association for Artificial Vacations. They guarantee to get you just as tired and just as mad in two days as you could by yourself in two weeks.\" We thought of that one morning as we descended the...", "...and entered the room. \"Now, Ibrahim, tell us about the ways of the Palace, for of these we are altogether ignorant. In the first place, about food. Do we provide ourselves, or how is it?\" \"All in the Palace are fed from the sultan's kitchen. At each meal, every officer has so many dishes, according to his rank. These vary from three to twelve. In the early morning, I shall bring you bread and fruit and sherbet; at ten o'clock is the first meal; and at seven there is supper. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the kitchens are open, and I can fetch you a dish of pillau, kabobs, a chicken, or any other refreshment that you may desire. At present, I have no orders as to how many dishes your Excellencies will receive, at the two meals.\" \"We shall not be particular about that,\" Surajah said. \"It is evident we shall fare well, at any rate.\" \"I am told to inform you, my lords, that the sultan has ordered two horses to be placed at your service.

The engineers in a short time had both bridges completed. General Wadsworth's division of the First Corps was the first to cross the lower bridge. General Wadsworth had become impatient, and, instead of waiting for the completion of the structure, swam his horse across the stream. General Brooks, of the Sixth Corps, was the first to cross the bridge at Bernard's. It was now five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. There was great commotion in Fredericksburg. A courier dashed into town on horseback, shouting, \"The Yankees are crossing down the river.\"[20] The church-bells were rung. The people who had returned to the town after the battle of the 13th of December sprang from their beds. They went out and stood upon Maryee's Hill, looked across the river, and saw the country alive with troops.

Now, in the mean time, the moment the coast is clear, I fly to you, my _real_ angel.\" \"Oh, no, upon my word,\" said Lady Augusta, so faintly, that Dashwood went on exactly in the same tone. \"I fly to you, my angel, and we shall be...", "...followed up by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly and free talk, from which Oliver learned that his friend's name was Jack Dawkins--among his intimate friends better known as the \"Artful Dodger\"--and that he was a peculiar pet of the elderly gentleman before mentioned. As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when they reached the small city street, along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels. Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. Oliver was just considering whether he hadn't better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill. His...", "...demanding the child, she refused to give her up, but lay upon the little one, and took blow after blow upon her own body? Only the greed for loot saved them, for the men seeing others getting our things left them to get their share. That same night when again our party was facing what seemed almost certain massacre, several Chinese came to Mrs. Cheng urging her to leave us, promising to see that she would be taken safely back to her home if she would, but she refused. About 2 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning I heard the sound of weeping in the courtyard; going out I found Mrs. Cheng sitting by the steps weeping bitterly, and moaning aloud: \"I must go, I must go; they need me, even if they kill me I will go.\" Sitting down beside her we clung in our distress to each other. Then a strange thing happened. Two Chinese women came creeping towards us through the dark court, and kneeling down at our feet took our hands in theirs. Almost too surprised for words I said:...", "...in the House to secure fuller party support for it. On the evening of January 9, a meeting was called in the hope of securing caucus action.

Shortly after 12 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Jan. 10, 1918, with the galleries of the House crowded, Representative Foster (Ills.) presented the rule, which, when adopted, provided for the closing of debate at five o'clock that afternoon and even division of time between supporters and opponents. With Chairman Raker's consent the general debate was opened by Miss Rankin and it continued until five o'clock, when amendments were in order. One, offered by Representative Moores of Indiana, providing for ratification by...", "...and shops close. We will all get together and then the sheriff can't stop us.\" An inspiration comes to Martha. She hurries to a telegraph station, and sends the message to Trueman calling him to Wilkes-Barre. \"If he only gets here before the police or the troops, he can prevent trouble,\" is the thought that consoles her. The hour that passes before she receives word that he will arrive on the Keystone Express, seems an eternity. With the knowledge that Trueman will arrive at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she breathes a sigh of relief. Again she mingles with the crowds which fill the streets. Here and there she goes, begging of the men and women to refrain from doing anything that they will regret later.

At four o'clock Sister Martha hears that the miners have determined to wreck the express, as it is bringing the Coal and Iron Police....", "...the snow, and the gentians, too, with their corollas twisted shut; cassiope I could recognize under any disguise; and two species of dwarf willow with their seeds already ripe, one with comparatively small leaves, were growing in mere cracks and crevices of rock-ledges where the dry snow could not lie. Snowbirds and ptarmigan were flying briskly in the cold wind, and on the edge of a grove I saw a spruce from which a bear had stripped large sections of bark for food. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the clouds lifted and I enjoyed another wide view from the summit of the ridge of the vast grassy fountain region with smooth rolling features. A few patches of forest broke the monotony of color, and the many lakes, one of them about five miles long, were glowing like windows. Only the highest ridges were whitened with snow, while rifts in the clouds showed beautiful bits of yellow-green sky. The limit of tree growth is about five thousand feet.

It seems incredible that all that I have passed through--all those weird and terrifying experiences--should have been encompassed within so short a span as three brief months. Rather might I have experienced a cosmic cycle, with all its changes and evolutions for that which I have seen with my own eyes in this brief interval of time--things that no other mortal eye had seen before, glimpses of a world past, a...", "...With a sweep of his hand, Mr. Mott sent the money flying. \"To-morrow morning I send for the police. Mind that!\" he roared. \"I'd better have my breakfast early, then,\" said Mr. Hurst, tapping his pockets. \"Good night. And thank you for your advice.\" He sat for some time after the disappearance of his host, and then, returning to the front room, placed a chair at the end of the sofa and, with the tablecloth for a quilt, managed to secure a few hours' troubled sleep. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he washed at the scullery sink, and at ten o'clock Mr. Mott, with an air of great determination, came in to deliver his ultimatum. \"If you're not outside the front door in five minutes, I'm going to fetch the police,\" he said, fiercely. \"I want to see Florrie,\" said the other. \"Well, you won't see her,\" shouted Mr. Mott. Mr. Hurst stood feeling his chin. \"Well, would you mind taking a message for me?\" he asked. \"I just want you to ask her whether I am really free....", "...of Ira Baldwin fell across her wonder. Had Mellony cared so much for him that her disappointment had driven her to something wild and fatal? She did not ask the question, but her lips grew white and stiff at the faintest suggestion of it. Several times she went to the door, meaning to go out, and up the street to look for her daughter, but each time something withheld her. Instead, with that determination that distinguished her, she busied herself with trifling duties. It was quite nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when she saw Captain Phippeny coming up the street. She stood still and watched him approach. His gait was more rolling than ever, as he came slowly towards her, and he glanced furtively ahead at her house, and then dropped his eyes and pretended not to have seen her. She grew impatient to have him reach her, but she only pressed her lips together and stood the more rigidly still. At last he stood in front of her doorstone, his hat in his hand.

At half-past four, the storm was over, and the sky clear and blue once more, so I determined to hasten to _San Juan_, and, though too late to hear the meditation, still witness the descent from the cross. To my surprise, on going to the door I found it impossible to leave the church; the whole place in front of the cathedral was knee-deep in water, and all the streets leading from it looked like swift-flowing rivers! Not until five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> did the water subside sufficiently to permit me to cross the street conducting to _San Juan_, where, however, I fortunately arrived in time for the ceremony I so much wished to see.

While I was absent on the expedition to Trevillian, the movement of the Army of the Potomac across the James River was effected, and Wilson, whom I had left behind for the purpose, was engaged in the duty of covering its front and rear. Late on the night of June 12 he, with Chapman's brigade, crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, in advance of the Fifth Corps, and by 7 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next morning had driven the enemy's pickets up to White Oak bridge, where he waited for our infantry. When that came up, he pushed on as far as Riddle's Shop, but late that evening the Confederate infantry forced him to withdraw to St. Mary's Church; for early in the morning General Lee had discovered the movement of our army, and promptly threw this column of infantry south of the Chickahominy to White Oak Swamp, with the design of covering Richmond.

The premature journey to Meudon, and quarrels so warm, were not calculated to re-establish a person just returned from the gates of death. The extreme desire she had to hide her state from the public, and to conceal the terms on which she was with her father ( for the rarity of his visits to her began to be remarked), induced her to give a supper to him on the terrace of Meudon about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> one evening. In vain the danger was represented to her of the cool evening air so soon after an illness such as she had just suffered from, and which had left her health still tottering. It was specially on this account that she stuck more obstinately to her supper on the terrace, thinking that it would take away all suspicion she had been confined, and induce the belief that she was on the same terms as ever with M. le Duc d'Orleans, though the uncommon rarity of his visits to...", "...be water enough to row up the creek.\" He called in one of the clerks, and told him to go out to get him an almanac with a tide-table. \"I want to know when it will be high water the day after to-morrow at Gravesend,\" he said. \"I can tell you that at once, sir.

With these instructions, his lordship, considerably relieved, dismissed her, and went to lie down upon his bed, and have a nap if he could. He had already given the chaplain the key of his chamber, the door of which he always locked, that he might enter and wake him when the appointed hour was at hand. As soon as he began to feel that eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was drawing near, Dr. Bayly proceeded to reconnoitre. The marquis's plan, although he could think of none better, was not altogether satisfactory, and it was to his relief that he found nobody in the dining-room. When he entered the drawing-room, however, there, to his equal annoyance, he saw in the light of one expiring candle the dim figure of a lady; he could not offer HER the keys of the wine-cellar! What was he to do? What could she be there for? He drew nearer, and, with...", "...as Bob and his party had to leave the woods in a very few days. Then again, they were all eager to find out what luck Bill and Mr. Anderson had had in getting in a claim on the gulch. Nothing exciting occurred the next day, as it was smooth sailing, or rather canoeing, until they hit the St. Lawrence. At this place the St. Lawrence is about forty miles wide. There was a southerly wind, so they kept to their original plan and took the river boat to Escoumains, arriving there about four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. Mr. Waterman hustled around and soon had a pair of little Canadian horses. These hustled away with them and the two canoes, and by dark they were at the ford once more. The next morning they were up early, and by seven o'clock they were back on Lac Parent. Jerry's cheery halloo proved to them that they had been expected. They found Bill and Mr. Anderson already back, and Mr. Waterman was very much pleased with the way they had gotten results. \"The gulch...", "...a few hours later. Up to the middle of March, 1915, all the ships which had become victims of German submarines had been of the slower coasting variety. There had been numerous unconfirmed reports that the faster transatlantic ships had been chased, but no credence had been given to them. On the 27th of March, 1915, however, when the _Arabic_ arrived at Liverpool it was reported by those on board that she had given a submarine a lively chase and had gotten away safely. At about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the evening before the submarine was sighted off Holyhead. She was only 200 yards ahead, and while her commander jockeyed for a position from which he could successfully launch a torpedo, the commander of the _Arabic_ gave the order \"Full speed ahead.\" His passengers lined the rail of the ship to watch the maneuvers. Soon the steamship had up a speed of 18 knots, which was a bit too fast for the submarine, and she fell to the rearward. Her chance for launching a torpedo was...", "...BATES MARTA.......................................MARIE REICHARDT THE CLOWN........................................TONY BEVAN PROGRAM CONTINUED ON SECOND PAGE FOLLOWING * * * * * PROGRAM CONTINUED.

They recognised the body at once, and twenty of them signed an attestation to that effect.

On Thursday, the 11th of February, at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, the King entered the Dauphine's chamber, which Madame de Maintenon scarcely ever left, except when he was in her apartments. The Princess was so ill that it was resolved to speak to her of receiving the sacrament. Prostrated though she was she was surprised at this.

He glanced repeatedly at his watch, and as seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> drew near he imagined that every vehicle pulling up outside must contain the two ladies for whom he was waiting so eagerly. When at last they did arrive he hastened to the door to greet them. Madame Bernstein was the first to alight, and Katherine Petrovitch followed her a moment later. She gave her hand to Browne, and as he took it such a thrill went through him that it was wonderful the young man did not collapse upon the pavement. Having conducted them to the room in...", "...French, Spanish, and even Arabic.\" \"But the people themselves are thoroughly Italian, I think, in spite of the French boundary line,\" said Margaret. \"They are a handsome race, with their dark eyes, thick hair, and rich coloring.\" \"I have never bestowed much thought upon beauty _per se_,\" responded the Professor. \"The imperishable mind has far more interest.\" \"How much of the imperishable M. do you possess, Miss Trescott?\" I heard Inness murmur. \"Breakfast\" was served at one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the large dining-room, and we found ourselves opposite the two English artists, and a young lady whom they called \"Miss Elaine.\" \"Elaine is bad enough; but 'Miss Elaine'!\" said Margaret aside to me. However, Miss Elaine seemed very well satisfied with herself and her Tennysonian title. She was a short, plump blonde, with a high color, and I could see that she regarded Janet with pity as she noted her slender proportions and delicate complexion in the one exhaustive...", "...trouble, I went to take a walk in Westminster Hall and by chance met with Mr. Child, who went forth with my Lady to-day, but his horse being bad, he come back again, which then did trouble me more, so that I did resolve to go to her; and so by boat home and put on my boots, and so over to Southwarke to the posthouse, and there took horse and guide to Dartford and thence to Rochester (I having good horses and good way, come thither about half-an-hour after daylight, which was before 6 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and I set forth after two), where I found my Lady and her daughter Jem., and Mrs. Browne' and five servants, all at a great loss, not finding me here, but at my coming she was overjoyed.

Give it to me!\" She snatched the telegram from him and tore it open. It was not as bad as might have been, but it was bad enough. Lawyer Peabody wired that Captain Cyrus Whittaker was at his home in Ostable, sick in bed, and threatened with pneumonia. Captain Cy, hurrying homeward in response to the attorney's former telegram, had reached Boston the day of the blizzard. He had taken the train for Bayport that afternoon. The train had reached Ostable after nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night, but could get no farther. The captain, burning with fever and torn by chills, had wallowed through the drifts to his lawyer's home and collapsed on his doorstep. Now he was very ill and, at times, delirious. For two weeks he lay, fighting off the threatened attack of pneumonia. But he won the fight, and, at last, word came to the anxious ones at Bayport that he was past the danger point and would pull through. There was rejoicing at the Cy Whittaker place. The...", "...been unjust, prejudiced, and, most galling of all, misled; and the question of his own vindication was only a secondary matter after all. One day he heard, casually, that Major Carstairs was expected at Cherry Orchard, and when he entered his house at lunch-time he found a note from Chloe asking him to call upon her between tea and dinner and remain, if possible, for the latter meal. In any case she asked him to come for half an hour, at least, and he rang her up at once and fixed six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> for the time of his call upon her. At six accordingly he entered the drawing-room, and found Major Carstairs in possession, as it were, standing on the hearth-rug with the air of a man at home in his own house. Before Anstice had time to wonder how this situation had arisen Chloe advanced, smiling, and held out her hand. \"Good-evening, Dr. Anstice. I think you and my husband have met already.\" In these words she announced her cognizance of that meeting in Piccadilly a...", "...to prevent all ingress or egress of citizens. On the night of the 24th his division, having crossed with Sherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plain to the north base of Missionary Ridge.

At twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, when all was quiet, I began to give orders for the next day, and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside. Sherman was directed to attack at daylight. Hooker was ordered to move at the same hour, and endeavor to intercept the enemy's retreat if he still remained; if he had gone, then to move directly to Rossville and operate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge. Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge. As I was...", "...to have no scandal. Catinat was charged with carrying out the scheme in person. The Abbe d'Estrades, in his dealings with Mattioli, feigned ignorance of the double game the Count was playing. He led him to believe, on the contrary, that the balance of the sums promised at Versailles was about to be paid. A meeting was fixed for May 2, 1679. On that day d'Estrades and Mattioli got into a carriage, the passing of which was awaited by Catinat accompanied by some dozen men. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, Mattioli was in the fortress of Pignerol, in the hands of jailer Saint-Mars. When we remember the rank held by the Italian minister, we are confronted with one of the most audacious violations of international law of which history has preserved a record. Early in the year 1694, Mattioli was transferred to the Isles of Sainte-Marguerite; we have seen that he entered the Bastille on September 18, 1698, and died there on November 19, 1703.

He placed the check book in its accustomed place in the desk, destroyed all evidence of the night's debauch and left a note on the desk saying: \"My dear Rayder, I have been suddenly called home by the illness of my wife. Come to Saguache as soon as you can make it convenient. Amos.\" When Rayder awoke it was four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. His head was in a whirl and every muscle was twitching. He called Charley and sent for a doctor. The doctor saw the trouble at a glance. He called a hack and accompanied Rayder to his home. \"This will never do, Mr. Rayder. You have drank much whisky in your time and it has become a poison to your system. Do not look for me to get you out of this in less time than four weeks.\" XXIV. THE RECKLESS HAND OF FATE. The day was fair when Carson left...", "...project and determined to tramp back to Little Silver. He tightened his belt on his empty stomach, lighted a pipe, and set his face for home. It was nearly seven o'clock when he started, and, allowing for all reasonable interruptions of progress--incidents inevitable after the storm--he believed that it would be possible to make the shepherd's cot at Teign Head under Watern Tor long before midday. His road of the previous evening he found quite impassable, and it was nearly nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before he fairly escaped from the labyrinth of deep waters and greedy bog now spread about Fur Tor. The task of return indeed proved far more difficult than he had anticipated, for the present harmonious contentment of his mind, despite hunger, induced an optimism rare enough in Myles at any time. But experience came to his aid, and he set to work soberly to save his strength for a toilsome journey. It is unnecessary to describe the many turnings of a tortuous way followed...", "...from his army. The President sends a copy to the Secretary, who will probably comply, and there may be a personal affair, for Bragg's strictures on Hill as a general were pretty severe. There are rumors of a break in the cabinet, a majority, it is said, having been in favor of Bragg's removal. Bragg's disaster so shocked my son Custis that, at dinner, when asked for rice, he poured water into his sister's plate, the pitcher being near. NOVEMBER 27TH.--Dark and gloomy. At 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Gov. Vance, of North Carolina, telegraphed the Secretary of War, asking if anything additional had been heard from Bragg. The Secretary straightened in his chair, and answered that he knew nothing but what was published in the papers. At 1 o'clock P.M. a dispatch was received from Bragg, dated at _Ringgold, Ga._, some thirty miles from the battle-field of the day before. Here, however, it is thought he will make a stand. But if he could not hold his mountain position, what...", "...least thirty other occasions, while with the same squadron, he has crossed the lines alone, either in pursuit or in quest of enemy airplanes. The following incidents are examples of the work he has done recently: On Dec. 23, 1917, when leading his patrol, eight enemy airplanes were attacked between 2:30 P.M. and 3:50 P.M. Of these two were shot down by Captain McCudden in our lines. On the morning of the same day he left the ground at 10:50 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and encountered four enemy airplanes; of these he shot down two. On Jan. 30, 1918, he, single-handed, attacked five enemy scouts, as a result of which two were destroyed. On this occasion he only returned home when the enemy scouts had been driven far east; his Lewis-gun ammunition was all finished and the belt of his Vickers gun had broken. As a patrol leader he has at all times shown the utmost gallantry and skill, not only in the...", "...Regency. We spent an hour and a half in indifferent conversation, occupied in studying each other's character. Each was trying to get at the bottom of the other. I had not much trouble in playing the part of the unenlightened, for such, in point of fact, was my state of mind, and Madame d'Urfe unconsciously betrayed the desire of shewing her learning; this put me at my ease, for I felt sure I could make her pleased with me if I succeeded in making her pleased with herself. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the same dinner that was prepared every day for twelve was served for us three. Nothing worthy of note (so far as conversation went) was done at dinner, as we talked commonplace after the manner of people of fashion. After the dessert Tour d'Auvergne left us to go and see the Prince de Turenne, who was in a high fever, and after he was gone Madame d'Urfe began to discuss alchemy and magic, and all the other branches of her beloved science, or rather infatuation. When we got...", "...was next to the detective, but did not address him, for after what had happened there could be no sympathy between them. Fix had not altered, but Passe-partout was extremely reserved, and on the least suspicion would have strangled his former friend. In about an hour snow began to fall, but not sufficiently thick to hinder the progress of the train. Nothing could be seen from the windows but an immense white sheet, against which the steam of the engine looked gray. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the steward entered and said that bed-time had come. The backs of the seats were thrown down, bedsteads were pulled out, and berths improvised in a few moments. By this ingenious system each passenger was provided with a bed, and protected by curtains from prying eyes. The sheets were clean, the pillows soft. There was nothing to do but to go to bed and sleep, which everybody did as if they were on board ship, while the train rushed on across the State of California. The...", "...crossed the Platte about a mile below the canyon, intending to strike the southern road. They traveled until about 12 o'clock that night, and after tying their horses laid down on the prairie and slept until morning. They were then on Willow (South Plum) creek, about a mile above Wakeman's. About 7 o'clock Monday morning they rode to Wakeman's and got coffee. From there they made south, in a direct line for the foothills, and struck the road running south to Colorado Springs about 3 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. They followed the road for an hour, and then stopped at a house and got supper. They continued along the road, passing Monument and other stations. About 4 o'clock in the morning (Tuesday) they passed through Colorado Springs, and took the road south. Soon they became bewildered, and were uncertain about being on the right road. They descried a ranch and went to a hay-stack and fed their ponies, and discovered the railroad. This assured them, and crossing over...", "...my affairs. I augured unfavourably from this silence. In the meantime I fetched my sister from her convent, and took her about Paris. The child knows nothing of our ruin. In the course of the day she had some rather expensive fancies. She provided herself liberally with gloves, pink note-paper, bonbons for her friends, delicate scents, special soaps, and tiny pencils, all very necessary useful things, but not as necessary as a dinner. May she never have to realize this! At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I was at M. Laubepin's in the Rue Cassette. I do not know our old friend's age, but to-day I found him looking just the same as ever--tall and thin, with a little stoop, untidy white hair, and piercing eyes under bushy black eyebrows--altogether a face at once strong and subtle. I recognised the unvarying costume, the old-fashioned black coat, the professional white cravat, the family diamond in the shirt-frill--in short, all the outward signs of a serious, methodical, and...", "...any other purpose, for if we carried it along the street it would make our wrists ache trying to go into pubs. It twisted my wrist one time, and it ain't got right since--I always feel the pain in dull weather. Well, one night we got yarning and didn't notice how the time was going, and forgot to go for the beer till it was nearly too late. We looked for the bag and couldn't find it--we generally kept it under a side-table, but it wasn't there, and before we were done looking, eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> went. We sat down round the fire, feeling pretty thirsty, and were just thinking about turning in when we heard a thump on the table behind us. We looked round, and there was that bag with two full bottles of English ale in it. \"Then I remembered that I'd left a bob in the bottom of the bag, and---\" The steward turned off the electric light. There were some hundreds of cases of oranges stacked on deck, and made fast with matting and cordage to the bulwarks. That night was...", "...to the Englishman's fighting qualities, but he does not fight on his holidays. There were \"d--n his eyes,\" in plenty, and any quantity of talk, but no actual combats, except the boxing matches, and they were all in good humor. Why? I can't tell. Possibly it is because the beer they drink tends to peace, and possibly it is because they find vent for their combativeness in whipping their wives at home. But they don't fight on race courses. The mass commenced melting away at about four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, and the grounds were entirely deserted, except by the showmen and those who have money to make during the entire racing season. They live in their tents. The scene on the road back was slightly different from the morning. The people on the way out started to get drunk, and a vast majority succeeded. The road was lined with prostrate forms of men and women. The English women of the lower order drink as much as their husbands and brothers. You see them in the...", "...notes, \"Seth Bede, I thank you for your love towards me, and if I could think of any man as more than a Christian brother, I think it would be you. But my heart is not free to marry, or to think of making a home for myself in this world.

It was ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when he reached home, and he heard the sound of tools as he lifted the latch. \"Why, mother,\" said Seth, \"how is it as father's working so late?\" \"It's none o' thy feyther as is a-workin'; it's thy brother as does iverything, for there's niver nobody else i' th' way to do nothin'.\" Lisbeth Bede was going on, for she was not at all afraid of Seth--who had never in his life spoken a harsh word to his mother--and usually poured into his ears all the querulousness which was...", "...at a careful distance behind her mother. Phyllida was taking the demurest little steps with an arm in her beloved Betty's arm and with a swansdown muff held against her cheek to ward off the shrewd Easterly wind, while almost level with the two maids walked a stately gentleman of a pale complexion. And every time the gentleman stopped to survey the promenaders over the tortoise-shell handle of his ebony walking-stick, Phyllida and Betty stopped to see if it was truly a quarter-past nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> by St. Simon's church tower. And every time the gentleman stopped to flick a speck of dust from his purple sattin sleeve, by a very odd coincidence Miss Courteen always stopped to see if her shoe had really become unbuckled. This tends to show that in spite of all the precautions of Beau Ripple, the innermost fane of AEsculapius had been invaded by a strange god. I doubt Miss Courteen, considered by her mother too young for Chalybeate, was learning to drink of that deep well...", "...August. The guests of the fazender took leave of the Garral family toward the evening, and the following morning, that of the 3d of July, the jangada recommenced its descent of the river. At noon they passed on the left the mouth of the Yacurupa. This tributary, properly speaking, is a true canal, for it discharges its waters into the Ica, which is itself an affluent of the Amazon. A peculiar phenomenon, for the river displaces itself to feed its own tributaries! Toward three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon the giant raft passed the mouth of the Jandiatuba, which brings its magnificent black waters from the southwest, and discharges them into the main artery by a mouth of four hundred meters in extent, after having watered the territories of the Culino Indians.

One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent Bertuccio. Before this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and go out by the back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and Bertuccio with terror. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> precisely, the count arrived before the house at Auteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some compliments, while, at the same time, he feared to have frowns.

Giving free rein to these ambitious ideas and aspirations, the chief paced thoughtfully to and fro in a retired corner of the village until about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that night, when his impatience could no longer be curbed, and he felt that he _must_ sally forth to ascertain, if possible, the fate of M'Bongwele and his party. Accordingly, mounting his horse, he took his way out of the village, passing through the principal gateway, and heading for the ruins at a gallop. He was greatly disconcerted, on reaching his destination, to discover that the _Flying Fish_ still peacefully reposed in her usual berth; and his disgust was supreme when...", "...not yet started; they had drunk four bottles of wine, but Michel had partaken sparingly of them. He had found means to pour three of the four bottles into Pierre's glass, where they did not long remain. At midnight the wine-shop closed, and Michel having nowhere to go for the four hours that still remained until daybreak, Pierre offered him a bed of straw in the stable. Michel accepted. The two friends went back arm-in-arm; Pierre staggering, Michel pretending to stagger. At three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning the servant of the hotel awakened Michel. The traveller wanted his horse. Michel, pretending that he must be off to see to his game, also rose. His toilet was not long in making; he had only to shake the straw from his hair, game-bag, and blouse, after which he took leave of his friend Pierre and hid himself at the corner of the street. Fifteen minutes later the gate opened and a man rode out on a pacing horse. It was M. de Valensolle. He took the street that...", "...In these miserable days she had come to look for hidden meaning even in the expressionless faces of her trained servants, and now she misconstrued the respectful smile of welcome, brushed hastily past the maid who admitted her, and ran upstairs. Except for the servants she was alone. She rang for information concerning her brother; nobody had any. He had not been home in a week. Her toilet, after the journey, took her two hours or more to accomplish; it was dark at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and snowing heavily when tea was served. She tasted it, then, unable to subdue her restlessness, went to the telephone; and after a long delay, heard the voice she tremblingly expected: \"Is that you, Jack?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" \"H-how are you?\" \"Not very well.\" \"Have you heard anything new about certain proceedings?\" she inquired tremulously. \"Yes; she's begun them.\" \"On--on w-what grounds?\" \"Not on any grounds to scare you.

But he made no reply. \"Tell me, what ails you, Thomas?\" Mary urged, taking his hand affectionately. \"I have been to see Margaretta,\" the brother at length replied, in as calm a voice as he could assume. \"And she...", "...thought that it would be a good idea to go home, change our ball-dresses for morning-dress, and go out to the Bois for our morning coffee. We did it. I confess that it was a crazy thing to do after dancing all night; but the beautiful May morning, the glorious sunshine, and our spirits inspired us to carry out this wild whim, much to the disgust of our sleepy coachmen. This excursion was not a success; we were all tired and longed for bed. One cannot be amusing or _en train_ at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. And as for the family, when we returned home all the comment they made was, \"What fools!\" They did not see any fun in it; neither did we, to tell the truth. The Rothschilds, Lord Lyons, and Prince and Princess Metternich gave us what must have been very powerful letters, for we had hardly been in London more than a few days before we knew every one worth knowing, and all doors worth opening were opened to us, and I found myself what one calls _lancee_.

Mandat was at the Hotel de Ville. Mandat had fallen before the vengeance of the crowd. They hastened forward and rolled into the Place de la Greve. It was then seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. There, where they expected the order to attack, they were compelled again to wait. When they clamored they were told that they were delaying for the Faubourg St. Marceau, which was to join them at the Pont Neuf. Then these hordes, who had passed the night in suspense, in the midst of rumors and counterrumors, sent up a great shout of anger: \"Treachery!\" The populace that could dare anything could not stand suspense. A panic was imminent; but firmer spirits...", "...sail, with the flood tide, and we along with them. They had talked loudly in Boston of the sailing qualities of our ship, but almost the whole coal fleet sailed ahead of us. _18th, Wednesday._ The wind remained still, with mist. We saw it would be some days yet before the ship would reach the city, and therefore determined to go up in a wherry, that is a row-boat, from Gravesend. As soon as one came alongside we went aboard, and passed by Gravesend and other villages. It was nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening when we landed at St. Catharines,[457] and went to a tavern called the Dutch Smack, but they would not receive us. We then went to the Inlander, the landlord of which was a Fleming, and a Papist, but not the worst one. We paid for the boat three English shillings in all. We three, namely, Vorsman, Jan Owins, the surgeon of our ship, a Rotterdammer, and myself, supped together; this was the first time we had slept in a bed in a long time.

I simply had to bring him to gaff. I pulled and pumped and wound until I was blind and could scarcely feel. My old blisters opened and bled. My left arm was dead. I seemed to have no more strength than a kitten. I could not lead the fish nor turn him. I had to drag and drag, inch by inch. It was agonizing. But finally I was encouraged by sight of him, a long, fine, game fellow. A hundred times I got the end of the double line near the leader in sight, only to lose it. Seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> passed. I had fought this swordfish nearly three hours. I could not last much longer. I rested a little, holding hard, and then began a last and desperate effort to bring him to gaff. I was absolutely dripping with sweat, and red flashes passed before my eyes, and queer dots.

But though the Serapis had submitted, there were two misanthropical foes on board the Richard which would not so easily succumb--fire and water. All night the victors were engaged in suppressing the flames. Not until daylight were the flames got under; but though the pumps were kept continually going, the water in the hold still gained. A few hours after sunrise the Richard was deserted for the Serapis and the other vessels of the squadron of Paul. About ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the Richard, gorged with slaughter, wallowed heavily, gave a long roll, and blasted by tornadoes of sulphur, slowly sunk, like Gomorrah, out of sight. The loss of life in the two ships was about equal; one-half of the total number of those engaged being either killed or wounded.

Washington, in after-life, was heard to declare it the most beautiful spectacle that he had ever witnessed--the brilliant uniform of the soldiers, arranged in columns and marching in exact order; the sun gleaming on their burnished arms; the Monongahela flowing tranquilly by on the one hand, on the other, the primeval forest projecting its shadows in sombre magnificence. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the army again crossed the river at a second ford ten miles from Fort Du Quesne.

Kitty Grant had laughed that morning when Laura had told her that she was to go to Esther's at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and leave at six, that she might be in time for her own dinner hour,--had laughed and said, \"Oh, a regular 'four-to-six,'--a sunset tea!

Orders were sent by Thomas for each division commander to throw out a strong skirmish line, to be withdrawn at daylight, concealing the movement to the rear.

During the night the movement was completed without the loss of a single man, and at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of the 22d, the Army of the Cumberland, again united, was in position, holding the coveted prize, still strong enough to prevent the enemy from attempting further to dispute our possession of the town.

Taking all the surroundings into consideration, the campaign from the western slopes of the Cumberland Mountains, ending in the...", "...frightful story: it seems their fears had dressed me in the flowing robes of a tremendous spirit; and one of them affirmed, that when I made my appearance, a cold blast of wind came pouring down upon him from the sky, like so much cold water. About noon we saw at a distance the capital of Kaarta, situated in the middle of an open plain, the country for two miles round being cleared of wood, by the great consumption of that article for building and fuel, and we entered the town about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon. We proceeded without stopping to the court before the king's residence but I was so completely surrounded by the gazing multitude, that I did not attempt to dismount, but sent in the landlord and Madi Konko's son, to acquaint the king of my arrival. In a little time they returned accompanied by a messenger from the king, signifying that he would see me in the evening; and, in the meantime, the messenger had orders to procure me a lodging, and see that the...", "...and he determined to go home and make his wife learn wind music. May 1, 1668, he mentions that the pit was thrown into disorder by the rain coming in at the cupola. May 7 of the same year, he calls for Knipp when the play is over, and sees \"Nell in her boy's clothes, mighty pretty.\" \"But, Lord!\" he says, \"their confidence! and how many men do hover about them as soon as they come off the stage! and how confident they are in their talk!\" On May 18, 1668, Pepys goes as early as twelve <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> to see the first performance of that poor play, Sir Charles Sedley's \"Mulberry Garden,\" at which the king, queen, and court did not laugh. While waiting for the curtain to pull up, Pepys hires a boy to keep his place, slips out to the Rose Tavern in Russell Street, and dines off a breast of mutton from the spit. On September 15, 1668, there is a play--\"The Ladies a la Mode\"--so bad that the actor who announced the piece to be repeated fell a-laughing, as did the pit. Four...", "...life at the chateau was quite old fashioned in its simplicity. Everybody rose with the sun, or very soon afterwards. At nine o'clock the bell in the court rang for the principal meal, which was called dinner. Kings dined at about the same hour in the times of the Crusaders. Early in the afternoon the bell rang again. This was for _collation_, a very light repast, which was often nothing more than salad or fruit and a _frotte_--a piece of crusty bread rubbed with garlic. At about seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the bell rang for supper. The small chateaux with which the whole country hereabouts is strewn, notwithstanding that most of them have been partially rebuilt or grossly and wantonly mangled without a purpose such as the rational desire of increasing homely comfort may excuse, even when combined with no respect for the past, nevertheless contain numerous details that call up in the mind pictures of the life of old France. In the rat-haunted lofts and lumber-rooms may still be...", "...cotton, and the deck in front of the boilers in the same way, adding sacks of grain. The hay and grain would be wanted below, and could not be transported in sufficient quantity by the muddy roads over which we expected to march. Before this I had been collecting, from St. Louis and Chicago, yawls and barges to be used as ferries when we got below. By the 16th of April Porter was ready to start on his perilous trip. The advance, flagship Benton, Porter commanding, started at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, followed at intervals of a few minutes by the Lafayette with a captured steamer, the Price, lashed to her side, the Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburgh and Carondelet--all of these being naval vessels. Next came the transports --Forest Queen, Silver Wave and Henry Clay, each towing barges loaded with coal to be used as fuel by the naval and transport steamers when below the batteries. The gunboat Tuscumbia brought up the rear. Soon after the start a battery between...", "...of ice that surrounded us. About noon, having but little wind, we hoisted out a boat to try the current, which we found set S.E. near 3/4 of a mile an hour. At the same time, a thermometer, which in the open air was at 32 deg., in the surface of the sea was at 30 deg.; and, after being immerged 100 fathoms deep for about fifteen or twenty minutes, came up at 34 deg., which is only 2 deg. above freezing.[5] Our latitude at this time was 55 deg. 8'. The thick fog continued till two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon of the next day, when it cleared away a little, and we made sail to the southward, wind still at N.W. a gentle gale. We had not run long to the southward before we fell in with the main field of ice extending from S.S.W. to E. We now bore away to east along the edge of it; but at night hauled off north, with the wind at W.N.W., a gentle gale, attended with snow. At four in the morning on the 17th, stood again to the south; but was again obliged to bear up on...", "...frijoles in dirty saucers, which were offered to us; a proof both that we were young travellers in this country, and that we had not exhausted our basket of civilized provender. The road wound round through a succession of rocks and woods till we reached _Cruz del Marques_--the Marquis being of course Cortes, while the cross, it is said, was planted there by him to mark the limits of his territory, or rather of that which the Indian Emperor had assigned him. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the heat became intense, and we began to see and to feel symptoms of our approach to _tierra caliente_. We arrived at the Indian village of _Huichilaque_, which is rather pretty, with cane cottages and a good many flowering trees; and from the eminence on which it is situated, the _hot land_ is visible. The diligence now began galloping down the rocky and stony descent. The country looked even more arid than before; the vegetation more dried up. Not a tree--but here and...", "...that undistinguished and unconcentrated diversity which is for me the Liberal note. The pensive member sits and hears perplexing dialects and even fragments of foreign speech, and among the clustering masses of less insistent whites his roving eye catches profiles and complexions that send his mind afield to Calcutta or Rangoon or the West Indies or Sierra Leone or the Cape.... I was not infrequently that pensive member. I used to go to the Club to doubt about Liberalism. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the day the great smoking-room is crowded with countless little groups. They sit about small round tables, or in circles of chairs, and the haze of tobacco seems to prolong the great narrow place, with its pillars and bays, to infinity. Some of the groups are big, as many as a dozen men talk in loud tones; some are duologues, and there is always a sprinkling of lonely, dissociated men. At first one gets an impression of men going from group to group and as it were linking...", "...the whir of the grindstone came clear and distinct from the tool-house, and the window still gleamed with the same subdued, ghostly light. Elsie had intended to rush across the flagstones, fling open the door, shout \"Brian, go to bed!\" and then herself beat a hasty retreat; but, just when she was on the point of doing so, she hesitated. What if it shouldn't be Brian after all? And if it were not her cousin, who or what could be there in the tool-house turning the grindstone at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning? It is when we pause to think that fear often takes hold of us. Elsie was a brave child; but, somehow, just then her courage seemed to desert her. She remained for an instant listening to the whispering of the night wind, and the mysterious sound which had first roused her from her slumbers; then she drew back in sudden panic, locked the door as if in the fear of some lion, and went quickly back the way she had come. \"Tick-tack! tick-tack!\" muttered the old...", "...I returned to the lounge, dreading yet desiring an encounter with Captain Nemo, wanting yet not wanting to see him. What would I say to him? How could I hide the involuntary horror he inspired in me? No! It was best not to meet him face to face! Best to try and forget him! And yet . . . ! How long that day seemed, the last I would spend aboard the Nautilus! I was left to myself. Ned Land and Conseil avoided speaking to me, afraid they would give themselves away. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> I ate supper, but I had no appetite. Despite my revulsion, I forced it down, wanting to keep my strength up. At 6:30 Ned Land entered my stateroom. He told me: \"We won't see each other again before we go. At ten o'clock the moon won't be up yet. We'll take advantage of the darkness. Come to the skiff. Conseil and I will be inside waiting for you.\" The Canadian left without giving me time to answer him. I wanted to verify the Nautilus's heading. I made my way to...", "...and the whole family had complained of severe frontal headache and a feeling of general depression. This feeling was continuous day and night in the case of the rest of the family, but in his case, during the day, after leaving the house for his work, it gradually passed off, to return again during the night. The headaches were so intense that the whole family regularly applied vinegar rags to their heads, on going to bed each night during this period, for about three weeks. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Sunday morning the headaches became so severe that the mother got out of bed and renewed the application of vinegar and water all round, after which they all fell asleep, and, so far as the father and mother were concerned, remained completely unconscious until Monday morning. A man who occupied the house opposite the house tenanted by the last-mentioned family informed the narrator (Dr. Reid) that on Sunday morning the family, consisting of four, were taken seriously ill...", "...of old ones.

You are sure to know me, as it is not likely there will be any one else about. I shall wear grey flannel and a plain straw hat. I understand you are not elderly. I think you will like me.\" \"I shall love you,\" cried Boodles with much decision, laughing joyously at the concluding sentences. \"She understands I am not elderly, but I expect she will be astonished when she sees what...", "...and finally, becoming desperate, he makes a dive for the royal pavilion. The consternation is extreme. The people cheer the dog and laugh: a white-handed official, in gold lace, and without his hat, rushes out to \"shoo\" the dog away, but is unsuccessful; for the animal dashes between his legs, and approaches the royal and carpeted steps. More men of rank run at him, and he is finally captured and borne away; and we all breathe freer that the danger to royalty is averted. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> six youths in white jackets, with clubs and coils of rope, had stationed themselves by the pavilion, but they did not go into action at this juncture; and I thought they rather enjoyed the activity of the great men who kept off the dog. At length there was another stir; and the king descended from the rear of his pavilion, attended by his ministers, and moved about among the people, who made way for him, and uncovered at his approach. He spoke with one and another, and...", "...scraps of intelligence. Something was flying about respecting \"a gentleman who came down by the train,\" and something about \"Lady Temple\" and \"admirable,\" and the young lady seized the first opportunity of deserting Rachel, and plunging into the melee. Rachel sat on, sick with suspense, feeling utterly unable to quit her seat. Still they waited, the whole of the party were not arrived, and here was the curfew ringing, and that at the Deanery, which always felt injured if it were seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before people were in the dining-room! Grace must be upstairs dressing, but to reach her was impossible! At last Mr. Grey was announced, and he had mercy upon Rachel; he came up to her as soon as he could without making her remarkable, and told her the cause of his delay had been the necessity of committing Mauleverer upon an accusation by a relation of Colonel Keith, of very extensive frauds upon Miss Williams's brother. Rachel's illness and the caution of the Williamses had...", "...be provided. As soon as they were ready, he exhorted his soldiers, and told them of what advantage it would be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries if they made themselves masters of a rich and plentiful town: and, at the same time, to strike terror into other states by the example of this, and to effect this with speed, before auxiliaries could arrive. Accordingly, taking advantage of the unusual ardour of the soldiers, he began his assault on the town at a little after three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the very day on which he arrived, and took it, though defended with very high walls, before sunset, and gave it up to his army to plunder, and immediately decamped from before it, and marched to Metropolis, with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumour of the taking of Gomphi.

I do not know exactly how long the baron made his honeymoon last, nor when war was declared in his household; but I believe it happened in 1816, at a very brilliant ball given by Monsieur D-----, a commissariat officer, that the commissary general, who had been promoted head of the department, admired the beautiful Madame B-----, the wife of a banker, and looked at her much more amorously than a married man should have allowed himself to do. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning it happened that the banker, tired of waiting any longer, went home leaving his wife at the ball. \"We are going to take you home to your house,\" said the baroness to Madame B-----. \"Monsieur de V-----, offer your arm to Emilie!\" And now the baron is seated in his carriage next to a woman who, during the whole evening, had been offered and had refused a thousand attentions, and from whom he had hoped in vain to win a single look.

Wilson, with his division of cavalry, was farther south, and was cut off from the rest of the army. At two o'clock Hancock's troops began to arrive, and immediately he was ordered to join Getty and attack the enemy. But the heavy timber and narrow roads prevented him from getting into position for attack as promptly as he generally did when receiving such orders. At four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he again received his orders to attack, and General Getty received orders from Meade a few minutes later to attack whether Hancock was ready or not. He met the enemy under Heth within a few hundred yards. Hancock immediately sent two divisions, commanded by Birney and Mott, and later two brigades, Carroll's and Owen's, to the support of Getty. This was timely and saved Getty. During the battle Getty and Carroll were wounded, but remained on the field. One of Birney's most...", "...is, walk carefully. No sprained ankles to-night.\" Just how they reached their rooms Blue Bonnet never quite knew. She trusted Annabel and followed meekly as a newly born lamb should. When they parted at Blue Bonnet's door Annabel gave Blue Bonnet a swift hug. \"You're game clear through,\" she said. \"I think everything is all right. I can't hear a sound anywhere.\" Somewhere down the length of the hall a clock struck. Annabel and Blue Bonnet both counted: one--two--three! \"Three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and all is well!\" Annabel said. \"Good night.

Did any one else hear it?\" \"Yes, Madam de Cartier,\" Sue Hemphill said, equal to the occasion. \"It...", "...was arranged that Isobel and Caroline were to go on ahead of their guests, as Madame had expressed a wish that all her pupils would arrive at least half an hour before the visitors were expected, so that everything and every one would be ready to start promptly to time. It was just beginning to get dusk when the two girls were actually ready and waiting for Tom Bagg's cab to arrive so that they could start off. Pamela, Beryl, Martha, and Ellen were to follow on to Inchmoor by the seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train. The evening was very warm, and as Tom Bagg drove up to the gate, Isobel, suddenly declaring that she was too hot to put on her cloak, decided to carry it over her arm and wrap it round her in the cab if she felt chilly. Caroline did not care how hot she felt; she put on her cloak and buttoned it up to the neck, telling Isobel she thought she was foolish and that she might not only catch a cold but would get her dress soiled in brushing against the cab door, and so...", "...over to the captain of the landwehr, who received instructions to keep a strict guard over him. This officer belonged to the engineering corps, and directed, at the same time, the work of repairs within the citadel, in charge of a civilian contractor. Taking into consideration the rank of his prisoner, the captain permitted the Marquis to have with him his orderly, an Alsatian, who twice a day brought from the inn his chief's repasts. This functionary had permission also, from ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning until sunset, to promenade in the court under the eye of the sentinel on guard at the entrance. At five o'clock in the evening, the officer of the landwehr politely shut up his guest in his prison, double-locked the door, put the key in his pocket, and appeared no more until the next morning. The middle of November had arrived; heavy snows had already fallen, and the prisoner amused himself by constructing fortifications of snow--a work which his amiable jailer...", "...appearance from time to time, assists in this process.

If the house sits until two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, the labours of the last reporter, of the Parliamentary leader-writer, and of one of the editors, are protracted until three and sometimes four o'clock.

Brodie was standing where the barge had been moored, and gazing blankly at the river; he turned when he heard their footsteps, and ran quickly to the car. \"It's O. K., Arthur,\" cried Devar, realizing that the chauffeur might be dreading an attack from the rear, \"little Willie has returned, and won't go boating again in a derelict barge at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning if he can help it.\" \"Oh, it's you, sir!\" came the answer in a tone of vast relief. \"My, but I'm glad to see you!

Nothing could dampen the enthusiasm of this first joyous mob. On the night of the twentieth of July the Army of the North was encamped about seven miles from Beaureguard's lines at Bull Run.

They had come loaded down with baggage. They hurled it aside and got their guns.

Many had brought handcuffs and ropes along with which to manacle their prisoners and have sport with them after the fight, another ancient pastime of...", "...her speed, the cable glided into the water with such ease that it seemed but a holiday affair to carry it across to yonder continent.

But a few hours had passed before the booming of a gun awoke all on board with the heavy tidings of disaster. The morning breaks early in those high latitudes, and by four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all were on deck, with anxious looks inquiring for the cause of alarm.

The method used by the electricians to discover a fault is one of such delicacy and beauty as shows the marvellous...", "...we advanced to the north, we found the coast from Cape Edgcumbe to trend north and north-easterly for six or seven leagues, and there form a large bay. In the entrance of that bay are some islands; for which reason I named it the _Bay of Islands_. It lies in the latitude of 57 deg. 20';[4] and seemed to branch into several arms, one of which turned to the south, and may probably communicate with the bay on the east side of Cape Edgcumbe, and make the land of the Cape an island. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, the Cape bore S.E. 1/2 S.; the Bay of Islands N. 53 deg. E.; and another inlet, before which are also some islands, bore N. 52 deg.

By six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning the Doctor was out visiting the quarters of his sable dependants. Having on the previous evening told Major Scott, the head man or overseer of the gang, that he should expect the people to rise by daybreak and get their breakfasts immediately, so as to be ready for early work, he was a little astonished to find half of them still asleep, and two or three absent. The Major himself was just leaving the water-butt in rear of the plantation house, where he had...", "...and I called our own, and not until the sun showed his face next morning did I awaken. Because a truce had been declared, there was no need of standing guard, and all our company enjoyed a full night's rest. As soon as breakfast had been eaten we lounged around the camp, remaining where we could overlook the town, and waited for some word from the governor, speculating meanwhile as to what proposition it might please him to make. Noon came, and no messenger appeared. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> my father was sent across the river to learn why we had not heard from Tryon, and he returned with a reply that we \"would be well satisfied in a few hours.\" This message was given by a servant at the governor's headquarters; my father had seen neither the governor, his secretary, nor Fanning. There was no little grumbling because we were thus kept waiting when the truce was for twenty hours only; but never a man dreamed of breaking his word.

We fell in with several large islands on the 14th, and about noon, with a quantity of loose ice, through which we sailed. Latitude 64 deg. 55' south, longitude 163 deg. 20' west. Grey albatrosses, blue peterels, pintadoes, and fulmers, were seen. As we advanced to the S.E. by E. with a fresh gale at west, we found the number of ice islands increase fast upon us. Between noon and eight in the evening we saw but two; but before four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning of the 15th, we had passed seventeen, besides a quantity of loose ice which we ran through. At six o'clock, we were obliged to haul to the N.E., in order to clear an immense field that lay to the south and S. E. The ice, in most part of it, lay close packed together; in other places, there appeared partitions in the field, and a clear sea beyond it.

A curious adventure happened to the Bishop in 1865. It was the rainy season, and the roads were saturated with water and full of holes, especially a new bit of road towards Pedungan, where sleepers of wood had been laid down, to steady what would otherwise have been a bog; but holes here and there could not be avoided. The Bishop always took a ride early in the morning, before seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> service in church.

At length, at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon of the 29th, the wind came at east, and we weighed anchor.

Next day, July 10, the wind rose again violently ahead.

Coils of fog rushed in after him through the opened door and filled the hall and passage with its cold discomfort. The first thing Dr. Silence did was to lock up Smoke in the study with a saucer of milk before the fire, and then make a...", "...After he had gone out for a few minutes for tobacco, all the four of them breakfasted together about ten o'clock.

He recommended them to Hare's house, and accompanied them there. About six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he was standing at the mouth of the entry leading to his dwelling, when a man whom he never saw before, and whose name he did not know, came up and asked if he could get a pair of shoes mended. This man was dressed in a greatcoat, the cape of which was turned up about his face. Burke offered to perform the work, and the stranger went with him into the house.

Later in the day--that is to say, about eleven o'clock in the morning--Don Hermoso was visited by a file of soldiers, who informed him that the governor demanded his presence, and roughly commanded him to follow them.

Thus she gave up her whole life to him, and doubtless thereby gained much fresh interest in it for herself.

To speak of the gloaming is a poetic license, it is true.

There is a species of dreaminess in the air. The landscape assumes soft tints unknown to a fiery sun. Tender shadows steal from undiscovered realms.

On the same day we put back to the roadstead of Havre de Grace, the wind not being favorable. On Sunday following, the 16th, we set sail on our route. On the 17th, we sighted d'Orgny and Grenesey, [121] islands between the coast of Normandy and England. On the 18th of the same month, we saw the coast of Brittany. On the 19th, at 7 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening we reckoned that we were off Ouessant. [122] On the 21st, at 7 o'clock in the morning, we met seven Flemish vessels, coming, as we thought from the Indies. On Easter day, the 30th of the same month, we encountered a great tempest, which seemed to be more lightning than wind, and which lasted for seventeen days, though not continuing so severe as it was on the first two days. During this time, we lost more than we gained. On the 16th of April, to the delight of...", "...the things I like. We both had the day off, of course, to go and say good-by to Hal--Lucy is a technician at Hydroponics Center. I felt awkward and clumsy. Her ways are so different from mine; I explode and then it's over--just a sore place where it hurts if I touch it. Lucy never explodes, but I knew the sore place would be there forever, and getting worse instead of better. We ate dinner in silence, though neither of us felt hungry, and had the table cleared. Then it was nearly 19 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and I had to speak. \"The takeoff will be at 19:10,\" I said. \"Want me to tune in now?

Then, in a softer voice, she added: \"Of course, Frank, turn it on whenever you like. I'll just go to my room and open the soundproofing.\" There were still no tears in her eyes.

At two o'clock a magazine in the fort blew up, and not long after, just as Clive was about to give the order to storm, a white flag was seen fluttering at one of the bastions.

A few minutes of this sufficed to bring the defenders to reason, and by five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the English flag flew upon the walls.

The others also threw up their heads and tested the air with their keen noses, their great ears cocked forward to catch the slightest sound. High headed and suspicious, they all...", "...for several miles lost them in distant jungle.

For five hours the two ships kept up the running fight. The ponderous eighteen and forty-two pound shot of the enemy crashed into the \"Constellation,\" or swept her decks, doing dreadful damage. The deck was strewn with dead and dying men, and the surgeons down in the cock-pit soon had their tables full of moaning sufferers. No one could tell what might be the condition of \"La Vengeance;\" but her regular fire told that she was in no wise disabled. At one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, the sound of her guns seemed to be more distant; and by the flash of the cannon it was seen that she was drawing out of the fight. The Americans cheered lustily, and Truxton ordered that his ship be braced up in chase. But the fire of the enemy had been rapid and well directed; and now, at this critical moment, its results were to rob the \"Constellation\" of her victory. As the ships were brought about, to follow in the track of the flying \"Vengeance,\" an...", "...lifted his feet with an effort, and carried them slowly from the house, carefully and quietly closing the kitchen door after him. About half a minute later he opened the door again, just as carefully and as quietly, and said: 'Good night, ma'am, and God bless you.' Then he went away, his hands bunched behind him, walking like a man carrying a heavy burden.

Jim, seeing a prospect of covering himself with glory, made a dash after the truants; but they snatched up their clothes and ran for the saplings up the creek, all naked as they were, and Jim was soon out of the hunt--though he captured Ted's shirt, and produced it as a guarantee of good faith. That night three boys--three of the...", "...the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously, and scrutinized them carefully. \"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich.

In a thorn-bush the old woman saw a mocking-bird feeding her young; in the dust she saw where a snake had smoothed his way across the road. She halted to look at a bare-legged boy, who with his straw hat was seining a rivulet. Telling the time by the sun, she dismounted at noon and in the shade of a wild plum thicket, ate her luncheon, while the mare cropped the sweet road-side grass. But it was not intended that her journey should be without event. Along toward four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she came to a bridge across a small stream. The planks were worn with heavy hauling--the whole thing dangerous, and into a hole the mare's foot sank. She floundered, fell, and when Margaret, unhurt, arose out of the dust, she saw with horror that the poor creature's leg was broken. The mare floundered to the road-side and then in misery sank upon the ground. \"Poor old friend,\" said the woman, with sorrow in her voice, tears streaming from her eyes, but in her hand was the...", "...in that which she believed to be the direction of London. The mists lifted as the sun began to warm them.

Yet a hundred yards farther down the lane and she espied some modern villas in the Queen Anne style and after that quite a considerable village lying in the hollow. It would have been about eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> of the morning by this time; and workmen passed her with the firm tread and the cheery \"Good-morning, miss,\" which are still to be seen and heard within ten miles of the metropolis. At first she scarcely had the courage to ask where she was; for she realized how strangely the question must fall upon other ears at such a time and under such circumstances; but plucking up her courage presently as a lad approached her, she stopped him and learned that this was the village of...", "...hidden face. We swung low across unnamed mountain ranges and deep sheer valleys steeped in shadow. The voice of the ranger in the _Arrow_ came softly through the open intercom into the tiny control room of the _Hound_.

The reply was, 'No.' But before the sitting was over, the psychic exclaimed, 'Why, your aunt is here! She has already passed away.' 'This cannot be true,' said the lady; 'there must be a mistake. If she had died, they would have telegraphed us immediately.' 'But,' the psychic insisted, 'she is here. And she explains that she died about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this morning. She also says that a telegram has been sent, and you will find it at the house on your return.' \"Here seemed a clear case for a test.

The regiment broke into a trot along the highroad, after leaving the village. There was the terrace where Bettina had been the other morning. Jean said to himself: \"Supposing she should be there.\" He dreaded and hoped it at the same time. He raised his head, he looked, she was not there. He had not seen her again, he would not see her again, for a long-time at least. He would start that very evening at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> for Paris; one of the personages in the War Office was interested in him; he would try to get exchanged into another regiment. Alone at Cercottes, Jean had had time to reflect deeply, and that was the result of his reflections. He could not, he must not, be Bettina Percival's husband. The men dismounted at the barracks, Jean took leave of his Colonel, his comrades; all was over. He was free, he could go. But he did not go; he looked around him. How happy he was three...", "...fell again into a deep sleep. When he awoke, the convoy had halted in a solitary spot, full in the sun, and all the men--the _peones_--were seated round a quarter of calf, which was roasting in the open air, beside a large fire, which was flickering in the wind. They all ate together, took a nap, and then set out again; and thus the journey continued, regulated like a march of soldiers. Every morning they set out on the road at five o'clock, halted at nine, set out again at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, and halted again at ten. The _peones_ rode on horseback, and stimulated the oxen with long goads. The boy lighted the fire for the roasting, gave the beasts their fodder, polished up the lanterns, and brought water for drinking. The landscape passed before him like an indistinct vision: vast groves of little brown trees; villages consisting of a few scattered houses, with red and battlemented facades; very vast tracts, possibly the ancient beds of great salt...", "...was sullied by the excesses of the image- breaking. The religious war, before imminent, became inevitable. Nevertheless, the first effect of the tumults was a temporary advantage to the Reformers. A great concession was extorted from the fears of the Duchess Regent, who was certainly placed in a terrible position. Her conduct was not heroic, although she might be forgiven for trepidation. Her treachery, however, under these trying circumstances was less venial.

They found her already equipped for flight, surrounded by her waiting- women, chamberlains and lackeys, while the mules and hackneys stood harnessed in the court-yard, and her body-guard were prepared to mount at a moment's notice. She announced her intention of retreating at once to Mons, in which city, owing to Aerschot's care, she hoped to find refuge...", "...It is perhaps fortunate, or I should spend too much time with you in this way.

While fresh horses were being put to and the passports and safe-conduct examined at the Loulle gate, the marshal entered the hotel to take a plate of soup.

The dark scowl on the count's face made absolutely no impression upon him. He closed the window and followed ten paces behind the...", "...suffered at all. The man had been a favorite with all his fellows by reason of his good humor, and that he was now stretched out dead seemed unbelievable.

The hot winds of Australia, which begin about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the forenoon, swept over the prairie with a blast that felt like the flames of an extensive conflagration, and yet we heeded it not, for our whole thoughts were fixed, like greedy misers, upon the gold which we were soon to acquire, and we speculated what we should do with our wealth, and how expend it. We urged our panting horses to their utmost speed, and not until the old stockman cried out to us to draw up, or we should exhaust the brutes, did we allow them to take...", "...It is asking a great deal, I know, as you have just ridden eighty miles; but it is a case of necessity, and if you'll go, Cody, I'll see that you are well paid for it.\" \"Never mind about the pay,\" said I, \"but get your despatches ready and I'll start at once.\" In a few minutes he handed me the package, and, mounting the same horse which I had ridden from General Terry's camp, I struck out for my destination.

General Terry, after reading the despatches, halted his command and then rode on and overtook General Crook, with whom he held a council; the result was that Crook's command moved on in the direction which they had been pursuing, while Terry's forces marched back to the Yellowstone and crossed the river on steamboats.

Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with good reason, that Herbert's wounds, half healed, might reopen on the way, did not give the order to start.

Before entering his carriage, the First Consul made a present to Monseigneur, the archbishop, of a snuff-box with his portrait, and also gave one to the mayor, on which was the inscription, 'Peuple Francais'.

I want to hear the old band play. _----James Whitcomb Riley._ THE great event of the Pioneers' Picnic was the lacrosse match between Millford and Hillsboro. It was held at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon, and everybody was there. The Millford lacrosse boys were in serious financial difficulty-- \"everything gone but their honour,\" as one sentimental member had put it, and if the columns of the Hillsboro Gazette were to be trusted, that was gone, too. But in the big game on this occasion they hoped to retrieve their fallen fortunes. Everybody felt that the real business of the day had begun when the two lacrosse teams drew up on the field. The women had...", "...I trust her Majesty will pardon me.\" Certainly the gallant adventurer on whom devolved at least half the work of directing the defence of the city, had a right to express his opinions.

Sara didn't scold or coax any more. She patted my head and kissed me and made me bathe my face and go to bed. Then she tucked me in just as she used to do when I was a little girl. \"Now, don't cry, dear,\" she said, \"it will come right yet.\" Somehow, I began to hope it would when Sara thought so, and anyhow it was such a comfort to have talked it all over with her.

The Third Brigade followed, and were put in first after 2 p.m., the Welsh Regiment and the Gloucesters, supported by the Munsters and the South Wales Borderers. By dusk the Munsters were taken from support, and put out to the right to fill a gap between the Gloucesters and the next Brigade of the Division.

He chatted with the barmaid while she was drawing the beer, noticing with a smile the notice painted on the wall: \"WHERE ELSE CAN YOU GET Such fine MELLOW 4d. RUM! Such pure OLD 6d. WHISKEY!

If Shakspeare had come back to life again, and had called at the vicarage at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on Saturday evening, to explain to Miss Sturch exactly what his views were in composing the tragedy of Hamlet, she would have smiled and said it was extremely interesting, until the striking of seven o'clock; at which time she would have left him in the middle of a sentence, to superintend the housemaid in the verification of the washing-book.

Not caring, therefore, to trust too much to appearances, I steered to the southward. Having thus got without all the land in sight, I then steered west, in which direction the islands lay, for such we found this land to be. By eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we had passed three of them, all of a good height. More of them were now seen to the westward, the south-westernmost part of them bearing W.N.W. The weather, in the afternoon, became gloomy, and at length turned to a mist, and the wind blew fresh at E.

A caged lover's feelings may easily be imagined. My uncle went on working, his imagination went off rambling into the ideal world of combinations; he was far away from earth, and really far away from earthly wants.

Still I held out; I made it a point of honour. Two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> struck. This was becoming ridiculous; worse than that, unbearable. I began to say to myself that I was exaggerating the importance of the document; that my uncle would surely not believe in it, that he would set it down as a mere puzzle; that if it came to the worst, we should lay violent hands on him and keep him at home if he thought on venturing on the expedition; that, after all, he might himself discover the key of the cipher, and that then I should be clear at the mere...", "...The Customs officers had eyed him suspiciously at the border. They evidently had been told of his strange madness in refusing to occupy the berth he had paid for. Their examination of his effects was more thorough than usual. It may have entered their heads that he was standing guard over the repose of a fair accomplice. They asked so many embarrassing and disconcerting questions that he was devoutly relieved when they passed on, still suspicious. The train was late, and at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he was desperately combating an impulse to leave it at Strassburg, find lodging in a hotel, and then, refreshed, set out for London to have it out with the malevolent Medcroft. The disembarking of the venerable mourners, however, restored him to a degree of his peace of mind. After all, he reviewed, it would be cowardly and base to desert a trusting wife; he pictured her as asleep and securely confident in his stanchness. No: he would have it out with Medcroft at some later...", "...surplusage or alloy. Michael Scott's, on the other hand, are about as direct as it is possible to be.

The following characteristic scene may serve as an example, and it must be borne in mind that all Scott's fine scenes are incidental: he never, so to speak, makes a point of them.

Having passed the first post-house she met a Berlin containing four travellers, among whom she recognised Louis Bonaparte going to meet the General on the Lyons road. On seeing Madame de Bourrienne Louis desired the postillion to stop, and asked her whether she had heard from me. She informed him that we should pass through Sens, where the General wished to dine with my mother, who had made every preparation for receiving him. Louis then continued his journey. About nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> my wife met another Berlin, in which were Madame Bonaparte and her daughter. As they were asleep, and both carriages were driving at a very rapid rate, Madame de Bourrienne did not stop them. Josephine followed the route taken by Louis.

At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening General Keller was ordered to retake Chenebier. On this errand he left Mandrevillars with two Baden battalions, reached Moulin Rougeot at midnight, and found Frahier already occupied by Colonel Bayer. _January 17th._--On this morning eight battalions, two squadrons, and four batteries were assembled in Frahier.

The moment came when money, the money that was so scarce, no longer procured bread.

The father did not care to venture into that mass of humanity. He was afraid of being recognized, of compromising himself by one of those outbursts to which his impetuous nature would have given vent, no matter where he might be. Then, too, he recoiled from the fatigue and severity of the task. The little boy was still too small; he would have been crushed; so the duty of obtaining bread for three mouths each day fell to the daughter. She obtained it. With her...", "...all the world over.

Punting he found was difficult, but not impossible, and towards four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> he succeeded in conveying a second passenger across the sundering flood from the inn to the unknown. As he returned, slowly indeed, but now one might almost say surely, to the peg to which the punt was moored, he became aware of a singularly delightful human being awaiting him on the bank. She stood with her legs very wide apart, her hands behind her back, and her head a little on one side, watching his gestures with an expression of disdainful interest. She had black hair...", "...as to the object. He being an old and reliable friend, I told him without hesitation; and he immediately asked if he might not be allowed to accompany me. He desired, he said, to pay a last visit to Charleston, the place of his birth, and to a sister living there, before the dread outbreak which he knew was coming. I saw no objection. He hurried to his rooms to make his own preparations, whence, an hour later, I took him and his wife to the boat.

It was now in the power of the French admiral to have engaged closely, and at about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning a line-of-battle ship and a frigate opened their fire upon the _Mars_. From this time a pretty constant cannonade was kept up, the French ships firing at a distance as they came up, and three of the English ships returning it. Such was the bad sailing of the _Brunswick_ and _Bellerophon_ that their fire was quite lost and they were obliged to keep their course without retaliating; in fact, it became necessary to cut away their anchors and launches, throw...", "...are due to you, for your readiness in attending to any propositions we might make.

The Lord's day afternoon meeting at two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was entirely given up, on account of its being an unseasonable time, and it being better to have only two meetings instead of three, as almost every one could attend two meetings, which was quite enough for one day, and gave some time for parents to be with their children, or gave some more time than usual for reading the Scriptures, a point at which I aimed from the beginning. For when I came to Stuttgart, I found it just as I have found it in some places in England on my...", "...at noticing that, while she had been walking up and down, up and down her room, she had never heard the clock strike two or three. The fact of having spoken to Miss Carew had brought her for the moment out of the inferno of the last few hours, and the time from four o'clock to six was less utterly miserable because worse had gone before it. At six she called the housemaid, and kept her fussing about the room, lighting the fire, and getting tea, so as not to be alone again. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she sent for coffee and eggs, and the coffee had to be made twice before she was satisfied with it. Then she suddenly said she felt much better, and, having dressed much more quickly than usual, she went out. Molly had determined to confide the position to Father Molyneux. When she got to the church in Kensington it was only to find that Father Molyneux had gone away for some days. That evening the doctor was again summoned, and told Miss Carew that he had now no doubt...", "...rather earlier than usual,\" explained Jeckley. \"Yes,\" I said, not caring in the least about Mr. Jeckley's hours for meals. \"You see I'm doing the opening at the Globe to-night, and I must get my Wall Street copy to the office before the theatre. And what do you think of that by way of an extra assignment?\" He took a card from his pocket-book and tossed it over. It was another one of Mr. Esper Indiman's calling-cards, and scrawled in pencil, \"Call at 4020 Madison Avenue at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> this evening.\" Jeckley was lighting his cigar, and so did not observe my start of surprise. Have I said that Jeckley was a newspaper man? One of the new school of journalism, a creature who would stick at nothing in the manufacture of a sensation. The Scare-Head is his god, and he holds nothing else sacred in heaven and earth. He would sacrifice--but perhaps I'm unjust to Jeckley; maybe it's only his bounce and flourish that I detest. Furthermore, I'm a little afraid of him;...", "...those boats before they get to Bonn. 39. Here comes a carriage driving slowly down the road, with four students in it. Two of them are hanging down their heads and holding them with their hands, as if they had dreadful headaches. They look very sick. The other two students seem pretty well. I suppose they are going in the carriage with the sick ones to take care of them. It is getting too dark for me to see any more CHAPTER VIII. A SABBATH ON THE RHINE. About eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning, Mr. George and Rollo went up among the gardens behind the hotel, and after ascending for some time, they came at length to a seat in a bower which commanded a very fine view, and here they sat down. Mr. George took a small Bible out of his pocket, and opened it at the book of the Acts, and began to read. He continued to read for half an hour or more, and to explain to Rollo what he read about. Rollo was very much interested in the stories of what the...", "...to Chopin, who quietly said to me: \"I should have liked better if it had been you.\" \"What are you thinking of my dear friend! An article by Liszt, that is a fortunate thing for the public and for you. Trust in his admiration for your talent. I promise you qu'il vous fera un beau royaume.'--'Oui, me dit-il en souriant, dans son empire!'\"\"] These few words speak volumes. But here is what Liszt wrote about the concert in the \"Gazette musicale\" of May 2, 1841:-- Last Monday, at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, M. Pleyel's rooms were brilliantly lighted up; numerous carriages brought incessantly to the foot of a staircase covered with carpet and perfumed with flowers the most elegant women, the most fashionable young men, the most celebrated artists, the richest financiers, the most illustrious noblemen, a whole elite of society, a whole aristocracy of birth, fortune, talent, and beauty. A grand piano was open on a platform; people crowded round,...", "...it may be that we could take the horses higher up, but I don't feel any way sure about it and, if we should take them, we'd probably find the ground covered with snow. Let's make camp, and tie up the pack horses, and then we'll ride farther on and see what there is. It looks to me like there ought to be lots of sheep and goats up here, and we may as well find out.\" It was nearly noon before the packs were off and the tent up, and then it was time to cook and eat, so that it was one <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> before they mounted again and rode off. Hugh followed the westerly branch of the stream and, after a little search, found a game trail which led up the steep bank and brought them to the level of the valley, above the forty-foot precipice over which the stream poured. Here the ground was level and timber-covered, but they soon came out on rolling land which rose steadily toward the mountain and was dotted with clumps of trees. The stream, which they had been following, came...", "...of your hands. It won't seem half so bad then. And don't any of you cry if you can help it. I want to remember you all smiling.\" We went out of the old orchard where the autumn night wind was beginning to make its weird music in the russet boughs, and shut the little gate behind us. Our revels there were ended. CHAPTER XXXIII. THE STORY GIRL GOES The morning dawned, rosy and clear and frosty. Everybody was up early, for the travellers must leave in time to catch the nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train. The horse was harnessed and Uncle Alec was waiting by the door. Aunt Janet was crying, but everybody else was making a valiant effort not to. The Awkward Man and Mrs. Dale came to see the last of their favourite. Mrs. Dale had brought her a glorious sheaf of chrysanthemums, and the Awkward Man gave her, quite gracefully, another little, old, limp book from his library. \"Read it when you are sad or happy or lonely or discouraged or hopeful,\" he said gravely. \"He has...", "...for want of leisure. So home and to bed. 13th (Lord's day). In the morning to Paul's, where I heard a pretty good sermon, and thence to dinner with my Lady at the Wardrobe; and after much talk with her after dinner, I went to the Temple to Church, and there heard another: by the same token a boy, being asleep, fell down a high seat to the ground, ready to break his neck, but got no hurt. Thence to Graye's Inn walkes; and there met Mr. Pickering and walked with him two hours till 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> till I was quite weary. His discourse most about the pride of the Duchess of York; and how all the ladies envy my Lady Castlemaine. He intends to go to Portsmouth to meet the Queen this week; which is now the discourse and expectation of the town. So home, and no sooner come but Sir W. Warren comes to me to bring me a paper of Field's (with whom we have lately had a great deal of trouble at the office), being a bitter petition to the King against our office for not doing...", "...he had aboard, how he was going to land for more. He didn't speak it particular loud, and you might have thought he was talking what a hot day it was; but there was that in his voice I've never heard before or since, and you knew he'd live right up to every word he said. I guess the pastor and the student understood a little English, for when Coe finished they laid on to their oars like mad, and headed the old sieve for shore again, Tweedie in the bilge and still protesting. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> we turned off Sosofina, Afiola's aunt. We now had three aloft, and as we rolled gently broadside on to the swell they'd swing together and swing apart till you didn't care to look at them. That hour from two to three was the very longest I ever spent in my life. It was the hottest time of day and the sun beat down unmerciful, the pitch running in the seams, and the awnings being stripped off to better fight the ship, if need be. The steward passed round sardines and buttered...", "...came to a Sioux village, consisting of a part of Wabashaw's band, under Wah-koo-ta. Landed and found a Sioux who could speak Chippewa, and serve as interpreter. I informed them of my route and the object of my visit, and of my having communicated a message with wampum and tobacco to Wabashaw. They told us that the Menomonies had killed twenty-five Foxes at Prairie du Chien a few days ago, having first made them drunk, and then cut their throats and scalped them. We encamped, at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, under high cliffs on the west shore, having been fifteen hours in our canoes. Found mint among the high grass, where our tent poles were put. On the next morning we set off at half-past four o'clock, and went until ten to breakfast. At a low point of land of the shore, we had a view of a red fox, who scampered away gayly. He had been probably gleaning among the shell-fish along shore. At a subsequent point we met a boat laden with Indian goods, bound to St....", "...waters over their cards and papers in the smoking-room; or wrote letters in the saloon or the music-room. At eleven o'clock they spoiled their appetites for lunch with tea or bouillon to the music of a band of second-cabin stewards; at one, a single blast of the bugle called them to lunch, where they glutted themselves to the torpor from which they afterwards drowsed in their berths or chairs. They did the same things in the afternoon that they had done in the forenoon; and at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the deck-stewards came round with their cups and saucers, and their plates of sandwiches, again to the music of the band. There were two bugle-calls for dinner, and after dinner some went early to bed, and some sat up late and had grills and toast. At twelve the lights were put out in the saloons and the smoking-rooms. There were various smells which stored themselves up in the consciousness to remain lastingly relative to certain moments and places: a whiff of whiskey and...", "...told him, and there was nothing that night but the late and dear express. For this Thomas had not enough money in addition to what would be required to buy off Jacob, so he had no help for it but to go home. This he did with a heart heavy enough. Well did he know that ere he could reach Birmingham to-morrow he would be too late. Recruiting sergeants do not linger at their work, especially after the army had been reduced by war and disease as it then had been in the Crimea. Before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next morning Jacob, still dazed with yesterday's unwonted debauch, was sworn in before a Birmingham J.P., and not all the money his father possessed could then release him. Henceforth, till his years of service were out, he must go and kill or be killed at the bidding of these \"sovereigns and statesmen,\" whose business it still, alas, is to make strife in the world. This untoward event was in many ways a knock-down blow to the old labourer and his wife. She, however,...", "...anywhere there.\" They then went to the barn and gave it a thorough search. Between it and the house, a little away from the path, but in plain sight, stood the carriage-house, _which they passed by without seeming to notice_. After they had gone, poor Tom was found in this very house, curled up under the seats of the old-fashioned family carriage. He had never come to the house at all, but had heard the voices of his hunters from his hiding-place, during their whole search. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, Fenton was found by William Wright out in the field. He had run along the bed of a small water course, dry at that time of year, until he came to a rye field amid whose high grain he hid himself until he thought the danger was past. From William Wright's the slave-catchers went to Joel Wierman's, where, despite all that could be done, they got poor Sam, took him off to Maryland and sold him to the traders to be taken far south. In 1856 William Wright was a...", "...Nibby retired, carrying away the image of his fair neighbor for evening reverie over his cigar, and that night he slept so soundly, without recurrence of his afflicting nausea, that he was disposed to make of madame's saint's day one of most favorable augury for himself. The Fraeulein went up stairs, and read aloud to the baroness. Her thoughts strayed to the good-looking gentleman with a gray moustache, friendly smile and well-kept, white hands who had been so kind to her. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she received an unexpected gift. Lo! on the fete-day the chef had compounded for her a second edifice in the shape of a nougat house stocked with bonbons. She blushed, then laughed like a child. * * * * * A month later, the Fraeulein again sat reading to the baroness, her thoughts astray and her tone of voice so monotonous that it acted soporifically on her listener. The baroness nodded in her arm-chair, with her pet poodle on her knee. The...", "...was seen in the afternoon. Of the progress of the battle on his flanks Sir John French had little knowledge. Aeroplanes were sent up to reconnoitre the position. One which flew over the area of the Sixth French Army west of the Ourcq saw at about five o'clock a good deal of movement and shells bursting in the area Etavigny-Marcilly-May-en-Multien. Another machine which flew along the line of the Fifth French Army on the British right came back with the information that at four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> fighting was going on south of Esternay and north of Villiers-St.-Georges. By seven o'clock that evening Sir John French had no definite news of the progress of the French armies on his wings save what was contained in these air reports, and the orders which he issued stated simply that all troops should be ready to move at any time after 8.0 a.m. on the morrow. Early on the 7th the situation became clearer; a general retirement of the Germans on the British front was in...", "...in the wind-shelter it was strange that she could be so oblivious of his presence. It was distasteful to him to have to signal the train of her attention. To be sure, a very little signal served,--a word, a look, a thoughtful gesture,--but he preferred a homage that required no prompting. Moreover, she was guilty of \"smiling on all she looked upon,\" and her acceptance of Andy Black into the ever-widening circle of her admirers offended him deeply. The day dragged interminably. By five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon a tango-tea was in progress, and it seemed to Percival that everybody on board was dancing except the missionaries and himself. Even they were taking part as spectators, having secured their places half an hour before the appointed time in order not to miss a moment of the shocking exhibition. Percival went to the upper deck and sought the most secluded corner he could find, but even there he was haunted by the soul-disturbing music. Dancing was one of his...", "...Czar of all the Russias.\" On the 13th, Philip received a telegram calling him to Paris at once. He was begged to spend a few hours at the arsenal of artillery with the Ministre de la guerre. He could not refuse. He wired immediately that he would comply without delay. Dora naturally proposed to send at once to General Sabaroff, asking him to dine with them another evening instead of on the 15th. \"No, no,\" said Philip; \"I shall leave Paris the day after to-morrow by the nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> train in the morning. It is the mail, and I shall arrive in London at half-past four; even allowing for a couple of hours of possible delay, I should still reach home in good time. Besides,\" he said, glancing at a newspaper, \"the barometer is rising, the sea is good, there is no danger of bad weather and delays.\" It was in vain for Dora to persist, Philip would not consent to any change in the arrangement. \"My dear child, one cannot put off a Minister at a moment's notice,...", "...the accused cadet, with his first real sinking feeling that morning. \"Yet, if any straw of evidence, this morning, seems really to throw any definite taint upon me, not one of these same fellows would ever again consent to wipe his feet on me!\" Such is the spirit of the cadet corps. Any comrade and brother must be wholly above suspicion where his honor is concerned. Had Dick been really guilty he would have been the meanest thing in cadet barracks. At a little before nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> Lieutenant Topham called. To Cadet Prescott it seemed grimly absurd that he must now go forth in holiday attire of cadet full-dress uniform, white lisle gloves and all---to stand before the court of officers who were to decide whether he was morally fit to remain and associate with the other cadets. But it was the regulation that a cadet must go to court, whether as witness or accused, in full-dress uniform. \"I'm going to do my best for you today, Mr. Prescott,\" declared...", "...pockets. I cared nothing who he was, and did not want to know. My sole desire was to acquit Jacqueline of his death in the world's eyes. That he had come deservedly by it I was positive. I was her sole protector now, and I felt a furious resolve that no one should rob me of her. The ground was as hard as iron, and I was satisfied that my footsteps had left no track; there would be snow before morning, and if my feet had left any traces these would be covered effectively. Four <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> was striking while I was climbing back into the room again. Jacqueline lay on the bed in the same position; she had not stirred during that hour. While she slept I set about the completion of my task. I took the knife from the floor where I had flung it, scrubbed it, and placed it in my suit-case. Then I scrubbed the floor clean, afterward rubbing it with a soiled rag to make its appearance uniform. I washed my hands, and thought I had finally removed all traces of the...", "...at the angles by stakes driven firmly into the ground. Fancy the rage of the South-Enders the next day, when they spied our snowy citadel, with Jack Harris's red silk pocket handkerchief floating defiantly from the flag-staff. In less than an hour it was known all over town, in military circles at least, that the \"Puddle-dockers\" and the \"River-rats\" (these were the derisive sub-titles bestowed on our South-End foes) intended to attack the fort that Saturday afternoon. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> all the fighting boys of the Temple Grammar School, and as many recruits as we could muster, lay behind the walls of Fort Slatter, with three hundred compact snowballs piled up in pyramids, awaiting the approach of the enemy. The enemy was not slow in making his approach--fifty strong, headed by one Mat Ames. Our forces were under the command of General J. Harris. Before the action commenced, a meeting was arranged between the rival commanders, who drew up and signed certain...", "...I moved, the dreadful tentacles drew back and away. A last effort, and the chain was in my fingers. I jerked spasmodically. Rosy light from the lamp flashed over the room. All the quiet comfort of the place sprang into view as if to reassure me; the piano open as I had left it, the table strewn with my evening's work, each bit of furniture, each drapery or trinket undisturbed. The Thing was gone. In the hush I heard my panting breath and the tick of my watch on the stand. It was two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. As I mechanically read the hour, a cock somewhere shrilled its second call before dawn. The Horror had been true to the legendary time of apparitions. Weak and chilled, I presently made an attempt to rise. But at the movement, a wave of sickness swept through me. The room seemed to rock and swing. I had just time to recognize the grip of faintness before I fell back on the pillow. * * * * * Vivifying sweetness was in my...", "...the French ship was full of men, and seemed to have a great number of officers on board. At six o'clock in the evening, I made the signal and weighed; we worked through the second narrow, and at ten o'clock passed the west end of it: at eleven we anchored in seven fathom off Elizabeth's Island, and the French ship at the same time anchored in a bad situation, to the southward of Saint Bartholomew's Island, which convinced me that she was not acquainted with the channel. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the next morning, I weighed and sailed between Elizabeth and Bartholomew Islands, with the wind at N.W. and after steering S.S.W. five or six miles, we crossed a bank, where among the weeds we had seven fathom water. This bank lies W.S.W. five or six miles from the middle of George's Island, and it is said in some former accounts that in many places there is not three fathom water upon it; the danger here therefore is considerable, and to avoid it, it is necessary to keep near...", "...but I know it is of no use doing that. The last thing he said when I bade good-bye to him was, 'Keep up your spirits, mother'; and I try to do so.\" The old lady went on talking about her son, and Tom, listening to her kindly attempts to draw him out of his own troubles, grew interested, and by the time they reached Winchester, where she left the train, he had shaken off his first depression. It was a long journey with several changes, and he did not arrive in Liverpool until six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the evening, having been nearly twelve hours on the road. Carry's last injunction had been, \"Take a cab when you get to Liverpool, Tom, and drive straight down to the docks. Liverpool is a large place, and you might get directed wrong. I shall be more comfortable if I know that, at any rate, you will go straight on board.\" Tom had thought it an unnecessary expense, but as he saw that Carry would be more comfortable about him if he followed her advice, he promised to do...", "...river would be fordable. So they began to cuss, amiable, and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone. \"There was about 1,500 grown-up adults in Bird City that had arrived at years of indiscretion; and the majority of 'em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable.

Before they left they took care that every ember was extinguished, so that no harm could come to the place where they had made their halt. It was about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when they resumed their journey, and they moved at an easy pace, with the aim of reaching their camping-ground towards five. That would give them ample time to make their preparations for the night. Until four o'clock the march was quite uneventful, then Chippy had an adventure with a baker's cart.

To this end the President directs that the Post-Office Department and its...", "...head a check to windward, before the less consumed part had entirely left the tier; and thus the very event which had seemed to seal the doom of the cutter was in all respects ordained by the Almighty for her preservation.

The wreck drifted on shore on the north side of the island of Tenedos, where, at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, she blew up with an explosion which might be felt on the adjacent shores of Europe and of Asia; and all that remained of the Ajax were a few smoking spars, which rose to the surface of the sea.

It appears, however, certain that, contrary to orders, there had been a light in the bread-room; for when...", "...herself exactly as she would have done on board a passenger ship. There were moments when she was honestly bored. Piracy! This was an established fact. Cunningham and his men had stepped outside the pale of law in running off with the _Wanderer_.

We have got so far east, now--a hundred and fifty-five degrees of longitude from San Francisco--that my watch can not \"keep the hang\" of the time any more. It has grown discouraged, and stopped. I think it did a wise thing. The difference in time between Sebastopol and the Pacific coast is enormous. When it is six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning here, it is somewhere about week before last in California. We are excusable for getting a little tangled as to time. These distractions and distresses about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid my mind was so much affected that I never would have any appreciation of time again; but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehending when it was dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, and I am tortured with doubts and fears no...", "...Dickinson's all ready to reorganize that company, when the time comes.

The effect of the fires by the huts, perched among the rocks at the entrance to the pass, was very strange and beautiful, reminding one of the midnight fires of the Gnomes in the fairy tales. And so we rode on, hour after hour, through the night, till we well-nigh fell asleep in our saddles, and at length, about two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, we reached the waggons to find the young Boers fast asleep in our bed. We kicked them out, and, after swallowing some biscuits, tumbled in ourselves for the few hours' rest which we so sadly needed.

Such a cheer as arose from the ladies that lined the veranda! I'll bet there wasn't one who would have missed the event for a five dollar note. Hugging the Grand River (the only hugging I had done in that section) until after dark, we trailed through the sage until ten o'clock, when, discovering a fair grazing place, I ordered camp. My donkeys had just rested two days, so next day, the 28th day of August, I made them trail fast and far, in spite of the heat. It was five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> when we pitched camp near the Scott Ranch. I had observed a cow and several hens about the ranch. If I couldn't get milk, I might still obtain fresh eggs, and vice versa. Not waiting to unpack for a can, I set out for the house and knocked at the back door. \"Come in,\" called a female voice. I entered the kitchen with hat in hand and politely said, \"How to do?\" The sober-faced housewife did not pause in her duties as she welcomed me to be seated. \"I came to purchase...", "...selected in his place to take command of a party consisting of a hundred seamen and marines from the different ships of war, and to go on shore and forage for the squadron.

Having landed at Newportneuse, we began our march at eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning into Elizabeth County. Not having been brought up like some of my Highland friends in the art of levying black mail on my lowland neighbours, I could not help feeling as if I had suddenly turned into a robber when I found myself entering a farm-yard, and, without a word of explanation, quietly collecting the cattle and pigs, or sheep or poultry, and driving them off. We marched about ten miles inland as rapidly as we could, and then, facing about, swept the...", "...of the British may individually dislike us, but I'm sure the two nations are not antagonistic.

Interruptions were numerous, and although they were treated courteously, in the main, it was only after rigid questioning and a thorough examination that they were permitted to proceed. A full hour was consumed at the harbor at Ostend before they could even land. As they stepped upon the wharf a group of German soldiers met them and now Captain Carg became the spokesman of the party. The young...", "...the officers and men were elated at the prospect of at last having the opportunity of doing what they had volunteered to do--fight the enemies of their country. I did not see how I could maintain discipline, or retain the confidence of my command, if we should return to Cairo without an effort to do something. Columbus, besides being strongly fortified, contained a garrison much more numerous than the force I had with me. It would not do, therefore, to attack that point. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> on the morning of the 7th, I learned that the enemy was crossing troops from Columbus to the west bank to be dispatched, presumably, after Oglesby. I knew there was a small camp of Confederates at Belmont, immediately opposite Columbus, and I speedily resolved to push down the river, land on the Missouri side, capture Belmont, break up the camp and return. Accordingly, the pickets above Columbus were drawn in at once, and about daylight the boats moved out from shore. In an...", "...tea was really enough to take up all our attention. There was everything of country things--fresh eggs, and butter and milk of the best, and bread, and tea-cakes, and strawberry jam, and potted fish--all \"home-made,\" of course. I think Mrs. Munt and nurse were really a little frightened to see how much we ate. After tea we wanted, of course, to go out, but Liddy decided that it was too damp, and Mrs. Munt consoled us by giving us leave to go all over the house, for it was barely six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> and quite light. She took us into the front hall and showed us the dining-room, out of which opened the study, and beyond that again, what had been the school-room, and was now grandpapa's bed-room. There was nothing _very_ interesting in these rooms, though they were all quaint and old-fashioned; and through all the house there was the sort of clean, fresh, and yet _not new_ feeling--a mixture of faint old scents that cannot be got away, and wood-fires long ago burnt out, and...", "...to set you quite at ease, you know I have never seen mountains before, and they fill me and oppress me so much that I could not sleep; I must keep awake this first night, and see that they don't fall on the earth and overwhelm it.

Before ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> she reigned sole power and potentate in Ruth's little chamber. Nothing could have been better devised for giving her an interest in the invalid. The very dependence of one so helpless upon her care inclined her heart towards her.

Yes, certainly there was an improvement. There was more...", "...Lucretia, when convalescent, would also come to the farm to rest and get strong.

At the earliest moment after the vault was opened he made his way to the box that contained the Porter payment. One thing troubled him slightly. It was a thousand-dollar bill that had been taken; the money he had to replace was in hundreds and fifties. As he slipped them quietly into the box he thought it wouldn't really matter; he would transfer...", "...others that she would not speak. Perceiving this mark of sincere good-will at so critical a moment, my heart was moved, and I said to her, in a similar tone, \"And I also am prevented from speaking, however earnest my desire to open to you my mind and heart.\" I saw that this made a favourable impression on her. Tears came into her eyes, and to conceal her emotion, and the extent to which she was moved, she dismissed us, observing that it was very late; and, in fact, it was nearly three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. The Grand Duke went out first, I followed, and just as Alexander Schouvaloff was passing out after me, her Majesty called him back, and he remained with her. The Grand Duke strode on rapidly, as usual, but on this occasion I did not hurry myself to follow him. He entered his apartments, and I mine. I was beginning to undress, in order to go to bed, when I heard some one knocking at the door by which I had entered. On asking who was there, Schouvaloff replied...", "...one wanted him.\" \"Yes, yes, John, that's right, that's right,\" said the old man. \"I will go and see about having the horses got up and the wheels greased.

This much is certain: he did not frequent cafes or places of amusement. If he went out at all after dinner, it was only to pass the evening at the house of some rich client in the neighborhood. He detested the smell of tobacco, and was inclined to be devout--never failing to attend eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> mass on Sunday mornings. His housekeeper suspected him of matrimonial designs, and perhaps she was right. On the evening that the Count de Chalusse was struck with apoplexy M.

Madame Dodelin hastened to open the door, and in walked Victor Chupin, breathless from his hurried walk.

Up to eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> every bit of news ran against us. Finally, the Brooklyn _Eagle_, a supporter of the President, and then the New York _Times_, our last line of defense, gave way and conceded Hughes' election, but the unterrified Democrats at the Executive offices stood out against any admission of defeat.

She declared that, being now acquainted with the truth, she should find it very easy to defend me:--'At all events,' added she, 'considering the terms on which you and Frederick stand with each other, nobody, except an old prude or two, will think the matter worth mentioning.' I was going to protest against this ground of acquittal, when the servant came to inform his mistress aloud, that Lord Frederick had set out for Lincolnshire at five <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> that morning. This confirmation of Lady St Edmunds' conjecture entirely removed my suspicions; and convinced me, that my black domino, having executed his commission with more zeal than discernment, had utterly mistaken Lord Frederick's intentions.

Great preparations had been made for four or five days in the delightful gardens of Trianon; but the evening before, the sky became cloudy, and many toilets which had been eagerly prepared were prudently laid aside; but the next day a beautiful blue sky reassured every one, and they set out for Trianon in spite of the recollections of the storm which had dispersed the spectators at the fete of Saint Cloud. Nevertheless, at three <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a heavy shower made every one fear for a short while that the evening might end badly. \"Afternoon shower making its obeisance,\" as the proverb says; but, on the contrary, this only made the fete pleasanter, by refreshing the scorching air of August, and laying the dust which was most disagreeable. At six o'clock the sun had reappeared, and the summer of 1811 had no softer or more agreeable evening. All the outlines of the architecture of the Grand Trianon were ornamented with...", "...him to be more explicit. \"You talk in the dark,\" I said. \"Then why don't you light a lamp?\" I did as he suggested and sat down again. \"Is there anything else I can do for you?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he said, \"you're coming over to Ireland with me to-morrow.\" \"I'll see you hanged first,\" I said.

CHAPTER XXX CAUGHT--CONCLUSION About seven <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the two pursuing boats were about ten miles above Cresville. They made a short stop at a little village and coffee was prepared. While the simple breakfast was being gotten ready the chief and Detective Layton went ashore. They learned from a man who kept a boathouse that a large motor craft had gone up the river about four o'clock that morning. He said he had seen it when he came down to go out on a short fishing trip. \"Three hours ahead of us,\" said Mr. Layton. \"Well, if...", "...\"There's _real_ work waiting here.\" The First Sergeant, hanging up the receiver, went out and gathered his men. Still the storm was raging. Icy snow, blinding sheets of sharp-fanged smother, rode on the racing wind. Worse overhead, worse underfoot, would be hard to meet in years of winters. But once again men and horses, without an interval of rest, struck into the open country. Once again on the skeleton bridge they made the precarious crossing. And so, at a quarter to nine <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> at night, the detail topped Greensburg's last ice-coated hill and entered the yard of its high-perched Barracks. As the First Sergeant slung the saddle off John G.'s smoking back, Corporal Richardson, farrier of the Troop, appeared before him wearing a mien of solemn and grieved displeasure. \"It's all very well,\" said he,--\"all very well, no doubt. But eighty-six miles in twenty-four hours, in weather like this, is a good deal for any horse. And John G. is twenty-two years...", "...taking advantage of this, at once moved a force on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond. As soon as I was apprised of the advantage thus gained, to retain it I ordered two divisions of the 6th corps, General Wright commanding, that were embarking at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for City Point, to report to General Butler at Bermuda Hundred, of which General Butler was notified, and the importance of holding a position in advance of his present line urged upon him. About two <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to the line the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning. General Wright, with his two divisions, joined General Butler on the forenoon of the 17th, the latter still holding with a strong picket-line the enemy's works. But instead of putting these divisions into the enemy's works to hold them, he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear of his own line.

That end of it was very important and this was to be an especially good operation. He was thinking about Dr. Parkman on the way down;--of the man's splendid surgery.

There moved in his mind a seductive first line for the opening of this poem, and that line determined in the end the whole question of metre; for it was an inspired line, and it was in exactly the right metre. All the afternoon he sat in the shady corner of the garden over the river, dreaming over the structure of this poem. In the evening he began to work upon it; and all the evening he worked, with a feverish concentration and excitement. At about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> the moon was well up, and the rising tide was lapping and murmuring already about the wall and about the boats. And he did not forget Muriel; he did not forget his promise. He knew that she was waiting for him, silent on the wall. He knew that he was bound in honour, or in dishonour, to go to her. But he did not go. He had done with that. And he had better things to do tonight. So Muriel leaned lonely over the wall, looking down the river past the fig-tree and the barges,...", "...Valley City continued steaming down the river, and anchored off Williamston at 12 m. At 1 p.m. she weighed anchor and steamed to off Jamesville, where she arrived at 5 p.m., the remainder of the fleet following close in our rear. On Saturday, December 24, the Valley City proceeded two miles up the river to tug the Chicopee off, which had got transversely across the river, preventing the fleet behind her from descending. The Valley City returned and anchored off Jamesville at 10 <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> a.m. The fleet is all now anchored off Jamesville, and is engaged in destroying the wreck of the Otsego. During this expedition I never had my clothes or shoes off. On Thursday, December 29, at 11-1/2 o'clock a.m. the Valley City weighed anchor and proceeded to Plymouth, where we arrived at 12-1/2 p.m. [Published in the New York Herald of January 9, 1865.] NEWBERN.

Suppose you should begin and run from the top of the stairs to the bottom, as fast and as loud as you could, and wake up the whole family. And as the vision of terrified night-gowns rises before your mental vision, you commence grinning noiselessly like a maniac; then laughing hysterically; then crying outright; and the next thing you know it is eight <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning, and coffee and rolls and beefsteak are awaiting your advent. And as to musquitoes. Ah! you too have suffered. You have lain, hour after hour, listening to that never-ceasing war-song, till you were as nervous as a hump-backed cat face to face with Jowler in a corner. You have \"turned over;\" you have lain on your side, lain on your back, lain on your face, spite of your prominent nose. You have doubled your fists up under your arm-pits, and twisted your feet...", "...babbled a good deal of old days, for which indeed Isla was thankful, since it kept him from asking questions about the present ones. She had dreaded what might happen on the night of the home-coming, but she now clearly saw that her father was less and less likely to disturb himself about any untoward happenings. He accepted everything--a circumstance which certainly considerably relieved the strain. \"He looks jolly bad, poor old chap,\" said Malcolm, when Isla came down about ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> from seeing him safely in bed. \"He can't last long. It was a pity that you didn't let him see it out at Achree.\" \"He has not got any worse in the last six months that I can see. Of course the excitement to-night wore him out. He will be brighter in the morning.\" \"I still think it was a beastly shame to bring him up here. There isn't even decent comfort. This is the only room worth mentioning.\" \"Well, he has it. He is quite comfortable,\" said Isla, stoutly. \"We...", "...fatigue after a long day's march--were allowed to retire to their beds. They were shown into a large room, where a good soft couch had been prepared for each of them. Their arduous journeying seemed nearly over; for they had reached a place where people slept with their faces screened from the faint light of the stars, and without depending on the nature of the earth beneath them for the quality of their couch. CHAPTER SIXTY FOUR. \"STRAYED OR STOLEN.\" It was not until ten <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> next morning that Hans awoke and then aroused his companions. \"We should be ashamed of ourselves,\" exclaimed Willem, as he hastily commenced making his toilet. \"We have swallowed too much smoke and overslept ourselves!\" \"No,\" answered Hans, who was always anxious to prove himself the philosopher of the company. \"We should rather feel pride in the circumstance that the small quantity we drank has produced so great an effect. It is proof that we have not been in the habit...", "...coast. The inner apartment is a plain cell, entered from the supposed oratory of the Greek saint.

The Monks used to pray heartily, or rather say their prayers no less than seven times in the twenty-four hours. We will give their names:-- 1st.--Nocturnal, at cock-crowing, or two o'clock in the morning. 2nd.--Matins, at six <span class=\"clocktext\">o'clock</span> in the morning. 3rd.--Tierce, at nine o'clock in the morning. 4th.--Sext, at twelve o'clock at noon. 5th.--None, at three o'clock in the afternoon. 6th.--Vespers, at six o'clock in the afternoon. 7th.--Compline, soon after seven.
