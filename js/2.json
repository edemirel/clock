A phenomenon must follow a certain law, because we see no reason why it should deviate from that law in one way rather than in another.

Take, for example, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the most elementary of all laws, the law of inertia and the first law of motion. A body at rest can not, it is affirmed, begin to move unless acted upon by some external force; because, if it did, it must either move up or down, forward or backward, and so forth; but if no outward force acts upon it, there can be _no reason_ for its moving up rather than down, or down rather than up, etc., _ergo_, it will not move at all.

It is also manifest that if the convergence were strongly pronounced and the confluence complete, the indentation at the convergent end would tend to be quite obliterated.

They had both--but the younger brother, John, more decidedly than Edward--passed into the opposite camp.

The teacher who seeks to impose his views raises antagonists, and not disciples. The...", "...How long will it take to tire them out?\" \"That I cannot tell.

But the king and his relatives were tired to death; and their feet swelled up to the size of an elephant's, and they became as full of thorns as the back of a porcupine.

About a pint was usually taken, when <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three would mess together upon this reviving, but scanty and not very palatable dish. But this mode of subsistence could not be long depended on, as the poor mules could ill afford to lose blood in their famishing state; nor could the men afford to lose their mules where there was a chance of life: therefore hungry as they were, the men were cautious in this matter; and it generally caused a quarrel when a man's mule was selected for bleeding by the others.

But after this effort, appalled at having two women, two children, and <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> maids on his hands, he was incapable of the struggle to maintain a family by his pen when he had failed to maintain even himself.

If, then, these two hundred francs, instead of being subtracted from the gross product to be saved and capitalized, are consumed, there is an annual deficit of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hundred francs in the family assets; so that at the end of forty years these good people, without suspecting it, will have eaten up their property and become bankrupt!

He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with a high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue eyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips. He was a man of few words, rather slow to action and of deep thought.

We come across another detailed account when Queen Mary went in triumph through London the day before her coronation. At Fenchurch the Genoese had dressed up a lovely boy as a girl, who was carried before the Queen and greeted her.

In front of the Steelyard they had placed <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> casks of wine, from which they poured drink to all who passed. This liberality cost them a thousand pounds, and heavy payments to cover such expenses are not infrequent in their account books.

When a single emery-wheel is used there is evidently twice the amount of wear to take a given amount of metal off (per traverse) that there is when <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> wheels are used, and furthermore the reduction of every wheel diameter per traverse is evidently twice as great with one wheel as it is with two. From some experiments made by Messrs. Morton Poole, it was found that using a pair of 10-inch emery-wheels it would take 40,000 wheel traverses along an average sized calender roll, to reduce its diameter an inch, hence the amount of error due to the reduction of the emery-wheel diameters, per traverse, may be stated as 1/40000 of an inch...", "...Besides which, his weakness makes him irritable, and his anger has more than once caused her unmerited pain.

Of course, Jack was always handsome. \"I wonder how Bess feels,\" remarked Daisy with scornfully curled lip. \"She thinks a lot of Jack,\" replied Maud, as both bowed to the occupants of the runabout. \"Where do you suppose they are going?\" went on Daisy. \"Oh, probably to see about having the old car fixed up.

For besides the elementary concept of continuity which both contain, time has the further character of being one-seried or one-dimensional, of not admitting of the possibility of return to a past point of time (absence of double points) and of absolute onesidedness, that is, of the fundamental difference between before and after. This last quality is the very one not found in the space concept, which is in every...", "...down upon him the good man's displeasure. \"Not at all dismayed at this, he almost immediately left his father's shop, and set up business for himself in the same neighbourhood, where he continued for two or three years, living, as it was supposed, upon the produce of his matrimonial connexion.

The total number of Saints represented were about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> thousand, which, with the exception of the branches in Preston, Bedford and Cumberland, were principally raised up by my own labors, as I spent my time in the branches, except on Sundays, when I preached in Preston. The branch in Preston numbered about four hundred, that in Bedford forty, and the branch in Cumberland sixty.\" All this was the work of only eight months. Two thousand had been baptized and enough branches organized to form the base work of three or four conferences,...", "...dame's butter and eggs. It is time to breakfast.\" We may suppose that Walter's simple meal was soon over; and growing impatient and restless to commence his inquiries, he descended from his solitary apartment to the little back-room behind the bar, in which he had, on the night before, seen mine host and his better-half at supper. It was a sung, small, wainscoated room; fishing-rods were neatly arranged against the wall, which was also decorated by a portrait of the landlord himself, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> old Dutch pictures of fruit and game, a long, quaint- fashioned fowling-piece, and, opposite the fireplace, a noble stag's head and antlers. On the window-seat lay the Izaak Walton to which the old man had referred; the Family Bible, with its green baize cover, and the frequent marks peeping out from its venerable pages; and, close nestling to it, recalling that beautiful sentence, \"suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,\" several of those little volumes...", "...this Savage Island. After leaving this place, the _Resolution_ steered westward, or west-south-west, until a string of islands was seen ahead, which proved to be those of the Tonga group. A canoe came off. At first the inhabitants appeared to be friendly, but various thefts were committed. Mr Clark's gun was snatched out of his hand, and another savage seized a fowling-piece belonging to the surgeon, who was out shooting. The marines were therefore landed, and took possession of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> large double sailing canoes; but the chiefs restored the articles, and brought on board a man who had been slightly wounded by small shot, stretched on a board as if dead. They seemed to think the captain wanted him. On examination, he proved to be very slightly hurt, and his wounds were dressed. After leaving the Friendly Islands, the Australis del Esperito Santo of Quiros was reached. Sailing round it, Cook proved it to be an island.

Stanley and Graham were both vehemently opposed to any Parliamentary appropriation of the surplus revenues of the Irish Church, but not exactly on the same grounds. Stanley denies the right of Parliament to interfere at all; that is, he asserts that Parliament has no more right to deal with the revenues of the Church than it would have to deal with his estate. Graham does not deny the right, but contends that it is not expedient, that the connexion between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> countries is mainly held together by the Protestant Church, and that any meddling with the Establishment will inevitably lead to its downfall. He stands upon religious grounds. I confess myself to be lost in astonishment at the views they take on this subject; that after swallowing the camel of the Reform Bill, they should strain at the gnats which were perched upon the camel's back, that they should not have perceived from the first that such reforms as these must inevitably be...", "...Pacini. The printer of the 1498 edition is not known; it cannot have been Mischomini, who seems to have brought his brilliant career to a close about 1495. The foregoing notice of his illustrated books is by no means exhaustive. Passing mention has been made in the chapter on Venice of one other important one, the undated _Meditatione_, attributed to S. Bonaventura, with cuts of peculiar interest, from the opportunity they afford of comparing the different styles in vogue in the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> cities. Three other Florentine books issued during the fifteenth century remain to be mentioned, none of which I have seen. The first of these, an undated edition of Domenico Capranica's _Arte di bene Morire_ (not to be confounded with Savonarola's), published by Morgiani and Johann Petri about 1495, contains twelve large cuts and twenty-two small ones. The larger cuts are interesting, because ten of them are based on those found in the old block books of the _Ars Moriendi_, the...", "...the train gates. Passengers started coming through the gate and among the first was the bulky form of Condon Adams. Bob called to him and Adams turned aside. \"How's Tully?\" asked Bob, who was really concerned over the condition of the young federal agent. Condon Adams' face lighted up, for he was genuinely fond of his nephew and Bob's inquiry touched a soft spot. \"Getting along fine,\" he said. \"Oh, he's pretty sore and all that, but he'll be able to continue on his assignment in <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three more days.\" \"It was a tough break,\" said Bob and Adams nodded. \"What's been going on?\" he asked. \"Plenty,\" replied Bob. \"My uncle was kidnaped earlier this evening.\" Adams dropped his bag and whirled to Bob. \"What's that?\" he demanded, as though unable to believe the words. \"My uncle disappeared this evening and everything points to a kidnaping by this gang of smugglers we're after,\" explained Bob. Condon Adams threw back his head and laughed, but it was a...", "...Amsterdam.\" Grave and phlegmatic by nature, the King was always master of his feelings, a sign, this, of the noble-minded. He shut himself up in his apartment, so as to be quite alone, and hastily perused the libellous pamphlet. According to the author of it, King Louis XIII., being weak and languid, and sapped moreover by secret poison, had not been able to beget any heirs. The Queen, who secretly was Mazarin's mistress, had had twins by the Abbe, only the prettier of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> being declared legitimate. The other twin had been entrusted to obscure teachers, who, when it was time, would give him up. The princess, so the writer added, stung by qualms of conscience, had insisted upon having her guilty intimacy purified by the sacrament of marriage, to which the prime minister agreed. Then, mentioning the names of such and such persons as witnesses, the book stated that \"this marriage was solemnised on a night in February, 1643, by Cardinal de...", "...be sure it is murder that has happened here.\" \"Not murder!\" cried Jonathan, in a shrill and panting voice. \"Not murder! It was all an accident, and I am as innocent as a baby.\" The new-comer looked at him and then at the two figures upon the floor, and then back at him again with eyes at once quizzical and cunning. Then his face broke into a grin that might hardly be called of drollery. \"Accident!\" quoth he. \"By the blood! d'ye see 'tis a strange accident, indeed, that lays <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men by the heels and lets the third go without a scratch!\" Delivering himself thus, he came forward into the room, and, taking the last victim of Jonathan's adventure by the arm, with as little compunction as he would have handled a sack of grain he dragged the limp and helpless figure from where it lay to the floor beside the first victim. Then, lifting the lighted candle, he bent over the two prostrate bodies, holding the illumination close to the lineaments first of one and...", "...and, feeling my way, reach the door, and tell the advocate that I cannot open it, and that he must get the key. The two sisters are behind me. I extend my hand; but I am abruptly repulsed, and judge that I have addressed myself to the wrong quarter; I go to the other side, and there I am better received. But the husband returns, the noise of the key in the lock announces that the door is going to be opened, and we return to our respective beds. The advocate hurries to the bed of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> frightened ladies, thinking of relieving their anxiety, but, when he sees them buried in their broken-down bedstead, he bursts into a loud laugh. He tells me to come and have a look at them, but I am very modest, and decline the invitation. He then tells us that the alarm has been caused by a German detachment attacking suddenly the Spanish troops in the city, and that the Spaniards are running away. In a quarter of an hour the noise has ceased, and quiet is entirely...", "...fire out into the bush where her pony was tied. Her feet seemed determined not to move and she wanted so much to lie down and sleep. But she kept on till she had led the pony away from the group. Then she mounted and started on her ride. But it was no use. She could not stay awake. Now what was she to do? They were on the direct road to the valley. For a moment she hesitated. Then quickly she tore her dress in strips. Taking a sharp stone, she cut her arm and with the blood she made <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> pictures on a piece of wood--the one showed five Indians asleep--the other showed an Indian girl by the road. Taking the strips from her dress, she fastened the bit of wood to the saddle. She took from her arm the circle of brass which would tell her father from whom the message had come, and fastened it to the saddle. Then a cut of the whip across the legs sent the pony flying down the path. After he had gone, the girl sat in a dazed way near the path. She was so tired.

I have always held in respect most of the customs and habits of the Orientals, many of which, to the generality of Europeans, appear so ridiculous and disgusting, because I have ever conceived them to be copies of ancient originals. For, who can think the custom of eating with one's fingers disgusting, as now done in the East, when <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or more put their hands into the same mess, and at the same time read that part of our sacred history which records, 'He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish,' etc.? I must own, every time that, dining with my Eastern friends, I performed this very natural operation (although, at the same time, let it be understood that I have a great respect for knives and forks), I could not help feeling myself to be a living illustration of an ancient custom, and a proof of the authenticity...", "...feet thick, stood between the stagnant air and the large breathings of the sea. The atmosphere was dense, motionless, inert with salt vapours. The prodigious circumvallation of cliff crushed vitality out of the air. There was a breathless whisper of water against the sea line of the ramparts, and deep in the gorge of the cave a smothered snore, like the hushed breathing of some stupendous monster. The yawl glided slowly up between the closing walls of the Red Gap. No one spoke. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boatmen were indifferent to the place. O'Brien and Paulton were lost in thoughts of diverse kinds, awakened by the spectacle of Mrs. Davenport on the Black Rock. None of the men was paying attention to the Gap. At last a sudden darkness fell upon the boat. O'Brien and Paulton looked up. The sky was no longer overhead. A gloom of purple brown was above them. The light of day stood like a lofty, luminous pillar in their wake. They had entered the Red Cave. The boatmen ceased...", "...to the Old South Meeting-House with this message, the candles were lighted and the house still crowded with people. When the governor's message was read a prodigious shout was raised, and soon afterward the moderator declared the meeting dissolved. This caused another general shout, outdoors and in, and what with the noise of breaking up the meeting, one might have thought that the inhabitants of the infernal regions had been let loose. That night there mustered upon Fort Hill about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hundred strange figures, SAID TO BE INDIANS FROM NARRAGANSETT. They were clothed in blankets, with heads muffled, and had copper-colored countenances. Each was armed with a hatchet or axe, and a pair of pistols. They spoke a strange, unintelligible jargon.

And where such Malt-liquors are kept in Butts, more time is required to ripen, meliorate and fine them, than those kept in Hogsheads, because the greater quantity must have the longer time; so also a greater quantity will preserve itself better than a lesser one, and on this account the Butt and Hogshead are the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> best sized Casks of all others; but all under a Hogshead hold rather too small a quantity to keep their Bodies. The Butt is certainly a most noble Cask for this use, as being generally set upright, whereby it maintains a large Cover of Yeast, that greatly contributes to the keeping in the Spirits of the Beer, admits of a most convenient broaching in the middle and its lower part, and by its broad level Bottom, gives a better lodgment to the fining and preserving Ingredients, than...", "...to him during the previous few months. In the Seventh Month 1824, Thomas Shillitoe and Elizabeth H. Walker came to Pyrmont, and to the latter J.Y. gave his assistance in various religious engagements. After her departure he again visited Minden, with the neighboring villages of Eidinghausen and Hille. His visit to the last-named place (1 mo. 13, 1825) was marked by a singular circumstance.

Orestes escapes; but returns later, at the instigation of Apollo, and kills his mother to avenge his father. Thereupon, in punishment for his crime, he is persecuted by the Furies. Now the point which Euripides seizes here is the conduct of Apollo. Either it was right for Orestes to kill his mother, or it was wrong. If wrong, why did Apollo command it? If right, why was Orestes punished? Or are there, as Aeschylus would have it, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> \"rights\", one of Apollo, the other of the Furies? If so, what becomes of that unity of the divine law after which every religious nature seeks? \"Phoebus,\" cries the Orestes of Euripides, \"prophet though he be, deceived me.

The recall of Monroe is connected with circumstances so important to the interests of France and the United States, that we must be careful not to confound it with the recall of an ordinary individual. The Washington faction had affected to spread it abroad that James Monroe was the cause of rupture between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Republics. This accusation is a perfidious and calumnious one; since the main point in this affair is not so much the recall of a worthy, enlightened and republican minister, as the ingratitude and clandestine manoeuvering of the government of Washington, who caused the misunderstanding by signing a treaty injurious to the French Republic. James Monroe, in his letters, does not deny the right of government to withdraw its confidence from any one of its delegates,...", "...together as they sit before their cafes, or in groups outside some friendly door.

Even her own consumption, supposed to be nine millions, under the administration of the monopoly to which it is farmed, enters little, as an article of exchange, into the commerce of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> nations. When this article was first put into Farm, perhaps it did not injure the commercial interests of the kingdom; because nothing but British manufactures were then allowed to be given in return for American tobaccos.

In answer, I learnt De Sylva had obtained leave of absence about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> months before; but though it had been some time expired, he was not yet returned: so that the charge of desertion was now added to those others, which I doubted not induced him to keep himself concealed.

Chemicals used for horticultural purposes are of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> distinct kinds--those for the control of animal pests and those for the control of diseases. The commercial horticulturist, however, finds it necessary to apply both in the one spray or dust for the dual purpose of controlling both pests and diseases.

A wiped joint is made by solder being poured on <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ends of the two pipes, the solder being worked about the joint, shaped into an oval lump, and wiped around with a cloth, giving the joint a bulbous form. All connections between _Lead Pipes_ and _Iron Pipes_ are made by means of brass ferrules. Lead cannot be soldered to iron, so a brass fitting or ferrule is used; it is jointed to the lead pipe by a wiped joint, and to the iron pipe by an ordinary lead-calked joint. _Putty_, _Cement_, and _Slip_ joints should not be tolerated...", "...tribunals of the colony; but retribution overtook him by another and a speedier course.

Having said this, he went off, little dreaming of the fate that awaited him. At the time appointed I went with a horse and sledge to the wood, but was much surprised to find that my master was not at the spot where he said he would be;--a surprise which was not a little increased by perceiving, from two or three felled sticks that lay around, that he had been there, but had done...", "...Just read Theodore Roosevelt's \"Rise of New York.\" [Great laughter.] Now I am going to tell you this story because you must go up to Ulster County and up to Dutchess and Albany Counties, and you must tell every Yankee you meet the truth about this, and not let him talk any more about the English having subjugated the Dutch.

This view, as may be supposed, was not nearly so interesting as those we had seen before. We hunted out all the houses on the shore, which were very few: there was the village of Luss, the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> gentlemen's houses, our favourite cottages, and here and there a hut; but I do not recollect any comfortable-looking farm-houses, and on the opposite shore not a single dwelling.

It consisted of two rooms, a kitchen and a bedroom, the sole furniture of the latter consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> wooden bedsteads. There was no food, except a half lamb, which Stephan had brought on the pack-horse, and its condition was unpleasant from its many hours' exposure to the sun and attendant flies.

When we examine them, however, they seem very insignificant. Take, as an example, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three, on which Judge Holmes relies, and which he thinks very striking. Holmes says (page 48) that Bacon quotes Aristotle, who said that \"young men were no fit hearers of moral philosophy,\" and Shakespeare says (\"Troilus and Cressida\"):-- \"Unlike young men whom Aristotle thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy.\" But since Bacon's remark was published in 1605, and \"Troilus and Cressida\" did not appear until 1609, Shakespeare might have seen it there, and introduced...", "...and W[)a][']hal[)a]['], while their respective mythologic colors are Red, Blue, Black, and White.

The two consuls settled by lot or by agreement which province of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> they should have. As the consuls were chosen before the two consular provinces were determined by the senate, it was in the power of the senate to give what provinces they pleased to the consuls, and so make the appointment either a favour or not.

In another minute the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boys were making good use of their knowledge of first aid, which they had learned as Boy Scouts. Working as they had never worked for merit badges, they laid Jud on the raft face down, with his arms above his head and his face turned a little to one side.

During the period of oral tradition many teachings of the Lord were doubtless kept clearly and accurately in memory after the historic situations which led to their first utterance were quite forgotten. 43. This fact helps to explain another perplexity in our gospel narratives. A comparison of the two accounts of the cure of the centurion's servant reveals differences of detail most perplexing, if we ask for minute agreement in records of the same events. When we see that of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> accounts evidently reporting the same incident, one can say that the centurion himself sought Jesus and asked the cure of his servant (Matt. viii. 5, 8), while the other makes him declare himself unworthy to come in person to the Lord (Luke vii. 7), the question arises whether other accounts, similar in the main but differing in detail, should not be identified as independent records of one event.

But the law of a prince (if we should, without trial and examination, take it for our rule) cannot be such a stable and sure rule. For put the case that a prince enjoin <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> things which sometimes fall out to be incompatible and cannot stand together, in that case his law cannot direct our practice, nor resolve us what to do; whereas God hath so provided for us, that the case can never occur wherein we may not be resolved what to do if we observe the rule which he hath appointed us to walk by. 7.

Between these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> lakes is the watershed for this part of the continent. An old barn is pointed out, five miles from Lake Chautauqua, whereof it is said that the rain falling on one side of its roof runs into Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence, while the drops on the other side through a pebbly brook find their way by Lake Chautauqua into the Mississippi.

This is the only seal that is beyond imitation. All else can be mimicked. We have seen how ghastly one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> persons appeared when they attempted to look like Lincoln. The imitation took on the appearance of pale, dull putty. The notion that Lincoln's personality could be imitated with success was quite in keeping with that other notion that the great President was, in spite of everything, just one of the common people.

An adequate speed for the mails leaves no available space for cargo. The ship may carry <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three hundred tons of freight; but it pays perhaps but little more than the handling and the extra coal necessary to transport its extra weight. As a general thing, it may be safely said that when a vessel is well adapted to the mails and passengers she is filled with her own power, that is, with heavy engines, large boilers, and a large quantity of fuel, as also with her provisions and baggage.

He thought of that now, and, suddenly sighing, came away from the window. He was really worried about Horatia, in spite of the fact that she looked distinctly better since her return three months ago. But she seemed sometimes as if she would never recover from her sadness. She had lost her habit of teasing him; she was, for her, rather...", "...in these peculiarly limited shapes. My thesis now is this: that, when we think of the law that thought is a function of the brain, we are not required to think of productive function only; _we are entitled also to consider permissive or transmissive function_. And this the ordinary psychophysiologist leaves out of account.[28] The question of the validity of an analogy in reasoning is always, as here, whether the similarity on which the reasoning rests really runs between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> cases in hand, or is not merely a general resemblance expressed by some phrase or word which seems to mean more than it does. In other words, when you are testing an analogy, whether your own or an opponent's, make sure that the similarity is real for the present case. A picturesque figure of speech may add life to an argument, but it may also cover a gap in the reasoning. 36. Reasoning by Classification or Generalization.

At that time, like all the farm servants' dwellings in the district, it consisted of a single room with an earthen floor, an open unlined roof of red tiles, and rafters running across and resting on the wall at each side. There was a fireplace at one end and a window, and then a door at right angles to the fireplace. When the furniture came to be put in, the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> box-beds with their sliding panels were set up facing the fireplace; they touched the back wall at one end, and left a small space free opposite to the door at the other. The beds came almost, if not quite, up to the level of the rafters, and screened off behind them perhaps a third of the entire space, which was used as a lumber closet or store. Above the rafters, well furnished with _cleeks_ for the family stock of hams, there was spread, in lieu of a ceiling, a large sheet of...", "...get out of that hateful, back-aching breaker,\" he gave a funny little twirl of his body around his crutch, which was his way of expressing great joy. Derrick shared this joy equally with Paul, and to see them one would have supposed they had just come into fortunes at least. To a stranger such rejoicings over an offer of monotonous work down in the blackness of a coal mine would have seemed absurd, but if he had ever been a breaker boy he could have fully sympathized with them. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boys were standing beside the check-board, near the mouth of the slope, and after their rejoicings had somewhat subsided Derrick said, \"Let's see who's sent up the most to-day.\" The check-board was something like the small black-board that hangs behind the teacher's desk in a school-room. It was provided with several rows of pegs, on which hung a number of wooden tags. Each of these tags, or checks, had cut into it the initials or private mark of the miner to whom it belonged....", "...gone back, but her son Edward longed to strike a blow for his inheritance, and they had friends in Wales whom they hope to meet. So they made their way into Gloucestershire; but there King Edward, with both his brothers, came down upon them at Tewkesbury, and there their army was routed, and the young prince taken and killed--some say by the king himself and his brothers. Poor broken hearted Queen Margaret was made prisoner too, and carried to the Tower, where she arrived a day or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> after the meek and crazed captive, Henry VI., had been slain, that there might be no more risings in his name. And so ended the long war of York and Lancaster --though not in peace or joy to the savage, faithless family who had conquered.

He actually set out to conquer France, and then let himself be...", "...liked. BROWNED FLOUR.--Sift some fine flour, spread it on a large dish, or clean tin-pan. Place it before the fire, so as to brown but not to scorch or burn. It will color first at the edges; therefore watch it, and keep it evenly mixed with the white flour from the centre. When all is nicely browned, set it to cool, and then put it away for use in a large clean bottle or jar, well corked.

With the view of terminating these differences the king in 1827 entered into a _concordat_ with the pope, and an agreement was reached with regard to nominations to bishoprics, clerical education and other questions, which should have satisfied all reasonable men. But in 1828 the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> extreme parties, the Catholic Ultramontanes and the revolutionary Liberals, in their common hatred to the Dutch regime, formed an alliance, the _union_, for the overthrow of the government.

He was now fifty years of age, unaccustomed to public speaking, and burdened with a sense of unfitness for the work before him. But from the first his labors were blessed in a remarkable manner to the salvation of souls. His first lecture was followed by a religious awakening in which thirteen entire families, with the exception of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> persons, were converted. He was immediately urged to speak in other places, and in nearly every place his labor resulted in a revival of the work of God. Sinners were converted, Christians were roused to greater consecration, and deists and infidels were led to acknowledge the truth of the Bible and the Christian religion. The testimony of those among whom he labored was, \"A class of minds are reached by him not within the influence of other men.\"(552) His preaching was calculated...", "...the New Lancaster road.

Why, for example, should a given melody in thirds on <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> bassoons denote a ring? and why should it bear a thematic kinship to another melody denoting Walhall? The association is purely conventional and serves no purpose, for the material object, a ring, is fully expressed in the word; there is nothing more to be said about it than that it is just a ring, and we do not want the bassoons to repeat or confirm what is quite intelligible without them.

It was only at the solicitation of another commander that the rounds had been set, and the sentinels placed at the top of the mountain.

She murmured something about Owen going out as he liked. 'He came to me before breakfast; besides, he is a boy. What made you go out in that strange manner?' There was no answer, but Honor had learnt by experience that to insist was apt to end in obtaining nothing but a collision of wills, and she merely put out the Prayer Books for the morning's reading of the Psalms.

A triumphant shout from Felix roused me. The waves had rolled back, broken and shattered, and we raised cheer after cheer as the baffled horsemen slowly climbed the hill.

The guns, dragged from the marsh on to firm ground, opened fire against the breastworks, the infantry marched steadily forward, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> troops of horse worked round to the right, seeking a favourable place for attack.

Between 1801 and 1812 he devoted his attention greatly to the study of Optics; and the results were published in a \"Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments,\" in 1813. In 1815 he received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society for one of his discoveries in optical science; and soon after was admitted a Fellow of that body. In 1816, the Institute of France adjudged to him half of the physical prize of 3000 francs, awarded for <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the most important discoveries made in Europe, in any branch of science, during the two preceding years; and in 1819, Dr. Brewster received from the Royal Society the Rumford gold and silver medals, for his discoveries on the Polarization of Light.

One was very definitely garbed in uniform, but because of the position of the sinking sun, and the rays of light it cast off, it was impossible to tell what kind of a uniform at the distance. Then the other, the one obviously garbed in civilian clothes, turned slightly and the sunlight danced off a gun he held in his right hand.

Another plan, which might be adopted by the Australians to produce something better than their \"dampers\", is to make a good fire on a level piece of ground, and, when the ground is thoroughly heated, place the dough in a small, short-handled frying-pan, or simply on the hot ashes; invert any sort of metal pot over it, draw the ashes around, and then make a small fire on the top.

It was vouched for not only by Vladimir Franzovitch and other Russians whom we met in Odessa, but by Englishmen who were living in the city at the time, and are now back in England. Moreover, it is perpetuated in a local song similar to those of the French Revolution. The Bolsheviki who first occupied Odessa, in the early spring of 1918, made their headquarters on the cruiser _Almaz_. Their first batch of arrests comprised about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hundred officers, with a few officials and other civilians. These were taken to the _Almaz_, and lined up on the deck.

No less than the elective system it is opposed to the methods of restriction thus far described. These latter methods attempt to limit election by the ballast of an alien principle lodged beneath it or by its side.

The source of their practical trouble lies here: the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> principles, election and prescription, are nowhere united; they remain sundered and at war, unserviceable for each other's defects. The group system intertwines them. It permits choice in everything, but at the same time prescribes everything.

Almost every town of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three thousand inhabitants has one. It must not be forgotten, however, that Benjamin Franklin conceived and reduced the idea to practice. The following are some of the questions discussed by members of the Junto: \"Is sound an entity or body? \"How may the phenomenon of vapors be explained? \"Is self-interest the rudder that steers mankind, the universal monarch to whom all are tributaries? \"Which is the best form of government, and what was that form which first...", "...LEG.--When, for taming purposes, a horse's leg is strapped up for any length of time, it becomes benumbed, and ought, when let down, to be rubbed vigorously before the animal is allowed to walk upon it If this is not done he will probably fall.

Mi[=a]ni (February 17, 1843) was the most glorious day in his life. With 2,400 troops, of whom barely 500 were Europeans, he attacked an army variously estimated between 20,000 and 40,000. Drawn up in a position, which they had themselves chosen, on the raised bank of a dry river bed, the Baluch[=i] seemed to have every advantage on their side.

Daylight finds them in all sorts of absurd places, in buildings, in open marshes, perched on telephone wires in a great city, or even on board of coasting vessels.

As they approached the spot they heard several loud snorts, and making their way along as quietly as possible they saw <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the great beasts standing in the stream. At this point it widened a good deal and was shallow and quite near the bank. The Fans had been told to stay behind directly the snorting was heard, and Mr. Goodenough and Frank, rifle in hand, crept forward, with the Houssas as still and noiseless as cats close behind them.

No pains had been spared, no necessary expenditure of money had been grudged; but, so far, no results of the slightest value had been obtained.

Yet, on account of the minuteness of the majority of their stars, neither of these constellations makes by any means as brilliant a display as does Orion, to which Argelander assigns only one hundred and fifteen naked-eye stars, and Heis one hundred and thirty-six.

Even a century ago, India was densely populated, yet in the intervening hundred years the population has increased between <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> and three fold.[260] Of course, factors like improved agriculture, irrigation, railways, and the introduction of modern industry enable India to support a much larger population than it could have done at the time of the British Conquest. Nevertheless, the evidence is clear that excessive multiplication has taken place. Nearly all qualified students of the problem concur on this point. Forty years ago the Duke of Argyll stated: \"Where there is no store, no accumulation, no wealth;...", "...When he got to Lisle Street, every one had arrived except Molyneux himself. Mr. Lind was gravely polite to him. Of course no mention could then be made about private affairs; the talk going on was all about the East, and how certain populations were faring. Presently the pink-faced farmer-agitator was ushered in, looking a little bit alarmed. But this frightened look speedily disappeared, and gave place to one of mild astonishment, as he appeared to recognize the faces of one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of those in the room. The business of the evening, so far as the brief formalities were concerned, was speedily got over, and five of the members of the small assembly immediately left. \"Now, Mr. Molyneux,\" said Ferdinand Lind, pleasantly, \"Mr. Brand and I have some small private matters to talk over: will you excuse us if we leave you for a few minutes? Here are some articles of our association which you may look over in the mean time. May I trouble you to follow me, Mr....", "...job was finished, 'you are an excellent surgeon, so you are.

Ah, ha! my boy, stick to it like a leech; I'll relieve you day after to-morrow.' \"By this means I was kept away from Lottie <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> days and nights, much against my wish; but I stood to my post until I was relieved on the third morning by Doctor Dodson. I hurried to Mr. Rockland's residence and met his wife at the door. \"'How is Lottie?' I hurriedly inquired, as I entered the house. \"'Improving rapidly, though I don't think she is quite as prudent as she ought to be.' \"'Can I see her now?' \"'No, Edward, she is asleep, I believe; but come in to breakfast, and then you can see her.' \"I obeyed...", "...of Western Europe against the Ottomans by almost any sacrifice. Accordingly, application was made to Pope Eugenius IV, and by him the representatives of the Eastern Church were invited to attend the council which was summoned to meet at Ferrara in 1438. The Emperor, John Palaeologus and the Greek patriarch Joseph proceeded thither. The Emperor, however, on his return home, soon discovered that his pilgrimage to the West had been lost labor. Pope Eugenius, indeed, provided him with <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> galleys and a guard of three hundred men, equipped at his own expense, but the hoped-for succors from Western Europe did not arrive. His own subjects were completely alienated by the betrayal of their cherished faith; the clergy who favored the union were regarded as traitors. John Palaeologus himself did not survive to see the final catastrophe; but Constantinople was captured by the Turks, and the Empire of the East ceased to exist.

His character and his personal pride, the dignity of opinion and office, his respect for constitutional law, were all at stake. Shallow observers considered the struggle now taking place as a personal one. Lovers of personal government chose to look upon the Advocate's party as a faction inspired with an envious resolve to clip the wings of the Stadholder, who was at last flying above their heads. There could be no doubt of the bitter animosity between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men. There could be no doubt that jealousy was playing the part which that master passion will ever play in all the affairs of life. But there could be no doubt either that a difference of principle as wide as the world separated the two antagonists. Even so keen an observer as Dudley Carleton, while admitting the man's intellectual power and unequalled services, could see nothing in the Advocate's present course but prejudice, obstinacy, and the insanity of pride. \"He doth no...", "...Lamorak, the man of oak and iron, Had with him now, as a care-laden guest, Sir Bedivere, a man whom Arthur loved As he had loved no man save Lancelot. Like one whose late-flown shaft of argument Had glanced and fallen afield innocuously, He turned upon his host a sudden eye That met from Lamorak's an even shaft Of native and unused authority; And each man held the other till at length Each turned away, shutting his heavy jaws Again together, prisoning thus <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> tongues That might forget and might not be forgiven. Then Bedivere, to find a plain way out, Said, \"Lamorak, let us drink to some one here, And end this dryness.

Hard pressed, he had climbed a small oak and crouched out on a swaying limb. We could see that he was heaving badly, and was a very sick animal. His gaze was fixed on the howling dogs. Young and I ran in close and shot boldly at his swaying body. Our arrows slipped through him like magic. One was arrested in its course as it buried itself in his shoulder. Savagely he snapped it in <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> with his teeth, when another driven by Young with terrific force struck him above the eye. He weakened his hold, slipped backward, dropped from the bending limb and rolled over and over down the ravine. The dogs were on him in a rush, and wooled him with a vengeance. But he was dead by the time he reached the creek bottom. We clambered down, looked him over with awe, then Young and I shook hands across the body of our first bear. We took his picture.

Her gaze was fastened upon the flagman who had showed such anxiety for her safety and that of Laddie. \"Say, please, Mister,\" she continued to ask, \"what makes you wear earrings?\" A Pullman coach had halted just opposite the spot where the twins and the flagman stood. They saw several people at <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the windows, waving to them. Then Russ Bunker popped out of the front door of the car and down the steps. \"Look! Look!

At last she left the room, and, looking after her for a second or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in silence, he said compassionately,-- \"Poor creature! she takes this to heart far more heavily than I could have thought;\" and then, seeing that the words were not quite intelligible to me, he added, \"Yes, mon cher Gregoire, I am a bachelor once more; Madame the Countess has left me!

The approach to the city was surrounded by many strong ramparts, one within the other, by which it was defended against its ancient enemy, the ocean, precisely like the circumvallations by means of which it was now assailed by its more recent enemy, the Spaniard. To enable the fleet, however, to sail over the land; it was necessary to break through this <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> fold series of defences. Between the Land-Scheiding and Leyden were several dykes, which kept out the water; upon the level, were many villages, together with a chain of sixty-two forts, which completely occupied the land.

The making so many fires as above did indeed consume an unusual quantity of coals; and that upon one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> stops of the ships coming up (whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies, I do not remember); but the price of coals was exceedingly dear, even as high as four pounds a chaldron;[305] but it soon abated when the ships came in, and, as afterwards they had a freer passage, the price was very reasonable all the rest of that year.

We are taught that a difference in the mode of sacrifice was the principal cause of the dispute between the first <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hostile brothers among men. Although, if we were to judge from first impressions and according to human feelings, no sacrifice is so filial, so simple, so appropriate, as that of the first fruits of the earth in returning Spring, (such for instance as the flower-offering of the pious Brahmins, or a similar oblation of thanksgiving among the ancient Persians and other nations); still on account of their deeper import and typical character, the pre-eminence has ever been allotted to...", "...with nearly all their writers, and in the reports of their officers, a disposition to minimize numbers on their own side, and to overstate those on the side of the Americans.

One opinion is that Love is sexual love, sexual attraction, sexual desire. To people holding this opinion love and sexual desire or \"lust\" are synonymous.

This was a very capital discovery, because it proved that if the heart was full of fluid, and if there were any means of causing that fluid in the ventricles to move, then the fluid could move only in one direction; for you will observe that, as soon as the fluid is compressed, the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> valves between the ventricles and the veins will be shut, and the fluid will be obliged to move into the arteries; and, if it tries to get back from them into the heart, it is prevented from doing so by the valves at the origin of the arteries, which we now call the semilunar valves (half-moon shaped valves); so that it is impossible, if the fluid move at all, that it should move in any other way than from the great veins into the arteries. Now that was a very remarkable and...", "...to do his full share of whatsoever labor might be at hand. CLOTHING FOR THE SALEM COMPANY Just fancy! The Massachusetts Bay Company gave to each man and boy who came over from England to Salem four pairs of shoes, and four pairs of stockings to wear with them, a stout pair of Norwich garters, together with four shirts, and two suits of doublet and hose of leather lined with oiled skin. As if that were not enough, to the list were added a woolen suit lined with leather, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> handkerchiefs, and a green cotton waistcoat. Then came a leather belt, a woolen cap, a black hat, two red knit caps, two pairs of gloves, a cloak lined with cotton, and an extra pair of breeches.

But the spoiler came in a second appearance of Gaut Gurley, who, having squandered in the country the bounteous sums of money which Elwood had paid him for his services, now followed the latter to the city. And, with the coming of that personage, together with the foolish ambition that had, about that time, seized Elwood, to outshine some of his city competitors in display and expensive living, commenced the wane of a fortune which, as large as it was, it had required but <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> short years to bring to the verge on which we represented its unhappy master as standing in the opening scene of our story. Having now related all we designed in this retrospect of events, we will return from the somewhat long but necessary digression, and take up the thread of the narrative where we left it.

The words that should sufficiently accurse And execrate the thing, hath need Come glowing from...", "...twenty dollar bill, shook hands and parted; yes, poor Billy Merrifellow, we never met again; he--he died soon after, in distress, his family broke up--scattered; it was very odd; poor fellow, he's gone;\" and Uncle Joe again had recourse to his rappee, while a large tear hung in the corner of his full blue eye. Closing his box, and wiping his face with his _pongee_, the Major continued: \"Next morning I called for my bill. I was astonished to find that a couple of bottles of good wine, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> extra meals, and something over one day's board, figured up the round sum of ten dollars. I was three days out, so far, and my pocket-book was lessened of half the funds intended for a month's expenses! By banks of Brandywine, thinks Major, my boy, this won't do; you must economize, or you shall be short of your reckonings before you are a week out of port.

Mounting the pony, he rode back to camp, where he found Harding looking grave. \"The fellow's gone and taken some provisions with him,\" he said. \"He left this for us.\" It was a strip of paper, apparently torn from a notebook, with a few lines expressing Benson's regret at having to leave them in such an unceremonious fashion, and stating that he would leave the horse, hobbled, at a spot about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> days' ride away. \"He seems to think he's showing us some consideration in not riding the beast down to the settlement,\" Blake remarked with a dubious smile, feeling strongly annoyed with himself for not taking more precautions. With the cunning which the lust for drink breeds in its victims Benson had outwitted him by feigning acquiescence. \"Anyway,\" he added, \"I'll have to go after him. We must have the horse, for one thing; but I suppose we'll lose four days. This is rough...", "...a state of perfect safety with respect to fire.' Captain Blackwood, his surviving officers and men, were all most honourably acquitted of any blame respecting the loss of the Ajax. Out of six hundred men, three hundred and fifty were saved by the boats of the squadron; but two hundred and fifty perished that night by fire or water. Amongst the lost were Lieutenants Reeve and Sibthorpe; Captain Boyd, Royal Marines; Mr. Owen, surgeon; Mr. Donaldson, master; twenty-five midshipmen; <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> merchants of Constantinople, and a Greek pilot. The melancholy fate of the gunner must not be passed over unnoticed. This poor man had two sons on board, whom he was bringing up to his own profession. When the first alarm of fire was given, he had rushed below, and was soon seen emerging from the smoke with one of the boys in his arms. He threw the lad into the sea and the jolly-boat picked him up; but on going down for the other, the unfortunate father fell a victim to...", "...your beautiful ermine furs have been worn, for they are soiled; other things look likewise. I don't know what to make of such ways, I'm sure.\" To this information Theodora listened in dismay and anger. It seemed to her such an incredible outrage on decency, honor, and even honesty. She rose instantly and went to look at her trunks. Ducie had made a very moderate complaint. It was only necessary to lift the lids to convince herself that the accusation was a just one. For a moment or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> she stood looking at the disarranged garments; her face flushed, she locked her fingers together, and was speechless. Then she sat down to consider the circumstance, and her lovely face had on it an expression half-pleading and half-defiant. It was the face of a woman you could hurt, but could not move. In half-an-hour she called Ducie. \"Do not touch the four trunks that were sent here from Kendal,\" she said. \"Open the one we had with us, and take from it my steel-blue silk...", "...of the disease. Of four human beings, not more than one would become rabid. John Hunter used to say not more than one in twenty; but that is probably erroneous. Cattle appear to have a greater chance of escape, and sheep a still greater chance. The time of incubation is different in different animals. With regard to the human being, there are various strange and contradictory stories. Some have asserted that it has appeared on the very day on which the bite was inflicted, or within <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three days of that time. Dr. Bardsley, on the other hand, relates a case in which twelve years elapsed between the bite and the disease. If the virus may lurk so long as this in the constitution, it is a most lamentable affair. According to one account, more than thirty years intervened. The usual time extends from three weeks to six or seven months. In the dog I have never seen a case in which plain and palpable rabies occurred in less than fourteen days after the bite. The...", "...a hero? ... Um! It's just possible.\" \"I never thought of that, sir,\" said Ted with obvious admiration. \"I do not doubt your honour, Ensign Russell, and I mean to employ you upon an errand needing strength of character.

Go to him at once for horse and escort.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And understand, Ensign Russell, that should you be captured and have no time to destroy the letter, you must on no account disclose the key--on _no_ account!\" \"I will not, sir.\" Ted saluted and withdrew, greatly pleased by this signal mark of the confidence reposed in him. An hour after he had started, Ensign Tynan in his turn was standing before Sir John Lawrence. \"And so you believe that Russell...", "...And now gentlemen, I regret the necessity of dismissing you, but I have a ball on hand for to-night, and must beg you to excuse us, that we may prepare for it. You know in the fashionable world we train for a ball, as athletes do for their sports. You will forgive my sending you away?\" This was her way and men never resented it. They simply obeyed. Mr. Barnes was delighted that both the other men would leave with him. He had prepared a trap for Mr. Mitchel, but now he would entice <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> birds into it. CHAPTER VI. MR. BARNES'S TRAP. It must not be supposed from what has been related, that Mr. Barnes had lost any of his old time skill. That he did not yet quite understand the case upon which he was working, is little to be wondered at when it is remembered that less than two days had elapsed since the robbery had occurred, and that a great part of this time he had necessarily been absent from the city upon another case. After his disappointment at...", "..._may_ come a dozen. More fuel may be needed,\" whereat half a dozen dark forms silently backed away down the slope, and all men waited and watched. Harris, with one arm and shoulder still bandaged, and obviously weak, sat grasping at the corner a folded blanket and busily coaching Briggs, who listened, absorbed. Ten, twelve, fourteen the minutes rolled by. The silvery sheen spread higher over the eastward sky. The crest of the distant Mesa was just fringing with dazzling white, when <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> voices at once exclaimed: \"There you are, sir!\" And afar over to the south-east, the direction of Tonto Creek, a little ruddy spark appeared through the gloom, and a moment later still another was made out, farther to the left. In twenty minutes three were in sight. \"Anywhere from fifteen to twenty miles away,\" said Harris, as he studied them with the signal glass, \"and,\" he continued, \"I looked for one much nearer.\" \"There you have it, sir!\" And almost opposite them, it seemed,...", "...us over a broken barren country; the hills composed of rocks and small stones, the valleys and flats of sand. To the westward of our route the country was covered with scrubs of the eucalyptus dumosa; these scrubs we avoided, by keeping close along the base of Peel's range, where the country had been lately burnt. It is somewhat singular that those scrubs and brushes seldom if ever extend to the immediate base of the hills: the washings from them rendered the soil somewhat better for <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three hundred yards. As to water, we did not see the least signs of any during the whole day. After proceeding between nine and ten miles, we stopped for the evening on some burnt grass, which existed in sufficient quantity; but, although we procured a few gallons of water for ourselves, not all our researches could find a sufficiency for the horses. The dogs killed a pretty large emu, which was a most luxurious addition to our salt pork, of which alone we were all well...", "...in the world, probably out of years of hard saving, but they were both almost going along with good spirits. A little further up the street, I saw a refined looking young girl cooking breakfast in the gutter. She wore a handsomely made but badly torn skirt and had a remarkably fine bracelet on one wrist. Her oven was made of two bricks and a toasting grill. A young man was bringing her bits of fire wood and they were consulting together over the frying of bacon. Further on were <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> other women doing the same thing and having fun out of it between themselves. \"Is it so very much farther?\" was the only complaint that came from one tired little woman who looked ready to faint. She was staggering under the weight of a huge bundle. She looked unused to work and her lips were white and trembling with exhaustion. She rested just a minute, then staggered on without another word of complaint. Men spoke kindly to her, but none offered to help her, because Woe was...", "...a fork.

I am glad therefore to be able to relieve any anxieties which my friends may entertain without delay. I assure them that my skull retains its normal covering, and that though, naturally, I may have felt alarmed, nothing serious has happened.

I regret to add, however, that by misadventure, and I am afraid I must say carelessness, he has inflicted one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> severe contusions on himself. When the noise of approaching battle roused me from the dreams of peace which occupy my retirement, I was glad to observe (since I must fight) that the campaign was to be opened upon a new field.

Force and vigor are so essential to health of mind, as well as of body, that I would secure those first to every child. I once had a very bright boy of four in my school, who had a very remarkable memory. He would learn a verse of poetry by my repeating it once, and learned to read with marvellous rapidity. It was almost alarming; but I took care not to stimulate him in any way. He was suddenly seized with a violent influenza, and did not return to school for <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> months. When he returned, he had not only forgotten all he had learned, but never showed the same aptitude again. In a year afterwards he had not caught up with those first few months. This taught me never to urge a child to exertion while suffering from a cold; and my attention having thus been directed to the point, I have often observed how that malady dulls the action of the faculties. I have one dear little scholar now, only too willing to exert her mind; and if I see that...", "...step. When they got me in front of the orchestra the slaves drew off my veil and there I stood. The chorus retired, and I began my song. I had had only one rehearsal with the orchestra, the day before; but the humming accompaniment to my solo, that the unmusical slaves had to learn, had taken a week to teach. Every one said the scene was very pretty. My song was quite a success; I had to sing it over again. Then I sang the waltz of Chopin, to which I had put words and transposed <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> tones lower. I saw Delle Sedie in the audience, with his mouth wide open, trying to breathe for me. It has sixteen bars which must be sung in one breath, and has a compass from D on the upper line to A on the lower line. Applause and flowers were showered on me, and I was rather proud of myself.

Though I was frightened...", "...coming and then we were put out.

When we examine Dalton's rules we must confess that they appear somewhat arbitrary. He does not give reasons for his assertion that \"when only one combination of two bodies can be obtained, it must be presumed to be a binary one.\" Why may it not be ternary or quaternary? Why must the atom of water be built up of one atom of hydrogen combined with one atom of oxygen? Or, when <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> compounds are known containing the same pair of elements, why must one be binary and the other ternary? Or, even assuming that this _must_ be justified by facts, does it follow that Dalton's interpretation of the atomic structure of the two oxides of carbon is necessarily correct? These oxides contain 6 of carbon + 8 of oxygen, and 6 of carbon + 16 of oxygen, respectively.

Yes, for these southwest winds served him now! \"What's the matter?\" asked the novice. \"It's that cook of misfortune, who has just fallen on the compass!\" replied Tom. At those words Dick Sand, in the greatest anxiety, leaned over the binnacle. It was in good condition; the compass, lighted by <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> lamps, rested as usual on its concentric circles. The young novice was greatly affected. The breaking of the only compass on board would be an irreparable misfortune. But what Dick Sand could not observe was that, since the taking away of the piece of iron, the needle had returned to its normal position, and indicated exactly the magnetic north as it ought to be under that meridian. Meanwhile, if Negoro could not be made responsible for a fall which seemed to be...", "...29. On resuming the negotiations on January 6 the situation was little changed. Kuehlmann's position was at any rate somewhat firmer than before, albeit only at the cost of some concessions to the German military party. In these circumstances the negotiations, in which Trotski now took part as spokesman for the Russians, led only to altogether fruitless theoretical discussions and the right of self-determination, which could not bring about any lessening of the distance between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> firmly maintained points of view. In order to get the proceedings out of this deadlock further endeavours were made on the part of Austria to arrive at a compromise between the German and Russian standpoints, the more so as it was generally, and especially in the case of Poland, desirable to solve the territorial question on the basis of complete self-determination. Our proposals to the German delegates were to the effect that the Russian standpoint should so far be met as to allow...", "...we spread very quietly to the right hand and the left of him once more, and we drew as close as might be to the thicket's edge, and those who had bows the nighest thereto.

At the age of two years they can slay with one blow an ox, horse, or camel, and can leap the hedges <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> yards high that surround the folds for protection. This period in the history of the lion is the most disastrous to the shepherds and their flocks, for then the lion goes about killing for the sake of learning to kill.

These were strong steps to take with a force such as that he had under him, but he succeeded in making them acceptable by increasing the pay of the men, and by substituting on his staff English officers--the services of a few being lent him by the commanding officer at Shanghai--for the adventurers who had followed Ward and Burgevine. The total strength of the force was fixed at 4000 men, and his artillery consisted of four siege and <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> field batteries. The men were paid regularly by a Chinese official appointed by Li Hung Chang, and the cost to the Chinese Government averaged L20,000 a month. At the same time, Gordon collected a pontoon train and practised his men in all the work of attacking fortified places before he ventured to assume the offensive. He also organised a flotilla of small steamers and Chinese gunboats capable of navigating the canals and creeks which traversed the province of Kiangsu in all...", "...the south-west in the thirties. When Samuel was about nine years old his father decided to move to Hannibal, in the same State. The prime cause of this immigration was the failure of the elder Clemens to make Salt River navigable; hence, as one writer has suggested, the probable origin of the old synonym for disaster, \"gone up Salt River.\" Young Clemens was sent to school in Hannibal. Some of his schoolmates are living in the old town to-day. He seems to have enjoyed the rule of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> teachers, Miss Newcomb and Miss Lucy Davis. Physically, he was not a strong boy, but intellectually he seems always to have been more than a match for any boy of his age. He had two brothers, Orion, who was considerably older, and Henry, who was the youngest of them all. Samuel attended school until his father died in 1847. The death of the father, who had just been elected county judge, was a hard blow to the family. After the death of his father, the subject of our sketch went to...", "...age. \"Doesn't she intend to finish her education?\" I inquired. \"No,\" was the quick and emphatic but stuttering reply, \"she's had sufficient education.

CHAPTER I. WHAT IS PAPER BAG COOKERY? THE principles contained in Paper-bag Cookery are not new. Woodsmen and hunters have known for ages that if they wanted fish or game done to a turn, a jacket of clay outside the meat which was protected from soil by leaves or corn husks, gave, on removing the clay case, the very quintessence of delicate, savory cookery. Now within the last <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> years, a series of experiments has resulted in the perfecting of a system of Paper-bag Cookery that revolutionizes the old time kitchen drudgery with its unending round of greasy pots and pans to be taken into account. The advantages of this method of cooking are manifold. They may be epitomized thus: I. It makes food more savory and nutritious. II. It is sanitary. No dust can reach the article being cooked and, the cooking accomplished, the bag can be thrown into the stove...", "...of very gruesome vintage; Of passes steep that try the lungs, And chattering in unknown tongues.

In taking a view of the state of our country we in the first place notice the late affliction of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in His goodness gave it an early termination on this occasion and lessened the number of victims which have usually fallen before it.

Born near Canajoharie, about the year 1733, and married to Martin J.

In the month of August, 1780, an army of Indians and Tories, led on by Brant, rushed into the Mohawk Valley, devastated several settlements, and killed many of the inhabitants; during the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> following months, Sir John Johnson made a descent and finished the work which Brant had begun. The two almost completely destroyed the settlements throughout the valley. It was during those trying times that Mrs. Van Alstine performed a portion of her exploits.

Verdi's _Falstaff_ opera contains some bits from the _Henry IV._ plays which I am dealing with under _The Merry Wives of Windsor_.

We procured merely the means of cooking, and milk, eggs, and fowl; but the people made themselves very agreeable, and we had great amusement and laughter. We set off early the next morning and commenced by descending the lofty mound upon which the town is built, by as tortuous and harassing a path as that by which we approached it. However, after we had proceeded about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> miles a vista of as romantic and pleasing a kind as any I had ever seen in any other country opened before me. In the continuous range of hills which lined the road, the vineyards covered both the sides and tops for several miles around, and the valleys in the distance were thickly planted with chestnut woods: further on, the vast range of the ronda sierra lined the horizon. The outline of these mountains was bold and their scenery grand. Their sides and summits were studded...", "...did turn bitter cold that night, so that they had to keep a fire blazing every hour, in order to ward off the fate of being frozen stiff; for their camp happened to be exposed to the breeze more than Tom would have liked, had he been given any choice. Arriving at the river, they met the man who had come from the ranch under the former agreement. He had been waiting two days, and made himself as comfortable as the conditions allowed; and it was the smoke of his fire that directed the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boys to his hideout. As he had a pair of snow shoes with him, they were able to continue their journey along the snow-covered surface of the frozen river; and in due time reach the ranch. Here the sight of their trophies, and the story of all that had befallen them during their two months' stay in the country of the Rockies interested the cowmen greatly, and for several nights they plied the boys with innumerable questions concerning the various happenings that went to make up...", "...again and again A Wee Deoch-an'-Doris in that room for convalescents that overlooks the sea. I wish I could think that the baby with both legs off will grow up without missing what it has never known. I wish I could be reconciled because the dead young officer had died the death of a patriot and a soldier, or that the boy I saw dying in an upper room, from shock and loss of blood following an amputation, is only a pawn in the great chess game of empires. I wish I could believe that the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> women on the floor below, one with both arms gone, another with one arm off and her back ripped open by a shell, are the legitimate fruits of a holy war. I cannot. I can see only greed and lust of battle and ambition. In a bright room I saw a German soldier. He had the room to himself. He was blue eyed and yellow haired, with a boyish and contagious smile. He knew no more about it all than I did. It must have bewildered him in the long hours that he lay there alone. He did not...", "...had his thoughts at Hippias's somnolent door, and to them the world might have subscribed. A monomaniac at large, watching over sane people in slumber! thinks Adrian Harley, as he hears Sir Austin's footfall, and truly that was a strange object to see.--Where is the fortress that has not one weak gate? where the man who is sound at each particular angle? Ay, meditates the recumbent cynic, more or less mad is not every mother's son? Favourable circumstances--good air, good company, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three good rules rigidly adhered to--keep the world out of Bedlam. But, let the world fly into a passion, and is not Bedlam the safest abode for it? Sir Austin ascended the stairs, and bent his steps leisurely toward the chamber where his son was lying in the left wing of the Abbey. At the end of the gallery which led to it he discovered a dim light. Doubting it an illusion, Sir Austin accelerated his pace. This wing had aforetime a bad character. Notwithstanding what...", "...symmetry; its span is one hundred and ninety-four feet, its elevation one hundred and eight feet, its width thirty-five feet. Combining grace and massiveness, the Augusta stands pre-eminent. It rises in majestic proportions to the height of two hundred and twenty-two feet and has a span between abutments of two hundred and sixteen feet. The width of the road-bed is twenty-eight feet and the thickness of the arch at the keystone is forty-five feet. The height of the Carolyn Bridge is <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hundred and five feet and the span one hundred and eighty-six feet. All these bridges span canyons whose depths correspond to the height of the arched structures. In White Canyon, a few miles below Edwin Bridge, under its overhanging rock walls, are the ruins of numerous cliff-dwellings. The largest natural bridge in the world yet discovered is the Nonnezoshi. It is in Nonnezoshiboko Canyon, Utah, not far from the place where the San Juan River enters the Colorado. This...", "...hundred _soldadoes_ be marched back to their ship. This Lachlan was willing to do, but still suspecting the commander of the galleon as a wily bird, he detained three of the officers of the troops as hostages to assure final settlement. Then he sent on board the _Florencia_ young Donald Glas, son of the MacLean of Morvern, to collect what was due and adjust the affair. No sooner had he set foot on deck, than he was disarmed and bundled below by order of Pareira who considered that <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> could play at holding that form of collateral known as hostages. Now ensued a dead-lock. Lachlan MacLean refused to yield up his brace of Spanish officers unless the demands of his people were paid in full, while Captain Pareira kept Donald Glas locked in a cabin and swore to carry him to sea. The tragedy which followed is told in the traditions of Mull to this day. When Donald Glas learned that he was kidnapped in the galleon, he resolved to wreak dreadful revenge for the...", "...and Herrendeen on the other part, made a bargain. Mrs. Casalle had come on deck and was reclining in a cane lounge, with Solepa sitting at her feet fondling her hands and looking into her mistress's face, as she talked volubly to her in Samoan. With her new-found happiness shining in her eyes, and tinting her pale cheeks, Mrs. Casalle seemed to scarcely heed the girl's prattle--she was trying to hear the good-natured argument going on between Tom, the Maori, and the captain. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hours' talk she had had with Tom had not satisfied her; she wanted to hear his story over and over again; to hear him tell her how he had carried 'the little one' up from the beach and placed her in Kate Gorman's arms; to question him again about her husband and how he looked, and about Port Kooringa, and his own father and brother, and Kate--and then to lie down and think of God's goodness to her in sparing husband and child to meet her again. Oh, if she could but know where they...", "...north, though in one of her letters she spoke of the gladness with which she would have made the effort had it been possible; and there was even no question of their all joining her at Robin Redbreast, though but for a short visit, for in November the fiat went forth which each winter she had secretly for some years past been dreading--she must not remain in England. For her chronic bronchitis was on her again, and a premature taste of winter in the late autumn threatened for a week or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> to turn this into something worse.

The lumberjacks are naturally wanderers and in the camps of the Pacific slopes the Minnesota and Wisconsin woodsmen are already there to give the chaplains welcome. Mr. Higgins tells of preaching in a town on the Tacoma Eastern Railway in Washington: \"In one town where no religious organization was at work, I held services in a dance hall, and seventy-five persons were present, sixty of whom were loggers. After the service <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> lumberjacks came up to me and said: 'Hello, Pilot, don't you know us? We're a couple of your Minnesota boys. Don't you remember preaching in the Clearwater Camps on 'The Chances a Fellow Has if He'll Take Them?' Well, we broke away from the gang, came out here, have saved our money, and are the ones who rustled the crowd for you tonight.' \"On another occasion I was to speak in the open air, when an old Minnesota campman brought a pitcher of lemonade and placed it by my side....", "...in,\" replied Hal. He tried to pull off his coat, but had not the strength. \"Will you help me?\" \"Of course.\" In a twinkle the man had the coat off, and his own on Hal's shivering form. \"Belong around here?\" \"No.\" \"Then come with me. I live right across the way, and I'll soon warm you up. It's lucky I came over to see if everything was all right. I'm looking after the place till spring.\" The man took up his lantern once more and led the way up stairs and across the street. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> entered a neat-looking tenement, and the man took Hal to a set of rooms on the second floor. A hot fire was blazing in the kitchen, and drawing up a chair the man motioned for Hal to sit down. \"Maybe the old woman kin lend you some clothes,\" said the man. \"But I allow as how you may be better off, if you let the wet ones dry onto you. It may save you from a spell of sickness.\" \"I am doing very nicely now,\" replied Hal. \"I am used to some pretty tough knocks,\" he added, and...", "...of two occasions when Shag's father had saved Sir George's life, once from drowning in the Assiniboine and once from freezing to death on the plains. The recreation interval was all too short for the boys to have their talk out, and when the \"good-nights\" came Hal wrung Shag's hand with a sincerity and heartiness that brought a responsive thrill into the fingers of the lonely boy who was spending his first night fifteen hundred miles away from home. \"Well,\" snorted Shorty, as the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boys left for the night, \"going to chum around with the son of your father's cook, are you?\" Hal whirled on his heel, his hand clenched, his knuckles standing out white and bony; then he checked the torrent of words that sprang to his lips and answered quietly, \"Yes, I am.\" \"Going to take him to Sir George and Lady Bennington's city residence for the Easter Vac?\" sneered Shorty.

Two days thereafter, the command marched out of Camp Weld <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> miles up the Platte River, and in due time encamped at Pueblo, on the Arkansas River. At this point further advices were received from Canby, stating that he had encountered the enemy at Valverde, ten miles north of Fort Craig, but, owing to the inefficiency of the newly raised New Mexican volunteers, was compelled to retire.

I well remember that a party of friends about to camp out were unable to buy a gridiron in <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Western towns, each numbering over four thousand eaters of fried meats.] Although, from what I have seen, I should judge that overtasked men of science are especially liable to the trouble which I have called cerebral exhaustion, all classes of men who use the brain severely, and who have also--and this is important--seasons of excessive anxiety or of grave responsibility, are subject to the same form of disease; and this I presume is why we meet with numerous instances of...", "...one being red and the other green. These colors were employed, after a preliminary test, as showing, on the whole, to nearly equal advantage in the individual choice of colors. The shorter exposure was five seconds and the longer exposure ten seconds. The color that was to be seen the longer time was exposed first alone; after five seconds the other was exposed; and then both were seen for five seconds together, so that neither might have the advantage of the more recent impression. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> colors were regularly alternated, and in one half of the series the longer exposure was to the right, in the other half to the left. The extra five seconds were thus in each case at the beginning of the experiment. The general averages show only a slight advantage in favor of the color which was exposed the longer time, namely, 29.15 seconds, as against 27.75 seconds. It is not easy to believe that the advantage of sole occupancy of the visual field for five seconds, without...", "...by side--the Adam and Eve in this forest Eden. No old folk were there--no gnarled and withered foresters--every tree rose up, upright in its youth, and perfect after its kind. There was as yet no choking under-growth of vegetation; nothing but mosses, woodbine, and ferns; and between the boles of the trees you could trace vista after vista, as between the slender pillars of a cathedral aisle. John pointed out all this to Miss March, especially noticing the peculiar character of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> species of trees--the masculine and feminine--fir and beech. She smiled at the fancy; and much graceful badinage went on between them.

The dark places in human nature seem to have become the sole monopoly of the Freudians and their psychology. But only seemingly. For all this time the physiologist has been working. Beginning with a candle and now holding in his hands the most powerful arc-lights, he has explored <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> regions, the sympathetic nervous system and the glands of internal secretion, and has come upon data which in due course will render a good many of the Freudian dicta obsolete. Not that the Freudian fundamentals will be scrapped completely. But they will have to fit into the great synthesis which must form the basis of any control of the future of human nature. That future belongs to the physiologist. Already his achievements provide the foundations. I propose in the following...", "...first, her black lace shawl; then her chemise.

One of these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> which have seventeen will be launched within a fortnight, and has the necessary supply of rowers.

The two outer lateral rows of posts are much smaller and support much lighter ridge-poles. In each row there are four posts, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in the middle and one at each gable-end.

The fourth raid was also undertaken by the 47th Battalion. A comparatively long distance separated the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> trench lines, some 200 yards. On this account an early start was imperative. Scarcely any resistance was encountered. Six Germans were killed, and others were pursued but not caught.

In fact, the church was the chief patron of art, and the artist was one of her most valuable teachers. A learned Spanish writer said: \"For the ignorant, what master is like painting? They may read their duty in a picture though they may not search for it in books.\" The painters of Spain were divided between the schools of Castile, Seville, and Valencia. That of Castile was founded at Toledo early in the fifteenth century, and was maintained about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hundred years. Claudio Coello was of this school; he died in 1693, and has well been called \"the last of the old masters of Spain.\" ALONZO BERREGUETTE (1480-1561), born at Parades de Nava, in Castile, was the most eminent Spanish artist of his time. He is called the Michael Angelo of Spain, because he was painter, sculptor, and architect. He was painter to Philip I. Later he went to Italy, and journeyed from Florence to Rome with Michael Angelo in 1505. He studied in Italy many...", "...morning lately, when I went to look in my _pataka_ (store-house) across the river, where I keep my seed-potatoes for the new season's planting, I found that some of them had been taken. Then half a mile up the river the next day I saw a place where some stranger had been fishing for eels, for there were heads of the eels lying there where he had cut them off. There was a fire there, and some of my seed-potatoes had been roasted in it.

Just where the track entered the slow-moving, muddy stream they saw the fresh prints of naked feet. Wading across, they quickly mounted the opposite bank and set out at a noiseless, easy lope, their bare feet making hardly a sound, along the trail that wound into the glooms of the bush. Suddenly, at a turn in the track, they came upon Hiroki. The fugitive was standing there, waiting, for the low growling of his dog, a white, savage-looking...", "...Don Marcos fancied he had no right to neglect the overtures the other was pleased to make; while keeping on his guard and determined to punish him severely if he deceived him.

When the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men had entered the house, and the door closed after them, Don Marcos de Niza, still closely followed by the bandit, who, in spite of his impudence, looked around him timidly, like a wolf caught in a sheepfold, led him into a room the door of which he carefully closed.

Forrester ordered another drink and tried to think about something else. The prospect of a fight with Mars was sometimes a little too much for him to handle. The drink arrived and he sipped at it vacantly, thinking back to Diana and her story of the Gods. There was one hole in it--a hole big enough to toss Mount Olympus through, he realized. Where had the Gods gone for three thousand years? And how had they gotten to Earth in the first place? Those <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> unanswered questions were enough to convince Forrester that, in spite of all he knew, and in spite of the way his new viewpoint had turned his universe upside down in a matter of hours, he still didn't have the whole story. He had to find it--even more so, now, as he began to realize that the human race deserved more than just the \"security\" and \"happiness\" that the Gods could give them. It deserved independence, and the chance to make or mar its own future.

Drift I embraces about three-fifths of the stars, and Drift II the remaining two-fifths. Quite as remarkable as the drifts themselves is the fact that the relative motion of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> is very closely parallel to the plane of the Milky Way. This epochal research has very great significance in all investigations of stellar motions, and it has been verified in various ways, particularly by the Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Dyson, who limited the stars under consideration to 1,924 in number, but all having very large proper motions. In this way the two streams are even more characteristically marked. But radial velocity determinations afford the ultimate and most...", "...the people whose names were signed to it. Veressayev went abroad; he visited Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland. Gifted with poetic inspiration, he had begun writing at an early age. He was not more than fourteen when he translated some poems of Koerner and Goethe into Russian verse. Later, when at college, he wrote some short prose tales, which were published in various papers. But it was in 1896, when the \"Russkoe Bogatsvo,\" the large St. Petersburg review, had published his <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> important stories, \"Astray\" and \"The Contagion,\" that renown came to him. It came so suddenly that it troubled him and was almost a blow to his modesty, which is one of the sympathetic traits of his personality. In fact, there came a time when the attention of the literary world, especially among the younger generation, became so wrapped up in his works that Gorky and Tchekoff sank to a second level. This enthusiasm was caused by the fact that Veressayev's works answered a...", "...shook the fan, in a moment the Prince Sobur stood before her, and said--\"You called me, here I am.

The prince told her of the circumstances under which he gave the box to her father, and informed her of the secret that whenever the fan would be shaken he would make his appearance. The prince lived for a day or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in the house of the merchant's daughter, who entertained him hospitably. The upshot was, that they fell in love with each other, and vowed to each other to be husband and wife. The prince returned to his royal father and told him that he had selected a wife for himself. The day for the wedding was fixed. The merchant and his six daughters were invited. The nuptial knot was tied. But there was death in the marriage-bed. The six daughters of the merchant, envying the happy lot of...", "...wether all round the field. It is called \"the Wolf of the field.\" Its horns are decked with a wreath of flowers and corn-ears, and its neck and body are also encircled with garlands and ribbons. All the reapers march, singing, behind it. Then it is killed on the field. In this part of France the last sheaf is called the _coujoulage_, which, in the patois, means a wether. Hence the killing of the wether represents the death of the corn-spirit, considered as present in the last sheaf; but <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> different conceptions of the corn-spirit--as a wolf and as a wether--are mixed up together.(858) (M236) Sometimes it appears to be thought that the Wolf, caught in the last corn, lives during the winter in the farmhouse, ready to renew his activity as corn-spirit in the spring. Hence at midwinter, when the lengthening days begin to herald the approach of spring, the Wolf makes his appearance once more. In Poland a man, with a wolf's skin thrown over his head, is led about at...", "...she stepped into her tan oxfords and flew out from shelter.

The author of \"Supernatural Religion\" quotes the passage in Dial. xxxiv.:-- \"For Christ is King, and Priest, and God, and Lord, and Angel, and Man, and Captain, and Stone, and a Son born,\" &c.

When dinner was over, Lady Belgrade gave the signal, and arose from the table.

Owners became discouraged, and captains sank in despair; harpoons and flinching gear were flung aside, and whalers were dispatched to the Baltic for timber, or wherever else a freight could be procured, and others departed to strange ports, and returned no more; for they were sold. The whaling fleet became, therefore, small by degrees. Yet <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ports struggled on against the receding tide; Hull in England, and Peterhead in Scotland, always hoped against hope, and persevered amid every disadvantage. They still sent vessels out; if not to catch whales, to be contented with seals. Peterhead reaped the reward of perseverance.

There used to be an omnibus line that carried passengers for <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> shillings and sixpence, but it was somewhat irregular in its movements, and could not be relied on. Nowadays the omnibus will carry you for threepence. \"When a ship arrived and anchored in the bay the passengers had to pay three shillings each to be put on shore, and very often the boatman raised the tariff to five shillings whenever he thought he could induce or compel the passengers to pay it.

In the midst of the dispute, Pizarro's brothers--for there were <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in the camp--entered the tent. De Soto, addressing the three, said: \"I am the champion of Attahuallapa.

Tarboe kept his tongue from blasphemy, and his hand from the captain's shoulder, for he knew only too well that Gobal held the game in his hands. They leaned over and saw <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> sailors with something on a plank. \"We therefore commit his body to the deep, in the knowledge of the Judgment Day--let her go!\" grunted Gobal; and a long straight canvas bundle shot with a swishing sound beneath the water. \"It was rough on him too,\" he continued. \"He waited twenty years to have his chance again.

Each had enjoyed his full measure of the grand sport, as was evidenced by the display of the several strings of salmon-colored beauties which hung around the camp-fire. There was not a fingerling in the entire catch. No one had caught a trout during the day of less than four ounces in weight, and very few of that size had been taken. The majority of them ranged between half a pound and <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> pounds, and the numbers were only limited by the amount of work each had done. My friends, being residents and accustomed to this kind of sport whenever they choose to enjoy it, had not cared to fish all day, and consequently had not taken so many as I, but had taken all they wanted. The only man in the party who had anything to regret in the day's experience was Sam.

Looking at their faces I thought they had not been washed for months, for a coat of dirt covered their skins. I looked at their fur garments with great suspicion, and kept away from them without appearing to do so. I found it necessary to use all the tact I possessed to avoid wounding their susceptibilities. After their departure Jakob said: \"I am going to take the reindeer to some friends of mine who have their camp within <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hours from this place, and they will take care of them until we go back.\" Then he bade me good-bye, saying, \"I will not be long.\" I watched him until I lost sight of him and of the reindeer. Then I put on my skees, took my gun, and went to look for foxes, and soon came upon fresh tracks of them. Once or twice I thought I saw white foxes, but they are difficult to see at a long distance, being of the color of the snow, and I could not be sure.

Now man is justified by faith according to Rom. 5:1: \"Being justified therefore by faith let us have peace,\" etc. Therefore faith is a virtue. _I answer that,_ As shown above, it is by human virtue that human acts are rendered good; hence, any habit that is always the principle of a good act, may be called a human virtue. Such a habit is living faith. For since to believe is an act of the intellect assenting to the truth at the command of the will, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> things are required that this act may be perfect: one of which is that the intellect should infallibly tend to its object, which is the true; while the other is that the will should be infallibly directed to the last end, on account of which it assents to the true: and both of these are to be found in the act of living faith. For it belongs to the very essence of faith that the intellect should ever tend to the true, since nothing false can be the object of faith, as proved above...", "...of the snows, pour in liquid avalanches from the summits of Mt.

Four papist, suspected of this sacrilege, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> marquises, one burgher, and a workman, were torn from their homes and hung in the manikin's stead. This occurred the eleventh of June, 1790. The whole French town wrote to the National Assembly that she gave herself to France, and with her the Rhone, her commerce, the Midi, and the half of Provence.

The theological current, thus re-enforced, seemed to become again irresistible; but it was only so in appearance. In spite of it, French scepticism continued to develop; signs of quiet change among the mass of thinking men were appearing more and more; and in 1672 came one of great significance, for, the Parliament of Rouen having doomed fourteen sorcerers to be burned, their execution was delayed for <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> years, evidently on account of scepticism among officials; and at length the great minister of Louis XIV, Colbert, issued an edict checking such trials, and ordering the convicted to be treated for madness. Victory seemed now to incline to the standard of science, and in 1725 no less a personage than St. Andre, a court physician, dared to publish a work virtually showing \"demoniacal possession\" to be lunacy. The French philosophy, from the time of its early development in the...", "...twice 5d., three times 5d., ...; which are written 1 X 5d., 2 X 5d., 3 X 5d., ... (S 28). This process is _repetition_, and the quantities 1 X 5d., 2 X 5d., 3 X 5d., ... are the successive _multiples_ of 5d. If, on the other hand, we have a sum of 5s., and treat a shilling as being equivalent to twelve pence, the 5s. is equivalent to 5 X 12d.; here the multiplication arises out of a _subdivision_ of the original unit 1s. into 12d. Although multiplication may arise in either of these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ways, the actual process in each case is performed by commencing with the unit and taking it the necessary number of times. In the above case of subdivision, for instance, each of the 5 shillings is separately converted into pence, so that we do in fact find in succession once 12d., twice 12d., ...; i.e. we find the multiples of 12d. up to 5 times. The result of the multiplication is called the _product_ of the unit by the number of times it is taken. 35. _Diagram of...", "...He desired to be buried 'inter fratres Minores' (London?).

On the whole, Group II. indicates that the death-rate above 35 is increasing, for if we add together any <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> consecutive periods, say 1841-50 and 1851-60, we shall find that the mortality of the last twenty years is greater than that of the first. By taking in this way longer periods of time, we can eliminate factors other than the time factor, and we can, at any rate, feel strongly suspicious that the mortality of middle and advanced life is on the increase.

Our anchorage ground was on the open coast, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three miles from land, at which distance it was necessary to keep, lest we should be driven ashore in case of a norther. Captain Scholefield, in fact, before he had discharged his cargo, was obliged to slip his cables and put to sea, and did not get back to his anchorage ground in nine days.

The marriage contract was ostensibly directed in favour of the independence of Brittany, for it declared that Brittany should revert to the second son or to the eldest daughter of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> sovereigns, and, failing issue, to the natural heirs of the duchess. Until her death Anne occupied herself personally with the administration of the duchy. In 1504 she caused the treaty of Blois to be concluded, which assured the hand of her daughter, Claude of France, to Charles of Austria (the future emperor, Charles V.), and promised him the possession of Brittany, Burgundy and the county of Blois. But this unpopular treaty was broken, and the queen had to consent to the...", "...to the offices, and later on had come the explosion.

In this tower, Italian by geography, Norman by allegiance, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> sides conform to the Italian and two to the Norman fashion. Nothing can show more clearly that even such small matters of detail as the use of a mid-wall shaft were made matters of serious thought, and that it was sometimes thought well to come to a compromise between two rival forms of taste.

The suction pipe is 76 ft. long and will dredge in 53 ft. of water.

The money had been sent, the time was short, but Darcy still remained. Why did he do so, unless it was to attempt a recovery of the document? It must, then, be of vital importance. Having arrived at these conclusions, Stanley found himself committed to one of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> courses of action: either to play the spy on the movements of his friends, or to effect the opening of the door with the silver nails. The first was repugnant to his spirit as a gentleman, and he instantly chose the second, believing that within the portal lay the only real clue he had so far obtained. This plan also had the added recommendation of placing in his hand evidence which would not involve the introduction of Miss Fitzgerald's name in the matter.

The erogenous zones are not equally satisfactory; it is therefore an important experience when, as Dr. Lindner puts it, the child while touching his own body discovers the especially excitable genitals, and so finds the way from sucking to onanism. Through the evaluation of sucking we become acquainted with <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> decisive characteristics of infantile sexuality. It arises in connection with the satisfaction of great organic needs and behaves _auto-erotically_, that is to say, it seeks and finds it objects on its own body.

It is not strange that the antagonism between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> parties should be lost sight of.

So we went and talked over old times. The bill for dinner and wine consumed was prodigious, and the quantity of brandy-and-water that Jack took showed what a regular boozer he was. 'A guinea or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> guineas. What the devil do I care what I spend for my dinner?' says he. 'And Letty Lovelace?' says I. Jack's countenance fell.

Now, the head of the parade was Cephus Fringe, and none other.

Few in that place, even of the children, could be idle, and he had no companions of his own kind. Indeed there were not many who could have kept up with him in his rambles, had there been a legion. But there were a score of vagabond dogs belonging to the neighbours, who served his purpose quite as well. With <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three of these, or sometimes with a full half-dozen barking at his heels, he would sally forth on some long expedition that consumed the day; and though, on their return at nightfall, the dogs would come home limping and sore-footed, and almost spent with their fatigue, Barnaby was up and off again at sunrise with some new attendants of the same class, with whom he would return in like manner.

The only point for a regulation for the formation for battle is to forbid the use of very deep columns, because they are heavy, and difficult to move and to keep in order. Besides, they are so much exposed to artillery that their destruction seems inevitable, and their great depth does not increase in any respect their chances of success. If the organization of an army were left to me, I would adopt for infantry the formation in <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ranks, and a regimental organization according with the formation for battle. I would then make each regiment of infantry to consist of three battalions and a depot. Each battalion should consist of six companies, so that when in column by division the depth would be three divisions or six ranks. This formation seems most reasonable, whether it is desired to form the battalion in columns of attack by divisions on the center of each battalion, or on any other division.

In truth, their days and nights were devoted very much to feasting themselves, and plundering their neighbours: <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> pursuits into which their Gascon friends entered with heart and soul. It is quite delightful to read in Froissart, or Enguerrand de Monstrelet, how \"twelve knights went forth in search of adventures,\" an announcement which may be fairly translated, into how a dozen of gentlemen with indistinct notions of _meum_ and _tuum_, went forth to lay their chivalrous hands upon anything they could come across.

There is, however, a very fine tower and east end in S.

And now I had been for several years on the pay of a petty officer (master's mate), and looking forward to be master, if he were good enough to drop off. He was truly tough, and would never drop off; and I felt it the more because he was ten years my junior, and unseasoned. He drew half again as much as I did, though he knew that I had done all the work. He gave me <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> fingers to say good-bye, which is a loathsome trick to me; so I put out my thumb, which was difficult to him: and the next time I saw him, he lay dead in the cockpit of the Goliath.

She had no mother to guide her, she was often lonely, for her father was immersed in his business. In a very short time she had fixed her heart on to the man, and when too late her father expostulated, and finally forbade the man the house. This only intensified her love and led to quarrels with her father. Ultimately they married, and had a good home and <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> servants. In a little over three years two children added to her joys and sorrows. Still her husband's faults were not amended, but his dissipation increased. Monetary difficulties followed, and to avoid disgrace her father was called upon to provide a large sum of money. This did not add to his sympathy, but it estranged the father and child. Then difficulties followed, and soon her husband stood in the dock charged with embezzlement. Eighteen months' imprisonment was awarded...", "...Natal. There is, moreover, a reserve imposed upon observers at home by our ignorance of the state of the transport services of the British forces. No concentration of troops is profitable if the troops when collected cannot be fed. Subject to these reserves it may be said that Sir Redvers Buller at the beginning of November had to choose between two lines of operations, that by Natal and that by the Cape. The cardinal principle is that you must never divide your force between <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> lines of operations unless it is large enough to give you on each of the two lines an assured superiority to the enemy's whole force. Sir Redvers Buller's design, however, violated this principle. He neither determined upon action with all his might through the Cape Colony nor upon action with all his might through Natal, but divided his effort, directing four of his seven brigades to Natal and the other three towards the Orange River; half his cavalry brigade going to Colesberg,...", "...in the former case lead one to that wonderland of the Bavarian highlands, with its many ancient and Royal castles, lovely little lakes, and fertile, flower-decked pastures.

The old road was opened for traffic nearly a century and a quarter ago, but a considerable portion of that now generally used, which is more sheltered and protected, was not made until 1825.

Their vows bound them to unceasing vigilance, to live on the plainest of fare, to sleep on their arms, ready for instant attack, and to the rescue of Christians, wherever they were found in captivity. The Roskilde guild became the strong core of the King's armaments in his score of campaigns against the Wends. Perhaps it was not strange that Valdemar should be of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> minds about venturing to attack so formidable an enemy in his own house. The nation was cowed and slow to move. In fact, from the first expedition, that started with 250 vessels, only seven returned with the standard, keeping up a running fight all the way across the Baltic with pursuing Wends. The rest had basely deserted. On the way over, the King, listening to their doubts and fears, turned back himself once, but Absalon, who always led in the attack and was the last on the...", "...Joe was hit for a long fly, that seemed good for at least two bases, Pop Dutton was just where he was most needed, and made a sensational catch. There was a howl of delight, and Gregory said to Joe afterward: \"Your man is making good.\" Joe was immensely pleased.

It was a triumph for Joe in <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ways--his own personal one, and in the fact that he had been instrumental in having Pop Dutton play--and Pop's one play, at least that day, saved a run that would have tied the score.

To lose another object of his affections, and that, too, by ministering to his own discomfiture, would ill become his character for intrigue, and ill accord with the present state of his love for the lady, and hatred for the rival.

Leisure in youth for play, leisure in mature life for reflection and creation--these are <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the most precious gifts of civilization to social progress. The United States has led the nations in providing opportunity for leisure time. Labor saving devices have been brought to a higher perfection there than in any other part of the world.

Of their talents the recorder in the _Leinster Journal_ makes no mention, but he is eloquent again and again on the successes of Mr. Moore, and the performances of 1809 appear to have marked an epoch. In 1810 Moore was again (and for the last time) a performer. The critic inclines to cavil at the slightness of the part given to this favourite, and emphasises Moore's cleverness with enthusiasm. But, indeed, on <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the evenings Moore had the stage entirely to himself, when, between the plays, he sat down to a piano and spoke his _Melologue upon National Music_, verses which he had written to be declaimed by Miss Smith at the Dublin Theatre for a benefit night, and which were afterwards published in pamphlet form. All this pleasant gaiety had two consequences, of which the less important may be first noted. In January 1809, three months after Moore's first appearance at Kilkenny, Rogers...", "...commonly eaten on the fishing-grounds.

The little squadron drop their anchors at short distances from each other, in a depth of from ten to twenty feet, and the business is immediately commenced. Each man has <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> lines, and each stands in one end of the boat, the middle of which is boarded off, to hold the fish. The baited lines have been dropped into the water, one on each side of the boat; their leads have reached the bottom, a fish has taken the hook, and after giving the line a slight jerk, the fisherman hauls up his prize with a continued pull, throws the fish athwart a small round bar of iron placed near his back, which forces open the mouth, while the weight of the body, however...", "...obligatory upon us in respect to _divine worship_,--such duties as praise, prayer, preaching the gospel, and observing the sacramental ordinances;--and no human authority may either repeal these laws or add to them. But in respect to the duties which we owe to our neighbor, that is, to our fellow-man, in any relation he holds to us or can ever hold; God has left the most of these duties to the authoritative decision of human governments. He has thus made a difference betwixt these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> classes of duties. The reason for this difference seems to be this; namely, man's wisdom can reach farther in ascertaining what is fit or right betwixt him and his fellow-man, than in ascertaining what is fit or right betwixt him and his God: and consequently, man can legislate in respect to property, and other matters of human right, but not in respect to prayer, and other matters of the first class of duties.

It is a fatal mistake which places an antagonism between the two. There should be between them harmony as sweet as that which moves the concentric rings of Saturn. Untaught by the presence and inspiration of woman, man becomes a cold, dry petrifaction, constantly obeying the centripetal force of his being, and adoring _self_. Without his basal firmness and...", "...mistake. But Tavannes smiled; a broader smile lightened the faces of the six iron-clad men behind him; and for some reason the gang of ruffians thought better of it and slunk aside. There are hard men, who feel scorn of the things which in the breasts of others excite pity. Tavannes' lip curled as he rode on through the streets, looking this way and that, and seeing what a King twenty-two years old had made of his capital. His lip curled most of all when he came, passing between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> tennis-courts, to the east gate of the Louvre, and found the entrance locked and guarded, and all communication between city and palace cut off. Such a proof of unkingly panic, in a crisis wrought by the King himself, astonished him less a few minutes later, when, the keys having been brought and the door opened, he entered the courtyard of the fortress. Within and about the door of the gatehouse some three-score archers and arquebusiers stood to their arms; not in array, but in...", "...points at their ends beat down upon as many thimble shaped objects which they thrust alternately into the unwinking brazier then laid upon the central block to shape. A goblin workman the Thing seemed, standing there, so intent upon and so busy with its forgings.

We passed a company of other Shapes which stood <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> by two and close together, their tops wide spinning wheels through which the tendrils of an opened globe fed translucent, colorless ingots--the substance it seemed to me of which Norhala's shadowy walls were made, the crystal of which the bars that built out the base of the Cones were formed. The ingots passed between the whirling faces; emerged from them as slender, long cylinders; were seized as they slipped down by a crouching block, whose place as it glided away was instantly...", "...it shuts out something which, in its place, might be effective. In Tennyson's _Becket_ is a fine scene, the washing of the beggars' feet by the Archbishop.[21] It illustrates both customs of the time and a side of Becket's character, yet it contained nothing absolutely necessary to the central purpose of the play. Consequently, as the play must be condensed for acting purposes, Sir Henry Irving cut out the whole scene. This time limit forces the dramatist, when choosing between <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> episodes of equal value otherwise, to select that which does more in less space, or to combine desirable parts of the two episodes when possible. In Tennyson's _Becket_, Scene 1 of Act II and Scene 1 of Act III take place in Rosamund's Bower. Henry and Rosamund are the principal speakers in both. There is, too, no marked lapse of time between the scenes, though Tennyson chose to separate them by the \"Meeting of the Kings\" at Montmirail.

One of their first cares was to endeavour to increase their good relations with the Duc and Duchesse de Berry. They were to see them before they were up. The Duc de Berry showed himself very sensible to this act, and the Duchess was eloquent, clever, and full of tears. But her heart was wrung by these advances of pure generosity. The separation she had planned soon followed: and the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> princesses felt relieved at no longer being obliged to dine together. Thus never was change greater or more marked than that brought about by the death of Monseigneur. That prince had become the centre of all hope and of all fear, a formidable cabal had seized upon him, yet without awakening the jealousy of the King, before whom all trembled, but whose anxieties did not extend beyond his own lifetime, during which, and very reasonably, he feared nothing.

That he laboured hard, both at Brienne and at Paris, we may judge; for his after-life left scanty room for book-work, and of the vast quantity of information which his strong memory ever placed at his disposal, the far greater proportion must have been accumulated now.

Bode, like Burger before him, thinks that he recognizes in the little head the likeness of Rembrandt's wife, Saskia.

Susanna is represented as about to step into the bath and is alarmed by the presence of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Elders, one of whom is seen lurking in the shrubbery. Burger notes: \"Placed by the side of the School of Anatomy and the Simeon, the merits of this work are too often overlooked. Yet Susanna, strongly relieved against a dark background, is one of the most interesting female figures ever painted by Rembrandt, being remarkably faithful to nature, though not of classic beauty.\" Of this picture Sir Joshua Reynolds remarks, and many will agree with him: \"It appears...", "...carefully chosen. Alone against Yasmini he knew he would have no chance whatever, for she was physically stronger than a panther, and as swift and graceful.

As the church clock struck <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> he threw down his rod, and, striding away along the bank, left Robert Audley to enjoy a nap which, according to that gentleman's habits, was by no means unlikely to last for two or three hours.

The romance-writing of France during the period has taken <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> different directions--the first that of the novel of incident, the second that of analysis and character. The first, now mainly deserted, was that which, as was natural when Scott was the model, was formerly most trodden; the second required the genius of George Sand and of Balzac and the more problematical talent of Beyle to attract students to it. The novels of Victor Hugo are novels of incident, with a strong infusion of purpose, and considerable but rather ideal character...", "...the Englishmen were departed thence in the morning. The Frenchmen found there great provision that the Englishmen had left behind them, because they departed in haste.

The swift, terrible punishment does indeed bear marks of the severity of that earlier stage of revelation. But it was not disproportioned to the offence, and it was not the cruelty of a martinet who avenged ceremonial lapses with penalties which should have been kept for moral offences.

If he were recognized as capable of carrying out his duties, the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> parties bound themselves by a contract, often verbal, often also made before a notary. This fixed the length of the apprenticeship, which varied greatly in different trades; for it might cover from one to six, eight, ten, or twelve years; sometimes it stipulated for a time of probation--usually a fortnight--during which time either side could cancel the agreement. The apprenticeship was not free of expense, at any rate to begin with, and the child's guardians paid an annual fee in...", "...men, either.\" \"Then ye've made up your mind to straddle out your legs and play Branscome's mule, hey?\" \"What was his special characteristic?\" The question was drawled coolly. \"He kicked when ye tried to drive him with a whip and he bit and squealed when ye tried to coax him along with sweet apples.

For the first <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three years after planting, all weeds and grass should be kept away from the stems and over the roots, either by frequent hoeing, or covering with a mulch. The best way, perhaps, to prevent the growth of weeds, is to use the land among the trees for some low-growing crops, such as beans, tomatoes, melons or potatoes, then see that the workmen, when hoeing these crops, hoe up the weeds and grass about the trees at the same time.

He was the vitalizing element in fashionable life,--the radiant sun, diffusing conventional warmth of tone and brilliancy of polish. He created modes. He regulated reputations.

The furniture was of his own fabrication. On one side hung a deerskin, sewed up in...", "...him and present him to the King. The King was so far from being displeased, that he made the Duc de Villeroy Lieutenant-General before dismissing him. There is another odd thing that I must relate before quitting this affair. Tesse, as I have said, was charged with the defence of Toulon by land. It was a charge of no slight importance. He was in a country where nothing was prepared, and where everything was wanting; the fleet of the enemy and their army were near at hand, commanded by <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the most skilful captains of the day: if they succeeded, the kingdom itself was in danger, and the road open to the enemy even to Paris. A general thus situated would have been in no humour for jesting, it might have been thought. But this was not the case with Tesse. He found time to write to Pontchartrain all the details of the war and all that passed amongst our troops in the style of Don Quixote, of whom he called himself the wretched squire and the Sancho; and everything he...", "...for many years, and he now stood where he could use it with deadly effect, if the savages should come.

At this moment the Major's horse, which was cumbered with the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> riders, was killed, and the Major himself wounded. To his assistance rushed Chalmers, who, though begged to save himself, refused, and promptly fell a sacrifice to his own gallantry. Such deeds of heroism were occurring daily.

Two days before the passover, the council finally determined that Jesus must be destroyed. They recognised all the dangers of that course.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> side-boards of the cabin floor must, of course, have square places neatly cut out to fit the uprights of the cabin.

Fixie was to be the little prince, and Lady Esther's youngest little girl the young princess, while the twins were to be <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> maids of honour. But Rosy's mother had said she would like better for her little girls to be the maids of honour, and the twins to be the queen and princess, which seemed quite right, as the party was to be in their house. And so it was settled.

In the procession of the presents, Mrs. Linley led the way. She had passed behind the screen which had thus far protected the hidden treasures from discovery, and appeared again with a vision of beauty in the shape of a doll. The dress of this wonderful creature exhibited the latest audacities of French fashion.

We do not know for certain whether black or white will emerge, but knowing the antecedent situation we expect black rather than white with a degree of assurance corresponding to the proportions of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in the box.

Its adhesion would have compelled the Transvaal, always more hostile to British rule, to come in eventually, if not at once; for the relations of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Republics were friendly enough at the time to permit one man, Pretorius, to be President of both States. The scheme was rejected by Lord Derby's Tory Cabinet, and Grey, a \"dangerous man,\" as Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary, dubbed him, was recalled. Sixteen years later, in 1875, Lord Carnarvon himself, as a member of the Disraeli Ministry, revived the project. Converted in his views of the Colonies, like many of his Tory colleagues at this period, he had carried...", "...of a passionate and somewhat sullen brunette, dark and glowing, with straight black eyebrows, very dark and very straight, which gave, oddly enough, a suggestion of oblique vision to her eyes; but her eyes were not in the least oblique, and looked at you straight from under that black line of shadow with no doubtful expression. She was shy in a kind of way, as was natural to a young woman who had never seen any society, and felt herself, on the whole, injured and unappreciated. But no <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> things could be more different than this shyness which made Barbara look you straight in the face with a kind of scared defiance, and the sweet shyness that pleaded for kind treatment in the soft eyes of little Rose, who was plain, and had the oddest longing to make people comfortable, and please them in her way, which, to be sure, was not always successful. Barbara sat down on the stool before the piano, which Miss Marjoribanks had been so obliging as to close, and thought it all...", "...banks till, four hundred miles from its mouth, it reaches the Strait of Obydos, where it is narrowed to two thousand paces. Through this channel its waters rush with immense force, calculated at five hundred thousand cubic feet in one second--sufficient to fill all the streams in Europe, and swell them to overflowing. No plummet has hitherto sounded the depth of its bed at this point, the force of the stream probably rendering the operation almost impracticable. Its last <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> great tributaries are the Tapajos, six times the length of the Thames, and the Xingu, twice that of the Rhine; while further east a narrow channel unites it with the River Para, into which flows the broad stream of the Tocantins. This river, rising in the Minas-Geraes, six hundred miles from Rio Janeiro, is one thousand six hundred miles long, and ten miles wide at its mouth. Opposite to Para is the large island of Marajo; and if Professor Agassiz is right in supposing that the...", "...at Hastings, in Nebraska, and set off with an open buggy and a fairly good livery team to find the Cuzak farm. At a little past midday, I knew I must be nearing my destination. Set back on a swell of land at my right, I saw a wide farm-house, with a red barn and an ash grove, and cattle-yards in front that sloped down to the highroad. I drew up my horses and was wondering whether I should drive in here, when I heard low voices. Ahead of me, in a plum thicket beside the road, I saw <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boys bending over a dead dog. The little one, not more than four or five, was on his knees, his hands folded, and his close-clipped, bare head drooping forward in deep dejection. The other stood beside him, a hand on his shoulder, and was comforting him in a language I had not heard for a long while. When I stopped my horses opposite them, the older boy took his brother by the hand and came toward me. He, too, looked grave. This was evidently a sad afternoon for them. 'Are you...", "...fight for them. As it was now drawing towards nightfall, and there seemed no chance of coming up with the raiders, he decided to call a halt, and, striking to the right, joined Ferrier. The men, who had marched without a murmur through the hottest hours of the day, were very glad to drop their burdens and camp. Tired though they were, they at once set about surrounding the encampment with a boma. While they were doing this, John and Ferrier, accompanied by Bill, scouted for about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> miles ahead to make sure that the raiders had not encamped in the vicinity, in which case an accidental noise might betray the safari. Discovering no sign of their presence, they returned to the men. They deliberated whether it was safe to light fires, and decided not to do so, though it meant a cold and dry supper. Before they went to sleep, Bill, who was not usually communicative, told John more completely, with Coja's aid, the story of which he had hitherto given only...", "...her of the menstrual distress and all other pain. The treatment for displacement consist of placing medicated pieces of wool or cotton, called tampons, in the vagina in such a position as to hold the womb, _as_ nearly in its proper place as is possible. After a time nature will so strengthen the ligaments that they will hold the womb and a cure is, therefore, affected. The length of time necessary to cure depends upon the length of time the displacement has existed. It may take, from <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> to four months. When the displacement is of long standing and is accompanied with more or less inflammation, adhesions sometimes grow between the womb and the adjacent organs. It is necessary to resort to surgery in such cases, but the result is always good and the danger practically nothing.

Here, in the moment's intensity of this comradeship with madness, observe how beautiful the whole thing becomes; how instinctively the imagination of the poet turns what is sordid into a radiance, all stars and flowers and the divine part of forgetfulness! It is a symbol of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> sides of his own life: the side open to the street, and the side turned away from it, where he could \"hush and bless himself with silence.\" No one ever worshipped beauty more devoutly, and just as we see him here transfiguring a dreadful thing with beauty, so we shall see, everywhere in his work, that he never admitted an emotion which he could not so transfigure. He knew his limits only too well; he knew that the deeper and graver things of life were for the most part outside the...", "...in any hard place. After a battle, or when it was a holiday, or when he was very thankful for something, King David used to make songs, and sing them before the people. Some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been forgotten. After all these hundreds and hundred of years, we sing them still; we call them Psalms. Often, after David had made a song, his chief musician would sing with him, as the people gathered to worship God. Sometimes the singers were divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> great choruses, and went to the service in two processions; then one chorus would sing a verse of David's song, and the other procession would answer with the next, and then both would sing together; it was very beautiful to hear. Even now, we sometimes do that with the songs of David in our churches. One of his Psalms that everybody loves is a song that David made when he remembered the days before he came to Saul's camp. He remembered the days and nights he used to spend in the...", "...but the Illinois were still spoken of as the Illinois, and the district was not merged in Louisiana, though it was annexed to that province, to give the company access to Canada, in which the monopoly of the beaver-trade had been granted to them. It has been already observed, that the limits of the Hudson's Bay territories and French Canada were settled by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713: one great object of that treaty was to provide against the commercial disputes of the subjects of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> crowns, which had led to a series of conflicts on the shores of Hudson's Bay; it was in furtherance of this object that the fur-trade of Canada was now diverted from the St. Lawrence to the Mississippi, by this grant of the monopoly of the beaver-trade to the Compagnie d'Occident, and the annexation of the Illinois country to Louisiana. Upon the surrender of Canada to the British arms, considerable discussion arose as to the respective limits of the provinces of Canada and...", "...in time. Up to the present, very few white men have penetrated any distance into the interior of the Labrador peninsula, and I do not see that they are very likely to, in the near future. But we never can tell. A few years ago we would have said the same of the Yukon region, so that it would be a wise precaution to have set apart a considerable section of the Labrador, in the interior, as a sanctuary.... It would perhaps be better to have <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> regions set apart, one near the Saguenay country and another nearer the Atlantic coast. We have, however, to consider the fact that sanctuaries will be of no value unless they are well guarded. In the case of the birds the conditions are bad; the destruction on the Labrador is horrible to contemplate. The outer islands were scoured by crews from foreign vessels, and whole loads of eggs carried off. There has not been much of this done in...", "...one soon gets used to it. Still it happened to Dora the other day that she said to V.: I don't want any _intercourse_. And that really means \"the utmost gifts of love,\" so Mad. told her. But V. was so well-mannered that he did not show that he noticed anything; and it did not occur to Dora until afterwards what she had said. It's really awfully stupid that every ordinary word should have such a meaning. I shall be so frightfully careful what I say now, so that I shan't use any word with <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> meanings. Mad. says it's just the same in French. We don't know whether it is the same in English and we could never dream of asking that awful fright, Miss Lundy. Very likely she does not know the first thing about it anyhow. I know a great deal more than Hella now, but I can't tell her because of betraying Dora and Mad.

Edwards had writhed, changed color, started to speak and caught himself back, showed all the agony of a clumsy criminal who dreads the probing that may give him away: temperament; the rotten spot in his affairs.

It concerned his bride; but he'd take punishment well. I proceeded to let him have it. \"I can see that...", "...among the pursuits that occupied his academic hours, those of playing at hazard, sparring, and keeping a bear and bull-dogs, were, if not the most favourite, at least, perhaps, the most innocent.

Eleven months later, in October, 1911, a majority of the voters conferred the suffrage on the 400,000 women of California. These <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> elections doubtless marked the turning-point in this country. In 1890 Wyoming came into the Union with suffrage for women in its constitution after they had been voting in the Territory for twenty-one years. In 1893 the voters of Colorado, by a majority of 6,347, gave full suffrage to women. In 1895 the men of Utah, where as a Territory women had voted seventeen years, by a vote of 28,618 ayes to 2,687 noes, gave them this right in its constitution for Statehood. In 1896 Idaho, by...", "...with which God has adorned our earthly abode. See how it glitters with burnished worlds, more numerous than the dust of earth. All are in motion.

The range of cucumber extends from western New York to Alabama, following the Appalachian mountains; and westward to Illinois and Mississippi, appearing west of the Mississippi river in Arkansas. It occurs on low rocky slopes, the banks of mountain streams, and on rich bottom land. It is of largest size and is most abundant in the narrow valleys in eastern Tennessee and the western parts of the Carolinas. The tree is from <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> to four feet in diameter, and sixty to ninety feet high. The trunk is of good form for sawlogs. Among its local names are pointed-leaf magnolia, black lin, magnolia, and mountain magnolia. The wood of cucumber resembles that of yellow poplar in appearance and in physical properties, except that it is ten per cent heavier than poplar. It usually passes for that wood at sawmill and factory. The Federal census credits it with less than a million feet a year as lumber.

Now the men were quite close to where he--Kennard--still stood cowering. A minute or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> later they had passed down the street. Their hoarse voices soon died away in the distance. Kennard crept cautiously out of his hiding-place. Message or mere coincidence, he now blessed that mysterious scrap of paper.

On the basis of probability, then, the field is narrowed to 1616-19.[3] More or less presumptive evidence may be adduced for a yet more specific dating. During these years that Field acted with the King's Men, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> plays appeared which bear strong internal evidence of being products of his collaboration with Massinger and Fletcher: _The Knight of Malta_ and _The Queen of Corinth_. While several parallels of phraseology are afforded for _The Fatal Dowry_ by these (as, indeed, by every one of the works of Massinger) they are not nearly so numerous or so striking as similarities discoverable between it and certain other dramas of the Massinger _corpus_.

The country on the south-side was a low prairie, that on the north highland. September 29.

At nine o'clock we saw the second chief and two women and three men on shore, who wished us to take <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> women offered by the second chief to make friends, which was refused; he then requested us to take them to the other band of their nation, who were on the river not far from us: this we declined; but in spite of our wishes they followed us along shore.

The exhibitionist's attitude of mind is well illustrated by one of Garnier's patients who declared that he never wished to be seen by more than <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> women at once, \"just what is necessary,\" he added, \"for an exchange of impressions.\" After each exhibition he would ask himself anxiously: \"Did they see me? What are they thinking? What do they say to each other about me? Oh! how I should like to know!\" Another patient of Garnier's, who haunted churches for this purpose, made this very significant statement: \"Why do I like going to churches?

Most masters agree (and I believe they are right) that the first thing to be taught to any pupil, is how to draw an outline of such things as can be outlined. Now, there are two kinds of outline--the soft and hard. One must be executed with a soft instrument, as a piece of chalk or lead; and the other with some instrument producing for ultimate result a firm line of equal darkness; as a pen with ink, or the engraving tool on wood or metal. And these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> kinds of outline have both of them their particular objects and uses, as well as their proper scale of size in work. Thus Raphael will sketch a miniature head with his pen, but always takes chalk if he draws of the size of life. So also Holbein, and generally the other strong masters.

I intended to take a French guide, or dragoman, who had been with me for some days, and to put myself under the peculiar guardianship of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Bedouin Arabs, who were to accompany me as long as I should remain east of Jerusalem. This travelling through the desert under the protection of Bedouins was, in idea, pleasant enough; and I must here declare that I did not at all begrudge the forty shillings which I was told by our British consul that I must pay them for their trouble, in accordance with the established tariff. But I did begrudge the fact of the tariff. I would rather have fallen in with my friendly Arabs, as...", "...and the proceedings began immediately. The room was crowded, and amongst the forty girls nobody seemed to have particularly remarked Flossie's absence, and no enquiry was made for her, until the close of the song that preceded her violin solo. \"Where is Flossie Taylor?\" whispered Vivian then, with a look of marked annoyance on her face. \"Her _Serenade_ comes next. She ought to be standing by the piano. Has anybody seen her? Please pass the question on.\" She paused a moment or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in great impatience; then, as no Flossie put in an appearance, she turned to Meta Fletcher and May Turner, who followed on the programme, and asked them to begin their duet. \"I can't wait for anybody,\" she remarked. \"If Flossie isn't ready, I must simply miss her out. We've almost too many pieces to get through in the time.\" The rest of the music went off successfully.

After many unsuccessful attempts, captain Lewis at last, by winding around the ridges, approached a party of seven, which were on an eminence, towards which the wind was unfortunately blowing. The only male of the party frequently encircled the summit of the hill, as if to announce any danger to the females, who formed a group at the top. Although they did not see captain Lewis, the smell alarmed them, and they fled when he was at the distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hundred yards: he immediately ran to the spot where they had been, a ravine concealed them from him, but the next moment they appeared on a second ridge at the distance of three miles.

In America, and in many parts of the continent, it is customary to have carriages long, broad, and high, with an avenue down the middle, and short seats for two persons each on either side of the avenue; every person looks towards the engine, and there is a plentiful supply of window on both sides. In America, these short seats are not only cushioned, but each seat has its <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> elbows and its cushioned back. Another English annoyance, is the _ticket-taking_.

But Orsini retorted swiftly, 'lifting' horses and cattle that belonged to his enemies and making prisoners of their retainers. Among others he took <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men who belonged to the Protonotary. And the latter, unable to leave Rome in safety, began to fortify himself in the Cardinal's house with many fighting men, and with many strange weapons, 'bombardelle, cerobottane,' and guns and catapults. Whereupon the Pope sent for Orsini, and commanded him, as the faithful adherent of the Church, to go and take the Protonotary prisoner to his house. But while Orsini was marshalling his troops with those of Jerome Riario, at Monte Giordano and...", "...in many places, and fields not long cleared, being densely filled with it as with a crop, to the exclusion of everything else.

It chanced that I saw no asters in bloom along the road for fifty miles, though they were so abundant then in Massachusetts,--except in one place one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of the aster acuminatus,--and no golden-rods till within twenty miles of Monson, where I saw a three-ribbed one. There were many late buttercups, however, and the two fire-weeds, erechthites and epilobium, commonly where there had been a burning, and at last the pearly everlasting. I noticed occasionally very long troughs which supplied the road with water, and my companion said that three dollars annually were granted by the State to one man in each school-district, who provided...", "...but left a posthumous note to an edition of his letters calculated, perhaps intended, to mystify future inquirers. The lady, a Mrs. Weston, to whom the note pointed, did not die till 1724, and could therefore not have committed suicide in 1717. The mystification was childish enough, though if Pope had committed no worse crime of the kind, one would not consider him to be a very grievous offender. The inquiries of Mr. Dilke, who cleared up this puzzle, show that there were in fact <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ladies, Mrs. Weston and a Mrs. Cope, known to Pope about this time, both of whom suffered under some domestic persecution. Pope seems to have taken up their cause with energy, and sent money to Mrs. Cope when, at a later period, she was dying abroad in great distress. His zeal seems to have been sincere and generous, and it is possible enough that the elegy was a reflection of his feelings, though it suggested an imaginary state of facts. If this be so, the reference to the lady in...", "...it with the Babylonian Zagmuku. Sayce's supposition (_Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch._ xix. 280, 281) is not to be taken seriously. The origin of the Jewish feast and fast of Purim is still obscure. The fact that there is both a fast (14th Adar) and a festival (15th Adar) is a safe indication of antiquity. Zimmern's view of a possible relationship between Purim and Zagmuku is untenable, but that there is a connection between Purim and _some_ Babylonian festival follows from the fact that the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> chief personages in the Book of Esther--namely, Mordecai and Esther--bear names identical with the two Babylonian deities, Marduk and Ishtar. This cannot be an accident. On the other hand, Haman and Vashti, according to Jensen (_Wiener Zeits. f.d. Kunde des Morgenlandes_, vi. 70), are Elamitic names of deities corresponding to the Babylonian Marduk and Ishtar. The case for Vashti is not clearly made out by Jensen, but, for all that, it is certain that the Babylonian elements in the...", "...was merely her impatience at being kept a few moments longer from her sergeant after having been detained an hour by a quarrel of the Enslees--a quarrel ending in a defiant announcement from Willie that he was going to see the wickedest show he could find in Paris, and from Persis an hilarious \"_Bonne chance!_ I hope you find somebody to take you off my hands for a while!\" This had horrified Willie as a sacrilege, and he had regretted his vow.

In this year an eighteen-gun ship from Cambridge, Mass., fell in with a Barbary pirate of twenty guns, and was hard put to it to escape. And, as the seventeenth century drew near its close, these pests of the sea so increased, that evil was sure to befall the peaceful merchantman that put to sea without due preparation for a fight or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> with the sea robbers.

The chapel was darkened, though it was broad daylight; and the face of the person that attracted Ernest's attention was concealed by her head-dress and veil. But that bend of the neck, so simply graceful, so humbly modest, recalled to his heart but one image. Every one has, perhaps, observed that there is a physiognomy (if the bull may be pardoned) of /form/ as well as face, which it rarely happens that <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> persons possess in common. And this, with most, is peculiarly marked in the turn of the head, the outline of the shoulders, and the ineffable something that characterises the postures of each individual in repose.

Therefore, let us keep our minds on two or three simple, essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment. It is true that while business and industry are definitely better our relief rolls are still too large. However, for the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined instead of increased during the winter months. They are still declining. The simple fact is that many million more people have private work today than <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> years ago today or one year ago today, and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who want to work. In spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem here as in every other nation, we have come to recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful remedial measures. These measures are of two kinds. The first is to make provisions intended to relieve, to minimize, and to prevent future unemployment; the second is to establish the...", "...moving from boarding-house to hotel as Bradley went up or down.

Sometimes the young ash, shooting up after being cut, takes fantastic shapes instead of rising straight. The branch loses its roundness and flattens out to a width of three or four inches, curling round at the top like the conventional scroll ornament.

He gave an account, in a letter to Bishop Hough, of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> highly interesting conversations, one with Malbranche, the other with Boileau. Malbranche expressed great partiality for the English, and extolled the genius of Newton, but shook his head when Hobbes was mentioned, and was indeed so unjust as to call the author of the Leviathan a poor silly creature. Addison's modesty restrained him from fully relating, in his letter, the circumstances of his introduction to Boileau.

It is known by experience that one great poet in every age is more than nature supplies; for although certain favoured periods have had <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three, there are long intervals of time without any. Yet I believe that in the course of my reign there have not been fewer than twenty writers of verse, who, in defiance of nature, have required of me that they may be great poets; and so insatiable are they, that not one of them is content to be less a poet than Milton. My rejection of these writers is called a prejudice against living poets, which judgment is said to be entirely mistaken: for Milton was once alive. Those who...", "...quelled by the uproar. We knew now, if we had not before divined it, that our great city was with us as one man, utterly united in the great cause we were marching to sustain. This grand fact I learned by two senses.

My fellow-citizens smote me on the knapsack, as I went by at the gun-rope, and encouraged me each in his own dialect. \"Bully for you!\" alternated with benedictions, in the proportion of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> \"bullies\" to one blessing.

Everything was gone from her deck, even the house and rail. There was not as much loose wood on deck as would make a tooth-pick. Afterwards we learned that <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> seas hove her down so that they had to cut the spars away to right her, and then just as she was coming up another monster had caught her and swept her clean--not only swept clean, but stove in her planks and started some of her beams so that she began to leak in a fashion that four men to the pumps could just manage to keep up with.

Not in the case of the third (place), as it is thus perceived. The third 'place' does not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the fifth oblation. The term,'the third place,' denotes mere evil-doers. That these do not, for the origination of a new body, depend on the fifth oblation, is seen from Scripture. For, in answer to the question 'Do you know why that world never becomes full?' the text says, 'On neither of these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ways are those small creatures continually returning, of whom it may be said, Live and die. This is the third place. Therefore that world never becomes full.' As this passage states that in consequence of 'the third place' (i.e. the creatures forming a third class) not ascending to and descending from the heavenly world that world never becomes full, it follows that that third place does not, for the origination of bodies, depend on the fifth oblation.

Bentley had <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> tickets for Drury Lane Theatre. It was \"The Critic\" again; immediately after, as if in spite of that good lesson, \"The Haunted Inn\" was performed, and the two gentlemen called _Matthews_ and _Litton_ so annoyed me with their low wit that I often thought that, could Shakespeare or Garrick be raised from their peaceful places of rest, tears of sorrow would have run down their cheeks to see how abused their darling theatre was this night. Bentley was more fortunate than I, he went to...", "...of making the capital secure, after his back should be turned. It was impossible to leave three thousand choice troops to guard Count Egmont. A less number seemed insufficient to prevent a rescue. He had, therefore, no longer delayed the chastisement which had already been determined, but which the events in the north had precipitated. Thus the only positive result of Louis Nassau's victory was the execution of his imprisoned friends. The expedition under Aremberg had failed from <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> causes. The Spanish force had been inadequate, and they had attacked the enemy at a disadvantage. The imprudent attack was the result of the contempt with which they had regarded their antagonist. These errors were not to be repeated. Alva ordered Count Meghem, now commanding in the province of Groningen, on no account to hazard hostilities until the game was sure. He also immediately ordered large reinforcements to move forward to the seat of war. The commanders intrusted with...", "...and there were some respectable {508} persons in the neighborhood who were not free from doubts that he had already become a parish-patriot, and joined the Ribbon Society. He was high and overbearing toward his equals, harsh and unkind to his inferiors, while he was cringing and sycophantic toward his superiors. There was nothing manly or straightforward, nothing ingenuous or affectionate, about him. In fact, if ever a man's temper and disposition justified the opinion that he had \"the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ways\" in him, they were those of Thomas Murdock. His father was a rich farmer, whose land joined that of old Ned Cavana, of whom he was a contemporary in years, and with whom he had kept pace in industry and wealth. Thomas Murdock was an only son, as Winny Cavana was an only daughter, and the two old men were of the same mind now as regarded the future lot of their children. A few words now of Edward Lennon, and we can get on. He was the eldest of five in the family. They...", "...years very happily; their days glided on like a clear stream in the summer noon. There were few husbands and wives who enjoyed as much nuptial happiness as fell to the lot of this Indian couple. Among that people the duties allotted to the female sex are both laborious and incessant; with Ampato Sapa, they were ameliorated by the kindness of her husband, who, in defiance of the customs of our people, performed the greater part of her tasks herself. Their union had been blessed with <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> children, upon whom both parents doated with a depth of feeling unknown to those who have other treasures besides those which spring from nature. The man had acquired a reputation as a hunter, which drew around him many families who were happy to place themselves under his protection, and avail themselves of such part of his chace, as he needed not for the support of his family. Desirous of strengthening their interest with him, some of them invited him to form a connexion with...", "...whole looks more like a rose than an apple blossom. In these cases it will usually be found that the calyx consists of distinct sepals, without a trace of the ordinary swelling beneath the flower. The petals are often more numerous than usual; the stamens variously changed, and the carpels sometimes absent; at other times, as in the instance figured in the adjacent woodcuts, figs. 36, 37, consisting of separate, superior ovaries, sometimes destitute of ovules, or, at other times, having <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> of these bodies.[85] [Illustration: FIG. 35.--Proliferous Rose. Showing an absence of the usual dilatation of the flower-stalk, and other changes.] This condition accords precisely with the account of the development of the flowers in _Pomaceae_ as given by Payer, Caspary, and others, so that the flowers above described would owe their deficiency of the swollen receptacle to an arrest of development.

But if there be any difference, the best way to determine it is to awaken them one after the other, and by their conduct to decide which ought to be deemed the most beautiful.' This proposal of Caschcasch's pleased equally both Maimoune and Danhasch. Maimoune then changed herself into a gnat, and leaping on the prince's neck stung him so smartly that he awoke, and put up his hand to the place; but Maimoune skipped away, and resumed her own form, which, like those of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> genies, was invisible, the better to observe what he would do. In drawing back his hand, the prince chanced to let it fall on that of the Princess of China, and on opening his eyes, was exceedingly surprised to perceive a lady of the greatest beauty. He raised his head and leaned on his elbow, the better to consider her. She was so beautiful that he could not help crying out, 'What beauty! my heart! my soul!' In saying which he kissed her with so little caution that she would...", "...on out to the street. When the whistle sounded, John went out into the Mill to stand near the window where the workmen passing in line received their envelopes. From every part of the great main building, from the yards and the several outer sheds and structures they came.

The converging paths of individuals touched, and <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> walked side by side. Other individuals joined the two and as quickly trios and quartets came together to form groups that united with other similar groups; while from the mass thus assembled, the thin line was formed that extended past the pay clerk's window and linked the Mill to the outer world.

Before we can discuss the absolute advantages of the elective system we must make preliminary inquiries as to whether the geographical position, the laws, the habits, the manners, and the opinions of the people amongst whom it is to be introduced will admit of the establishment of a weak and dependent executive government; for to attempt to render the representative of the State a powerful sovereign, and at the same time elective, is, in my opinion, to entertain <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> incompatible designs. To reduce hereditary royalty to the condition of an elective authority, the only means that I am acquainted with are to circumscribe its sphere of action beforehand, gradually to diminish its prerogatives, and to accustom the people to live without its protection. Nothing, however, is further from the designs of the republicans of Europe than this course: as many of them owe their hatred of tyranny to the sufferings which they have personally undergone, it is...", "...insensible on the floor--insensible she concluded from shock at seeing Mr. Barton dead, for she had realised in an instant that the old man had been murdered.

At all costs, to him, to her, to any one, she must save him. The whole thing had been a matter of two minutes--the result was one spreading alas, not merely over <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> years, but over a lifetime. He was obliged to confess that strictly speaking she had been, or, as he preferred to put it, her judgment had been wrong--very wrong. True to his word, he had lost no time in placing Gerald formally in possession of the Manor House, and Miriam of her income under the will.

Poor Limby, although only <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> years old, knew what he was at--he was trying to get the master of his mamma; he felt he had gained his point, and gave another kick and a squall, at the same time planted a blow on his mother's eye. 'Dear little creature,' said she, 'he is in a state of high convulsions and fever--he will never recover.' But Limby did recover, and in a few days was running about the house, and the master of it; there was nobody to be considered, nobody to be consulted, nobody to be attended...", "...huts and putting them up. The Englishmen, however, as soon as they saw their mode of proceeding, greatly lightened their labours. The rest of the men went out hunting, and before evening returned with a plentiful supply of game.

After the Indians had left them, the young girl came fearlessly into their midst, bringing the fish she had caught as her present to Oliver and the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> officers, for she at once distinguished them from the rest of the men. She had then a further talk with Oliver; she inquired whether he would be willing to accompany her in her canoe up the stream, and as they would have a long way to go, he must assist in paddling, but no one else must accompany them, nor must the Indians or his own friends know where they had gone. There might be some danger, she confessed, though it was not such as to make her hesitate if she could serve her...", "...However the Event must of Necessity be tedious, the Dutch being already possess'd of all the King's Forts in the Archipelago; and their numerous Fleets of all the Ports, Fairs, and Trade, with Factories conveniently settled for their Intercourse between India and their own Country.

The recital of the events spoken of above brings us well into the eighth volume of the \"Histoire de ma Vie\"; and as there are but ten in all, the treatment of the things that follow is pursued with much less detail, and with many a gap, which the malevolent among our author's contemporaries would assure us that they know well how to fill up. Between the extreme reserve of the last <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> volumes and the wild assertions of so many we would gladly keep the _juste milieu_, if we could; but we wish only truth, and it is not at the hands of the scandalmongers of any society--is it?--that we seek that commodity.

We afterwards addressed a letter to the governors demanding the arrest of these <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men on the above grounds, but we were not sanguine of obtaining their consent, as it was evident that the government officials were unable to exercise any control over the Tosa people. Very little progress was made after this, as was natural enough, seeing that the Tosa people were entirely innocent of any share in the murders, as was afterwards proved. On October 6 I had an opportunity of conversing amicably with the vice-governor. I said that the Tosa people tried to throw...", "...true that from a civilised standpoint these prizes would not be considered of much value, but by these young Indians they were much valued. And then the honour of being the winner is just as much prized by them as it has ever been in more highly favoured lands.

The result was that all the lessons were in the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> languages, with a decided preference for the English as their studies advanced. This was the first opportunity the boys had had of seeing the methods, by which Mr Evans's syllabic characters were taught to the Indians.

In 1880 he became the candidate for mayor of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> factions of the Democracy--Tammany Hall and Irving Hall--and was elected by a few hundred votes. About the first thing he did was to quarrel with John Kelly, the leader of Tammany. Kelly had sent around a list of appointments he wanted Grace to make. \"Can they do the work?\" the mayor asked. Kelly looked at him in surprise. \"What difference does it make?\" he asked. \"They are organization men.\" \"The fact that they are organization men doesn't make any difference, either,\"...", "...made another trip to Dawson City, and this time he took with him both Randy and Earl.

Now this would be a matter of very little interest, were it not that a great deal is made of Palamedes elsewhere in Philostratus' narrative. What it all means is difficult to say with a Damis and Philostratus as interpreters between ourselves and the silent and enigmatical Apollonius. Palamedes was one of the heroes before Troy, who was fabled to have invented letters, or to have completed the alphabet of Cadmus.[103] Now from <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> obscure sayings (iv. 13, 33), we glean that our philosopher looked upon Palamedes as the philosopher-hero of the Trojan period, although Homer says hardly a word about him. Was this, then, the reason why Apollonius was so anxious to restore his statue? Not altogether so; there appears to have been a more direct reason. Damis would have it that Apollonius had met Palamedes in India; that he was at the monastery; that Iarchas had one day pointed out a young ascetic who could \"write...", "...ridge-pole is a peculiar feature; it is fastened to the ridge of the thatch by strong twisted ropes, that give it an ornamental appearance; and its carved ends project at both gables, or rather, over the \"hip roofs,\" to the length of a foot, or more; it is further ornamented by white shells, those of the _cyprea ovula_ being most used for the purpose.

The _Tours to the British Mountains, with the Descriptive Poems of Lowther and Emont Vale_ (London, 1824), have been referred to in the note to _The Solitary Reaper_, vol. ii. p. 399, one of the poems in the \"Memorials of a Tour in Scotland, 1803.\" It is an interesting volume--the prose much superior to the verse--and might be reprinted with advantage.

Some readers may perhaps think this a stupid question, and perhaps so it was; but Willie was not therefore stupid. People sometimes _appear_ stupid because they have more things to think about than they can well manage; while those who think only about one or two things may, on the contrary, _appear_ clever when just those one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> things happen to be talked about. \"What is my business, Willie?

If Mr. Gosse had himself been fully imbued with such principles would he have made the statement quoted in chapter <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> in regard to Browning's later books? And should we have such senseless criticism as a remark which has become popular lately, and which I believe emanated from a university in the South--namely, that Browning never said anything that Tennyson had not said better?

As James looked up, he too felt for the first time the piercing power of those eyes, but to him it brought no terror, only joy, as he yielded himself wholly to his teacher's scrutiny. In silence the two stood, reading each the other's soul. James felt, instinctively, that his new friend knew and understood everything that had happened to him, all his life long; that there was no need to tell him anything, or to explain anything. Of an older friendship between <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men it was written, 'Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.' Thus it proved once more in that crowded dungeon. No details remain of the interview; no record of what James said, or what George said. No one else could have reported what passed between them, and, though each of them has left a mention of their first meeting, the silence remains unbroken.

In the camp actual famine prevailed--the -modius- of wheat cost 50 -denarii- (1 pound 16 shillings)--and dangerous diseases broke out; whereas on the left bank there were accumulated provisions and varied supplies, as well as troops of all sorts--reinforcements from Gaul of cavalry and archers, officers and soldiers from furlough, foraging parties returning--in all a mass of 6000 men, whom the Pompeians attacked with superior force and drove with great...", "...and honest officer, well qualified for his business, and extremely accurate in all his work.

A real representative government was, of course, impossible in Paraguay, but the Creoles, who naturally formed the bulk of the Congress, were desirous of insuring themselves against another dictatorship. They wanted a government where the offices would be passed around. However, an executive was necessary and the only executive they knew was an irresponsible one. The title borne by Yegros and Francia in the early days seemed a good one, and so it was agreed that <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> consuls should be elected for a limited period, during which, however, they were to exercise very limited power. Among the ambitious and turbulent deputies a directing spirit arose in the person of Carlos Antonio Lopez, a well-to-do rancher who had received a lawyer's education and had been careful to keep out of public view during Francia's reign. At this juncture he inevitably came to the front, because he was the most learned and far-sighted among his fellow Creoles.

But after a day or two we shook down, as British boys will, to our lot. After all, it was only a case of putting off our holiday, and meanwhile we were allowed to do anything we liked, short of setting the place on fire, or kicking up a row near the infirmary. There were enough of us to turn out <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> good teams at football, or to run a big paper-chase across country, or get up a grand concert of an evening; and not too many of us to crowd into the long dormitory, where, for all we were interfered with, we might have prolonged our bolster matches \"from eve to dewy morn.\" In time we came to look upon our confinement as rather a spree than otherwise, and this feeling was considerably heightened by the arrival of several hampers at the beginning of Christmas week, including a...", "...of her players.

The White Indians were guarding well the egress from the creek of the frozen steam. Hastening to the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> struggling figures, Waseche jerked them to their feet, and before the surprised O'Brien knew what was happening, he was being unceremoniously hustled into the narrow valley from which he had just emerged--and none too soon, for as they passed between the pillared rocks, the Indians broke cover and rushed boldly upon them, hurling their copper-tipped harpoons as they ran.

He had been made prominent by a daring fight at Belmont, Missouri, on the 7th of November (1861) against a largely superior force under the command of the Confederate General Pillow. For the numbers engaged it was one of the most sanguinary conflicts of the war. The quarter-master of the expedition intimated to General Grant that in case of a reverse he had but <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> small steamers for transportation to the Illinois shore.

He then waited for a second antagonist, and, if again victorious, for a third, till he was at last, in his turn, defeated. A singular rule observed in these combats is, that whilst any <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> are preparing to fight, a third person may step in, and choose either of them for his antagonist, when the other is obliged to withdraw. Sometimes three or four followed each other in this manner, before the match was settled.

It was, if I remember rightly, on the 24th of July that we went to Spithead to see those four magnificent ships, the \"Queen,\" \"Vengeance,\" \"St. Vincent,\" and \"Howe,\" riding at anchor there. Though the morning was calm, a light breeze sprung up just as we got...", "...and of succour. I went to her and drew her gently into another apartment. The old man, tremulous and wonder-struck, seemed anxious to perform some service. I directed him to kindle a fire in Eliza's chamber. Meanwhile I persuaded my gentle friend to remain in this chamber, and resign to me the performance of every office which her sister's condition required. I sat beside the bed of the dying till the mortal struggle was past. I perceived that the house had no inhabitant besides the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> females and the old man. I went in search of the latter, and found him crouched, as before, at the kitchen-fire, smoking his pipe. I placed myself on the same bench, and entered into conversation with him. I gathered from him that he had, for many years, been Mr. Hadwin's servant. That lately he had cultivated a small farm in this neighbourhood for his own advantage. Stopping one day in October, at the tavern, he heard that his old master had lately been in the city, had caught...", "...much hot, dry weather between May and October. The fall and winter storms are more certain than those of summer, and the parts of the reserve lying above 8,000 feet are usually buried in snow before spring--frequently with several feet of snow on a level. The amount of snow increases steadily with increase of altitude. Some of the winter storms are severe, and on one occasion, while living at an altitude of 7,500 feet, I witnessed a storm during which snow fell continuously for nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> days. The weather was perfectly calm at the time, and after the first day the pine trees became so loaded that an almost continual succession of reports were heard from the breaking of large branches. At the close of the storm there was a measured depth of 26 inches of snow on a level at an altitude of 7,500 feet. A thousand feet lower, on the plains of the Little Colorado, a few miles to the north, only a foot of snow fell, while at higher altitudes the amount was much greater...", "...in a few dayes he had ioyned togither souldiers, and made prouision necessarie for the iourney; and spent therein a great part of his substance, and departed altogether from the valley of Saint Bartholomew the tenth of Nouember, 1582, and carry with him (for whatsoeuer should happen) one hundred and fifteene horses and mules, great stoare of weapons and munition, with victuals, and certaine people of seruice in this iourney necessarie.

Sir We said: \"Should we long to see you at some later time, my son can make inquiries.\" Old Dschang placed his wife on a donkey and gave her a straw hat to wear. He himself took his staff and walked after. A few years passed without any news from either of them. Then Sir We and his wife felt quite a longing to see their daughter and sent their son to make inquiries. When the latter got back in the hills he met a plow-boy who was plowing with <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> yellow steers. He asked him: \"Where is Old Dschang's country house?\" The plow-boy left the plow in the harrow, bowed and answered: \"You have been a long time coming, sir! The village is not far from here: I will show you the way.\" They crossed a hill. At the foot of the hill flowed a brook, and when they had crossed the brook they had to climb another hill. Gradually the landscape changed. From the top of the hill could be seen a valley, level in the middle, surrounded by abrupt...", "...squires around there. I answered that I was the only one I knew of and that if she liked she could use me as her own. It was all arranged in the twinkling of an eye. She promised me sixty coppers for my meals and wages. I took the job and offered her my arm. I threw away the cane because I didn't need it anymore, and I was only using it to appear sickly and move people to pity. She sent the child home, telling him to have the maid set the table and get dinner ready. For more than <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> hours she took me from pillar to post, up one street and down another. The lady told me that when she got to the first house we were going to stop at, I was to go up to the house first and ask for the master or mistress of the house, and say, \"My lady, Juana Perez (that was her name), is here and would like to pay her respects.\" She also told me that whenever I was with her and she stopped anywhere, I was always to take off my hat. I told her I knew what a servant's duties...", "...down the stream at a rapid rate. They were farther out than the keel-boat had been; and the rushing water, lifted into waves by its own force, began to tumble about as it would have done in the wilder rapids of Niagara. None of the four were skilful boatmen, and there seemed to be no one in particular in the skiff to take the lead. As usually happens on such occasions, the two men without paddles were frightened, and stood up, which was the worst possible thing they could do. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> who were managing the boat did not agree as to the method of handling it, and each wanted his own way of doing it. Each of them was sure he could do it, and that the other could not. The couple with the paddles could not use them; and the skiff whirled as it mounted the waves, and then it heeled over from one side to the other. The two men who were standing up jumped from one side to the other; then one of them lost his balance, and tumbled overboard. The second tried to save...", "...Nat. \"He has run away with our money.\" \"Has Mr. Dart run away?\" asked the sick man, nervously. \"Yes.\" \"Oh! And to think I borrowed that money from my poor sister!\" came with a cry of anguish, and then the sick man sank on the hallway stairs, thoroughly overcome. CHAPTER XIV NAT OBTAINS ANOTHER SITUATION \"How is it that you know so much about this man?\" asked Nat, after he had collected his thoughts. \"I am a police official from Chicago,\" answered one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men who had tried to catch Hamilton Dart. \"We have been on this rascal's trail for some time.\" \"Is Hamilton Dart his real name?\" \"No; his real name is Nick Smithers. He is a sly rogue.\" \"Do you think there is any chance of catching him?\" asked Harry Bray. \"I cannot afford to lose my money.\" \"Nor I,\" added our hero. \"I must have my money back!\" groaned the sick man. \"What will my sister say? She got it out of the bank only yesterday!\" \"I wish I could help you,\" said...", "...still unable to believe that the handsome, chivalrous captain had wronged them, and that everything would be found right upon examination of matters which was immediately and searchingly entered upon; but the first glance at affairs showed conclusively that they had been swindled, and it was soon discovered that he had gathered together at the stores under his own charge, and at different points along the line, under various pretexts, fully fourteen thousand dollars, and had been given <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> weeks in which to escape. Mr. Kuhn did not desire to give the case into my hands on that morning; but explained that he had returned from a fruitless trip to Philadelphia in search of his former superintendent, and had been advised by a telegram from his brothers to lay the case before me and request my advice about the matter; at the same time securing information about the probable pecuniary outlay necessary for further prosecution of the search, and such other items of...", "...at Fettercairn, but not nearly so nice and cheerful; there was a drawing-room and a dining-room; and we had a very good-sized bedroom. Albert had a dressing-room of equal size. Mary Andrews (who was very useful and efficient) and Lady Churchill's maid had a room together, every one being in the house; but unfortunately there was hardly anything to eat, and there was only tea, and two miserable starved Highland chickens, without any potatoes! No pudding, and no _fun_; no little maid (the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> there not wishing to come in), nor our two people--who were wet and drying our and their things--to wait on us! It was not a nice supper; and the evening was wet. As it was late, we soon retired to rest. Mary and Maxted (Lady Churchill's maid) had been dining below with Grant, Brown, and Stewart (who came the same as last time, with the maids) in the \"commercial room\" at the foot of the stairs. They had only the remnants of our two starved chickens!' The ascent of the hill of...", "...back. \"You are a dear, Wilfred,\" she comforted, \"and I couldn't manage to get on without you, but you aren't marriageable--at least, not yet.\" \"Why not?\" he argued. \"I've stood back and twirled my thumbs all through your _debut_ winter. I've been Patience without the comfort of a pedestal. Now, will you give me three minutes to show you that you are not acting fairly, or nicely at all?\" \"Duck!\" warned the girl, and once more they fell silent in the sheer physical delight of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> healthy young animals, clean-blooded and sport- loving, as the tall jib swept down; the \"high side\" swept up, and the boat hung for an exhilarating moment on the verge of capsizing. As it righted itself again, like the craft of a daring airman banking the pylons, the girl gave him a bright nod. \"Now, go ahead,\" she acceded, \"you have three minutes to put yourself in nomination as the exemplar of your age and times.\" CHAPTER XV The young man settled back, and stuffed...", "...in boats, the expedition reached Congo on the 4th of January, 1861. Here a flagstaff and a custom-house (a floorless hut of mangrove stakes roofed with stakes) had been erected. The garrison of the place being almost starved, the provisions of the expedition also ran short, though they obtained game in abundance. On the 31st the \"Pioneer,\" the steamer which had been sent to replace the \"Asthmatic,\" appeared off the bar, but the bad weather prevented her entering. At the same time <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men-of-war arrived, bringing Bishop Mackenzie at the head of the Oxford and Cambridge mission to the tribes of the Shire and Lake Nyassa. It consisted of six Englishmen and five coloured men from the Cape.

You're the best officer I had. Why the devil did you go into the Constabulary without talking to me?\" Stormont's upper lip seemed inclined to twitch but he controlled it and scowled at space. \"Go to bed, you darned fool,\" said Darragh, carelessly. \"You'll find dry things ready. Ralph will take care of your uniform and boots.\" Then he went into his own quarters to read <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> letters which, conforming to arrangements made with Mrs. Ray the day he had robbed Emanuel Sard, were to be sent to Trout Lodge to await his arrival. Both, written from the Ritz, bore the date of the day before: the first he opened was from the Countess Orloff-Strelwitz: \"Dear Captain Darragh, \"--You are so wonderful! Your messenger, with the _ten_ thousand dollars which you say you already have recovered from those miscreants who robbed Ricca, came aboard...", "...the sleep of the really happy. And thus it was every night. I fell asleep before my prayers were ended, sang in the morning, and felt light-hearted almost to reckless gaiety, happy and ready for work the whole day long. This proved how truly Susanna had said that our love would become to me a spring of health, better than any doctor's human wisdom could devise. CHAPTER X _THE STORM_ It was late in the afternoon of the Saturday after Twelfth Night that the terrible <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> days' storm began, which is still spoken of by many as one of the most violent that has visited Lofoten within the memory of man. It was fortunate that the fishing had not yet begun--the storm raged with grey sky, sleet, and tremendous seas from the south-west right up the West Fjord--or perhaps as large a number of wrecks might have been heard of as in the famous storm of 1849, when in one day several hundred boats were lost. This time only a few boats were wrecked on their way...", "...state, she now got up softly, and putting on a cloak, went down to his assistance. Alas! the little arms that were unclosed from her soft neck belonged to a light, easily awakened sleeper. Nanny missed her darling Susy; and terrified at being left alone, in the vast mysterious darkness, which had no bounds and seemed infinite, she slipped out of bed, and tottered, in her little nightgown, towards the door. There was a light below, and there was Susy and safety! So she went onwards <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> steps towards the steep, abrupt stairs; and then, dazzled by sleepiness, she stood, she wavered, she fell! Down on her head on the stone floor she fell! Susan flew to her, and spoke all soft, entreating, loving words; but her white lids covered up the blue violets of eyes, and there was no murmur came out of the pale lips. The warm tears that rained down did not awaken her; she lay stiff, and weary with her short life, on Susan's knee. Susan went sick with terror. She carried...", "...of different officers in the prison and among them one of Colonel W. C. Raulston, who met so sad a fate in the attempted outbreak on the Tenth of December, 1864, but this sketch unfortunately, was lost. He also made a good one of myself, from which I have procured a cut for this volume, and which I highly prize. There were also in Danville, as in other prisons where I was confined, sutlers who bought provisions of the Johnnies and sold to their comrades at a profit. They would buy <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three pounds of bacon of the Johnnies and cut it up into small pieces of about two ounces each, and sell these to their comrades, who either had not money enough to buy more, or were too fond of their own comfort to go down stairs at eleven o'clock at night to buy of the guard.

The order was...", "...this--\" There was noticeably less applause for the Kid. He was an unknown. A few of those present had heard of his victories in the West, but these were but a small section of the crowd. When the faint applause had ceased, Smith rose to his feet. \"Oh, you Kid!\" he observed encouragingly. \"I should not like Comrade Brady,\" he said, reseating himself, \"to think that he has no friend but his poor old mother, as occurred on a previous occasion.\" The burly gentleman, followed by the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> armies of assistants, dropped down from the ring, and the gong sounded. Mr. Fisher sprang from his corner as if somebody had touched a spring. He seemed to be of the opinion that if you are a cyclone, it is never too soon to begin behaving like one. He danced round the Kid with an india-rubber agility. The _Peaceful Moments_ representative exhibited more stolidity. Except for the fact that he was in fighting attitude, with one gloved hand moving slowly in the neighborhood of his...", "...hear it descried! \"I think it is a very pretty hat,\" she answered, somewhat indignantly. \"To go on the stage with, perhaps, but not for a respectable farmer's daughter to appear at church in,\" continued Mrs. Churchill. May slightly tossed her pretty head, and walked indignantly out of the room. She had no idea of leaving off wearing her new hat, which had just cost her two pounds, on account of her stepmother's remarks. And immediately the early dinner was over she called to her <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> young brothers to go out for a walk with her, and wore the picture hat in spite of Mrs. Churchill. During their afternoon ramble they went along the country lane where May Churchill had first met John Temple in the summer time, when she was gathering wild roses to make a wreath to place on poor young Phil Temple's grave. It was autumn now, and the cobwebs on the grass and the chill in the breeze told of the shortening days. The wild roses were gone, and the meadow-sweet scented...", "...immortality removes this contradiction; but it also displaces the supreme gracefulness of this act of sacrifice. The consideration of a future reward excludes love. There must be a virtue which even without the belief in immortality, even at the peril of annihilation, suffices to carry out this sacrifice. I grant it is ennobling to the human soul to sacrifice present enjoyment for a future eternal good; it is the noblest degree of egotism; but egotism and love separate humanity into <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> very unlike races, whose limits are never confounded. Egotism erects its centre in itself; love places it out of itself in the axis of the universal whole. Love aims at unity, egotism at solitude. Love is the citizen ruler of a flourishing republic, egotism is a despot in a devastated creation. Egotism sows for gratitude, love for the ungrateful. Love gives, egotism lends; and love does this before the throne of judicial truth, indifferent if for the enjoyment of the following...", "...the star, would be as the area of the pupil of the eye to the area of the whole sphere having the star as a centre and our distance from the star as a radius. If the eye is assisted by a telescope, the ratio is quite different. In that case the ratio of the light which enters the eye to the whole light, would be as the area of the mirror or object-glass to the area of the whole sphere having the star as a centre and its distance as a radius. Thus the light received by the _eye_ in the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> cases would be as the area of the pupil is to the area of the object-glass. For instance, if the pupil has a diameter of two-fifths of an inch, and the mirror a diameter of four inches, then a hundred times as much light would enter the eye when assisted by the telescope as when unarmed, since the _area_ of the pupil is one-hundredth the _area_ of the objective. If a particular star is just visible to the naked eye, it will be quite bright if viewed with this special telescope,...", "...Almost universally they incline to a triquetrous or three-sided figure, with their external surface convex, sometimes partially so, and their internal concave. Most frequently they are arched, curving inwards; but sometimes, as in _Prionus octangularis_[1235], a Capricorn beetle, and others of that genus, they are nearly straight; and in _Rhina barbirostris_[1236], a most remarkable Brazilian weevil, their curvature is outwards. In _Pholidotus lepidotus_ MacLeay, and _Lucanus Elephas_, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> insects of the stag-beetle tribe, they are bent downwards; and in _Lucanus nebulosus_ K. (_Ryssonotus_ MacLeay) they turn upwards[1237]. They are usually widest at the base, and grow gradually more slender to the apex, but in the hornet (_Vespa Crabro_) the reverse takes place, and they increase in width from the base to the apex; and in the hive-bee, and others of that tribe, they are dilated both at base and apex, being narrowest in the middle; others are nearly of the same width...", "...I find Dr. Lushington worthy of the prize he has obtained in a wife, [Footnote: Miss Edgeworth's old friend, Miss Sarah Carr.] and I have heard from friends, who differ from him in political opinions, such honourable testimony to his integrity and strength of mind that my heart is quite at ease about her happiness. _To_ MISS RUXTON. FROGNEL, _Jan. 3, 1822_. I believe I left off where I had mentioned the _Pirate_, which I hope you are reading to my aunt. The characters of the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> sisters are beautiful. The idea of Brenda not believing in supernatural agency, and yet being afraid, and Minna not being afraid though she believes in Norma's power, is new and natural and ingenious. This was Joanna Baillie's idea. The picture of the sisters sleeping and the lacing scene is excellent, and there are not only passages of beautiful picturesque description, but many more deep philosophical reflections upon the human mind, and the causes of human happiness, than in any...", "...And there is, of course, the further difference that in the Legal School Man's acceptance of what he is taught has taken the _practical_ form of doing what he is told to do, detail by detail; whereas in the Ecclesiastical School it has been mainly _oral_ (though also partly ceremonial), the business of the disciple being to commit to memory the creed or catechism which has been placed in his hands, and recite it, formula by formula, with flawless accuracy. But the difference between the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> schools is wholly superficial, being, in fact, analogous to that between the conventional teaching of Drawing, in which the pupil finds salvation in doing what he is told to do, line by line, and stroke by stroke, and the conventional teaching of History and Geography, in which the pupil finds salvation in saying what he is told to say, name by name, and date by date. The relation between the two great branches of education, the education of Man by God, and the education of the...", "...of my study such a series of records was unattainable. Few if any of the racers recaptured had more complete series of records than the one mentioned above. For 20 racers the records were sufficiently numerous and well distributed to permit plotting of minimum home ranges. One of these ranges was hexagonal, nine were pentagonal, eight were rhomboidal and three were triangles. In four instances the area encompassed was broken by woodland, indicating that the home range comprised <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three disjunct segments. In all instances the smaller segments were triangular. The 20 minimum home ranges averaged 6.6 acres (3.2 to 12.8). The 15 ranges of males averaged 7.3 acres, whereas the five ranges of females averaged only 4.5 acres, but the sample is too small to be relied upon for differences in the sexes.

The trends are much alike...", "...a seat raised slightly above the others sat a man who evidently was speaker for the men of the jury. On a similar elevated seat was the woman speaker; this latter was Lylda. Near the center of the room, facing the judge and jury were two triangular spaces about twenty feet across, enclosed with a breast-high wall of stone. Within each of these enclosures were perhaps ten or twelve people seated on small stone benches. Directly facing the members of the jury and between them and the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> enclosures, was a small platform raised about four feet above the floor, with several steps leading up to it from behind. A number of attendants dressed in the characteristic short tunics, with breastplates and a short sword hanging from the waist, stood near the enclosures, and along the sides of the room. The Chemist leaned over and whispered to his friends: \"Those two enclosed places in the center are for the witnesses. Over there are those testifying for the accused; the...", "...two high fences.

By good fortune she was not one of those timid maidens who turn frantic at a crisis, and drag to the bottom the swimmer who would save them. She had faith in the capability of her counsellor--believed that he knew what he was about--and, once more spurring the mare into a gallop, she rode off in a direct line for the...", "...stone than in water,\" said Masin, who had put his ear to the hole. \"I can hear it much louder now.\" \"Of course you can,\" answered Malipieri. \"We are wasting time,\" he added, picking up the drill and holding it against the block at a point six inches higher than before. Masin took his sledge again and hammered away with dogged regularity. So the work went on all that day, and all the next. And after that they took another tool and widened the holes, and then a third till they were <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> inches in diameter. Masin suggested that they might drive an iron on through the brickwork, and find out how much of it there was beyond the stone, but Malipieri pointed out that if the \"lost water\" should rise it would pour out through the hole and stop their operations effectually. The entrance must incline upwards, he said. They made long round plugs of soft pine to fit the holes exactly, each one scored with a channel a quarter of an inch deep, which was on the upper side...", "...not at all of one mind.

Thorgeir began to turn his steps towards Ormilda, and Gunnar thought that ill, and great dislike arose between them. So the winter wore away. Now comes the summer, and their secret meetings went on oftener than before. As for Thorgeir of the Threecorner and...", "...is, however, no doubt that it can sometimes be produced independently of any such mixture, since many fresh vegetables and tartar afford a considerable quantity of it.

In _Allopora_ the cyclostems resemble the calyces of Anthozoan corals. In _Cryptohelia_ the cyclosystem is covered by a cap or operculum. In _Astylus_ (fig. 63) styles are...", "...component parts of his mission. Charles Nicholas Falk sat enthroned on his leather sofa, very conscious of the fact that it was _his_ leather sofa, surrounded by his staff; or his dogs, as one might have said. Levin found everything splendid; the bowl, the glasses, the ladle, the cigars--the whole box had been taken from the mantelpiece--the matches, the ash-trays, the bottles, the corks, the wire--everything. The schoolmaster looked content; he was not called upon to talk, the other <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> did that; he was merely required to be present as a witness in case of need. Falk was the first to raise his glass and drink--nobody knew to whom--but the schoolmaster, believing it to be to the hero of the day, produced his verses and began to read \"To Fritz Levin on the Day of his Promotion.\" Falk was attacked by a violent cough which disturbed the reading and spoiled the effect of the wittiest points; but Nystroem, who was a shrewd man and had foreseen this, had introduced...", "...distinct object, as nearly as possible radiating from the centre of the trunk of the tree--the \"medullary rays\" of the wood being, in fact, sliced through, instead of intersected transversely.

Ill-natured people added: \"It is a good piece of work; and will bring in not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three per cent. profit.\" Two days later, they heard that the work of renovation had been entrusted to Celestin Chambrelan, the carpenter from Percheville. Then this was denied, and it was said that all the pews in the church were going to be changed. That would be well worth the two thousand francs that had been demanded of the church administration. Theodule Sabot could not sleep for thinking about it.

It ended, as was inevitable, in disruption. Of the two human beings here described, one was born to fly backward, the other could not help being carried forward. There came a time when neither spoke the same language as the other, or encompassed the same hopes, or was fortified by the same desires.

For the one is Sir Sagramore le Desirous, who was at that tournament in Ireland, and the other is Sir Dodinas le Sauvage.\" \"Well,\" said Sir Tristram, \"those are indeed two very good, worthy knights. Now if you will sit here for a while, I will go forward and have speech with them.\" \"Messire,\" said Gouvernail, \"I would counsel you not to have to do...", "...I was forty-two years old, in spite of the experience I had had, I was so foolish as to go alone. The girl saw me coming from the window, and guessing that I was looking for her, she came down and shewed me in. I went in, I went upstairs, and when I found myself in the presence of the wretch Pocchini my blood froze in my veins. A feeling of false shame prevented my retracing my steps, as it might have looked as if I had been afraid. In the same room were his pretended wife, Catina, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Sclavonic-looking assassins, and the decoy- duck. I saw that this was not a laughing matter, so I dissembled to the best of my ability, and made up my mind to leave the place in five minutes' time. Pocchini, swearing and blaspheming, began to reproach me with the manner in which I had treated him in England, and said that his time had come, and that my life was in his hands. One of the two Sclavs broke in, and said we must make friends, and so made me sit down, opened a bottle,...", "...inside. She will not take them into the house, for she knows the snake is there, and may at any moment come up through a crack in the rough slab floor; so she carries several armfuls of firewood into the kitchen, and then takes the children there. The kitchen has no floor--or, rather, an earthen one--called a \"ground floor\" in this part of the bush. There is a large, roughly-made table in the centre of the place. She brings the children in, and makes them get on this table. They are <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> boys and two girls--mere babies. She gives them some supper, and then, before it gets dark, she goes into the house, and snatches up some pillows and bedclothes--expecting to see or lay her hand on the snake any minute. She makes a bed on the kitchen table for the children, and sits down beside it to watch all night. She has an eye on the corner, and a green sapling club laid in readiness on the dresser by her side; also her sewing basket and a copy of the _Young Ladies'...", "...fronts is a large _caponniere_, mounting ten guns in the upper tier and eight in the lower tier. This _caponniere_ is on a lower level than the enceinte of the place. The counterscarp at the north-west and south-west angles of these two fronts is for the distance of twenty yards composed of a crenellated wall four feet six inches thick. This was caused by the irregularity of the ground. The bomb-proof barracks of the northern fronts mount in casemate <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> tiers of fourteen guns at the curtains. The flanks have five guns in casemates open to the rear, in addition to the guns on the parapet above. The lunette in the ditch is eight feet deep. The eastern front has an escarp fourteen feet high cut in the lava, and well flanked by the _caponniere_ defending the entrances, mounting four guns. The bomb-proof barracks in the northern fronts have one tier of eight guns in casemate at the curtains, and three...", "...British flag was much more effectually asserted by the gallant admiral Boscawen, who, as we have already observed, was intrusted with the conduct of a squadron in the Mediterranean. It must be owned, however, that his first attempt savoured of temerity. Having in vain displayed the British flag in sight of Toulon, by way of defiance to the French fleet that lay there at anchor, he ordered three ships of the line, commanded by the captains Smith, Harland, and Barker, to advance and burn <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ships that lay close to the mouth of the harbour. They accordingly approached with great intrepidity, and met with a very warm reception from divers batteries, which they had not before perceived. Two small forts they attempted to destroy, and cannonaded for some time with great fury; but being overmatched by superior force, and the wind subsiding into a calm, they sustained considerable damage, and were towed off with great difficulty in a very shattered condition. The admiral...", "...the spinet, her head on the music-rack,--lying there speechless, motionless; for the girl--and for the first time in her life--had fainted. CHAPTER XXIV An hour later, when left in her own room with Mary, Dorothy poured out her secret sorrow. The others had yielded to her urging and gone to the tea-table below, albeit with scant appetites, and with minds much troubled over the strange weakness that had come over Dot. But Mary remained; and so it came about that the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> were now alone, Dorothy lying upon a lounge, and Mary beside her, clasping one of her hands. The room was filled with weird shadows from the wood fire, which made the only light; for Jack, at his sister's request, had carried away the candles. \"Are you cold?\" Mary asked, feeling Dorothy shiver. And she drew the silken cover more closely about the girl's shoulders and neck. \"No--no,\" was the quick reply. \"It's not that I'm cold. I'm only so miserable that I don't know what...", "...of my sex; no woman's face remember Save, from my glass, mine own.\" In the afternoon Phillis, who was \"writing up\" her diary after the manner of the ancient Aztec, received a visitor. For the first time in her life the girl found herself face to face with--a lady. Men she knew--chiefly men of advanced age; they came to dine with Abraham Dyson. Women-servants she knew, for she had a French maid--imported too young to be mischievous; and there had been a cook at Highgate, with <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three maids. Not one of these virgins possessed the art of reading, or they would never have been engaged by Mr. Dyson. Nor was she encouraged by her guardian to talk with them. Also she knew that in the fulness of time she was to be somehow transferred from the exclusive society of men to that in which the leading part would be taken by ladies--women brought up delicately like herself, but not all, unhappily, on the same sound fundamental principle of oral teaching. Among...", "...we don't know what they're there for, but we know they're there. Now, this third boy comes to the mine and works just long enough to get in touch with the other two. Then he disappears.\" \"Buys a lot of provisions and goes down the river to leave his hat on the bank!\" laughed Tommy. \"I guess that was a pretty poor imitation of a suicide or a drowning accident, either!\" \"But this boy didn't get to be intimate with the two breaker boys,\" contended George. \"He talked with them about <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> minutes after the fight, according to Canfield, but paid no further attention to them after that. If he had any secret understanding with them, he must have done a whole lot of talking in a mighty short space of time.\" \"The right kind of a boy can say a good deal in a minute and half!\" laughed Tommy. \"But suppose we let Will go on and explanation us about that boy tramp in the railroad yards. I think I know what he's getting at, but I'm not quite certain. Go on, Will, it's up to...", "...in consequence, at daylight, 300 Turks and a party of Austrian marines landed and took unopposed possession of it. The casualties of the allies amounted to only 14 English and 14 Turks killed, and 42 wounded. Notwithstanding the long continued fire to which the ships had been exposed, they escaped with slight damage. The havoc caused by the bombardment on the walls and houses was very great, while it was calculated that the explosion had destroyed between one and two thousand persons, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> entire regiments being annihilated, with a number of animals. On the 4th another explosion took place, by which a marine was killed, and Captain Collier had his leg fractured. This was the first occasion on which the advantages of steam had been fully proved in battle, by the rapidity with which the steamers took up their positions, and the assistance they rendered to the other ships, as also by the destruction the shells thrown from them produced. The survivors of the...", "...as regards change.\" \"She has a great honesty.\" Winthrop sat down--until now he had been standing; he threw aside the book. \"You certainly can't approve of it,\" he said,--\"such a disposition?\" He did not pay much heed to what he was saying, he was absorbed in the problem before him; face to face with Margaret, he was asking himself, and with more inward tumult than ever, why she had been so willing to have him think of her, as, after what he had seen, he must think? During his <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> weeks of absence--the evening before on that long pier in the rain--he had felt a hot anger against her for the unconcern with which she was treating him. But now that he knew the real history of that last afternoon, now that he knew that it was Garda who had planned the meeting with Lucian, Garda, not Margaret, who had been on her way to that solitary house, the problem was more strangely haunting even than before. She had saved Garda from compromising herself in the eyes of the...", "...Aubrey de Vere, the poet, and very apprehensive we were, and nervous, as we neared the abode of a man reported to be such a bear to strangers. We first saw Mrs. Tennyson, a gentle, invalid lady lying on her back on a sofa. After some time the poet sent down word to ask us to come up to his sanctum, where he received us with a rather hard stare, his clay pipe and long, black, straggling hair being quite what I expected. He got up with a little difficulty, and when we had sat down--he, we <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> and his most deferential son--he asked which was the painter and which was the poet. After our answer, which struck me as funny, as though we ought to have said, with a bob, 'Please, sir, I'm the painter,' and 'Please, sir, I'm the poet,' he made a few commonplace remarks about my pictures in a most sepulchral bass voice. But he and Alice, in whom he was more interested, naturally, did most of the talking; there was not much of that, though, for he evidently prefers to answer a...", "...he accepted with quite vehement protestations. His course homeward was, I fear, usually more discursive than that of his coming. Like all Spanish musicians he sang upon the slightest excuse. He corrected my melody by singing: \"Lo, La, Lo, La, Lo, La,\" as I played. Having played the violin, the mandolin and the piano, I did not find the laud very difficult. It has a queer tuning in fourths and is played with the plectrum. But when La Merchora discovered that I had learned a piece in <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> days she was quite eloquent in her astonishment. CHAPTER XIX MURCIA--THE LAUD During our month in Verdolay we had not quite cut off communication with Murcia. Luis and his friend Flores had come out to lunch with us, bringing with them a slab of odoriferous dried fish which _they said_ was excellent in salads. On this occasion many families in Verdolay had offered to cook our dinner for us, Encarnacion's mother, the shopping woman, the woman who brought the water and...", "...invitations to luncheon; but ladies as a rule seldom avail themselves of this _facon de parler_, as they consider it, and prefer to await a more direct form of invitation. Gentlemen, on the contrary, are expected to avail themselves of this proffered hospitality without ceremony, as the presence of a gentleman visitor at luncheon is considered an acquisition, the reason, perhaps, being that ladies are usually in the majority at luncheon, and also that the unexpected arrival of one or <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> ladies would call for a greater amount of attention on the part of a hostess seated at luncheon than would the unexpected arrival of gentlemen, ladies requiring especial attention to be shown to them in the matter of a place at table, etc., while gentlemen are ready to offer attention instead of requiring it, and to take any place at table, whether convenient or otherwise. As a rule, the number of ladies present at luncheon greatly exceeds the number of gentlemen present, unless...", "...or prayers for the dead might be offered before the altar and image of \"oure Ladye.\" Dr. Fuller gives the following account of \"obits\" at Waltham: \"The charge of an obit was two shillings and two pence; and, if any be curious to have the particulars thereof, it was thus expended: to the parish priest, three pence; to our Lady's priest, three pence; to the charnel priest, threepence; to the two clerks, four pence; to the children (these I conceive choristers) three pence; to the sexton, <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> pence; to the bellman, two pence; for two tapers, two pence; for oblation, two pence. O, the reasonable rates at Waltham! Two shillings and two pence for an obit, the price whereof in S. Paul's, in London, was forty shillings! For, forsooth, the higher the church, the holier the service, the dearer the price, though he had given too much that had given but thanks for such vanities. To defray the expenses of these obits, the parties prayed for, or their executors, left lands,...", "...length the ship left England I watched and watched the retreating tow-boat,\" he continues, \"until I could see it no longer, and then hurried down below. Indeed, I felt for the moment as one paralysed. Now is the time for reaction--to 'cast all your care upon Him'.\" Strangely enough, both his missionary journeys in Africa failed in their original aim, which was to reach the kingdom of Uganda. In the first journey the expedition started from the coast at the end of June, 1882. After <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> months' difficult marching into the interior, amidst the constant difficulties which beset the African traveller, he writes on 1st August: \"I am very happy. Fever is trying, but it does not take away the joy of the Lord, and keeps one low in the right place\". On, on they went. Fever was so heavy upon him that his temperature reached 110 degrees; but still he struggled forward, insisting upon placing a weary companion on the beast which he ought himself to have ridden. By 4th...", "...divisions and two wings, but the divisions were placed so close together that they practically formed but one. The whole of the archers were placed in advance of the men-at-arms. Every archer, in addition to his arms, carried a long stake sharpened at both ends, that which was to project above the ground being armed with a sharp tip of iron. When the archers had taken up their positions these stakes were driven obliquely into the ground, each being firmly thrust in with the strength of <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> or three men. As the archers stood many lines deep, placed in open order and so that each could shoot between the heads of the men in front of him, there were sufficient stakes in front of the line to form a thick and almost impassable _chevaux-de-frise_. The baggage and horses were sent to the rear, near the village of Maisoncelles, under a guard of archers and men-at-arms. When all the arrangements were made, the king rode along the line from rank to rank, saying a few words of...", "...grace of the long twilight that we are able to reach Glasgow by lamp-lighting time. Measured in miles, the day's run was not extraordinary, but much of the road was pretty strenuous and tire trouble has been above normal, so that the comfortable hotel of the metropolis does not come amiss. After a perfunctory round in Glasgow, our thoughts turn toward Ayr; even though we have already made two pilgrimages to Burnsland, the spell is unbroken and still would be though our two visits were <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> score. We will not follow the Kilmarnock route again, but for the sake of variety will go by Barrhead and Irvine on the sea. It proves a singularly uninteresting road; Barrhead is mean and squalid, the small villages are unattractive, and Irvine is a bleak, coal-shipping town. Irvine would be wholly commonplace had not the poet James Montgomery honored it by making it his birthplace and had not Bobby Burns struggled nearly a year within its confines to earn a livelihood as a...", "...spoke to 'im several times myself about not doin' enough, but it don't seem to make no difference.' 'I've 'ad me eye on 'im meself for some time,' replied Nimrod in the same tone. 'Anybody would think the work was goin' to be sent to a Exhibition, the way 'e messes about with it, rubbing it with glasspaper and stopping up every little crack! I can't understand where 'e gets all the glasspaper FROM.' ''E brings it 'isself!' said Crass hoarsely. 'I know for a fact that 'e bought <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> 'a'penny sheets of it, last week out of 'is own money!' 'Oh, 'e did, did 'e?' snarled Misery. 'I'll give 'im glasspaper! I'll 'ave a Alteration!' He went into the hall, where he remained alone for a considerable time, brooding. At last, with the manner of one who has resolved on a certain course of action, he turned and entered the room where Philpot and Harlow were working. 'You both get sevenpence an hour, don't you?' he said. They both replied to the affirmative....", "...for some time, turned it over and over, then stood up and said: \"Come along.\" \"Where to?\" \"Gare de Lyon.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"I am sure of nothing with Daubrecq.

The circumstances of the case are few and simple, and may be narrated in a short compass. On Friday, the 17th of May 1839, Mr. Edgell and his family quitted the house in Cadogan-place in their carriage, for the purpose of proceeding to Foot's-cray, in Kent, leaving Marchant, the deceased, the cook, and the upper house-maid, at home. The <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> latter individually also went out, and thus Marchant and the girl Paynton were left alone in the house. On their return they were unable to obtain admittance; and the coachman and upper-footman having now got back from Foot's-cray, they went to the stables and procured their aid. Middleton, the coachman, scaled the garden-wall, and with some difficulty burst open the back-kitchen door, and having let in the other servants they all proceeded to examine the house. On their reaching...", "...it generally is in the summer; and as for a portion of the way they had to beat to windward in a rather narrow channel, it took them some time to reach Wroxham. They found that the _Swan_ was not so handy in tacking as a single-hulled yacht would have been, and they had to use the mizen to swing her round each time they put about. Their progress was, therefore, slower than they had calculated upon, and they did not reach Wroxham until 12.30. Their way was past Ranworth Broad and the <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> Hovetons, besides some smaller broads, all connected with the river by dykes, half hidden by tall reeds, and looking deliciously lonely, and inviting exploration. Although they were so close they could see nothing of the broads' surface, and their existence was only made manifest to them by the white sails of yachts which were now and then to be seen gliding hither and thither through forests of reeds. Sir Richard, Mr. and Mrs. Merivale, Mrs. Brett, Mary and Florrie, were all...", "...is also charged that, at the time the discovery was made of an attempt on the part of some of the prisoners to escape, a party of three or four hundred was huddled together and surrounded by a guard; that one of them was pushed by a comrade and fell to the ground, and that instantly the unfortunate man was shot, and that three or four others were wounded. It is further stated that it is no uncommon thing for a soldier to fire on the barracks without any provocation whatever, and that <span class=\"clocktext\">two</span> men were thus shot while sleeping in their bunks a week or two ago, no inquiry being made into the matter. No court-martial has been held, no arrest has been made, though within the past month ten or twelve of the prisoners have been thus put out of the way.
