On the day before the fight he successfully outwitted the Boers, for, learning that they had left their laager in order to take up a position for battle, he pounced upon the laager and captured 10,000 head of cattle, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> wagons, and forty prisoners. Stimulated by this success, he attacked the Boers next day, and after five hours of hard fighting forced the pass which they were holding against him. As Methuen had but 1500 men, and was attacking a force which was as large as his own in a formidable position, the success was a very creditable one.

Joseph, however, who stood in great dread of so terrible an enemy as Charles XII., succeeded in purchasing his neutrality, and this fiery warrior marched off with his battalions, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand strong, to drive Peter I. from the throne of Russia. Joseph I., with exhausted resources, and embarrassed by the claims of so wide-spread a war, was able to do but little for the subjugation of Hungary.

And Perseus himself was a monarch of great ability, trained and disciplined to war. He collected an army of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand men, while the whole Roman force in Greece was scarcely more. Crassus conducted the Roman army, and in the first engagement at Ossa, was decidedly beaten. Perseus then sought peace, but the Romans never made peace after a defeat.

The library was rich in English plays, English history, travels, and antiquities, but there were not many high-priced books. The sale of the library of the Rev.

In that edition the text of 1798 is scarcely altered: but, in the year in which it was published, Wordsworth was engrossed with his settlement at Grasmere; and, in the springtime of creative work, he probably never thought of revising his earlier pieces. In the year 1800, he composed at least twenty-five new poems. The third edition of \"Lyrical Ballads\" appeared in 1802; and during that year he wrote <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> new poems, many of them amongst the most perfect of his Lyrics. His critical instinct had become much more delicate since 1800: and it is not surprising to find--as we do find--that between the text of the \"Lyrical Ballads\" of 1800, and that of 1802, there are many important variations. This is seen, for example, in the way in which he dealt with 'The Female Vagrant', which is altered throughout.

With this army were no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> generals of renown, and the number of feudal barons, great and small, who sent troops to swell its ranks was thirty-one.

In 1795 he is styled shorthand writer to the City of London on the title-page of the published reports from his own notes of the trial of Gillman and of Thomas Hardy, the political shoemaker, whose trial and acquittal created so great an excitement throughout the country. Two years after this he obtained a situation in the Bank of England, which he held for no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years. In addition to all this multifarious work, he found time for writing and slight editorial duties. In 1796 a volume of sermons preached in the New Jerusalem Temple appeared in his name, and in 1802 he edited a liturgy for his own church, and wrote a hymn-book. If in no other way, his memory will be perpetuated among his coreligionists by the hymns that bear his name.

First of all, he withdrew his troops hurriedly from the neighborhood of Harper's Ferry to Winchester.

A large part of his force was footsore and exhausted after a hurried march of twenty-five miles in a single day, with frequent skirmishings to punctuate their progress. Nevertheless Jackson determined to reach and occupy Strasburg before his enemies could get there. He had eighteen miles to go while one of the enemy's columns had twenty and the other only twelve to travel. Their combined forces outnumbered his own about three to one, to say nothing of the...", "...the most dangerous foe the British could have. In June (1775), Washington, as Commander-in-Chief of the army, left Philadelphia for Boston. There was no time to visit Mount Vernon. He wrote to his wife, telling her to be brave and that he trusted God would soon bring him safely home. General Philip Schuyler and General Charles Lee and a light horse troop went with him. As they galloped along the way, people came out of the farms and villages to see the great General. Washington, now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old, was very splendid and dignified in his bearing, yet always modest and quiet--a gentleman and a soldier. About twenty miles from Philadelphia, they met a messenger from Boston riding a fleet horse and bearing dispatches to Congress. They stopped and heard from him the news of the Battle of Bunker Hill, which had just been fought (June 17, 1775).

AN INVESTMENT IN REDDING Many of the less important happenings seem worth remembering now. Among them was the sale, at the Nast auction, of the Mark Twain letters, already mentioned. The fact that these letters brought higher prices than any others offered in this sale was gratifying. Roosevelt, Grant, and even Lincoln items were sold; but the Mark Twain letters led the list. One of them sold for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> dollars, which was said to be the highest price ever paid for the letter of a living man. It was the letter written in 1877, quoted earlier in this work, in which Clemens proposed the lecture tour to Nast. None of the Clemens-Nast letters brought less than twenty-seven dollars, and some of them were very brief. It was a new measurement of public sentiment. Clemens, when he heard of it, said: \"I can't rise to General Grant's lofty place in the estimation of this country;...", "...There were two or three features in it, however, which were bad, and which the author is glad to notice that the United States Government in renewing the agreement of the Bank of Spain for the present fiscal year, that is, the year ending June 30, 1899, has obliterated. The Spanish Government paid the five per cent. on the receipts given the bank, and not on the money collected. This resulted in great abuses, because the delinquents during the years of war were fifteen, sixteen, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> per cent. respectively. The punishment of delinquents has also been considerably modified by the United States authorities.

That is why these two oceans with an area of only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> million square miles receive the drainage from twenty million square miles of land, while the far larger Indian and Pacific Oceans with an area of ninety-one million square miles receive the rivers of only ten million square miles.

In the fall of 1845 the bulk of the Old Settler and Treaty parties, having become satisfied that it would be impossible for them to maintain a peaceful and happy residence in the country of their adoption while the influence of John Ross continued potent in their national government, resolved to seek for themselves a new home on the borders of Mexico. A council was therefore held at which a delegation (consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> members of the Treaty and eleven of the Old Settler party) was chosen to explore the country to the south and west for a future abode.

The power of his mind, tortured and insufficient in actual production, was supreme in putting forth clearly and finally that criticism which ran as an unspoken and obscure current of opinion in the mind of his age. This was his glory, and it was true. His dryness was extraordinary.

Of this scraping and pumice stone in the mind a better example than his verse is to be found in his letters. A number remain. They might seem to be written by two different men! Half a dozen are models of that language he adored--they cost him, to our knowledge, many days--the rest are slipshod notes that any man might write, for he thought they would not survive, and, indeed, the majority of his editors have had the piety to suppress them.

To have 'an opinion about Ireland,' one must begin by getting the truth; and where is it to be had in the country? Or rather, there are two truths, the Catholic truth and the Protestant truth. The two parties do not see things with the same eyes. I recollect, for instance, a Catholic gentleman telling me that the Primate had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand _five hundred_ a year; a Protestant clergyman gave me, chapter and verse, the history of a shameful perjury and malversation of money on the part of a Catholic priest; nor was one tale more true than the other.

THE CHURCH CANTATAS ARRANGED CHRONOLOGICALLY We have the statement of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach,(346) confirmed by Forkel,(347) Bach's earliest biographer, that his father composed five Cantatas for every Sunday and Festival of the ecclesiastical year. Concerted music was sung at Leipzig annually on <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> Sundays and sixteen week-days.(348) Bach therefore must have written at least 295 Cantatas. Of this number he composed at least thirty before 1723. Hence approximately 265 were written at Leipzig. But Bach's fertility does not appear to have outlived the year 1744. We have reason, therefore, to conclude that the 265 Leipzig Cantatas were written in the course of twenty-one years, that is, between 1723 and 1744. To complete that number Bach must have composed a new...", "...down to your own level a man who was somebody in the world of finance.

Proceeding nearer the land, our sounding lessened to twenty-two fathoms, when we anchored on good ground; and though we distinctly heard the rut of the shore at no great distance, we could not perceive the land till next day, when the weather was somewhat clearer. We then sent our skiff in shore, to see if any place could be discovered of more security for our ship to ride in; but, on account of the great sea that came rolling into the bay, the surge was so violent...", "...you take to Mr. Leask?-I think we had thirty odd cwt. of cured fish; one part of that was ling, and one part was tusk and cod. We had about nineteen cwt. of ling and we sold them at \u00a323. [Page 135] 5455. When you say that the price for ling is 8s. a cwt., that is the price for green ling?-Yes. 5456. And 21/4 -cwt. of green ling make one cwt. dry?-Yes; that is what the fish-curers calculate upon. 5457. So that nineteen cwt. of cured fish would have been something less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cwt. green, and you got \u00a323 for that?-Yes. 5458. But from that price you must allow something for the expense of curing?-Yes; it would be from \u00a32 to \u00a32, 10s. per ton for curing. 5459. So that you made some profit by selling your fish in that way?-Yes. 5460.

We distinguished Chacachacarreo, the most westerly of the islands situated between Cape Paria and the north-west cape of Trinidad. When we were five leagues distant from the coast, we felt, near Punta de la Boca, the effect of a particular current which carried the ship southward. The motion of the waters which flow through the Boca del Draco, and the action of the tides, occasion an eddy. We cast the lead, and found from thirty-six to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> fathoms on a bottom of very fine green clay. According to the rules established by Dampier, we ought not to have expected so little depth near a coast formed by very high and perpendicular mountains.

In October, 1853, Mr. Baldwin came to Cleveland, and on the completion of Northrup & Spangler's Block, commenced the retail branch of the dry goods business, his father, S. I. Baldwin, being a partner in the business for the first three years. Mr. Baldwin opened out with a stock of goods costing sixteen thousand dollars, and at the close of the first year had made sales to the amount of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand dollars. This was an encouraging result for those times, and he correctly judged that it was but the foundation of a large and lucrative business. Each succeeding year, without any exception, has brought an increase of business, till the annual sales of the firm are in the vicinity of a million dollars, which, in a retail business, in a city of Cleveland's size, is very large; and fairly entitles him to be regarded as the most successful dry goods merchant...", "...of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?\" Now he recovered his former countenance and form.

The use of the torpedo-boat and of the weapons which it carries must always demand, like that of the bayonet, men of the strongest nerve, and of the greatest devotion to their duty and to their country. Fifty miles an hour is a rate which is already in sight as the speed of the future torpedo-boat, the first turbine steamer of the British Navy having achieved <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> miles an hour before the end of the nineteenth century. It should be distinctly understood, however, that such a speed cannot be kept up for any great length of time and that long voyages are out of the question. The role of the turbine torpedo-boat will be to \"get home\" with its weapon in the shortest practicable time. Hence its great value for the defence of harbours by striking at distances of perhaps two or three hours' steaming.

Nay, it was said that the regiment had made a mighty acquisition to its fame, but that it had been dearly bought. At length, however, the truth arrived, in a distinct and intelligible shape. The well-known and sanguinary affair of Ticonderago had been fought; and, in that murderous contest, the 42nd Regiment, which had behaved with a gallantry unmatched before in the annals of war, had suffered dreadfully--no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, and six hundred and three privates having been killed and wounded in that corps alone.

The latter party had their headquarters in the Osaka castle, and the struggle for mastery was finally concluded in a great battle, fought on September 15, 1600. Iyeyasu was the assailant.

Immersions and emersions of stars behind each other have been observed, and real motions among them detected, rapid enough to become sensible and measurable in very short intervals of time. The periods of the double stars are very various, ranging, in the case of those already ascertained, from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years to one thousand. Their orbits are very small ellipses, only a few seconds in the longest direction, and more eccentric than those of the planets. A double star in the Northern Crown (_Eta Coronae_) has made a complete revolution since its first discovery, and is now far advanced in its second period; while a star in the Lion (_Gamma Leonis_) requires twelve hundred years to complete its circuit.

Ten years after this splendid victory of the Phalanx, in support of their civil rights, General Butler then a member of congress, made an eloquent appeal in behalf of the equal civil rights of the negro race. In it he referred to the gallant charge of the Phalanx. He said: \"It became my painful duty to follow in the track of that charging column, and there, in a space not wider than the clerk's desk and three hundred yards long, lay the dead bodies of five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> of my colored comrades, fallen in defense of their country, who had offered up their lives to uphold its flag and its honor, as a willing sacrifice: and as I rode along among them, guiding my horse this way and that way, lest he should profane with his hoofs what seemed to me the sacred dead, and as I looked on their bronzed faces upturned in the shining sun, as if in mute appeal against the wrongs of the country for which they had given their lives, whose flag had only...", "...five psalms, and during the whole of the exercises the passengers conducted themselves with perfect decorum, although one of the sermons was one hour in length....

Then he turned upon his slaves, his fury in his convulsed face; but, to his amazement, they were not looking at him, but had all turned in attitudes of deep respect towards the opening of the peristyle. As he faced round and saw who had just entered his house, his own rage fell away from him in an instant, and his manner became as humble as that of his servants.

The second compromise had passed out of general recollection before Mr. Clay's death, though it had made him a Presidential candidate at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years of age. The most remarkable fact connected with the excitement over the Missouri question, which engrossed the country for more than two years, was the absence of any premonition of its coming. There had been no severe political struggle in the nation since the contest between Madison and De Witt Clinton in 1812. Monroe had been chosen almost without opposition in 1816, and, even while the Missouri controversy was at its height, he was re-elected in 1820 by a...", "...the Desperates to dash themselves to pieces when the inevitable swing of the pendulum took place.

The majority of these, however, are not as complete or enlightening as they might be; nor has the extraordinarily dramatic nature of the Warning, the Siege, and the Sack been shown.

The Commander-in-Chief in India at that time was General the Hon. George Anson, an officer of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years' service, but without much Indian experience, having been only four years in the country. He was an able, intelligent man, an excellent judge of character, a great authority on whist and on horses, and he was well known in London society, which was somewhat surprised when he accepted an appointment in India--the command of the Meerut division. He did not, however, remain long in that position, for he was soon given the command of the Madras Army, and a year and a half...", "...this, we should allow a tenfold value in exchange to the dollar of Philip's day, we should be surprised at the meagreness of his revenues, of his expenditures, and of the debts which at the close of his career brought him to bankruptcy; were the sums estimated in coin.

He carried on a vast war without interruption during the whole of his <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years' reign against the most wealthy and military nations of Christendom not recognising his authority, and in so doing he is said to have expended a sum total of seven hundred millions of dollars--a statement which made men's hair stand on their heads.

Of his infantry, not quite two thousand were regulars, and of these, three-fourths were new levies. His force nearly doubled in number that of Cornwallis, which did not exceed two thousand four hundred men; but many of Greene's troops were raw and inexperienced, and had never been in battle; those of the enemy were veterans, schooled in warfare.

In this way, some few necessarily perished, for it was not possible to save them all, owing to the small number of boats employed on our side, and the large number of those destroyed on theirs; besides which, the heat and danger were often too great to be able to approach near enough to render timely assistance. Thus, in the short space of three hours, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> war-junks were blown up, and thirty-two fire-rafts destroyed, besides smaller boats.

But as the association of John and Daniel is known to have lasted from 1652 to 1654, the date 1653 appears to be very plausible. We reproduce the entire title of this typographical _bijou_, which merited a cleverer engraver. The rarest of all the numerous Elzevirs, possibly by reason of the popularity of its subject, is the _Pastissier Francois_, Louis and Daniel Elzevir, Amsterdam, 1655, of which M. Morgand had an uncut copy, measuring a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> millimetres, in 1878. The Benzon copy sold in 1875 for three thousand two hundred and fifty-five francs. It is to be remarked that the Elzevirs frequently avoided dating or even signing their books, for reasons easy to comprehend. Publishing numerous works, they were afraid of compromising themselves in the eyes of the powerful, and they let them go forth without any trade mark. These artists in typography were, besides, the most prudent and subtle of men. Working at a...", "...from the books, to which of the gods it should be performed.

Ambassadors came from Ptolemy and Cleopatra, king and queen of Egypt, congratulating the Romans because the consul Manius Acilius had driven king Antiochus out of Greece, and advising that they...", "...the Herring goes where his food is. What food does he find? He swallows the small life of the sea, tiny transparent things like baby shrimps, prawns, crabs, and so on, which swarm even in the cold water which the Herring loves. They are good juicy food, these little mites, and very plentiful; so no wonder the Herring becomes plump. He eats greedily of this good food. For instance, a young Herring, picked up on the beach at Yarmouth, was found to contain no less than one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> small shrimps. Not a bad dinner for a fish the length of this page! The ocean teems with small creatures; even the huge Greenland Whale feeds on them, and the Herring seems to live on little else. Well, the shoals of Herring begin to move from their feeding place in the deeps, and come nearer the coast. As they get to shallower water they are crowded together near the surface. Where are they going, and why? Perhaps you can guess--they seek warmer, shallower water, in...", "...great news from Egypt.

A part of the reservoir plan, however, is that the land above it shall not be cultivated; otherwise the erosion from the tilled fields will promptly fill up the reservoirs, as the present condition of many eastern mill dams so emphatically attests. The carrying out, therefore, of the Pittsburgh reservoir plan necessitates the exodus of hundreds of thousands of farmers and the...", "...and conceits of ornament are superb.

Moreover, of this increase in English tonnage, a large percentage had been in steamers, one ton of which class was estimated to be equal in efficiency to three tons of sailing-ships; while, by substituting largely iron for wood, England had gained a still further advantage in her much larger class of iron vessels, doubly as durable as...", "...be.\" All these qualities found expression in a speech he delivered on the occasion of the presentation of his portrait to the United Presbyterian Synod in May 1888.

The second book of Samuel begins with an account of things that did not happen till four years after Samuel was dead; for it begins with the reign of David, who succeeded Saul, and it goes on to the end of David's reign, which was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years after the death of Samuel; and, therefore, the books are in themselves positive evidence that they were not written by Samuel.

Add to these the arms owned by the several States and by military organizations, and it would make a total of one hundred and fifty thousand for the use of the armies of the Confederacy. The rifles were of the caliber .54, known as Mississippi rifles, except those at Richmond taken from Harper's Ferry, which were of the new-model caliber .58; the muskets were the old flint lock, caliber .69, altered to percussion.

Some years later he returned to the town, but as he remained only a short time, he evidently did not reillumine his first flame. He did not wed until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old, and then on February 25, 1726, he married the eighteen-year-old Marie Louise Mangot.

In fact, there seems to be some difference of opinion among those designers who favor fixed ignition, and in one case this is located <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> degrees ahead of center, and in another motor the point is fixed at twenty degrees, so that it may be said that this will vary as much as one hundred per cent. in various forms. This point will vary with different methods of ignition, as well as the location of the spark-plug or igniter.

The Romans lost four tribunes, and two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> soldiers, in this memorable battle of Strasburgh, so glorious to the Caesar, and so salutary to the afflicted provinces of Gaul. Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain in the field, without including those who were drowned in the Rhine, or transfixed with darts while they attempted to swim across the river.

Pausanias enumerates only eighty-eight paintings, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> portraits; he describes, on the other hand, 2,827 statues. These were, in fact, more suitable ornaments to public places, and the gods were always represented in the temple by sculpture. In Greece painting followed the invariable law of development.

Domestic exports of coffee, mostly from Hawaii and Porto Rico, amounted to 34,572,967 pounds valued at $5,895,606, as compared with 36,757,443 pounds valued at $9,803,574 in the calendar year 1920, or a decrease of six percent in quantity and forty percent in value. In 1919 domestic exports were 34,351,554 pounds, having a value of $8,816,581, practically the same in quantity, but showing a...", "...and the dividends that farmers have received on their investments have been so enormous that they must blush for shame, unless they are a soulless corporation. Now, for instance, a farmer paid twenty-five cents for a good average hen the 1st of December. Before the 1st of February that hen has laid five dozen eggs, which are worth two dollars and a half. Take out five cents for feed, two cents for the society that the hen has enjoyed, and there is a clear profit of two dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cents, and the farmer has got the hen left. Did any railroad wrecker ever make a greater percentage than that? Talk about watering stock, is it any worse than feeding a hen, to make her lay four-shilling eggs? We have it from good authority that some farmers have actually gone so far as to bribe legislators with eggs, to prevent their passing any law fixing a rate for the sale of eggs. This is a serious charge, and we do not vouch for it. It is probable that farmers who...", "...observer is the undertaking which has the uninviting name of Drainage Canal. The pure water of Lake Michigan used to be polluted by the inflow of the Chicago River. To prevent this the city has made an immense waterway by which the lake water is carried to the Illinois River and the tide of the Chicago River is diverted from its former course. The new canal is navigable and opens a route between the great lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. The territory involved embraces the city and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> square miles of Cook County.

The time taken in raising steam to 60 lb. pressure was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> minutes.

It is an unquestionable fact that the unification of Germany and the establishment of a strong German Empire, half a century ago, were brought about against the bitter opposition of France, and that the defeat incurred by France in 1870, in her attempt to prevent German unification, is at the bottom of the constant irritation that has agitated Europe during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years. Germany's policy toward France during these forty-three years has been one of utmost restraint and forbearance, and has been dictated by the one desire of making her forget the loss of the two provinces, German until the seventeenth century and inhabited by German stock, which were won back from France in 1870. Whether the acquisition of these provinces was a fortunate thing for Germany may be doubted. The possession of Alsace-Lorraine has certainly robbed Germany of...", "...not win them over to me afterwards, I should only complain of myself.

On this hot August morning he was dressed in a light grey frock-coat, under which he wore a yellow waistcoat, and on his wife's writing-table lay his tall hat and lemon-coloured gloves. As mayor of his native town--a position he owed to an historic name and to his wealth, and not to his very moderate Republican opinions--his duties included the celebration of civil marriages, and to-day, it being the...", "...tangle of imagery, often obscene and horrible, often quaint and fantastic, is difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We recognize the prevalence of three great popular types or figures, each of which may be credited with a satirical intention--of Reynard the Fox, the hero of the famous medieval romance; of the Devil, that peculiarly medieval antithesis of God; and of Death, the sarcastic and irreverent skeleton. The popularity of the last is evidenced by the fact that no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> towns in England, France and Germany are enumerated as possessing sets of the Dance of Death, that grandiose all-levelling series of caprices in the contemplation of which the middle ages found so much consolation.

It would be interesting to know if the arrangement entered into by the British Government, that the export of opium from India shall diminish by one-tenth annually until it has ceased, is reciprocal, in so far that not alone shall the exports of the drug from China be diminished in the same proportion, but the area under poppy cultivation be similarly controlled.

They are in the proportion of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> per cent. of the Phanerogams. Thus the earliest husbandmen employed chiefly annuals or biennials, rather fewer woody species, and far fewer herbaceous perennials.

There is no account of either of this, or the _Heart's Ease_, in _The Struggler for the Preservation of Mr. John Bunyan's Labours_. This gives a list of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> works published by him, and of seventeen left by him at his decease for publication. If _The Visions_ were written by him, it must have escaped the search of his widow and surviving friends; but the style at once proves that it was not a production of his prolific pen. Bunyan's style was remarkably simple and plain. The following phrases extracted from _The Visions_ will carry conviction to every reader:-- \"Mormo's of a future state,\" \"metempsychosis of nature,\"...", "...oft-repeated explanations went for little, and that in the end--but this was not until he had been at practise for almost a month--he learned the tricks himself by constant experimenting.

The asvattha or pippala-tree, _Ficus Religiosa_, which had previously been identified with the supreme deity, Brahma, came to be venerated above all others by the special injunction of Gautama, as that under which he had achieved perfect knowledge.[28] In his previous incarnations Gautama himself is represented as having been a tree-spirit no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> times. The evidence of the monuments as to the importance attached to the tree in early Buddhism is equally definite.

Notwithstanding the isles are not identified on either of Champlain's maps (1612 and 1632), it is no longer doubtful that De Monts made them out nine years before Smith saw them, though the latter has first given them on a map a locality and a name.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years he labored with shrewdness and perseverance, and with few scruples as to the means employed, to build up the kingly authority. His first act was a violent attack on the _Jews_, whom he despoiled and banished. This was counted an act of piety.

During the life of _Henry II._, Philip had allied himself closely with his son _Richard_ (the...", "...ceased. Surely these circumstances formed a body of proof which was irresistible.

He saw at least three after the first of these communications, for that many letters exist containing the same mournful allusion. In 1862 the Civil War disrupted the Church. Dr. Elias Harrison died in 1863 after <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years of ministering to his congregation and with his death the Church ceased to function and its congregation scattered. During the Battle of Bull Run, it was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers, and from time to time it was used by other faiths, including a Negro Baptist congregation. Neglected, uncared for, the prey of thieves and vandals, the doors were finally closed. The cemetery lies between the Church and the manse. Here John Carlyle sleeps. Cofounder and...", "...More than three hundred years have rolled away since the events narrated in the following pages stirred the souls of men; since John Bradford sat down to his \"merry supper with the Lord;\" since Lawrence Saunders slept peacefully at the stake, lifted over the dark river in the arms of God; since Ridley and Latimer, on that autumn morning at Oxford, lighted that candle in England which they trusted by God's grace should never be put out. And how stands it with England now? For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years, like a bird fascinated by the serpent, she has been creeping gradually closer to the outstretched arms of the great enchantress. Is she blind and deaf? Has she utterly forgotten all her history, all the traditions of her greatness? It is not quite too late to halt in her path of destruction; but how soon may it become so? How soon may the dying scream of the bird be hushed in the jaws of the serpent? The candle which was lighted on that autumn morning is...", "...her want of feeling, said, \"Madam, it would give _you_ very little concern if all your relations were spitted like those larks, and roasted for Presto's supper.\" Taking the most unfavourable version, we may judge how much real indifference to human sorrow was implied by seeing how Johnson was affected by a loss of one of his humblest friends. It is but one case of many. In 1767, he took leave, as he notes in his diary, of his \"dear old friend, Catherine Chambers,\" who had been for about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years in the service of his family. \"I desired all to withdraw,\" he says, \"then told her that we were to part for ever, and, as Christians, we should part with prayer, and that I would, if she was willing, say a short prayer beside her. She expressed great desire to hear me, and held up her poor hands as she lay in bed, with great fervour, while I prayed, kneeling by her, in nearly the following words\"--which shall not be repeated here--\"I then kissed her,\" he adds. \"She...", "...center--a pin wheel! How much windage did you have?\" \"A quarter-point of left wind,\" answered Dick. \"Just right--now, go ahead and make a possible.\" And that is exactly what Drummer Comstock did--every one of his following shots hitting the bull's-eye for a perfect score, and to the present day he shows that page from his score book with great pride. Dick's luck continued with him at 600 yards, which to many old and tried riflemen is one of the most interesting ranges. With <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> points here and the fifty at 500 yards, Dick now had a total score of one hundred and eighty-two points. \"What's your total, Hank?\" asked Dick while they rested during the noon hour. \"One hundred and sixty-three, so far; but do you know who has the highest total for the day?\" \"No, I didn't get through at six hundred in time to look over the score-boards; why, who is it?\" \"Oh, a fellow named Richard Comstock!

A weekly allowance in money and coals was granted to these poor people. \"In the year 1849 the applicants had become so numerous that it was determined to erect an additional building. The first stone of that building was laid by my lamented father, who again...", "...The president is not dis- [15] missed from his office, as soon as he is acquainted with business--he continues four years, and is re-eligible, if the people approve his conduct.

The age requisite to qualify for this office is thirty-five years.(5) The age requisite for admittance to the Roman consulship was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years. For this difference, good reasons may be assigned--the improvements in science, and particularly in government, render it practicable for a man to qualify himself for an important office, much earlier in life, than he could among the Romans; especially in the early part of their commonwealth, when the office was instituted. Besides it is very questionable whether any inconvenience would have attended admission to the consulship at an earlier age.(6) The powers...", "...gave Craig one of his favorite cigars. The gambler turned it over and inspected the carnelian label, realizing that this was expected of him. Mallow smiled complacently. They might smoke as good as that at the government-house, but he rather doubted it. Trust a Britisher to know a good pipe-charge; but his selection of cigars was seldom to be depended upon. \"Don't see many of these out here,\" was Craig's comment, and he tucked away the cigar in a vest pocket. \"They cost me <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cents apiece, without duty.\" The vulgarian's pleasure lies not in the article itself so much as in the price paid for it. On the plantation Mallow smoked Burma cheroots because he really preferred them. There, he drank rye whisky, consorted with his employees, gambled with them and was not above cheating when he had them drunk enough.

We are just enough to understand that a country like France, with a glorious past, a gallant spirit and an undaunted courage, cannot forget the blow we dealt her <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years ago. We think we have been right in retaking from her Alsace-Lorraine, belonging originally to the German Empire. But we look with a kind of envy upon her who succeeded in denationalizing the people of those provinces to such a degree that we have not yet been able to make them Germans once more. We have always regretted that the two most civilized nations in Continental Europe should be rent asunder by an unforgotten past.

Its top is three thousand and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> feet above the river at its foot. The sides show plainly-marked perpendicular cleavages in the granite. Although so steep in front and at the sides, a strong grasp, a sure foot, a cool nerve and a calm head can safely climb it from the rear, that is, the southwest side.

They celebrate their festivities with good meat and wine consumed decently behind closed doors. Dantzig was in fact under a cloud. No larger than a man's hand, this cloud had risen in Corsica <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years earlier. It had overshadowed France. Its gloom had spread to Italy, Austria, Spain; had penetrated so far north as Sweden; was now hanging sullen over Dantzig, the greatest of the Hanseatic towns, the Free City. For a Dantziger had never needed to say that he was a Pole or a Prussian, a Swede or a subject of the Czar. He was a Dantziger. Which is tantamount to having for a postal address a single name that is marked on the map.

They set sail in December, 1606, in three ships under Captain Newport, and in April, 1607, reached the entrance of Chesapeake Bay. Sailing westward across the bay, the ships entered a river which was named the James in honor of the king, and on the bank of this river the party landed and founded Jamestown (map, p. 44).

This edifice was an oblong square one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> feet long by fifty-five feet wide, or nearly half as large again as the nave of Canterbury Cathedral. The whole of this apartment was roofed in with slabs of solid stone; two rows of circular pillars thirty feet in height supported the central part, dividing it into three avenues, while on each side of the pillars was a row of square piers, still further extending the width of the chamber, and breaking it up into five long vistas.

The first of Scott's remarkable series of novels, \"Waverley,\" published in 1814 when the author was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years of age and at the height of his fame as a poet, took the fashionable and literary world by storm. The novel had been partly written for several years, but was laid aside, as his edition of Swift and his essays for the supplement of the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica,\" and other prose writings, employed all the time he had to spare.

It is two thousand eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> feet above sea level, and the highest point on the road. In the olden time snow drifts often accumulated to the depth of twenty feet on Keyser's Ridge, and stages and wagons were compelled to take to the skirting glades to avoid them.

Here Camden pauses in his description of the place, to consider whether there ever was a Hercules at all, and, if so, whether there were not really <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> Hercules; and if this was not so, whether Hercules was perhaps 'a mere fiction to denote the strength of human prudence,' or, again, possibly a myth personifying the sun, and his labours the signs of the zodiac, 'which the sun runs through yearly.' On the whole, he decides that, at any rate, Hercules never came to Britain, but the name might have been given to the point by the Greeks 'out of vanity,' because 'they dedicated everything they found magnificent in any place to...", "...Kingdom, or the British Empire, in five different degrees of largeness, so may 'our metropolis' have at least as many significations.

The Town Clerk reported that, in the preparation of the Ordnance Survey, a question had arisen as to whether two pieces of land, one containing about 38 acres, situate in the parish of Catton, and the other of about 45 acres, with 150 houses thereon, situate in the parish of Sprowston, should not be included within the Parliamentary and municipal boundary of the...", "...Association.

MARCH. 25.--The Sheriff of Norwich (Dr. Bateman) and the Mayor (Sir Samuel Bignold) attended at the Shirehall, on the conclusion of the Norfolk Assizes, when the former, addressing Mr. Baron Martin, presented his lordship with a pair of white kid gloves, in commemoration of the fact that for the first time in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years the city of Norwich had had a maiden Assize. The Mayor corroborated the statement, and said that in that year, 1830, he happened to be Sheriff of the city. His lordship remarked it was extremely creditable that a city of 80,000 inhabitants should have no cases for trial at the Assizes. 29.--Two meetings were held at Norwich, in furtherance of an effort to secure a visit of the Royal Agricultural Society to the city in 1874. The Norfolk Agricultural Association...", "...personal conduct, the general system of Augustus was equally adopted and uniformly pursued by Hadrian and by the two Antonines. They persisted in the design of maintaining the dignity of the empire, without attempting to enlarge its limits.

During a long period of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years, their virtuous labors were crowned with success; and if we except a few slight hostilities, that served to exercise the legions of the frontier, the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius offer the fair prospect of universal peace.

He offered Herschel a salary of L200 a year if he would come and live at Datchet, and devote himself entirely to astronomical observations. It was by no means a munificent sum for a king to offer for such labour; but Herschel gladly accepted it, as it would enable him to give up the interruption of teaching, and spend all his time on his beloved astronomy. His Bath friend, Sir William Watson, exclaimed when he heard of it, \"Never bought monarch honour so cheap.\" Herschel was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> when he removed to Datchet, and from that day forth he lived almost entirely in his observatory, wholly given up to his astronomical pursuits. Even when he had to go to London to read his papers before the Royal Society, he chose a moonlight night (when the stars would be mostly invisible), so that it might not interfere with his regular labours. Poor Carolina was horrified at the house at Datchet, which seemed terribly desolate and poor, even to her modest German ideas;...", "...us he had buried four, but was so weak he could not bury the others who were in the house.

In the ordinary course of nature the number of persons, (including those in age and infancy, the weakest periods of existence,) who perish in the space of a twelvemonth, is at the rate of but two and a half in a hundred; but in an African voyage, notwithstanding the old are excluded and few infants admitted, so that those who are shipped are in the firmest period of life, the list of deaths, presents an annual mortality of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> in a hundred. It presents this mortality even in vessels from the windward coast of Africa; but in those which sail to Bonny, Benin, and the Calabars, from whence the greatest proportion of the slaves are brought, this mortality is increased by a variety of causes, (of which the greater length of the voyage is one,) and is said to be twice as large which supposes that in every hundred the deaths annually amount to no less than eighty-six. Yet even the former comparatively...", "...In 1919, the first year after the war, this amount was almost doubled, being 150,483,853 pounds with a value of $30,425,162. In 1920, there was a further increase to 194,682,616 pounds valued at $41,557,669, and in 1921 the high mark of 249,123,356 pounds valued at $37,322,305 was reached. This was a gain of twenty-eight percent over 1920 shipments; and, although the value was less than in the year before, the decrease was only ten percent in a year when the average fall in value was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> percent.

In Persia and other Eastern Countries trees may often be met with, the branches of which have been recently hung with offerings of cloth, rags, and even garments. In India the notion of trees being inhabited by deities or semi-divine beings or spirits is to this day very common, and we have already noted (p. 112) that during the period of Gautama's Bodhi-sattvaship, in the course of which he had to undergo countless births in preparation for his Buddhahood, he was born <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> times as a tree-god. In Siam, according to Mr. Alabaster, offerings are commonly made in the present day to the spirits or deities inhabiting trees.

In one of them, the corps of Marion, its general being attending in the legislature, was surprised and dispersed by the British Colonel Thompson; and in another, an English guard galley, mounting twelve guns, and manned with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> seamen, was captured by Captain Rudolph, of the legion. From the possession of the lower country of South Carolina, which was known to contain considerable quantities of rice and beef cattle, the army had anticipated more regular and more abundant supplies of food than it had been accustomed to receive. This hope was disappointed by the measures of the government. The generals, and other agents acting under the authority of congress, had been accustomed in extreme...", "...United States, and planted the American flag in the public square, where the stars and stripes and eagle streamed above the Palacio Grande, or stately residence of ex-Governor Armigo.

In this engagement the Mexicans lost <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> killed and fifty wounded. Only one American was wounded and none killed.

All this suggests that this is a very early and common form of narrative. Among folk-tales there are still many traces of the _cante-fable_. Thus, in Grimm's collection, verses occur in Nos. 1, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 21, 24, 28, 30, 36, 38_a_, _b_, 39_a_, 40, 45, 46, 47, out of the first fifty tales, 36 per cent.

The speed at which we travelled was a sensible proof that we were once more on the line of our old friends of Pennsylvania. From Altoona to Harrisburg, 132 miles, we rattled along in two hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> minutes. On another stretch of the line we travelled eighty-three miles in one hour and forty-two seconds, including stoppages; and the rapid motion was very agreeable, as there was a perceptible increase of temperature after we reached the plains and approached the beautiful valley of the Susquehannah--a scene of industry, prosperity, and peace. Fortunately there was a good light on the river, and we had a fine view of the country all the way to Harrisburg under the rays...", "...Canada has spent on her canals $138,000,000. On steamship subsidies, Canada's yearly grants have gradually risen from a few hundred thousands to as high as two millions in some years.

This road was so heavily guaranteed by provincial governments that if it had failed it would have involved four western provinces. Its plight arose from two causes--the extravagant cost of labor and material in an inflated era, and the depression in the world money markets curtailing all extension. Workmen on this road were paid three to seventeen dollars a day, who would have received a dollar and a half to four dollars ten...", "...fresh-water shell (Paludina) is common to Tahiti and Van Diemen's Land.

Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> shells found in other parts of the world, twenty-five inhabit the western coast of America, and of these eight are distinguishable as varieties; the remaining eighteen (including one variety) were found by Mr. Cuming in the Low Archipelago, and some of them also at the Philippines.

They and Professor Witthaus agreed in their testimony that the lungs were congested.

The affair of Quatre Bras was sustained with admirable firmness by the allied English and Netherland forces, against an enemy infinitely superior in number, and commanded by one of the best generals in France. The Prince of Orange, with only nine thousand men, maintained his position till three o'clock in the afternoon, despite the continual attacks of Marshal Ney, who commanded the left of the French army, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand men. But the interest of this combat, and the details of the loss in killed and wounded, are so merged in the succeeding battle, which took place on the 18th, that they form in most minds a combination of exploits which the interval of a day can scarcely be considered to have separated. The 17th was occupied by a retrograde movement of the allied army, directed by the duke of Wellington, for the purpose of taking its stand on the position he had previously fixed...", "...the immediate dispatch of half my battalion to the front, subject to the approval of the commanding officer. It seems to me they might have plucked up courage enough to decide the matter for themselves, instead of putting the responsibility upon the local commander. As it was left to me, however, I gave the necessary orders at once. That very night, August 5, I marched through Vladivostok to entrain my detachment. It consisted of 500 fully equipped infantry and a machine-gun section of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> men with four heavy-type maxims. Leaving my second in command, Major F.J. Browne, in charge of the Base, I marched with the men with full pack. The four miles, over heavy, dirty roads, were covered in fair time, though many of the men became very exhausted, and at the end of the march I found myself carrying four rifles, while other officers carried packs in addition to their own kit.

At that moment Fisher's appearance upon the heights to the north-west somewhat after relieved the pressure, and McCracken, receiving to his satisfaction permission to retain what he had won, soon had his command so safely entrenched against musketry and shell fire, that, for the next <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> days, during which it never ceased, his casualties numbered but eighteen. So passed the day without further incident until, late in the afternoon, Schoeman suddenly led a column, about 1,000 strong, out of the south-eastern corner of the Colesberg _enceinte_, making as if to envelop the British right.

Three hundred and seventy-two drawings had then been secured, and they covered between them a period of six months and a half. They were also as consecutive as it was possible to secure. During a part of the period the planet was seen and drawn at every twenty-four hours, from April 5, namely, to May 26, or for forty-six consecutive days. Though the rest of the time did not equal this perfection, no great gap occurred, and one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> nights were utilized in all. Furthermore, as these drawings were all made by one man, the personal equation of the observer--a very important source of deviation where drawings are to be compared--was eliminated. But even this does not give an idea of the mass of the data. For by the method employed about 100 drawings were used in the case of each canal, and as 109 canals were examined this gave 10,900 separate determinations upon which the ultimate result depended.

In 1815 the facts first came to the knowledge of Mrs. Serres; but, even then, they were not revealed, until the grave had closed over every individual who could vouch as to the handwriting.

The volume (called the Codex Carolinus) seems to have been once at Bobbio, and has been traced from Weissenburg to Mayence and Prague, till it was bought by a Duke of Brunswick in 1689.

It is a large stone edifice of block coral, one hundred and forty-four feet long and seventy-eight wide, and was one of the first objects we saw after passing Diamond Head. It was commenced in 1838, and was five years in building, at a cost of about thirty thousand dollars. Just think of people, who, only twenty-five years before, were in the depths of heathen darkness, building such a church, and by voluntary...", "...that a vigorous effort in that government to compel the payment of private debts, and raise money for public ones, produced the resistance. I believe you may be assured, than an idea or desire of returning to any thing like their ancient government, never entered into their heads. I am not discouraged by this. For thus I calculate. An insurrection in one of thirteen States, in the course of eleven years that they have subsisted, amounts to one in any particular state, in one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years, say a century and a half. This would not be near as many as have happened in every other government that has ever existed. So that we shall have the difference between a light and a heavy government as clear gain.

A canoe was capsized and we lost five rifles. Ismailia was shot dead at Panga Falls. But why need we say over again what I have already said? We reached Ugarrowwa's after an absence of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> days. There were only sixteen of us alive, and fifteen of us were wounded.

We had resolved not to tramp through France, and we therefore sought places in the diligence; and by the time I had paid <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> francs for my seat in that respectable vehicle, and ten francs for the carriage of my box from Vienna to Strassburg, together with two francs for a passeport provisoire; and by the time also that I had paid some two francs more for extra luggage, including two loaves and a string of six Strassburger sausages, which were all included in the weight, I found that I should arrive in Paris with less than five francs in my pocket.

Here, indeed, was one of the signs of the times with a vengeance! Surely the colored race must have a great natural thirst for knowledge.

In other words, forty-three per cent. of the colored population of the United States could read and write--being ten years and over of age. At that time that I am writing my book, that is, the year of grace, 1897, inasmuch as the increase is going bravely on from day to day, I have no hesitation in saying that fifty per cent., that is, one-half of the entire colored population of the United States, North and South included, and--as usual in such government...", "...for litanies in the church. It is curiously characteristic that it was the English clergyman, who, equally pious, and sensible that only the Almighty could remove the scourge, yet deemed it right to take precautions against the effects of bringing a large number of persons into one building.

Besides the Oratorians, there died eighteen Jesuits, twenty-six of the order called Recollets, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> Capuchins, all of whom had freely given their lives in the endeavor to alleviate the general suffering. In the four chief towns of Provence 80,000 died, and about 8,000 in the lesser places.

Here, then, we have seventy-three species, all but one of which (_Spiranthes cernua_) are of the class of exogens. Twenty-two orders are represented, the great autumnal family of the _Composit\u00e6_ naturally taking the lead, with thirty species (sixteen of them asters and golden-rods), while the mustard, pink, and pulse families come next, with five species each. The large and hardy heath family is wanting altogether. Out of the whole number about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> are indigenous. Witch-hazel is the only shrub, and, as might have been expected, there is no climbing plant. In setting down such a list one feels it a pity that so few of the golden-rods and asters have any specific designation in English.

There are two points in the law that deserve consideration. First, the object of the fund was the aid and encouragement of the schools, and not their support; and secondly, the limit of appropriation to the respective towns was the amount raised by each. There is an apparent inconsistency in this restriction when it is considered that the income of the entire fund would have been equal to only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cents for each child in the state between the ages of five and fifteen years, and that each town raised, annually, by taxation, a larger sum; but this inconsistency is to be explained by the fact that the public sentiment, as indicated by resolves reported by the same committee for the appointment of commissioners on the subject, tended to a distribution of money among the towns according to their educational wants. As early as 1828, the Committee on Education of the...", "...and go on board the Dorsetshire man-of-war, to proceed to Jamaica. But another tedious delay occurred.

By this time, John Harrison had finished his fourth timepiece--the small one, in the form of a watch. At length William Harrison set sail with this timekeeper from Portsmouth for Jamaica, on November 18th, 1761, in the Deptford man-of-war. The Deptford had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> ships in convoy, and arrived at Jamaica on the 19th of January, 1762, three days before the Beaver, another of His Majesty's ships-of-war, which had sailed from Portsmouth ten days before the Deptford, but had lost her reckoning and been deceived in her longitude, having trusted entirely to the log.

He carried on a vast war without interruption during the whole of his <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years' reign against the most wealthy and military nations of Christendom not recognising his authority, and in so doing he is said to have expended a sum total of seven hundred millions of dollars--a statement which made men's hair stand on their heads.

Taking ten different kinds of ink, most commonly on sale, he drew lines on a piece of paper in such a way as to produce a hundred points of crossing and so that a line drawn with each of ink passed both over and under all the lines drawn with the other inks. He, of course, knew, in respect to each point of crossing, which ink was first applied, but the appearance to the eye corresponded with the fact in only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cases. In thirty-seven cases the appearance was contrary to the fact, and in the remaining cases the eye was unable to come to any decision.

It was found necessary in 1651 to forbid all \"mixt and unmixt\" dancing at taverns on the occasion of weddings, abuses and disorders having arisen. But I fancy a people who would give an \"ordination ball\" would not long sit still at a wedding; and by the year 1769, at a wedding in New London, ninety-two jigs, fifty contra-dances, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> minuets, and seventeen hornpipes were danced, and the party broke up at quarter of one in the morning--at what time could it have begun?

It was here Santa Anna, already returned from his ill-fated movement against Taylor, undertook to defend the passage of the mountains against Scott's advance. After careful reconnoissances, the American general turned his position, attacked his flank, and after a short fight broke up his army in utter rout, very nearly cutting off and capturing the whole. As it was, the Americans captured about four thousand prisoners, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cannon, and three thousand five hundred small-arms. All this was done with a force of less than nine thousand Americans against some twelve thousand Mexicans strongly fortified. This extraordinary victory opened the road to the valley.

Of the forty-three Scotch it would be impossible to ascertain how many of them were from the Highlands, because all people from Scotland were designated under the one word.

The \"correction\" was virtually the allowance which a large yacht made to a smaller one for the difference in length. The club had adopted the regulation of the Dorchester Yacht Club, which contained a \"table of allowance per mile.\" In this table, a yacht one hundred and ten feet six inches long, is taken as the standard for length. The Skylark was just thirty feet long on the water-line, and her allowance by the table was two minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> and four tenths seconds for every mile sailed in a regatta. The Sea Foam's length was three inches less, and her allowance was one and three tenths seconds more.

Sir William Tite was an ardent collector of manuscripts, books, and works of art, and he formed a very large and choice library, which contained many valuable manuscripts, and a great number of rare early English books. It was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, in May and June 1874. The sale occupied sixteen days, and realised nineteen thousand nine hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> pounds, six shillings. There were three thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven lots. Among the more notable manuscripts in the library were a richly illuminated _Lectionarium_, written on vellum about A.D. 1150 at the monastery of Ottenbeuren in Suabia, which sold for five hundred and fifty pounds; a Wycliffe New Testament on vellum of the first half of the fifteenth century, which brought two hundred and forty-one pounds; a copy of the Four Gospels of about the same...", "...floor corresponds to the main assembly room on the fourth floor of the Salt Lake City Temple, and is provided with pulpits at both east and west ends, the former devoted to the use of the Higher or Melchisedek Priesthood, the latter reserved for the officials of the Lesser or Aaronic order of Priesthood.

For two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years the Negro had been learning the lesson of obedience and obsequious submission to the white man. The system of slavery under which he had languished had destroyed the family relation, the source of all virtue, self-respect, and moral growth.

A riot followed and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> Negroes were arrested, charged with rioting and theft of the trucks, and sentenced to up to four years in prison. The authorities also recommended that several of the white marines (p. 093) involved be court-martialed.

This check Thyrsis paid over to his rich relative, and a week or two later, when he sold a short story, he sent the balance of the hundred dollars that he owed.

Friendships Godwin had, but of love he seems to have kept absolutely clear until at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> he met Mary Wollstonecraft. He had not much believed in love as a disturbing element, and had openly avowed in his writings that he thought it usurped far too large a place in the ordinary plan of human life.

Mary Wollstonecraft was in all respects his opposite. Her ardent, impulsive, Irish nature had stood the test of an...", "...in the wrong in the affair.

This bill was returned on the 9th of March by the council, with their objections, and, two thirds not voting in favour, it was lost. These objections, in substance, were precisely what had been urged against it by Colonel Burr on the floor of the assembly.

In 1703/04 the average size of landholding in Northampton County was 389 acres, in Accomack 520 acres.

Considering all of Virginia of the seventeenth century, one cannot say that it was primarily a land of large plantations, of cavaliers, and of noble manors which have been romanticized by some writers.

It is hardly worth while, however, making a formal assertion of so self-evident a proposition as that rent constitutes a much smaller fraction of the national income now that wealth is invested so vastly in trade and manufactures, than it did when agriculture was the one great business of life: but it is perhaps better worth showing that rent does not absorb a greater...", "...subject of a caricature by John Phoenix, the _nom de plume_ of that inveterate wit and joker, Lieutenant George H.

The individual man needs only nine months for his complete development, from the fecundation of the ovum to the moment when he leaves the maternal womb. The human embryo runs its whole course in the brief space of forty weeks (as a rule, 280 days). In many other mammals the time of the embryonic development is much the same as in man--for instance, in the cow. In the horse and ass it takes a little longer, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> to forty-five weeks; in the camel, thirteen months. In the largest mammals, the embryo needs a much longer period for its development in the womb--a year and a half in the rhinoceros, and ninety weeks in the elephant. In these cases pregnancy lasts twice as long as in the case of man, or one and three-quarter years. In the smaller mammals the embryonic period is much shorter. The smallest mammals, the dwarf-mice, develop in three weeks; hares in four weeks, rats and marmots...", "...in at forty-four and four-tenths per cent. But as this was after all more vigorous protection than woollens had before received, amounting, through minima, in some cases to over one hundred per cent., sixteen out of the thirty-nine New England members, led by Webster, accepted this universally odious tariff bill--the Tariff of Abominations, it was called--as the preferable evil, and, aided by a few Democrats in each house, made it a law. The average duty on dutiables was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> and a third per cent. No one can question that this high tariff worked injustice to the South. It forced from her an undue share of the national taxes, as well as extensive tribute to northern manufacturers.

It is therefore probable that, of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> millions of returns from the direct imposts and from the patriotic contribution, they have furnished the larger portion, perhaps two thirds of it, or even three-quarters.

For instance, in regard to the patriotic contribution, the Assembly left it to the conscience of each person to fix his own quota; at the end of six months,...", "...de Caen was in charge of the fort, and in the violence of his heresy refused them shelter. The inhabitants, likewise, declined to admit the newcomers to their homes. In despair at such treatment the three Jesuits were on the point of returning to France, when the hospitable Recollets invited them to the convent at Notre Dame des Anges. In September the Jesuits made a clearing on the opposite side of the St. Charles, and here they began to build a convent of their own. Thus had the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> French exiles, who now made the permanent population of Quebec, a sufficiency of both Recollets and Jesuits for their spiritual guidance.

In the general western literature, it has seemed to me, Oregon has never received its merited share of consideration. Just now,...", "...Jericho, spoke to them that were 26:4.

She prepared a large fleet of a hundred and twenty sail, of which seventeen were her own ships, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> were smaller vessels, and the rest tenders and victuallers: she embarked on board this fleet five thousand new-levied soldiers, and added a thousand veteran troops, whom Sir Francis Vere brought from the Netherlands.

The French, who emulated the skill and valour of the English, had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> killed and one hundred and seventeen wounded; and the Russians fifty-seven killed and one hundred and thirty-seven wounded. The scene of wreck and devastation on the side of the Turks was such as had not been witnessed since the battle of Lepanto: of about one hundred men-of-war and transports, about half were burnt, sunk, or driven on shore.

By these means he raised his fleet to two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> long galleys or ships of war.

He was favorable to parliamentary reform. The ferment on this subject caused the resignation of the _Wellington_ ministry, which was succeeded by the ministry of Earl _Grey_. A bill for reform was presented to Parliament, depriving eighty-eight \"rotten or decayed\" boroughs, where there were very few inhabitants, of a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> members of the House of Commons, who were given to counties or to large towns, such as _Birmingham_ and _Manchester_, which had no representation. At the same time the franchise was greatly extended. The bill was strenuously resisted by the Tories, who now began to be called _Conservatives_. Its repeated rejection by the House of Lords caused a violent agitation. Finally, in 1832, when it was understood that the king would create new peers enough to pass the measure, it...", "...peasants from the surrounding country began to take refuge in the capital they found business at a standstill, the shops closed, the streets deserted, the householders preparing for flight. From the twenty-third to the twenty-eighth there was no news from Napoleon; the Empress and council heard only of Marmont's defeat. They felt that a decision must be taken, and finally on the twenty-eighth the imperial officials held a council. The facts were plainly stated by Clarke; he had but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand men, all told, wherewith to defend the capital, and in consequence it was determined to send the Empress and her son to Rambouillet on the very next day. This fatal decision was taken partly through fear, but largely in deference to Napoleon's letter containing the classical allusion to Astyanax. The very men who took it believed that the Parisian masses would have died for the young Napoleon, and deplored the decision they had reached. \"Behold what a fall in...", "...seized revenue-cutters in Southern ports.

The Confederates fitted out privateers to prey upon our commerce; but these were soon disposed of by government vessels, which, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> in number, blockaded the Southern ports by midsummer. Nevertheless, numerous British ships, in violation of neutrality laws, slipped into Southern ports with supplies for the Confederates. Danger made the Navy Department very active.

The crowd cried: \"Away with the crepe\" and instantly all signs of mourning that had surrounded the statue for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years were torn away. As might be expected, when the French army was driven out of Alsace later on, the people suffered untold misery. The Good Lord only knows what they went through.

Next day General Washington rode out on horseback and, under the famous elm still standing near Harvard University, drew his sword and took command of the American army. He was then <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old, with a tall, manly form and a noble face. He was good to look at as he sat there, a perfect picture of manly strength and dignity, wearing an epaulet on each shoulder, a broad band of blue silk across his breast, and a three-cornered hat with the cockade of liberty in it.

We can thus realise at what a disadvantage the ancients were. The measuring instruments at their command were utterly inadequate to detect such small displacements.

The book, \"Figures of the Past,\" was written by Josiah Quincy of the famous Quincy family of Massachusetts, a graduate of Harvard, 1821; mayor of Boston from 1845 to 1849. Mr. Quincy visited Nauvoo in May, 1844, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> days previous to the martyrdom of the Prophet, and though his \"Figures of the Past\" was not published until 1882, the year of his death, yet his recollections of the Prophet and his impressions of Nauvoo were drawn from his journal, written at the time of that visit, and numerous letters written to his friends about the same period.

It was committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, wherein it was discussed on the eighth of June and reported back to the House.

Doctor Bode then named the new star \"Uranus,\" and Uranus it is, although perhaps with any other name 't would shine as bright. Herschel was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old when he discovered Uranus. He was still a professional musician, and an amateur astronomer. But it did not require much arguing on the part of Doctor Watson when he presented Herschel's name for membership in the Royal Society for that most respectable body of scholars to at once pass favorably on the nomination. As one member in seconding the motion put it, \"Herschel honors us in accepting this membership, quite as much as we do him in granting it.\" And so...", "...and capture another; but he never let Lady Bessborough go, and the antics of his mortified vanity were to lead her as far into the mire as any woman could go without suffocation. Such experiences may be common enough; it is rare to have them so nakedly portrayed as they are in this lady's letters, and not easy to avoid the conclusion that she made use of them to pique her wooden Antinous into some more active kind of pose than that of allowing himself to be adored. Sheridan was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> and married to his second wife when Lady Bessborough fell in with Antinous at Naples; but it was not until the attachment of those two had become a notoriety that he began to make scenes about it.

Take, for example, the resolution presented by Mary Grew, and passed in the Woman's Anti-Slavery Convention <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years ago, declaring that it was the Christian duty of every woman to withdraw from all churches that fellowshiped with slavery, which was a sin against God and man.

At the end of the second year after his arrival La Bougival was the only servant in the house; on her discretion he knew he could count, and he disguised his real purposes by the all-powerful open reason of a necessary economy. To the great satisfaction of his heirs he became a miser. Without fawning or wheedling, solely by the influence of her devotion and solicitude, La Bougival, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old at the time this tale begins, was the housekeeper of the doctor and his protegee, the pivot on which the whole house turned, in short, the confidential servant. She was called La Bougival from the admitted impossibility of applying to her person the name that actually belonged to her, Antoinette--for names and forms do obey the laws of harmony. The doctor's miserliness was not mere talk; it was real, and it had an object. From the year 1817 he cut off two of his...", "...her. We heard she was in a free State.

After so many long years and so many attempts, for this was her seventh, she at last succeeded, and we were now all free. My mother had been a slave for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years, and liberty was very sweet to her. The sound of freedom was music in our ears; the air was pure and fragrant; the genial rays of the glorious sun burst forth with a new lustre upon us, and all creation resounded in responses of praise to the author and creator of him who proclaimed life and freedom to the slave.

If we are to appreciate fully the place of the press during the anti-slavery epoch, we must recall the conditions of American life in the olden time.

There were fourteen papers in New England, four in New York State, two in Virginia, two in Carolina and nine in Pennsylvania.

Sylla reverted to the old rule. Consuls like Marius and Cinna, who had the confidence of the people, had been re-elected year after year, and had been virtual kings. Sylla provided that ten years must elapse between a first consulship and a second. Nor was any one to be a consul who was not <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old and had not passed already through the lower senatorial offices of praetor or quaestor. The assembly of the people had been shorn of its legislative powers. There was no longer, therefore, any excuse for its meeting, save on special occasions. To leave the tribunes power to call the citizens to the Forum was to leave them the means of creating inconvenient agitation.

We shoved the boats a dozen rods over the mud and water till they floated, then rowing half a mile to the vessel climbed aboard, and there we were in a mackerel schooner, a fine stout vessel of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> tons, whose name I forget. The baits were not dry on the hooks. There was the mill in which they ground the mackerel, and the trough to hold it, and the long-handled dipper to cast it overboard with; and already in the harbor we saw the surface rippled with schools of small mackerel, the real _Scomber vernalis_.

There were strange manifestations on the part of Miss Jewsbury toward Mrs. Carlyle. At one time, when Mrs. Carlyle had shown some preference for another woman, it led to a wild outburst of what Miss Jewsbury herself called \"tiger jealousy.\" There are many other instances of violent emotions in her letters to Mrs. Carlyle. They are often highly charged and erotic. It is unusual for a woman of thirty-two to write to a woman friend, who is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years of age, in these words, which Miss Jewsbury used in writing to Mrs. Carlyle: You are never out of my thoughts one hour together. I think of you much more than if you were my lover. I cannot express my feelings, even to you--vague, undefined yearnings to be yours in some way. Mrs. Carlyle was accustomed, in private, to speak of Miss Jewsbury as \"Miss Gooseberry,\" while Carlyle himself said that she was simply \"a flimsy tatter of a creature.\" But it is on the...", "...himself a beast, rejects clothing and ordinary food, and even (as in this case) the shelter of a roof, ceases to use articulate speech, and sometimes persists in going on all-fours.\"--Smith's _Ancient History of the East_, p. 357.] After a period the cloud passed away, \"the glory of his kingdom, his honor, and brightness returned unto him.\" But it was the splendor of the evening; for the old monarch soon after died at the age of eighty, worn out by the toils and cares of a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years, the longest, most memorable, and instructive in the annals of the Babylonian or Assyrian kings. THE FALL OF BABYLON.--In 555 B.C., Nabonadius, the last king of Babylon, began his reign.

His accession was due to the best of all reasons, his loyalty to his predecessor Tiberius Augustus, whose daughter he married. Maurice was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years of age when he became emperor, and he was an excellent ruler, promoting the happiness of his people with sense and courage.

A satire upon such an embodiment of kingship is impossible, the simple and truthful characteristics being more effective than fiction or exaggeration.

Two explanations only of this occurred to antiquity,--design and chance. Socrates, Plato, and others, were led by such facts to infer the creation of the world by an intelligent author--\"ille opifex rerum.\" Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, ascribed it to the fortuitous concourse of atoms. But modern science has expelled chance from the universe, and substituted law. Laplace, observing <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> instances in the solar system of planets and their satellites revolving on their axes or moving in their orbits, from west to east, declared that this could not be a mere coincidence.

The Reform Act of 1832 brought in a general franchise for boroughs in place of the multifarious, and on the whole highly exclusive, privileges which had existed before. It also changed, though in a less radical way, the franchise in the counties. But as a political measure its greatest importance lay in its effect upon the constituencies by the redistribution of seats. It took from small boroughs in various stages of decay and rottenness one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> seats, and gave them to the counties, and to new large towns hitherto unrepresented. The Act of 1867, on the other hand, while transferring seats to some extent, was mainly a measure for extending greatly the borough franchise. In 1884 and 1885 both subjects were dealt with radically. By the Act of 1884 the franchise for counties was much enlarged; and by that of 1885 the distribution of seats was reorganised upon a basis closely akin to equal electoral districts....", "...the Junker aristocracy is at bay, and soon to have its throat cut; but there comes a Holy Father to its rescue, with the cross of Jesus uplifted, and a series of pleas for mercy, written in Vienna, edited in Berlin, and sent out from Rome.

Out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> permanent members of the staff, thirty were German subjects, six Austrians, two German-Swiss, two Belgians, one was a Dutchman, one Turk, and there was a solitary Russian.

A panic on the Belgian market was the immediate consequence. Russian travellers had to deposit their jewellery in pawn...", "...and day, flashing out now despair, and now hope, to innumerable hearts. Liberty owes a great debt to the press, for it assembled all the people in one vast speaking chamber, and told them how events were going with the slave and the Union.

When the colonies revolted and published their Declaration there were in the United States only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> newspapers, most of them weeklies. There were fourteen papers in New England, four in New York State, two in Virginia, two in Carolina and nine in Pennsylvania. The entire forty-three papers, however, held less printed matter than any ten pages of our morning journals. The papers of that time contained no editorials, and were strictly purveyors of the gossip and news of the week, with rude advertisements--now a cut of a horse that had strayed, an apprentice that had...", "...Bragado, Olavarria, Junin, and many other towns of their size (twenty thousand population and upwards) could all support flour mills. They have none and are in the heart of the grain belt. Wood would have to be used for fuel which would be expensive, but the profits derived from the flour would offset it. Pergamino is a growing town in the grain belt between Buenos Aires and Rosario, with good railroad facilities, yet it has not a single manufacturing enterprise. It has a population of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand inhabitants. Personally I think that the flour mill proposition would be the best paying enterprise in Argentina. It would pay at all times, war or no war. One of the leading manufacturing industries in Argentina is that of the beef-canning factories, here called saladerias. This is the chief industry of Uruguay, and the second in importance in Paraguay, and the state of Matto Grosso, Brazil. These saladerias not only can beef, but they manufacture beef extract,...", "...Century._ [28] _There is only one reference to Acre in the Old Testament (Judges i, 31), and one in the New Testament (Acts xxi, 7), under the name of Ptolemais.

It was here that the Knights of St. John, after they had been driven from every other part of Palestine, prolonged for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> days their gallant resistance to the Sultan of Egypt and his immense host; 60,000 Christians were on that occasion slain or sold as slaves.

The nature of these strange villages can best be explained by an account of the best-known and the largest example of them (fig. 11). At Castellazzo di Fontanellato, a little west of Parma, are the vestiges of a settlement which, with its defences, covered an area of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> acres.

In front of the rampart was a wet ditch (A), 100 ft. wide, fed with fresh water from a neighbouring brook by an inlet at the south-western corner (C) and emptied by an outfall on the east (D).

The meaning of the adjective is doubtful. We are not certain whether the boy spoke his verses extemporaneously, his words being taken down by shorthand; or whether he and his fifty-one colleagues were allowed some time to consider the subject and write the composition, as is now the practice in literary examinations. Ancient writers speak of \"improvvisatori\" who manifested their wonderful gift at a premature age;[135] still, it seems almost impossible...", "...Loja is proverbially noted for the fertility of its gardens and orchards, the abundance and purity of its springs, and the loose morals and hard features of its inhabitants. Its situation is peculiarly picturesque, the town being built upon a steep acclivity, unbosomed in groves of fruit trees and overlooked by a toppling mountain. The view of the distant _Sierra Nevada_ gives additional interest to the scenery. It contains a population of 9000 souls. From Loja to Malaga is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> miles. The country throughout is extremely mountainous, but the road, nevertheless, is so good as to be traversed by a diligence. Soon after leaving Loja, a road strikes off to the right to Antequera, four leagues; and this, in fact, is the great road from Granada to Seville, and the only portion of it that is interrupted by mountains.

On November 16 a well-planned attack was made upon the fort; it was forced to surrender, and 2,858 prisoners, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cannon, and a large quantity of small arms were taken by the British. Two days later Cornwallis took possession of Fort Lee, together with 140 cannon and stores of various kinds. He rapidly overran New Jersey.

The result would be to save a great deal of labour to hard-worked Indian officials, who required to know the precise limits of their authority; and the Act would form a complete constitutional code, determining the powers and the mutual relations of the whole Indian administrative and legislative...", "...10 Market Place has an almost complete set of admirable photographs, which he was enabled to take when the scaffolding was up for the restoration of 1870-73: it is these which Mr Ruskin has so much admired.

Even when vaccination fails to protect against small-pox it tends to produce a modified and so much milder form of the disease, that while one patient died out of every two in the Homerton Small Pox Hospital who had the disease naturally, the deaths were only one in four of those who had been imperfectly vaccinated, and one in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> of those whose arms bore evidence of perfectly good and successful vaccination. The influence of previous vaccination often scarcely shows itself in the stage which precedes the appearance of the eruption of small-pox, the fever being often just as intense, and the general symptoms just as severe as in the unmodified disease. The difference, however, becomes at once obvious with the appearance of the rash.

Now, there was a difficulty in the movement of the planet Mercury which could not be solved. Even after all the disturbances caused by the attraction of other planets had been taken into account, there remained an inexplicable phenomenon--i.e., an extremely slow turning of the ellipsis described by Mercury on its own plane; Leverrier had found that it amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> seconds a century. Einstein found that, according to his formulas, this movement must really amount to just that much. Thus with a single blow he solved one of the greatest puzzles of astronomy. Still more remarkable, because it has a bearing upon a phenomenon which formerly could not be imagined, is the confirmation of Einstein's prediction regarding the influence of gravitation upon the course of the rays of light. That such an influence must exist is taught by a...", "...a gift from benign heaven, surely a cause for happiness! And yet--he did not feel so jolly! He was surprised, he was even a little hurt, to discover by introspection that monetary gain was not necessarily accompanied by felicity. Nevertheless, this very successful man of the world of the Five Towns, having been born on the 27th of May 1867, had reached the age of forty-three and a half years! \"I must be getting older,\" he reflected. He was right. He was still young, as every man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> will agree, but he was getting older. A few years ago a windfall of three hundred and forty-one pounds would not have been followed by morbid self-analysis; it would have been followed by unreasoning, instinctive elation, which elation would have endured at least twelve hours. As he disappeared within the reddish garden wall which sheltered his abode from the publicity of Trafalgar Road, he half hoped to see Nellie waiting for him on the famous marble step of the porch,...", "...the 14th of January, 1223, leaving the kingdom of France far more extensive and more compact, and the kingship in France far stronger and more respected than he had found them. It was the natural and well-deserved result of his life. At a time of violence and irregular adventure, he had shown to Europe the spectacle of an earnest, far-sighted, moderate, and able government, and one which in the end, under many hard trials, had nearly always succeeded in its designs, during a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years. He disposed, by will, of a considerable amount amassed without parsimony, and even, historians say, in spite of a royal magnificence. We will take from that will but two paragraphs, the first two:-- \"We will and prescribe first of all that, without any gainsaying, our testamentary executors do levy and set aside, out of our possessions, fifty thousand livres of Paris, in order to restore, as God shall inspire them with wisdom, whatsoever may be due to those from...", "...represented four distinctive generations. \"One of the notable features of the evening was the large gathering of pioneers who collectively represented more years of residence in Seattle than ever were found together before. [Illustration: LOUISA B. DENNY] \"What added interest to the occasion was the historical fact that Mr. and Mrs. Denny were the first couple married in Seattle, and the transition from the small, uncouth log cabin, built <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years ago by the sturdy young pioneer for his bride, to the present beautiful residence with all its modern convenience in which the respected couple are enjoying the fruits of a well spent life, was the subject of many congratulations from the friends of the honored host and hostess who remembered their early trials and tribulations. All present were more or less connected with the history of Seattle, all knew one another's history, and...", "...get a cut any tenderer than that, or with less bone. Would you like to have a little extra suet wrapped up with it?\" [Sidenote: Three Effects Produced] The butcher thus combined in his close _three effects_. He brought about _judgment of the prospect's intellect_, plus _increased desire_ for the goods, plus the _impulse to carry the desire into action_. First, by emphasizing, \"Two pounds and five ounces!\" in a _heavy_ tone, and by depreciating the cost, \"Only a dollar and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> cents,\" spoken _lightly_, he implied that the _value_ of the steak far outweighed the _price_. Thus judgment of the prospect's intellect was effected. Second, to stimulate increased desire for the steak, the butcher skillfully put on the favorable side of the scales of decision the weight of _a suggestion of excellence_. He said temptingly, \"It's the very choicest part of the loin.\" At this point he also employed _contrast_, to make the prospect's desire stronger still....", "...taken, only fortified the impression that a most damaging defeat had been served upon the Americans. Against Washington's estimate of a total of one thousand or less for his own loss, Howe reported that the enlisted men he captured alone numbered one thousand and six, and that in addition he took ninety-one commissioned officers, of whom three were generals, three colonels, four lieutenant-colonels, three majors, eighteen captains, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> lieutenants, eleven ensigns, one adjutant, three surgeons, and two volunteers; and he \"computed\" that in killed, wounded, and drowned, the Americans lost two thousand two hundred more. On the part of the British, Howe reported five officers and fifty-six men killed, twelve officers and two hundred and fifty-five men wounded, and one officer and thirty men prisoners and missing. The Hessians lost two men killed, three officers and...", "...For a long time it was a question whether these corpuscles were animal or vegetable; but it was soon ascertained that they belonged to the family of microscopic mushrooms, of the genus _Uredo_, which Bauer proposed naming _Uredo vivalis_. Then the doctor, prying into the snow with his cane, showed his companions that the scarlet layer was only nine feet deep, and he bade them calculate how many of these mushrooms there might be on a space of many miles, when scientific men estimated <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> thousand in a square centimetre. This coloring probably ran back to a remote period, for the mushrooms were not decomposed by either evaporation or the melting of the snow, nor was their color altered. The phenomenon, although explained, was no less strange. Red is a rare color in nature; the reflection of the sun's rays on this crimson surface produced strange effects; it gave the surrounding objects, men and animals, a brilliant appearance, as if they were lighted by...", "...pouring out their urns upon us; for, as I think nothing so insipid as a flat ceiling, I think nothing so absurd as a storied one. Before I was aware, and without my participation, the painter had adorned that of my bedchamber with a golden shower, bursting from varied and irradiated clouds. On my expostulation, his excuse was that he knew the Danae of Scopas, in a recumbent posture, was to occupy the centre of the room. The walls, behind the tapestry and pictures, are quite rough. In <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> days the whole fabric was put together and habitable.

Latterly I have never sat long after dinner, and am curious to pass through the other apartments, if you will trust me. _Lucullus._ I attend you. _Caesar._ Lucullus, who is here? What figure is that on the poop of the vessel? Can it be---- _Lucullus._ The subject was dictated by...", "...but it is thought that this was due to the fact that her shoulders were thrown back during the plunge, as she had her arms in straps, and these undoubtedly saved her neck from breaking. She admitted having lost consciousness in passing over the Falls. While thanking God for sparing her life, she warned every one not to repeat her foolhardy trip. So severe was the shock that she wandered in her talk, with three doctors attending her; she, however, soon recovered. Mrs. Taylor was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> years old when she made this marvellous trip. She was born in Auburn, N. Y., and was a school teacher in Bay City, Mich., before she came East. She had crossed the American continent from ocean to ocean eight times, and during her stay East impressed everybody with her wonderful nerve. The barrel in which Mrs. Taylor made the journey was four and one-half feet high, and about three feet in diameter. A leather harness and cushions inside protected her body. Air was secured...", "...thirty-four of whom are Protestants: and the balance of thirteen Catholics. The thirty-four Protestants draw an average yearly salary of L653 13s., while the average yearly salary of the thirteen Catholic officials only amounts to L580. On the permanent staff created by competitive examination the story is very different. Here we find forty-three Catholics and twenty-five Protestants. Brains and ability could not be kept out. But what about their remuneration? The average salary of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-three</span> Catholics amounts to L207 13s. 6d., while that of the twenty-five Protestants is L304 8s. Can any sensible man believe that there is no favour here?\" [48] The result is that since 1906 Ulster has been half Nationalist in its Parliamentary representation. Taking the last three General Elections together, the Nationalists have nearly an average hold over half the seats in Ulster:--1906: Nationalist and Liberal, 17; Unionist, 16. 1910 (January): Nationalist and Liberal, 15;..."]
