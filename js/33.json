In 1887, one of the Arctic whalers, the steamer _Orca_, captured twenty-eight whales. The _Jeanette_ in 1905 got ten whales and a calf, the _Karluk_ got seven whales, the _Alexander_ eight, the _Bowhead_ seven. The boats wintering at Herschel in that year had among them thirty-three whales and one calf. At fifteen thousand dollars each (San Francisco values for that season) the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> whales netted very nearly half a million. Two years later the _Narwhal_ took out fifteen whales, the _Jeanette_ and _Bowhead_ each four. Although the average bone per head is two thousand pounds, sometimes the catch runs far beyond that figure. A whale caught by Capt. Simmons of the ship _John M.

On the edge of this is a tumulus, ninety-three yards in circumference, which is called the tomb of Hector; it is formed entirely of loose stones.

Rather more than one hundred and twenty paces from this tumulus is another tumulus; the base of this is one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> yards in circumference. Some little way from this is a third, ninety yards in circumference. The former is called the tomb of Priam; the latter the tomb of Paris. At a short distance farther on are beheld foundations of buildings; but these are not supposed to be of any high antiquity, nor even so high as to be classed with a Roman interdict. They are therefore, with probability, assigned to those pirates which at different times have infested the Hellespont.

Since Jacobs persisted in his candidacy for State Senator the Lynch faction brought out an opposing candidate in the person of a Baptist minister by the name of J.M.P. Williams. The contest between the two Republican candidates was interesting and exciting, though not bitter, and turned out to be very close. The convention was to be composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> delegates, seventeen being necessary to nominate. The result at the primary election of delegates to the convention was so close that it was impossible to tell which one had a majority, since there were several delegates,--about whose attitude and preference there had been some doubt,--who refused to commit themselves either way. In the organization of the convention the Williams men gained the first advantage, one of their number having been made permanent chairman. But...", "...of a circular or rather elliptical form.

The prevalence of light winds made it noon before we got on board, when I found that in consequence of the tides approaching the springs and falling 12 instead of 6 feet, it had been necessary to move the ship farther off.

It is well to remember, too, that the expenditures of the Government have decreased one-half in this period; viz., from $520,809,417, in 1866, to $258,469,797 in 1876.

Now, when the Passover eve, that is the fourteenth day of the first month, was at hand, it was found that the great majority of the people did not bring with them the prescribed sacrifices, either because they did not know of the custom or because they were too poor. Such a condition, however, did not dismay Josiah and his officers. He, himself, out of his own treasury, distributed the means for making the sacrifices to over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> thousand people. Hilkiah and the heads of the Temple service, out of their own means, did the same for the Priests and the Levites.

The statement has, however, been contested on good authority; and it seems proved (see Delambre, _Astronomie Moderne_, tom. i. p.81) that the Persian intercalation combines the two periods 7/29 and 8/33. If they follow the combination (7 + 3 x 8) / (29 + 3 x 33) = 31/128 their determination of the length of the tropical year has been extremely exact. The discovery of the period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years is ascribed to Omar Khayyam, one of the eight astronomers appointed by Jel[=a]l ud-Din Malik Shah, sultan of Khorasan, to reform or construct a calendar, about the year 1079 of our era.

A majority of ten votes in New York carries the entire thirty-seven votes of that State, while a majority of one thousand in Montana only counts three. There are forty-six States in the Republic, but the thirteen most populous possess more than half the votes, and a presidential candidate who received the votes of those thirteen, though each was won by only the narrowest majority, would be elected over an antagonist who carried the other thirty-three States, though in each of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> his majority might be overwhelming. Bearing this in mind, we see at once what immense importance may, in a doubtful election, attach to the control of a single populous State. If in an English election, similarly conducted, the country was known to be so equally divided that the vote of Warwickshire, with, perhaps, twenty votes, would certainly decide the issue, the man who could control Warwickshire would practically control the country.

Monsieur le president was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years old, and possessed the estate of Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worth seven thousand francs a year; he expected to inherit the property of his uncle the notary and that of another uncle, the Abbe Cruchot, a dignitary of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours, both of whom were thought to be very rich.

Her complexion was dark, pale and a little too thick, but it was relieved by the jet black of her regular eye-brows and of her masses of wavy hair.

In the earliest days of Greece, the precious metals existed in great abundance in the Levant. Cabul and Little Thibet (B.C. 500) were abundant in gold.

Darius, son of Hystaspes (B.C. 538), coined _darics_, containing one hundred and twenty-one grains of pure metal, which were preferred, for several ages throughout the East, for their fineness.

He was clean shaven, handsome beyond most men, and while his features were of a classical regularity and of an almost feminine delicacy, they were still not without character. There was determination in his face, and his eyes were naturally watchful. It was his manner which prompted Pamela's instinct of dislike.

In his Psalms he lives through all the generations of men. He reigned <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years at Jerusalem, and seven at Hebron, and transmitted his throne to Solomon--his youngest child, a youth ten years of age, precocious in wisdom and culture.

While the Venetians and the Tuscans are content with claiming seven distinctive beauties for the object of their affection, the Sicilian boldly asserts that his _bedda_ possesses no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> _biddizzi_. In the same manner, when he is about sending his salutations, he sends them without stint: Many the stars that sparkle in the sky, Many the grains of sand and pebbles small; And in the ocean's plains the finny fry And leaves that flourish in the woods and fall, Countless earth's human hordes that live and die, The flowers that wake to life at April's call, And all the fruits the summer heats supply-- My greetings sent to thee...", "...\"Do you believe I care anything about that?

Edward saw at once the larger opportunities possible in a house of the importance of the Scribners, and he immediately placed himself in communication with Mr. Charles Scribner, with the result that in January, 1884, he entered the employ of these publishers as stenographer to the two members of the firm and to Mr. Edward L. Burlingame, literary adviser to the house. He was to receive a salary of eighteen dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> cents per week, which was then considered a fair wage for stenographic work.

No mortar was used, and yet in some places the joints are so nicely fitted and the stone so accurately cut that a knife blade can not be inserted after a lapse of nearly twenty centuries.

The guide first shows a number of blocks about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet long, fourteen feet high and ten feet thick. After one's wonder has had sufficient time to express itself, three blocks are pointed out which measure sixty-four feet in length, fourteen feet in height and twelve feet in thickness.

They had led him for a lifetime over land and sea. And now they came to him darkly and mysteriously like a message of despair. The King had arisen, but he had been denied and cast out. He was about to perish. Perhaps he was already dying. Could it be the same who had been born in Bethlehem, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years ago, at whose birth the star had appeared in heaven, and of whose coming the prophets had spoken? Artaban's heart beat unsteadily with that troubled, doubtful apprehension which is the excitement of old age.

Without stopping to inquire as to what the munition works would then do, we can still see that it is doubtful whether the farm can act as magnet.

A man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> gave me the point of view. \"My brother is 'over there,' and I feel as if I were backing him up by making guns.\" The only thing that can change the idea that farming is \"mulling around,\" and making a gun \"backs up\" the man at the front more thoroughly than raising turnips, is to bring to the farm new workers who realize the vital part played by food in the winning of the war.

Besides, it looked so much handsomer; glittering and glistening like bracelets and breast-pins.

Its growth, nevertheless, was slow; ten years after the foundation the Congregation only numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> members; but Vincent had no desire that it should be otherwise.

In spite of plague, treachery and famine, the little garrison held out valiantly in Jesus Fort, to which they had been forced to retire, until December 12, 1698, when the Arabs made a last determined attack and captured the citadel, putting the remnant of the defenders, both men and women, to the sword.

His tongue was never silent, and he was always relating his stories of Don Pedro Giron and of the earl of Urena. He was more bold in word than in deed; we therefore called him the Agramant of many words and few works. Alonso de Avila was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years of age when we arrived in New Spain. He was of good stature, had a cheerful countenance, was remarkably courageous, and eloquent and persuasive in argument. He was very open-hearted towards his comrades, but rather imperious, jealous, and turbulent, for which reason Cortes despatched him with Quinones to Spain to present part of the treasure of Motecusuma and Quauhtemoctzin to his majesty, but he was captured by a French corsair, and imprisoned in France.

On several other returns of the November epoch the number of meteors observed has been greater than on ordinary nights; the distinctly marked exhibitions, however, up to 1866, have all been enumerated. THE SHOWER OF NOVEMBER 14, 1866. The fact that all great displays of the November meteors have taken place at intervals of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> or thirty-four years, or some multiple of that period, had led to a general expectation of a brilliant shower in 1866. In this country, however, the public curiosity was much disappointed. The numbers seen were greater than on ordinary nights, but not such as would have attracted any special attention. The greatest number recorded at any one station was seen at New Haven, by Prof. Newton. On the night of the 12th, 694 were counted in five hours and twenty minutes, and on...", "...and cowardice.' When the Earl of Strafford came into trouble, Suckling, along with some other cavaliers, intrigued for his deliverance, was impeached by the House of Commons, and had to flee to France. Here an early death awaited him. His servant having robbed him, he drew on, in vehement haste, his boots, to pursue the defaulter, when a rusty nail, or, some say, the blade of a knife, which was concealed in one of them, pierced his heel. A mortification ensued, and he died, in 1641, at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years of age. Suckling has written five plays, various poems, besides letters, speeches, and tracts, which have all been collected into one thin volume. They are of various merit; none, in fact, being worthy of print, or at least of preservation, except one or two of his songs, and his 'Ballad upon a Wedding'. This last is an admirable expression of what were his principal qualities--_naivete_, sly humour, gay badinage, and a delicious vein of fancy, coming out...", "...his part, the inspiration of ambition, but rather of great good sense.

To have surrendered those Italians, who had rallied around the armies of France in their hour of need, again to Austrian domination, would have been an act of treachery.

The change of rulers did not affect their material interests, since Theodoric merely appropriated that proportion of the cultivated land (one-third) which Odoacer had claimed for his followers.

Theodoric reigned over Italy for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years (493-526). A tolerant and enlightened ruler, he spared no effort to give his rule a legal character, and to protect the Italians against oppression.

His meeting in Petersburg with Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, who had just returned from abroad, almost sent him out of his mind. At the present moment, standing at the barrier, he was terribly uneasy.

The plea that Van Buren had secretly assembled the Bucktails in force neither justifies nor palliates it; for the slightest management on Clinton's part would have controlled the caucus by bringing together fifty members instead of thirty-three, and the slightest inquiry would have discovered the weakness of having only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> present instead of fifty. Clinton professed to believe that the Federalists no longer existed as a party; and it is probably true that he desired to create a party of his own out of its membership, strengthened by the Clintonians, and to leave Tammany and its Bucktail supporters to build up an opposition organisation. But in this he was in advance of his time.

Ansten Nattestad's party of one hundred then sailed from Drammen by the _Emelia_, Captain Ankerson, late in the spring of 1839.

They took the usual route inland and arrived in Milwaukee just at the time when the Luraas party had returned to Milwaukee to purchase land already selected in Waukesha County, as we have seen above. They urged the new arrivals to stop in Milwaukee and go with them to Muskego, but Nattestad objected, and so they continued their journey to Chicago.

It met in October, 1910, with eleven Republican and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> Democratic members. Through the demands of organized labor backed by a heavy labor vote a very progressive constitution was written. Miss Gregg and Mrs. Munds struggled with the delegates during its entire session to have a full, partial or conditional woman suffrage clause incorporated but to no avail.

Yet Blake could be very amusing; but he rather laughed at people than with them, and when there were more than two in company, he would usually be found making a butt of one. Nevertheless, his society was greatly sought...", "...in number, there are thousands in which ever so many divine beings are praised and prayed to.

As the earth consumes such myriads of Leonids each <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years, it follows that the total number must be decreasing. The splendour of the showers in future ages will, no doubt, be affected by this circumstance. They cannot be always so bright as they have been.

This gives, for the prehistoric period proper, a term of about two hundred and twenty-two thousand years. Add to this perhaps twelve thousand years ushering in the civilization of Egypt, and the six thousand years of stable, sure chronology of the historical period, and we have something like two hundred and thirty thousand or two hundred and forty thousand years as the age of man. \"These figures,\" says Mortillet, \"are certainly not exaggerated.

One of the methods and mysteries was explained; the floating objects were large rubber and guttapercha bags, water-tight and unsinkable, and in these waterproof sacks was packed the contraband merchandise. Four boats were at work, and within a couple of hours no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> of these sacks were put on board the \"Nancy,\" containing thousands and thousands of dollars worth of goods that were never intended to pay duty to good old Uncle Sam. All the bags were put on board, and the \"Nancy\" was ready to run into the bay and land her contraband cargo. The detective expected she would run back on the course over which she had come out, but such was not the fact; on the contrary she lay to until all the goods were stowed below.

The National Guard seems to be armed merely for the protection of robbery and disorder.\"--For more than thirty years, M. de Chaponay, the father of six children of whom three are in the service, expended his vast income on his estate of Beaulieu, giving occupation to a number of persons, men, women, and children. After the hailstorm of 1761, which nearly destroyed the village of Moranee, he rebuilt <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> houses, furnished others with timber for the framework, supplied the commune with wheat, and, for several years, obtained for the inhabitants a diminution of their taxation. In 1790, he celebrated the Federation Festival on a magnificent scale, giving two banquets, one of a hundred and thirty seats, for the municipal bodies and officers of the National Guards in the vicinity, and the other of a thousand seats for the privates.

The conditions in France fortunately were very much better than those in this country, and for the first year or two French factories helped us out with both machines and engines.

There were no less than seventy-six great factories turning out vast numbers of complete aeroplanes, in addition to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> manufacturing complete engines and over 3,000 turning out spares and equipment. Such expansion is not possible within a few weeks, it took a long time to arrive at this position, and it causes one very seriously to think what would have happened had France not been our ally, and points the moral which has been mentioned of the necessity for a thriving aircraft and engine industry in peace.

Its abode now was the hearts of the people of the West and South; and its strongest exponent was a young Kentuckian, Henry Clay, whose feelings and words were those of the heroic seventies. Although but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years old, he had been appointed for the second time to fill an unexpired term in the National Senate. On February 22, 1810, he addressed that body on the country's wrongs and duty: \"Have we not been for years contending against the tyranny of the ocean?\" We have tried \"_peaceful_ resistance....

On coming back to Athens, Solon was very sorry to learn that it was Pisistratus, his own kinsman, who had taken the power of the archons; but when he saw how wisely Pisistratus governed the people, and how careful he was to make them happy and improve them, he freely forgave him, and remained on good terms with him until he died. Pisistratus went on ruling the Athenians for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years, and when he died they mourned him greatly. In their grief for their loss, they allowed his sons, Hip'-pi-as and Hip-par'chus, to succeed him, without raising any objections.

This method of developing water power is distinctly an American idea, and the only instance where it has been attempted abroad, that I know of, is at Bellegarde in France, where there is a fall in the Rhone of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet. Within the last few years works have been constructed for its development, furnishing a large amount of power, but from the great outlay incurred in acquiring the titles to the property, and other difficulties, it has not been a financial success.

In perfecting these minutiae, the Baldwin Locomotive Works has borne its part, and it only remains to state briefly its contributions in this direction.

The greater number of these were of the ordinary type, four drivers coupled, and a four-wheeled truck, and varying in weight from fifteen ton engines, with cylinders twelve by twenty-two, to twenty-seven ton engines, with cylinders sixteen by twenty-four. A few ten-wheeled engines were built, as has been previously noted, and the remainder were the Baldwin flexible-truck six- and eight-wheels-connected engines.

These are your brethren; and they have shed as much glory upon that flag as any equal number of men in the Union. They are the men, and that is the locality, where the first Union flag was unfurled, and where was fought a gallant battle before our independence was declared--not the flag with thirteen stripes and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> stars, but a flag with a cross of St. George, and the long stripes running through it. When the gallant Moultrie took the British Fort Johnson and carried it, for the first time, I believe, did the Union flag fly in the air; and that was in October, 1775. When he took the position and threw up a temporary battery with palmetto-logs and sand, upon the site called Fort Moultrie, that fort was assailed by the British fleet, and bombarded until the old logs, clinging with...", "...on Monday there would be very little ready money left, and he must settle or his reputation, such as it was, would be gone.

Meanwhile, the sale and allotment of plantations and town lots steadily continued, until on April 9, six months from the day the surveyors began their operations, about twelve thousand or fifteen thousand acres of land had been allotted, besides nine hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> city lots. Many of the lots had been cleared, and parts of some of the plantations. Quite an amount of planting, in the aggregate, had been done. The survey corps and the colonists agreed that the semi-anniversary of the coming of the surveyors to La Gloria should be marked by a celebration, and the bold project of a grand ball was set on foot. When I first heard of it, I thought it was a joke, but when I saw a long list of committees conspicuously posted on Central...", "...while in the captured town, continued their march.

Nevertheless, however it was commanded, the thirty-three were destined to gain yet further support from the force detached against them.

At a meeting contrived between him and Lavalleja the pair embraced, and Rivera forsook the Brazilian service on the spot to join the cause of his country.

No member of Congress, however, can be appointed an elector. Thus New York, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> representatives in the Lower House, would name thirty-five electors; and Rhode Island, with two members in the Lower House, would name four electors;--in each case two being added for the two senators.

It was a dramatic coincidence and no mere fortuitous one in the minds of thoughtful Englishmen who had seen in the Civil War a struggle as fateful in British domestic policy as in that of America herself.

The Gospel of Luke is addressed to Theophilus. Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, who is believed to be the person addressed, flourished in the latter half of the second century. Dr. Schleiermacher, one of Germany's greatest theologians, after a critical analysis of Luke, concludes that it is merely a compilation, made up of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> preexisting manuscripts. Bishop Thirlwall's Schleiermacher says: \"He [Luke] is from beginning to end no more than the compiler and arranger of documents which he found in existence\" (p. 313). The basis of this Gospel is generally believed to be the Gospel of Marcion, a Pauline compilation, made about the middle of the second century. Concerning this Gospel, the Rev. S.

From Cannae to Rome was twelve days' march with an army encumbered with booty. He could not, therefore, hope for a surprise. The walls of Rome were exceedingly strong, and he had with him none of the great machines which would have been necessary for a siege. He must have carried with him the supplies he had accumulated for the subsistence of his force, and when these were consumed he...", "...by the thermometer, and that the air which they breathed was capable of producing all the well-known effects of such a heat on inanimate matter, they placed some eggs and a beef-steak upon a tin frame near the thermometer, but more distant from the furnace than from the wall of the room.

Another beef-steak, similarly placed, was rather overdone in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> minutes. In the evening, when the heat was still more elevated, a third beef-steak was laid in the same place, and as they had noticed that the effect of the hot air was greatly increased by putting it in motion, they blew upon the steak with a pair of bellows, and thus hastened the dressing of it to such a degree, that the greatest portion of it was found to be pretty well done in thirteen minutes.

Chantrey, has very recently...", "...magnificent spectacle that was seen by them:-- 'The mist was then clearing (it was in July) and in a few moments was entirely gone. So marvellous a transformation scene, and so immense a prospect, I have never beheld since.

The vision faded all too quickly, but it was worth walking <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> or thirty-four miles, as I did that day, for even a briefer view than that.'

In justice to the Germans it must be said they were heroic in courage and reckless of their lives, and the valley of the Meuse was choked with their corpses. The river itself was strewn with the dead bodies of men and horses and literally ran red with blood. The most tremendous fighting took place for the possession of the bridges, but the French engineers blew them up one after another as they retired southward. No less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> bridges were destroyed in this way before they could be seized by the German advance guard. The fighting was extended for a considerable distance on either side of the Meuse and many engagements took place between French and German cavalry and regiments working away from the main armies. There was, for instance, a memorable encounter at Marville which is one of the most heroic episodes of the war. Five thousand French soldiers of all arms, with quick-firers, engaged...", "...departure, as she had been in her serene and honored career.

Can a man earn that much? To do so he must earn _thirty_ thousand dollars a year for thirty-three and one-third years. Is it possible for one to render so large a service? I believe it is. Well, what shall we say of ten...", "...of channel catfish in the Neosho was approximately the same at all stations, and the large 1957 year-class grew to an average size of about nine inches by mid-September, 1959 (Table 7). Channel catfish mature at a total length of 12 to 15 inches. Thus, most individuals of the 1957 year-class in the Neosho River probably will mature in their fourth or fifth summer (1960 or 1961 spawning season). The sizes attained by young-of-the-year in 1957 differed in the two rivers. Six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> young taken in the Marais des Cygnes River attained an average size of 4.7 inches (range two to six inches) by mid-September.

The same note rings in four more of the Choral Cantatas,(466) which may be attributed tentatively to Weiss, though their ascription to Bach would be equally congruous. Returning, however, to the seventy-two libretti of the later Leipzig period we reach this result: More than half of them (thirty-nine) are congregational hymns, all but two of which are of the paraphrased type in which we detect the work of Picander, Bach himself, and perhaps the younger Weiss. Of the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> original libretti Marianne von Ziegler heads the list with nine, and perhaps ten.(467) Bach follows with a problematical six,(468) Picander with five,(469) the elder Weiss with four,(470) Neumeister with one.(471) One text is taken from the Bible.(472) Another consists of a single stanza of a hymn by Martin Behm.(473) Five are by authors unknown or undetected.(474) But, as was said at the outset, the attribution of particular libretti to individual writers is...", "...and consequently make a revolution of the seasons every thirty-three years, for 365 / 11 = 33 nearly.

The story of the career of Willard Glazier will not be complete without some description of his novel and adventurous feat of riding on horseback across the continent of North America--literally from ocean to ocean, or from Boston to San Francisco.

It was a long and trying journey, extending over a period of two hundred days, and a distance of four thousand one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> miles, but at the same time a journey of great interest. His object was to study, at comparative leisure, the line of country through which he would pass, and to note the habits and condition of the people he came in contact with.

As ships-of-the-line carried more than seventy guns, frigates about forty-four to fifty, sloops twenty, brigs ten and other vessels in proportion, this fleet had 1155 cannon.

Meanwhile the army was shivering in its log huts at Valley Forge. Nearly three thousand were barefoot. Many had to sit by the fires all night to keep from freezing. One day there was a dinner of officers to which none were admitted who had whole trousers. For days together there was no bread in camp. The death-rate increased <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> per cent from week to week. Just now, however, amid this terrible Winter at Valley Forge, Baron Steuben, a trained German soldier, who had been a pupil of Frederick the Great, joined our army.

When God sent a snow, there was a lion who slipped and fell into a certain pit, and because the pit's mouth was narrow it was evident he would perish, being enclosed with the snow; so when he saw no way to get out and save himself, he roared.

Root's plan also provided for the transfer of the equitable powers of the Court of Chancery to the courts of common law. This was the extreme view. Although the convention, or at least a majority of it, might wish to get rid of the old Supreme Court judges, it was plainly unwilling to let go the Court of Chancery. So it rejected the Root substitute by a vote of seventy-three to thirty-six, and the report of the judiciary committee by seventy-nine ayes to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> noes. But the attack thus daringly begun by Root, was steadily maintained. Martin Van Buren, who figured as a sort of peacemaker, proposed the retention of the Chancery and Supreme Courts, and the creation of circuit judges. This proposition went to a special committee, which presented two reports--one for the preservation of the Court of Chancery and the Supreme Court, the other for the creation of a Court of Chancery, a Supreme Court, and courts of common pleas.

Mr. Williams was building a distillery at the time, and, as he had confidently reckoned upon using the two stills in his possession, was considerably nonplussed when Longworth presented his order for them. In his extremity he offered to purchase them from the lawyer for a lot of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> acres of barren land in the town, which was then worth little or nothing. Longworth hesitated, for although he had an almost prophetic belief in the future value of the land, he was sorely in need of ready money; but at length he accepted the offer. The deed for the land was made out in his name, and the stills became the property of Mr. Williams. The distillery was built, and its owner realized a fortune; but Longworth did more.

Taking advantage, however, of the absence of De la Tour, who had a habit of roving about, he one day besieged St. John. Madame de la Tour headed the little handful of men in the fort, and made such a gallant resistance that De Charnise was obliged to draw off his fleet with the loss of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> men,--a very serious loss, when the supply of men was as distant as France. But De Charnise would not be balked by a woman; he attacked again; and this time, one of the garrison, a Swiss, betrayed the fort, and let the invaders into the walls by an unguarded entrance. It was Easter morning when this misfortune occurred, but the peaceful influence of the day did not avail.

In the south, the designation of Florida as a Spanish discovery, with its southerly coast running along the parallel of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> and a half of north latitude, eight degrees north of its actual position, is precisely the same it as it is shown on the anonymous Portuguese chart just mentioned. These representations of the country, in the north and the south, were thus adopted as the basis of this map.

Leafing over the pages he announced: \"Busted to smithereens, and she cost me exactly eleven thousand five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> dollars and nineteen cents!

Through the minds of both there ran pleasant thoughts of the contrast between the days before the war and the days now prevailing. Both of them could remember a wage of fifteen and sixteen shillings a week. Then just before the war, it had risen to eighteen shillings and a pound. And now--why the Wages Board for Brookshire had fixed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> shillings as a weekly minimum, and a nine-hours' day! Prices were high, but they would go down some day; and wages would not go down. The old men could not have told exactly why this confidence lay so deep in them; but there it was, and it seemed to give a strange new stability and even dignity to life. Their sons were fighting; and they had the normal human affection for their sons. They wished the war to end.

Peel had been forced into this position by the King: his own judgement would have led him to wait some years. He fought dexterously for four months, helped in some measure by Stanley, who had left the Whigs when they threatened the Established Church in Ireland; but it was this question which in the end upset him. Lord John Russell, in alliance with O'Connell, proposed the disendowment of that Church and defeated Peel by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> votes. It was a question of principle, though it was raised in a factious way, and subsequent history showed that the mover, after his tactical victory of the moment, could not effect any practical solution.

In 1669, Charles II. granted letters patent to Edward Andrew, Esq., empowering him to build a pier, erect lighthouses, and cleanse the harbour at Sunderland, and also to raise funds for these purposes by a tonnage-duty on ships. At a subsequent period, commissioners were appointed for the same purposes by an act of parliament; and under their authority three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> yards of the north pier were built, between 1716 and 1746. From a report of the commissioners made in 1765, it appears that L50,000 had been expended on the south pier up to that time, and it was estimated that to finish it would cost as much more. It is now extended to the length of six hundred and twenty-five yards. The north pier, which is entirely of stone, was commenced about 1785, but additions have been recently made to its eastern extremity. The lighthouse on the...", "...of the Governor's House, with doorways opening on the interior court. The only exterior doorways are on the front of the southern building and on the ends of the northern; these, however, only afford access to the outer range of rooms, which do not communicate with the interior. In only one instance do more than two rooms communicate with each other, and that is in the centre of the eastern building, where are two communicating apartments, the largest in the Nunnery, each thirteen by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet, with an ante-room at each end measuring nine by thirteen feet.

The four heavy retaining timbers forming the walls and supporting the platform were thirty-one feet at the front and back and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet along the sides, two feet wide, and five inches in thickness, and were fitted together at the ends as previously described, and shown in the house plan.

La Porte was one of the ministers of the Cevennes, who had fled before a sentence of death pronounced against him for having been concerned in \"The Project.\" At Berlin they were received very cordially by the Elector of Brandenburg, who had already given great assistance to the Huguenot emigrants, and expressed himself as willing to do all that he could for their protection.

It was a sort of _tour de force_ that took the scientific world by surprise and gained its author the widest recognition. The services of Lewis Morris Rutherford to astronomy resembled in many ways those of Draper. Starting in life as a lawyer, he abandoned that profession at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> to devote his whole time to science, principally to the perfection of astronomical photography and spectrum analysis. The service which photography has rendered to astronomy can scarcely be overestimated, and these pioneers in the art were laying the foundations for its recent wonderful developments. He was the first to attempt to classify the stars according to their spectra, and invented a number of instruments of the greatest service in star photography.

He offered to desist from the prosecution, if Seymour would promise him a cordial reconciliation, and, renouncing all ambitious hopes, be contented with a private life, and retire into the country. But as Seymour made no other answer to these friendly offers than menaces and defiances, he ordered a charge to be drawn up against him, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> articles;[*] and the whole to be laid before the privy council.

The casualties in this last affair were, of course, by no means all on the British side; we had suffered pretty severely in the three affairs in which we had been involved since the departure of the boat expedition from the ship, our total amounting to eleven killed and twenty-six wounded; but the losses on the part of the enemy had been very considerably greater, their dead, in this last fight alone, numbering nineteen killed, while <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> wounded had been hurriedly bestowed in one of the houses, to be attended to by the surgeons as soon as our own people had been patched up; thus Hutchinson and Murdoch were kept busy the whole of that night, while Copplestone, Keene, and Parkinson-- the three uninjured midshipmen--were impressed as ward-attendants to keep watch over our own wounded, and administer medicine, drink, and nourishment from time to time.

The total exports from Great Britain in the last year amounted to but \u00a32,221,000, ($11,500,000,) much of which was simply _en route_ for Persia; and this constitutes the great trade that has been built up at so much cost to the people of Turkey, and that is to be maintained as \"a golden privilege\" not to be abandoned!

A repetition of the _Deutschland's_ exploits was looked for from her sister undersea craft, the _Bremen_, about whose movements the widest speculation was centered. She was reported to have left Germany for the United States on September 1, 1916, but did not appear, nor was any trace of her seen en route. She never arrived, and became a mystery of the sea. A story circulated that she had been captured by a British patrol boat in the Straits of Dover and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> of her crew of thirty-five made prisoners, the remaining two having been killed when the boat was caught in a steel net. The British admiralty preserved its customary silence as to the truth of this report. Her German owners finally acknowledged their belief that she had been lost probably through an accident to her machinery.

There is, however, much moisture in the air that floats over the plains, but the reason that no rain falls is because there are no mountains in that portion of the globe for thousands of miles. Now suppose that there were to be no rain at all, and people should undertake to water the earth by bringing the water from the rivers. On an average of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> inches of rain fall upon the surface of the entire earth each year, in some places more, in others less. The weight of this water in one single square mile would be nearly two and one-half millions of tons, and if this water which falls upon one single square mile had to be drawn in cars, it would require 100,000 carloads of water to keep this one single mile as wet as God usually keeps it throughout the year by the rain from heaven.

Theodoric had now no rival in Italy. THEODORIC KING OF ITALY, 493-526 A.D. Though Theodoric gained the throne by violence and treachery, he soon showed himself to be, as a ruler, wise, broad-minded, and humane. He had lived as a youth in the imperial court at Constantinople and there had become well acquainted with Roman ideas of law and order. Roman civilization impressed him; and he wished not to destroy but to preserve it. Theodoric reigned in Italy for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years, and during this time the country enjoyed unbroken peace and prosperity.

Gemistos, who enjoyed the confidence of the Imperial House, was made a judge at Mistra, and thus obtained clear insight into the causes of the decadence of the Hellenic race upon its ancient soil. The picture he draws of the anarchy and immorality of the peninsula is frightful. He also professed philosophy, and at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> became a teacher of repute. The views he formed concerning the corruption of the Greek Church and the degradation of the Greek people, combined with his philosophical opinions, inspired him with the visionary ambition of reforming the creed, the ethics, and the political conditions of Hellas on a Pagan basis. There is something ludicrous as well as sad in the spectacle of this sophist, nourishing the vain fancy that he might coin a complete religious system, which should...", "...ship's head was turned for Cork, and, under all sail, the Agamemnon at last stood homeward. The voyage home was made with ease and swiftness considering the lightness of the wind, the trim of the ship, and that she only steamed three days, and at midday on Tuesday, July 12th, the Agamemnon cast anchor in Queenstown harbor, having met with more dangerous weather, and encountered more mishaps than often falls to the lot of any ship in a cruise of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> days.

So Gratian's messengers found Theodosius managing his estates in Spain.

Theodosius was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years of age when he ascended the throne of the eastern division of the Roman Empire. In grace and manly beauty, in his qualities of heart and intellect, contemporaries held him to outshine Trajan.

Even at this early age he had gained renown for valour in the field, where his experiences had been many...", "...was not limited to one year alone, but was repeated at each meeting for about three years running. The further assumption was, therefore, made that the swarm was much denser in one portion of the orbit than elsewhere,[27] and that this congested part was drawn out to such an extent that the earth could pass through the crossing place during several annual meetings, and still find it going by like a long procession (see Fig. 20, p. 269). In accordance with this ascertained period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years, the recurrence of the great Leonid shower was timed to take place on the 15th of November 1899. But there was disappointment then, and the displays which occurred during the few years following were not of much importance. A good deal of comment was made at the time, and theories were accordingly put forward to account for the failure of the great shower. The most probable explanation seems to be, that the attraction of one of the larger planets--Jupiter...", "...four pieces of cannon of large calibre, which thundered at the siege of Philipsburg, and were subsequently presented to the Marshal by Monseigneur, the brother of Louis XIV.

Twelve firms conceded these terms at once, leaving 600 men still on strike against <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> firms. As a result many women-workers were asked to do men's work, and it seemed not unlikely that the men might be thus defeated.

The conditions, however, were so onerous, both to landlord and tenant, that only 7,665 tenants out of more than half a million were able to avail themselves of these purchase clauses. 2. The Ashbourne Act of 1885 was the first successful measure of the kind. Five millions were advanced under it, and five millions more under an extending Act of 1887. Next came the Act of 1891, empowering the loan of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> millions, followed by the amending and simplifying Act of 1896. These Acts form a body of legislation by themselves, of which I need refer only to a few salient characteristics.

The remarkable disparity in this regard with the Poles and the Italian was again shown here. For every hundred Poles entering in 1907, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> emigrated in 1908. For every hundred South Italians entering in 1907, sixty emigrated in 1908.

Official reports show that on both sides the casualties--killed, wounded, and missing--embraced the enormous proportion of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> per cent. of the troops actually engaged. On the Union side there were over a score of regiments in which the losses in this single fight exceeded 49.4 per cent., which was the heaviest loss sustained by a German regiment at any time during the Franco-German war.

The era of commercial fruit-growing began in the year 1869 in which the first fresh fruits were sent east by rail, the shipment amounting to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> tons, mostly pears and apples. This event marks the beginning of a great industry in growing pears on the Pacific slope for the fresh fruit market, and was followed shortly by the introduction of canning and evaporation to use up the surplus product.

In this last charge I received a rude blow from a stout fellow on foot with the butt end of his musket which perfectly...", "...Carson and induced him to enter the government service as the official guide of the expedition. He afterward wrote: On the boat I met Kit Carson. He was returning from putting his little daughter in a convent school in St. Louis. I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting. He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered and deep-chested, with a clear, steady blue eye and frank speech and manner--quiet and unassuming. Carson, then a little less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years of age, was already a national character. The association which began at that time lasted to the end of the Mexican War. Washington, a city which saw many strange spectacles, had a novel sight on the June day of 1847 when Kit Carson entered it with letters from Fremont.

Among the sales was one to Alexander Macomb, for three millions six hundred and thirty-five thousand two hundred acres. The magnitude of this sale, and the price at which it was sold, created a great excitement throughout the state, and at the session of the legislature which commenced on the 4th of January, 1792, the subject was brought before the assembly. The price at...", "...reaching the river front of the island, we took our bearings from the map and walked slowly toward the water's edge, being careful not to walk too far as the water's edge is so much closer in now than it used to be. Going to the uppermost of the several jetties, we sighted along it straight out over the water and kept on looking, in accordance with the measurements on the map, until we had looked one hundred and thirty-five yards; then, turned our eyes sharply to the right and looked <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> and one third yards more. We then had the satisfaction of feeling that the spot our eyes rested upon was, in 1607, on the shore of the island, and was the place where the original settlers first landed. Nor was our satisfaction at all dampened by the discovery that the spot was two spots--Nautica gazing spellbound at one place, and the Commodore at another. After all, it made very little difference, for the settlers did not stay where they landed anyway. They seem to...", "...the year one thousand six hundred and sixty seven.

On May 16, 1907, he modified the order so as to permit valid locations made prior to the withdrawal on November 12, 1906, to proceed to entry and patent. Prior to that date some 900 claims had been filed, most of them said to be illegal because either made fraudulently by dummy entrymen in the interest of one individual or corporation, or because of agreements made prior to location between the applicants to cooperate in developing the lands. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> claims for 160 acres each, known as the \"Cunningham claims,\" which are said to be valid on the ground that they were made by an attorney for thirty-three different and bona fide claimants who, as alleged, paid their money and took proper steps to locate their entries and protect them.

Then-- \"Oh, go to hell!\" he said thickly. Anthony picked up the note and placed it beside his lordship. Then he left the room and returned to his work. Lord Pomfret was exceedingly wrath. In fact, he brooded over the incident. This augured ill for Anthony. The cold fact that in due season--to be precise, at eleven minutes to four that same afternoon--Slip Along won his race easily did not improve matters. That he started at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> to one was still less digestible.... When his lordship read the news at half-past five, he broke into a cold sweat. Then he bit savagely at the nail of his favourite thumb. Considering that, so recently as that morning, he had reluctantly decided that that toothsome _entremet_ must be allowed to go unmolested for at least a week, his action was indicative of an emotion which knew no rules. That he made no mention of the matter to Anthony, was the ugliest omen of...", "...accumulation of descriptions, separately beautiful, but uniform and tedious. Though images derived from light and music are the most pleasing, and can be borne longer in poetry than any others, their sweetness palls upon the sense by frequent repetition, and we require the intermixture of sharper flavours. Yet there are detached passages of great excellence in this third part of Dante's poem; and even in the long theological discussions which occupy the greater proportion of its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> cantos, it is impossible not to admire the enunciation of abstract positions with remarkable energy, conciseness, and sometimes perspicuity. The first twelve cantos of the Purgatory are an almost continual flow of soft and brilliant poetry. The last seven are also very splendid; but there is some heaviness in the intermediate parts. Fame has justly given the preference to the Inferno, which displays throughout a more vigorous and masterly conception; but the mind of Dante...", "...disaster through a body of troops being surprised. Reconnoitring parties, too, would deem it prudent to pay greater deference to an enemy's lonely sentry on advanced outpost duty if the latter were provided with this new Machine Gun, instead of the ordinary rifle. Immediately below the barrel of the gun, a box is placed, containing the belt which carries the cartridges. The belts vary in length. Those commonly used are seven feet long, and capable of holding three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> cartridges; shorter ones hold one hundred and twenty cartridges; but the several pieces can be joined together for continuous firing. Single shots can be fired at any time whether the belt is in position or not--in the former case by pressing a button, which prevents the recoil; in the latter, by hand-loading in the ordinary way. To start firing, one end of the belt is inserted in the gun, the trigger is pulled by the hand once, after which the movement becomes continuous...", "...year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,--Jesus began to be about thirty years of age:\" for, supposing Jesus to have been born as Saint Matthew and Saint Luke also himself relate, in the time of Herod, he must, according to the dates given in Josephus and by the Roman historians, have been at least thirty-one years of age in the fifteenth year of Tiberius. If he was born, as Saint Matthew's narrative intimates, one or two years before Herod's death, he would have been thirty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years old at that time. This is the difficulty: the solution turns upon an alteration in the construction of the Greek. Saint Luke's words in the original are allowed, by the general opinion of learned men, to signify, not \"that Jesus began to be about thirty years of age,\" but \"that he was about thirty years of age when he began his ministry.\" This construction being admitted, the adverb \"about\" gives us all the latitude we want, and more especially when applied, as it...", "...to the British commander, where he received humane treatment until 1779. Then a Mrs. Harvey, the wife of an Indian trader, while a crowd of Indians were drunk, took three of their guns and hid them in a patch of peas in her garden.

The three fugitives after <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> days of incredible suffering reached Louisville. Later, with General George Rogers Clark in command, Kenton, the great scout and spy, piloted the Kentuckians, when in 1780 they carried the war into the Indian's own country. During all these dangers there had ever been the horrible feeling that he was a fugitive and a murderer; but meeting by chance some one from his boyhood home, Simon Kenton learned that his former rival, William Veach, was still alive.

He wanted that backed up by a book not in the handwriting of S. W. Dorsey. That will not do. Rerdell also tells you that at the time he went to the Attorney-General he not only had that tabular statement, but he had a...", "...about the oil business. \"Well, then,\" said he, \"I will understand it.\" So he set himself at the study of the whole subject. He began at the second day of the creation, he studied the subject from the primitive vegetation to the coal oil stage, until he knew all about it.

By sword and good right arm, the Visigothic kings generally won their thrones, but the time came when they were dominated by the Church. To show how this came about, we must look back to the time when, a menace to Rome and a terror to all southern Europe, the barbarous Goths descended from their northern fastnesses. They were pagans then, enemies of the true faith, until between the years 340 and 380...", "...Milly never to go on the ocean,\" she declared rebelliously.

It may be inferred from this that the Norwegian walrus-hunters kill yearly on an average at least a hundred bears. It is remarkable that in this large number a pregnant female or one with newly-born young is never found.[68] The female bear appears to keep herself well concealed during the time she is pregnant; perhaps in some ice-hole in the interior of the country.

An incident strikingly illustrative of these truths, occurred to a traveler who was visiting Acre, about the year 1815. One morning, in rambling about the city, he chanced to come into the vicinity of the custom house, at the port, and there he overheard a violent dispute going on between some fishermen and a certain farmer of the revenue--probably a wealthy merchant of the town--who was standing near. It seems that a duty of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> per cent., that is, one-third part of the whole price, had been laid upon all fish that should be taken in the bay and brought into the port for sale; and the privilege of collecting the tax had been sold to the merchant, who was engaged in the dispute. It had been calculated that the remaining two-thirds of the value of the fish would be sufficient to induce the fishermen to continue their vocation. It proved, however, not to be so. The cost of boats and outfit, and the...", "...was, notwithstanding, our whole dependance for the purposes of hunting and fishing!----Here,' continued he, sighing, 'was the habitation of _Tawlongo_, one of our most celebrated warriors.

This family, known in history as the Saiyid dynasty, ruled nominally in Northern India for about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years, but the rule had no coherence, and a powerful Afghan of the Lodi family took the opportunity to endeavour to concentrate power in his own hands.

Although the motive may not seem to be very reasonable, still the result is of great advantage to those believers who occupy thirty-three days in taking the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> baths, for otherwise the majority of them would never undergo any form of ablution. That the demon is loose on the 24th of August is an established fact among the credulous; and were it not for the compact entered into between St. Bartholomew and the said demon, that all who have taken thirty-three baths during the year should be free from his talons, the list of the condemned would be much increased.

The surface area of all these, each being one <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> hundredth of an inch in diameter, is about thirty-three hundred square yards. The haemoglobin which they contain combines in the lungs with the oxygen in the inspired air, and they give up this indispensable substance to the cells everywhere in the body.

The private enterprise of Ojeda did not fail to excite the same spirit among other followers of Columbus, who remained in Spain. He had been scarcely a month gone, before _Pedro Alonzo Nino_, who had been the pilot of the admiral on his first voyage, set out from Palos with _Christoval Guerra_, the brother of a Sevillian merchant who supplied the outfit. The vessel of these bold adventurers was but a bark of fifty tons, the crew but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> men--yet with the daring spirit of the Spanish sailors of those days, they embarked fearlessly and joyfully to explore barbarous shores and unknown seas. Reaching the coasts of Paria and Cumana, they carried on for some time a profitable commerce with the natives, from whom they obtained pearls and gold in exchange for glass beads and other trinkets; but falling in at length with tribes less peaceful, and not, like Ojeda, enjoying warlike renown as much as profitable...", "...Moslem and chivalrous Crusader must have been nearer to each other, because they were both dogmatists, than any two homeless agnostics in a pew of Mr. Campbell's chapel. \"I say God is One,\" and \"I say God is One but also Three,\" that is the beginning of a good quarrelsome, manly friendship. But our age would turn these creeds into tendencies. It would tell the Trinitarian to follow multiplicity as such (because it was his \"temperament\"), and he would turn up later with three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> persons in the Trinity. Meanwhile, it would turn the Moslem into a Monist: a frightful intellectual fall. It would force that previously healthy person not only to admit that there was one God, but to admit that there was nobody else.

The poem begins with a reference to the light of God's glory, and its last line speaks of \"the Love which moves the Sun and the other stars.\" And between this beginning and this end in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> cantiche light is represented not only by degrees of increasing intensity and variety of unlocked for movements but as surrounding the spirits, living flames, and constituting, symbolically, the beatitude of Heaven.

This man was Theodosius, then living in modest retirement on his farm near Valladolid, in Spain, as unambitious as David among his sheep, as contented as Cincinnatus at the plow. Even Gibbon does not sneer at this great Christian emperor, who revived for a while the falling empire.

One of the greatest of all the emperors, and the last great man who swayed the sceptre of Trajan, his ancestor, he has not too warmly been praised by the Church, whose defender he was--the last flickering light of an expiring monarchy,--although his character has been assailed by modern critics of great respectability.

It is certain that Villeneuve at Trafalgar fought under more favourable conditions than in the conflict of July 22nd. He had landed his very numerous sick, his crews had been refreshed and reinforced, and, above all, the worst of the Spanish ships had been replaced by seaworthy and serviceable craft. Yet out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> sail of the line, he lost eighteen to an enemy that numbered only twenty-seven sail; and that fact alone absolves him from the charge of cowardice in declining to face Cornwallis and Calder in July with ships that were cumbered with sick and badly needed refitting.

To refute this error it is merely needful to remind the reader that all immediate fear of invasion was over, when, at the close of...", "...and painter-engravers' work.

The Pragmatic is of interest to the student of French history mainly because of the degree in which it enhanced the power of the crown, particularly in respect to the ecclesiastical affairs of the realm, and because of the testimony it bears to the declining influence of the papacy in the stronger nations like France and England.

The girls had not yet been subjected to the restrictions of civilized dress. He says: \"In all, I examined the movements of eighty-two chests, and in each case took an abdominal and a costal tracing.

Thus there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> full-blooded Indians, five one fourth, thirty-five one half, and two three fourths white. _Seventy- five_ showed a _decided abdominal_ type of breathing, three a costal type, and three in which both were about even. _Those who showed the costal type, or a divergence from the abdominal type, came from the more civilized tribes_, like the Mohawks and Chippewas, and were either _one half_ or _three fourths white_; while in _no single instance_ did a full-blooded Indian girl...", "...a broader and more convenient way from the City to the Borough. But no more interesting structure was ever devoted to the labourer's pickaxe. A bridge appears to have existed as early as 978; another, built of wood, in 1014, was partly burned in 1136; and this was succeeded, some years later, by the edifice which was destroyed within the memory of some still living. The design was given by Peter of Colechurch, chaplain of St. Mary Colechurch in the Poultry. The construction occupied <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years, from 1176 to 1209, which, considering the breadth of river to be spanned, the massiveness of the work, and the primitive nature of engineering science at that time, does not seem excessive. Peter's bridge was of stone, not of timber, and consisted of nineteen arches, a drawbridge for large vessels, a gate-house at each end, and a chapel in the centre, dedicated to St. Thomas of Canterbury. According to an old tradition, the course of the river was diverted into a...", "...it is important from the fact that it is obviously the original of the very poetical discourse on rosemary in the first printed English herbal, commonly known as Banckes's herbal. Moreover, in this MS. there is recorded an old tradition which I have not found in any other herbal, but which is still current amongst old-fashioned country folk, namely, that rosemary \"passeth not commonly in highte the highte of Criste whill he was man on Erthe,\" and that when the plant attains the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years it will increase in breadth but not in height. It is the oldest MS. in which we find many other beliefs about rosemary that still survive in England. There is a tradition that Queen Philippa's mother sent the first plants of rosemary to England, and in a copy of this MS. in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, the translator, \"danyel bain,\" says that rosemary was unknown in England until the Countess of Hainault sent some to her daughter.

I have placed this High Hall in the plan on that part of the gate-house which lay to the north side of Holborn. There is no precise evidence that it was exactly so situated, but as all other rooms on this first floor can be pretty accurately placed, I think the conclusion is just that High Hall was approximately where I have put it. High Hall was large, being <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet by twenty-eight, and in altitude twelve. In the midst of the place was a stone anvil, whereon the irons were knocked off the unhappy persons sentenced to death, when they came down from the chapel (on the third floor), on their way to the cart which was to carry them to Tyburn. Opposite the entrance to the tap-house was a passage leading to a second common-side debtors room.

Of course, the greater part of the rock will be removed by means of blasting with high explosives, but some of it is to be attacked with a novel instrument, which was first tried, on a small scale, on the Panama Canal, and is to be used for serious work here.

In 1852 the steamer Uncle Sam was brought out on a schooner from San Francisco and put together at the mouth of the river, but after a few months she most strangely went to the bottom, while her owner, Turnbull, was on the way from San Francisco with new machinery for her. Turnbull came in the schooner General Patterson, which was bearing stores for the fort. When the Patterson arrived at the mouth of the Colorado, she was able to sail easily up the river for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> miles because Turnbull was met by some of his men who had been left here to take soundings, and for the first time a vessel was sailing with some knowledge of the channel.

He had worked <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years among Protestants, and could testify that what Manning affirmed was the reverse of the truth. Conolly is a man who is on the whole in tolerable harmony with Roman views, but who is therefore all the more resolved to vote against infallibility.

This brochure was answered by Professor Henderson, the title of his book being _Homoeopathy Fairly Represented_. From 1827 to 1837 there were but a dozen practitioners of homoeopathy in London, but during 1837 to 1847 the number increased to between seventy and eighty. In 1857 there were upwards of two hundred practitioners in the kingdom, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> institutions in which the law of similars was used as a basis of practice. In 1867 the increase was not so rapid, the number being 261. A society was formed about this period for \"the protection of homoeopathic practitioners and students,\" which proved of great value in binding the sect together. In 1870 congresses were established, and annual meetings held, which have continued to the present time. In 1901 there were over three hundred homoeopathic...", "...one acre of hops at forty-two dollars, for manuring and tilling, exclusive of poles and rent of land; poles they estimate at sixteen dollars per annum, but in this country they would not amount to half that sum; one acre is computed to require three thousand poles, which will last from eight to twelve years, according to the quality of the wood used. The English growers of hops think they have a very indifferent crop if the produce of one acre does not amount to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> dollars, but, much more frequently, it amounts to two hundred dollars, and sometimes so high as four hundred dollars per acre. In this country, experiments have been equally flattering. A gentleman in Massachusetts, in the summer of 1791, raised hops, from one acre of ground that sold for three hundred dollars; it is allowed, that land in this state is equally favourable to the growth of hops. Upon a low estimate, we may fairly compute the nett profit of one acre of hops...", "...in German Treasury bills, and English Exchequer loans. This is very good; it sounds well.

The total length is nearly 80 feet. Another tomb of the same type, La Grotte du Castellet, contained over a hundred skeletons, together with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> flint arrow or spear-heads, one of which was stuck fast in a human vertebra, a bell-shaped cup, axes of polished stone, beads and pendants of various materials, 114 pieces of _callais_, and a small plaque of gold.

The reign of Theodoric covered <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years--years of such quiet and prosperity as Italy had not known since the happy era of the Antonines. The king made good his promise that his reign should be such that \"the only regret of the people should be that the Goths had not come at an earlier period.\" The kingdom established by the rare abilities of Theodoric lasted only twenty-seven years after his death, which occurred A.D. 527.

This, together with the picturesque style in which the book is written, gives a peculiar charm, and leaves on the mind of the reader impressions more vivid and lasting than any other work which we have seen on the same subject.

Of these Washington's, Putnam's, Arnold's, Moultrie's, Warren's, Marion's, Hamilton's, and Burr's, are, in our opinion, the most spirited. The biography of Washington affords a keen analysis of that great hero's character, and conclusively proves, we think, that he was not only a great patriot, but a great general.

On the following day, May 9th, the consideration of the subject was resumed, and Mr. Broomall addressed the House in favor of the resolution. He began by counting the votes that would probably be cast against the amendment. \"It would meet the opposition,\" said he, \"of the unrepentant <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> of this body.

It would seem to be rather unnatural, and the reverse of what was contemplated by those who enacted the constitution, as our numbers increase, to lessen the ratio of representation. He was, therefore, against striking out the number thirty-three, with a view to insert a lower number. A divisor of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> thousand would now give a House consisting of at least one hundred and forty members, which, even on the present ratio, must soon become not only too expensive, but unwieldy.

At that time Baha had been for many years a leader in the Babi religion, had written the \"Ikan,\" and announced his mission.

The inhabitants of the town of Mongray, on the river of the same name, in that month made a raid upon Mamaiah, a town on the British frontier, plundered several factories there, and carried off <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> British subjects as slaves.

Her sacrifice was very near to its completion now. This is what she meant when she said her _Fiat_ to the Angel Gabriel <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years ago. This is what she meant when she presented Him to the Lord when He was forty days old. The three days' loss, and the separation when He left His home at Nazareth, had been a foreshadowing of this. Now the consummation of her sacrifice had arrived: \"And there stood by the Cross of JESUS His Mother\"! She had never flinched, had never looked back. It had been _Fiat_ all along the line.

The stem of the tree was twenty-eight feet in compass on the ground, and the ascent to the turret was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet. The tree must have stood on some of the highest ground at Hampstead, for it is said that six neighbouring counties could be seen from the top of it.

Puzyritsin was a very good-natured and shy person, and was always preparing to be an hussar, in spite of his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years. He belonged to that class of people who feel it absolutely necessary, once in the twenty-four hours, to utter a phrase after the pattern of, 'The beautiful always falls into decay in the flower of its splendour; such is the fate of the beautiful in the world,' in order to smoke his pipe with redoubled zest all the rest of the day in a circle of 'good comrades.' On this account he was called an idealist.

The evils of impressment and the work of the crimp and his gang--so infamous in England--had no great vogue here, for the reason that, during our wars of 1776 and 1812, the good seamen--coasters and fishermen, who had suffered most from the Lion--were only too anxious to find a berth on an American man-of-war, where they could do yeoman's service...", "...[Illustration: JUDGES' PAVILION.] Fire is an invader of peace and property, defence against whose destructive forays is one of the first and most constant cares of American cities, old and new, great and small.

Milford Track is in the South Island, among the lakes and fiords of Otago, and goes through an uninhabited and unexplored country of dense forest and inaccessible mountain.

Everywhere was Octavian hailed as the savior of the world and, as the founder of a new golden age, men...", "...fortunate of them two or three years behind, and bidding fair to increase the distance indefinitely. Its longevity has been greater than the first and second republics taken together, which covered a period of a little over sixteen years; while if we combine the existence of all three republics, equal to about thirty-six years, we again find that no other regime has shown such prolonged vitality,--the two empires having lived for only twenty-eight years, and the two monarchies for about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> and a half years. But the early years of the third republic--from 1870 to 1879--like the declining period of the first and second republics, were more monarchical than republican. And again, there are so many weakening influences in the present institutions of France, that the decisive conclusions which might otherwise be drawn from the foregoing considerations need, I regret to say, to be considerably qualified. Previous to the election to the presidency of M. Grevy, in...", "...petitions. When were they filed? July 8, 1879, and it turned out that that charge was true, with two exceptions: First, that they were not filed at that time; and, second, that all the petitions were true. That is the only harm about that charge. Third. A fraudulent order made by Brady, July 8th. Now let us see what the fraud consists in. The fraud is claimed to be in expediting to thirty-three hours when the petition only called for forty-eight. You remember the charge expediting to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> hours, when the petition only called for forty-eight. Now, let us see. It is claimed that to grant more than the petitions ask is a crime; certainly it must be admitted that to grant less is equally a crime. The only evidence now of fraud in this is that he was asked to expedite the forty-eight hours, but he expedited to thirty-three. That is to say, he violated the petitions, and if that is good doctrine, then the petitions must settle whether expedition is to be granted...", "...History, Geography, and Astronomy; and on those of the right wing, Painting, Music, and Architecture.

On the strength of several years of study of different kinds of protists, especially rhizopods and infusoria, I published a theory <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years ago to the effect that every living cell has psychic properties, and that the psychic life of the multicellular animals and plants is merely the sum total of the psychic functions of the cells which build up their structure.

The clergyman was again kind enough to make the necessary arrangements for me, and even to act as my Mentor on the journey. Though we were only three strong, we departed with a retinue of seven horses, and for nearly ten miles rode back the same way by which I had come from Reikholt on the preceding morning; then we turned off to the left, and crossing hills and acclivities, reached other valleys, which were partly traversed by beautiful streams of...", "...a chin denoting great firmness.

He was a man about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years of age, of medium height, but of a full and well-developed form, black eyes, a pleasing countenance, a dark mustache nearly covering his lips, square chin, and eyebrows meeting in the center of the face--all tokens of a great firmness and decision.

Outside of...", "...tenancy at will is sometimes used to describe the condition, not only of the holder of customary land, but also of men who are mere squatters on the waste or on the demesne, and who are not protected in their holdings by any manorial custom. Again, it is not always easy to draw a line between copyhold and leasehold. On a manor where the custom is least favourable to the tenants' interests the former shades into the latter. There is not much difference, for example, between a lease for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years and a copyhold for life. Again, the classification is one of tenures not of tenants. In parts of England, it is true, it does divide individual tenants with almost complete exhaustiveness and precision. In most districts, for example, the free tenant usually holds freehold land and nothing else, the customary tenant customary land and no other. But in East Anglia there is no such simplicity of arrangement, no such permanence of tenurial compartments. Many free...", "...commenced immediately after the war to collect their dead in suitable cemeteries, and the work of permanently marking their graves continued systematically until the Federal loss in the war can be very accurately estimated.

It may be recalled that before Trafalgar over twenty-four hours were needed for the allied <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> to get out of Cadiz Bay. On the 13th, however, the combined French and Spaniards sailed, intent primarily, it would seem, not on the true and vital offensive purpose of frustrating the relief, but upon the very secondary defensive object of preserving two of their own numbers, which in a recent gale had been swept to the eastward.

To remedy the inconveniences arising from the different rates at which the same species of foreign coin did pass in the several colonies and plantations, Queen Anne, in the sixth year of her reign, had thought fit, by her royal proclamation, to settle and ascertain the current rate of foreign coin in all her colonies. The standard at which currency was fixed by this proclamation, was at an hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> pounds, six shillings and eight-pence _per cent_.; but this regulation, however convenient and advantageous to trade, was afterwards little regarded in these provinces, and the confusion of current money continued and prevailed.

In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic currents is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of sixty miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown by an inland gale to a favourable spot, would germinate.

To these terms they would not accede, but prepared for war, by equipping a fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> ships, and placing it under the command of one of their best officers. A battle ensued which was fought on both sides with great skill and bravery; but the Rhodians were obliged to yield to the superior number of the Roman fleet, and to return to the harbour, having lost two of their ships, and the rest being very much damaged.

Northerners and Southerners had at once joined issue on their relation in the Union. The House had appointed its committee of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> to consider the condition of the country.

Moreover, on account of the insufficient quantity of copper money for minor currency, the small change frequently gained a premium on the silver dollar, so much so that by every purchaser not less than half a dollar was realized.

Grimes had often disguised himself so well as different people that he might have made something by the art in a \"protean turn\" on the vaudeville stage. Chesterton had known all about the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> thousand dollars belonging to Morrell & Grimes in the banks. Grimes had hinted to his friend how easy it would be to sequestrate this money without Morrell knowing it. At first, evidently, Grimes had wished to use the bookkeeper as a tool.

It is a very difficult thing to subdue even savages who are desperate, determined, and united. Charlemagne fought the Saxons for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years. Though he never lost a battle, they still held out. At first he was generous and forgiving, for he was more magnanimous than Caesar; but they could not be won by kindness.

The reign of Mahmud (1808-1839) witnessed the first real introduction of Turkey into the atmosphere of the West. He had been trained by the deposed Selim, to hate the Janissaries, to play the part, strange indeed, of a reforming Sultan. Baraicktar was at his side. It seemed at first that only a new and more blood-thirsty tyrant had begun to reign.

It was here that Crescentius, one of the first preachers of the Christian faith on the Rhine, regarded by local tradition as the pupil of St. Peter and first Archbishop of Mainz, suffered martyrdom in the reign of Trajan in A.D. 103.

Alexander died in Babylon when not quite <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years old. In actual and immediate achievement he surpassed perhaps every other man who has ever lived. He founded an empire which he himself had conceived and developed, which covered nearly all the then known world, and which, though it was composed mainly of barbarous and semi-barbarous people, was dominated by Greek thought.

Then, with a rush that sent every one flying out of his way, Goliath hurled himself at the bulwarks, which were low, the top of the rail about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> inches from the deck. The two bodies struck the rail with a heavy thud, instantly toppling overboard. That broke the spell that bound everybody, so that there was an instantaneous rush to the side.

Among these lesser captains I soon struck up a friendship with Joe Murray, a friendship which is as strong now as it was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years ago.

She had sailed across the Atlantic from a point on the South African route, held prisoner <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> days by a prize crew of twenty-two men and one officer, Lieutenant Hans Berg, of the Imperial German Naval Reserve. Aboard the _Appam_ were 156 officers and men, 116 of her own passengers, 138 survivors of destroyed vessels, and twenty Germans who had been en route to a prison camp in England when rescued. This large company was cowed by the lieutenant's threat to shoot the first man who made a hostile move, or to blow up the vessel with bombs if he saw defeat was certain....", "...delay.

How well the Harwich auxiliary vessels carried out their work, and how heavy that work was, the following figures show. In the year 1917, the total number of enemy mines swept up and destroyed by the mine-sweepers of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> bases of the British Isles amounted to 3400, of which over 1000 stand to the credit of the Harwich base.

His public work took the form of lectures, of which his books are reproductions. In 1836 he published his first book, \"Nature,\" anonymously. \"Nature\" was the germ essay from which all Emerson's later work sprang, a first expression of thoughts that were expanded and developed later. It was published in 1836, when its writer was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years of age, and known only as a preacher who had become a lecturer. Already Emerson had adopted the methods of a seer rather than those of the consecutive thinker. \"Nature\" was one of the first-written books of great writers that made a deep impression on the understanding few, but had only a few readers. It presaged the greatness to be; and indeed its poetical quality carries a charm, which Emerson sometimes failed to reproduce...", "...regard to the _inorganic matters of peat_ considered as food to plants, it is obvious, that, leaving out of the account for the present, some exceptional cases, they are useful as far as they go.

The ashes of the other half are largely mixed with sand and soil, but in most cases also contain considerable sulphate of lime, and often carbonates of lime and magnesia.

On the first of May, 1683, the Emperor Leopold reviewed his troops on the plains of Kitsee, not far from Preshurg, To this review, all who had promised to sustain Austria were invited. Her appeals had at last roused the German princes to action; but they had been so dilatory in their councils, that not one of them was prepared for war. The army assembled on the plains of Kitsee was not numerous. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> thousand men in all, who, with their faded uniforms and defective weapons, made no great show. The emperor, as he emerged from his tent, looked discouraged. Sternly he rode forth on his richly-caparisoned gray horse, and, when his men greeted him with enthusiastic shouts, he bowed his head in silence, and sighed heavily. He turned to Charles of Lorraine, who rode a few paces behind him, and said: \"Come hither, Carl.\" The duke obeyed at once, and at one bound was at...", "...a private corporation, and in each district the organization formed a kind of social and political club.

When the Goth was summoned to depart, he destroyed ruthlessly. The rage of Vitiges casts back a light upon the mildness of Theodorick; the slaughters ordered by Teia are a witness to Gothic humanity. No words but those of Gregory himself, in applying the Hebrew prophet, can do justice to the temporal misery of Rome.

Fifty years of sad experience have shown to us and to all India, that this system is incapable of improvement under the present dynasty; and that the only alternative is for the paramount power to take the administration upon itself.

I subsequently gave it the more definite title of a _neurological_ problem, as I share the view that true consciousness (thought and reason) is only present in those higher animals which have a centralized nervous system and organs of sense of a certain degree of development.

After Mexico Graham stuck to the old army, rose to the colonelcy of the Fourth Cavalry in 1864, and was a Union brigadier of volunteers. He had been in the army nearly ten years when the Mexican War broke out.

In 1885, after the completion of the present city water works, a new fire department was organized, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> members, with Captain Terence McCracken as chief.

They left Bristol on the 14th of July, with fifty-six guns and three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> men, and with double the usual number of officers, in order to prevent the mutinies so common in privateers. Nothing of moment occurred till the vessels anchored at Isola Grande, off the coast of Brazil. Here two men deserted, but were so frightened in the night by tigers, as they supposed, but in reality by monkeys and baboons, that they took refuge in the sea and shouted till they were taken on board. The two ships passed through Lemaire's Strait and doubled Cape...", "...resides solely in the use made of them by Langbaine. Two hundred and fifty-two British poets are named in Phillips' _Theatrum Poetarum_. Of these some one hundred and sixty-nine were authors of plays. The titlepage of Winstanley's _Lives_ advertises an account \"of above Two Hundred\" poets, but \"147 are actually listed in the catalogue, and only 168 are noted throughout.\"[3] Four hundred and sixty-seven plays by sixty authors are included. From Phillips' collection Winstanley omits the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> Scottish poets and sixty-eight English poets. William Riley Parker believes that most of Winstanley's omissions were deliberate and that his \"endeavor, unlike Phillips', was to give a chronological survey of English poetry from Robert of Gloucester down to Sir Roger L'Estrange.\"[4] Parker defines the differing contributions of the two men in the following manner: Phillips is more the bibliographer and cataloguer, collecting names and titles; Winstanley is the...", "...morally.

Then I sort of got a shock, as sometimes fellows of my age making a big talk do. In about half a minute I found a new meaning for the word 'bluff.' I thought I'd got its meaning right before that. I thought I could teach my father all there was to know about bluff. You see, I'd forgotten he'd lived <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> more years than I had. Bluff?

What is the exact figure of his victims? How many corpses bestrew the _coup d'etat_ of December? Who can tell? Who knows? Who will ever know? As we have already seen, one witness deposed: \"I counted in that place <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> bodies;\" another, at a different part of the boulevard, said: \"We counted eighteen bodies within a space of twenty or twenty-five yards.\" A third person, speaking of another spot, said: \"There were upwards of sixty bodies within a distance of sixty yards.\" The writer so long threatened with death told ourselves: \"I saw with my eyes upwards of eight hundred dead bodies lying along the boulevard.\" Now think, compute how many it requires of battered brains, of breasts...", "...Comedy is divided into three parts or books, _canticas_, as they are called by Dante: Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, each one containing thirty-three cantos, with one additional introductory canto prefixed to the Hell. Even the number of lines in the three _canticas_ is approximately the same.[7] Dante's love for number-symbols was shown in the New Life, hence we are justified in accepting the theory that the threefold division of the poem is symbolical of the Trinity, and that the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> cantos of each _cantica_ represent the years of the Savior's life. It is worthy of note that the last word in each of the three books is \"stars.\" The allegory of the Divine Comedy has been the subject of countless discussions.

Milne Edwards gives, as the mean amount of these two classes, required for all climates, not less than three hundred and fifteen grains of nitrogen and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> hundred and fifty grains of carbon in the twenty-four hours. These views are adopted by most physiologists; yet the analyses of Schlossberger and Kemp indicate that the idea of estimating the value of food by the quantity of nitrogen it contains is a fallacious one.

Macchiavelli arrived at Imola on the evening of October 7, 1502, and, all travel-stained as he was, repaired straight to the duke, as if the message with which he was charged was one that would not brook a moment's delay in its deliverance. Actually, however, he had nothing to offer Cesare but the empty expressions of Florence's friendship and the hopes she founded upon Cesare's reciprocation. The crafty young Florentine--he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> at the time--was sent to temporize and to avoid committing himself or his Government. Valentinois listened to the specious compliments, and replied by similar protestations and by reminding Florence how he had curbed the hand of those very condottieri who had now rebelled against him as a consequence. He showed himself calm and tranquil at the loss of Urbino, telling Macchiavelli that he \"had not forgotten the way to reconquer it,\" when it should suit him.

The king made good his promise that his reign should be such that \"the only regret of the people should be that the Goths had not come at an earlier period.\" The kingdom established by the rare abilities of Theodoric lasted only twenty-seven years after his death, which occurred A.D. 527.

High ground commanding the anchorage was occupied by the besieging force, and on the 18th of December 1793 the allies retired. They carried away or destroyed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> French vessels, of which thirteen were of the line. But partly through the inefficiency and partly through the ill-will of the Spaniards, who were indisposed to cripple the French, whom they considered as their only possible allies against Great Britain, the destruction was not so complete as had been intended.

How long this was before the death of Attila is not related, but we know that he died in 453 A.D. He is supposed to have been born about 406, which would have made him forty-seven years old at the time of his death. It was thirteen years after her marriage to Attila when Chriemhild accomplished her revenge. Supposing that Attila's death took place not less than a year later, that would fix the date of the marriage at 439, or when this busy warrior was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> and perhaps ready to rest, and that of the revenge at 452. Therefore, as the \"Nibelungen Lied\" tells us that the death of Siegfried took place twenty-six years before the accomplishment of the revenge, we may suppose that the hero expired in 426. At any rate, the date of his death must have been in the early part of the fifth century.

That work was constructed by a single State giving aid occasionally to a company, which supplied the balance of the cost. I understand that the road from Baltimore to Wheeling, when it shall have been finished, and its furniture placed upon it, will have cost at least thirty millions.

In favor of that reduction, New England, with a delegation of forty members in the other house, gave <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> votes, and one only against it. The four Southern States, with more than fifty members, gave thirty-two votes for it, and seven against it. Again, in 1821, (observe again, Sir, the time,) the law passed for the relief of the purchasers of the public lands. This was a measure of vital importance to the West, and more especially to the Southwest. It authorized the relinquishment of contracts for lands which had been entered into at high prices, and a reduction in other cases...", "...is found on the desert, which in summer is utterly dry and barren.

Vasari says positively, that \"John Van Eyck would not let any one see him work, nor would he teach the secret to any one--but being old,\" &c.

Soissante-et-le-va was the highest chance that could happen in the game, for it paid sixty-seven times as much money as was staked. It was seldom won except by some player who resolved to push his good fortune to the utmost. The players sat round a table, the talliere in the midst of them, with the bank of gold before him, and the punters or players each having a book of 13 cards, laying down one, two, three, or more, as they...", "...into the road, the concern started off as hard as its eight legs and two wheels could carry it. The night was dark, the streets guiltless of lighting. As the trap zigzagged furiously from one side of the way to the other, now poised on one wheel, now leaping bodily into the air as it charged through a deep hole or rut, it was a comfort to the said passenger to reflect that the road being feet deep in sand one was bound to fall soft anyhow.

Well, it gave her a building expansion, a year ago, greater than that of any other city of her population in America. One year has seen in Western Canada an increase in crop area under the one cereal of winter wheat of over one hundred and fifty per cent, a development absolutely unique in the world's history. Winnipeg, having acquired the growing habit, expands by leaps and bounds. No city on the continent within the last <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years has had such phenomenal growth. In 1876 the population was 6,000; it now counts 150,000 souls. This city is the greatest grain-market in the British Empire, and from it radiate twenty-two distinct pairs of railway tracks. Architects have in preparation plans for fifteen million dollars' worth of buildings during the coming year. The bank clearings in 1903 were $246,108,000; last year they had increased to $618,111,801; and a Winnipeg bank has never failed.

Had I not done it all the years of her life? It was no new sacrifice. But I said all such things with a swelling heart, and eyes full of unshed tears.

The flat meadow bottom is from about three hundred to two hundred yards wide, with gently curved margins about fifty yards wide from which rise the simple massive walls of gray granite at an angle of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> degrees, mostly timbered with a light growth of pine and streaked in many places with avalanche channels. Towards the upper end of the canyon the Sierra crown comes in sight, forming a finely balanced picture framed by the massive canyon walls.

The table pops up again, receiving, perhaps, a light sovereign, and the higher hammer, having always first strike, knocks it into a receiver to the right, time enough to escape its colleague, which, when it comes forward, has nothing to hit, and returns, to allow the table to be elevated again. In this way the reputation of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> sovereigns is established or destroyed every minute.

My idea is that, taking one hundred ordinarily healthful young soldiers from a regiment in active service, and putting them into Andersonville, by the end of the third month at least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> of those weakest and most vulnerable to disease would have succumbed to the exposure, the pollution of ground and air, and the insufficiency of the ration of coarse corn meal. After this the mortality would be somewhat less, say at the end of six months fifty of them would be dead. The remainder would hang on still more tenaciously, and at the end of a year there would be fifteen or twenty still alive.

This story is too circumstantial to be without foundation, nor is there any reason to doubt the badness of a country lane; but the particular family-flitting referred to must be left uncertain. George Austen was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years old when he settled down at his Hampshire living. His wife was some eight years younger. Their means were not large, but George was able to supplement his income both by farming and by taking pupils.

Louis XIV. having died, the Regent took possession, and then the prisons were opened. The Regent called for a list of all persons then in the prisons sent there at the will of the king. He found that, as to many prisoners, nobody knew any cause why they had been in prison. They had been forgotten. Many of the prisoners did not know themselves, and could not guess why they had been arrested. One Italian had been in the Bastile <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years without ever knowing why. On his arrival in Paris, thirty-three years before, he was arrested and sent to prison. He had grown old. He had survived his family and friends. When the rest were liberated he asked to remain where he was, and lived there the rest of his life. The old prisoners were pardoned, but in a little while their places were taken by new ones. At this time Voltaire was not interested in the great world--knew very little of religion or of...", "...feet of the man. The cowpuncher drew the hose tight, slipped the nozzle through the iron ring, and caught the flapping arms of the man to his body. With the deft skill of a trained roper Clay swung the rubber pipe round the body of the man again and again, drawing it close to the post and knotting it securely behind. The Swede struggled, but his furious rage availed him nothing. He was in the hands of the champion roper of Graham County, a man who had hogtied a wild hill steer in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> seconds by the watch. It took longer than this to rope up the husky janitor with a squirming hose, but when Clay stepped back to inspect his job he knew he was looking at one that had been done thoroughly. \"I keel you, by damn, ef you don't turn me loose!\" roared the big man in a rage.

In the charge to a jury, also, opportunities are offered for exceptions which do not exist if the cause is to be decided by the judge alone. He does not have to instruct himself in public.

They included, by statute, a certain sum, say twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> cents a day for each day's attendance at court by the prevailing party. This was construed to mean each day during which the action lay in court, since upon any of them it might by possibility be called up, and the client was always represented by his attorney of record, a notice to whom was a notice to him.

For reasons charitable, as well as practical, Ford had planned to leave Frisbie out of this second dance of attendance upon the president. The track-layers were well up toward the head of Horse Creek gulch, with Brissac to drive; but during the night the Louisianian had reported in with a touch of mountain fever, and Ford had asked Frisbie to go up and take his place.

While one army marched up the Hudson valley to attack Montreal, General Wolfe, in command of another army of 7000, and accompanied by a strong fleet, moved up the St. Lawrence against Quebec. An inordinate thirst for military glory had been Wolfe's heritage from his father, himself a general. An ensign at fourteen, Wolfe had become an officer in active service while still in his teens, had commanded a detachment in the attack on Louisburg in 1758, and now at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> was charged with the capture of Quebec, a natural stronghold, defended by the redoubtable Montcalm. The task seemed impossible; weeks were wasted in futile efforts; sickness and apparent defeat weighed heavily on the young commander.

Their existence was suggested at least as long ago as the days of Sir Francis Bacon, whose statement about them is quoted on the flyleaf of this book.

In his book on _Klimaschwankungen seit 1700_, Brueckner has collected an uncommonly interesting assortment of facts as to the climate...", "...of the Green are the North, the Centre, and Trinity churches, the first two Congregationalist and the last Episcopal, the row presenting a curiously quaint and ancient appearance.

The number of eggs laid before incubation commences varies from ten to fifteen, or more. Yarrell says, 'Twenty-eight eggs in one instance, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> eggs in two other instances, are recorded as having been found in one nest; but there is little doubt, in these cases, that more than one bird had laid eggs in the same nest.' This may be; but I find in a French author an instance in which no less than forty-two eggs were laid by a Partridge in captivity, all of which, being placed under a hen, would have produced chicks, but for the occurrence of a thunder-storm accompanied by a deluge of rain which flooded the nest, when...", "...and of what it may culminate in, is the only safeguard against the terrible acts which from time to time startle the community, and which are found, when too late, to have been perpetrated by those who ought to have been under medical restraint.

They reduce cabinet ministers and other dignitaries many degrees in the social scale, exhibiting them as footmen, as boys, as policemen, as nurses, as circus performers, so that a certain comic effect is produced, even if the joke should go no further.

So far, so good. But though we had taken the Mortella Tower, we were still nearly as far off having San Fiorenzo as ever. The town was commanded and completely defended by a formidable redoubt, which mounted twenty-one heavy guns, and was moreover perched upon an eminence which commanded every other accessible height in the neighbourhood, and the possession of this redoubt really meant the possession of San Fiorenzo.

Legally, he was told, they were as much the owners as ever. Astor satisfied himself that this point would hold in the courts. Then he assiduously hunted up the heirs, and by a series of strategic maneuvers worthy of the pen of a Balzac, succeeded in buying their claim for $100,000. In the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years which had elapsed since confiscation, the land had been greatly improved. Suddenly came a notification to these unsuspecting farmers that not they, but Astor, owned the land.

The writer, Edward Stanley, was for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years an active country clergyman, and for twelve years more a no less active bishop, at a time when such activity was uncommon, though not so rare as is sometimes now supposed.

The man--so the story further runs--had no money to pay Longworth's fee and no property except two second-hand copper stills. These also were high in the appraisement of property values, for they could be used to make whisky, and whisky could be in turn used to debauch the Indian tribes and swindle them of furs and land. These stills Longworth took and traded them off to Joel Williams, a tavern-keeper who was setting up a distillery. In exchange, Longworth received <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> acres of what was then considered unpromising land in the town.[167] From time to time he bought more land with the money made in law; this land lay on what were then the outskirts of the place. Some of the lots cost him but ten dollars each. As immigration swarmed West and Cincinnati grew, his land consequently took on enhanced value.

An interesting state of transition was seen in some of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> families who had abandoned whipping but had not given up the idea of absolute obedience. It is evidenced in comments like the following: \"They are not whipped. Father threatens with a strap.\" Or, \"It [whipping] is not necessary.

Yet the act must have operated in relief of the indebted clergy equally with other debtors, and many of the ministers were in debt. It was by no means the intention of the assembly to abridge the maintenance of the clergy, or to bear harder upon them than upon all other public creditors; and as they, under the new act, in fact, received in general a larger salary than they had received in any year since it was first...", "...buried in the church, brought hither from Alexandria many years ago.

Under this fabric is the cloister where merchants meet morning and evening, as also the grave senators and gentlemen, to confer of state affairs, in their gowns and caps, like so many philosophers; it is a very noble and solemn spectacle.

There were front and back and sides for stormy weather but they were seldom in requisition. The program, discussed and settled beforehand, was carried out in scout silence, which is about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> and one-third per cent greater than the regular market silence. Tom and Eddie Ingram, being the tallest of the foxes, stationed themselves at either upright, the other members of the patrol lining up along the sides where they loosened the ropes from the pegs. Then Tom and Ed lifted the ridgepole, the scouts along the sides held the canvas high, and the entire patrol moved uniformly and in absolute silence. The tent, intact, was moved from over the sleeping Ravens as the...", "...was then married. He had saved enough money to feel justified in starting out independently as an agriculturist and in 1878 he brought his bride to Washington and took up a homestead in Garfield county which is a part of his present home farm, on which he has resided continuously to this time. As his financial resources have increased, owing to his untiring industry and capable management, he has extended the boundaries of his place by purchase until it now embraces three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> acres. The property yields him a gratifying annual income and he has long been numbered among the representative agriculturists and substantial citizens of the county.

His illogical brush filled the cathedrals of Saragossa, Seville, Toledo, and Valencia with masterly frescoes, while with the etching needle he produced many plates. Some of these, like the \"Caprices,\" a series of eighty etchings, are filled with imagination alternately tragical and grotesque; while another series, representing bull-fights, throughout its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> plates depicts the incidents of the game with intense realism. The \"Disasters of War,\" another series of eighty, were inspired by the French invasion; and never, perhaps, were the cruelties of war more strenuously realized in art than in these. Probably these etchings, executed, like all his works, by methods peculiar to himself, constitute his best title to remembrance. But his painting, replete though it be with the defects of his qualities, stands as a precursor of the...", "...I tell you what would happen to you? At your age--\" \"Why!

Do what he would, harden himself as he might, George at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> could never hope to rival the sinews of the boy of twenty-four, who incidentally could instruct him on every conceivable military subject. George, standing by his sodden horse, felt humiliated and annoyed as Resmith cantered off to speak to the officer commanding the Ammunition Column.

The law provides that when an officer reaches the age of sixty-two years he must be retired from active service. One who has been disabled in the service, or who has served honorably for forty years and requests release, may also be retired. Officers on the retired list receive three-fourths as much pay as when on active duty at sea. Rear Admiral Dewey will be retired on the 26th of December, 1899. In 1898 there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> rear admirals on the retired lists. The officers while at sea receive more pay than when on shore duty. The salary of an ensign at sea is $1200 a year; that of a rear admiral is $6,000. The salaries of the other officers range between these two extremes. Previous to 1898 the number of enlisted men in the navy was limited to ten thousand. These men are received for a period of three years; and any one after serving continuously for twenty years may be assigned to duty...", "...to all have reference to the upper plumage. In 1888 an egg of a great auk was sold for one hundred and sixty guineas, whilst more recently an egg of the same species fetched two hundred and twenty-five pounds; and although these may seem enormous sums to give for a relic, the transactions are not without others to keep them in countenance. Only a few years ago two eggs of the same kind fetched one hundred and one hundred and two guineas respectively; while the egg first named realised <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> pounds ten shillings a little over twenty years ago. At that time it was discovered, together with four others, packed away in a dust-covered box in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, these being sold in 1865. From this it would seem that in the ornithological market the complete shell of a great auk's egg is worth nearly one hundred and seventy pounds, and a broken one only seventy pounds less. It will be seen that the purchase of one of these may be a good...", "...which indicate that such will be the fulness and triumphant issue of His kingdom. But Christ did not say, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at least nineteen centuries away from you.\" And again, when tauntingly questioned as to when this kingdom should come, He answered that it was come already, \"not with observation,\" yet among them. And, indeed, He, being Himself the Anointed One, was always speaking of the kingdom; so that, while the rest of the New Testament mentions it <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> times, it is mentioned in the gospels one hundred and twenty-five times. For He spoke to men who understood the phrase, being steeped in Old Testament promises of the Messianic time; and they, when their turn came, had to preach where the mention of a new kingdom would be as alarming as it was to Herod.

Several other vessels, however, seeing the imminent peril of the Spanish flag-ship, came to her assistance, and hemmed in the \"Royal Sovereign\" on all sides; but the latter, after suffering severely, was relieved by the arrival of the rest of the British squadron; and not long afterwards the \"Santa Anna\" struck her colours.

One of these is a mass of iron and nickel, weighing sixteen hundred and eighty pounds, found by the traveler Pallas, in 1749, at Abakansk, in Siberia. This immense aerolite may be seen in the Imperial Museum at St. Petersburg. On the plain of Otumpa, in Buenos Ayres, is a meteoric mass 7-1/2 feet in length, partly buried in the ground. Its estimated weight is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> thousand six hundred pounds. A specimen of this stone, weighing fourteen hundred pounds, has been removed and deposited in one of the rooms of the British Museum. A similar block, of meteoric origin, weighing twelve or thirteen thousand pounds, was discovered some years since in the Province of Bahia, in Brazil.

Still he was always in debt, always in want of money. In about a year Steele's wife died, and he was shortly married to another well-off lady. About this time he left the army, it is thought, although we do not know quite surely, and for long afterwards he was called Captain Steele. Steele wrote a great many letters to his second wife, both before and after his marriage.

There are no signs of the Chislehurst Caverns having at any time been used systematically as human abodes, but in other parts of the world similar sites have been converted into villages: one such existing at Troo in France is thus described by Baring-Gould: \"What makes Troo specially interesting is that the whole height is like a sponge perforated with passages giving access to halls, some of which are circular and...", "...these, he returned to his new home, by way of Pensacola, the lakes, and the Amite.

On the Sunday following, a peasant of Uri, William Tell by name, who, as we are told, was one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> sworn confederates, passed several times through the market-place at Altdorf without bowing or bending the knee to Gessler's hat. This was reported to the governor, who summoned Tell to his presence, and haughtily asked him why he had dared to disobey his command. \"My dear lord,\" answered Tell, submissively, \"I beg you to pardon me, for it was done through ignorance and not out of contempt. If I were clever, I should not be called Tell. I pray your mercy; it shall not...", "..._the acceptable year_ of the Lord.\" See Kaye's \"Clement of Alexandria,\" p. 347.

According to Malto Brun (\"Universal Geography,\" book xxii.), \"the _mean duration_ of human life is between thirty and forty years,\" and, in the same chapter, he computes it at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years.

Amongst those in high command there were few who, like Cromwell, had passed middle age. Fairfax was but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years old, and most of his colonels were even younger.

The science of Comparative Philology, one of the great triumphs of modern scholarship, has enabled us now, for the first time, to answer this question. What no Greek knew, what neither Herodotus, Plato, nor Aristotle could tell us, we are now able to state with certainty. The Greek language, both in its grammar and its vocabulary, belongs to the family of Indo-European languages, of which the Sanskrit is the elder sister. Out of eleven thousand six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> Greek words, some two thousand are found to be Sanskrit, and three thousand more to belong to other branches of the Indo-European tongues. As the words common to the Greek and the Sanskrit must have been in use by both races before their separation, while living together in Central Asia, we have a clew to the degree of civilization attained by the Greeks before they arrived in Europe. Thus it appears that they brought from Asia a familiarity with oxen and cows, horses,...", "...majorities, and Mr. Gladstone protested against the constant renewal of uneasiness in the country by successive motions of this kind in Parliament.

He describes one of them as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> feet high, composed of a pedestal, ten high and fifteen square, surmounted with a tall cylindrical stone, and capped with another in the form of a _pyramid_.

In addition, our banks have over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> billions of deposits, and all these are supposed to be secured by gold; in addition, there are twenty-five billions of government bonds, and uncounted billions of private notes, bonds and accounts, all supposed to be payable in gold. So it appears that about one per cent of our outstanding money is real, and the rest is imaginary--that is, it is credit. The point for you to get clear is this: The great mass of this imaginary money is created by law, and we have the...", "...calls itself orthodoxy manages to do so. Does the self-limitation of Jesus mean that the Deity was lessened in any way during the incarnation? Why, of course not, we should all say; the Deity continued with infinite fulness unimpaired above and beyond the consciousness of Jesus. Then are we to understand that this self-limitation of Jesus meant that the eternal Son, or second person in the Trinity, the Word by whom the worlds were made, quitted the throne of His glory and lived for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years as a Jewish peasant? I think the dogmatic theologian would have some hesitation in giving an unqualified affirmative to this question, for the difficulties implied in it are practically insurmountable. Was the full consciousness of the eternal Word present in the babe of Bethlehem, for instance? If not, where was it? Questions like these cannot be answered on the lines of the conventional Christology. The plain and simple answer to all of them is to admit that...", "...them. Even in Leipzig, where I played the 'Carnival' at my second Gewandhaus concert, I did not obtain my customary applause. Musicians, even those who claimed to be connoisseurs also, carried too thick a mask over their ears to be able to comprehend that charming 'Carnival,' harmoniously framed as it is, and ornamented with such rich variety of artistic fancy. I did not doubt, however, but that this work would eventually win its place in general appreciation beside Beethoven's <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> variations on a theme by Diabelli (which work it surpasses, according to my opinion, in melody, richness, and inventiveness).\" Both as a composer and writer on music, Schumann embodied his deep detestation of the Philistinism and commonplace which stupefied the current opinions of the time, and he represented in Germany the same battle of the romantic in art against what was known as the classical which had been carried on so fiercely in France by Berlioz, Liszt, and...", "...67 9.

In the next four birds, including the Silk hen, which is incapable of flight, we see that the wings, relatively to the legs, are slightly increased in weight; but it should be observed that, if in these birds the legs had become from any cause reduced in weight, this would give the false appearance of the wings having increased in relative weight. Now a reduction of this nature has certainly occurred with the Burmese Jumper, in...", "...the bridge with evident satisfaction. \"Atween yesterday and the day,\" he reported to Jamie, in the afternoon, \"aucht and twenty scholars hae passed, no including the Professor, and there's fower expected by the next train; they'll just be in time,\" which they were, to everybody's delight. \"It's a gude thing, Hillocks,\" said Jamie, \"that bridge was mended; there's been fifty degrees gane over it the day, Hillocks! to say naithin' o' a wecht o' knowledge.\" The Doctor had them all, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> University men, with Domsie and Carmichael and Weelum MacLure, as good a graduate as any man, to dinner, and for that end had his barn wonderfully prepared.

The Government, that is, the aristocracy of lawyers and bankers who represent the country to-day, just as the priests used to do in the time of the monarchy, has felt the necessity of mystifying the worthy people of France with a few new words and old ideas, like philosophers of every school, and all strong intellects ever since time began.

The history of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years following 1815 may, so far as Switzerland is concerned, be summed up in this description--it was a protest, latent at first and afterwards open and declared, of the Swiss people against the decrees of the Vienna Congress, which tended to stop the wheel of progress. The Swiss struggled onwards through the conflicts of political development, and battled against all that was a hindrance to them in the constitution of 1815, the Powers looking on with misgiving if not...", "...and what is ours is his, of course; for instance, the India Stock, which poor Uncle James left, that now stands in the Colonel's name.

It would be quite impossible to kill any one of these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> true representatives of each kind, however much a man might try. Nevertheless, if an Iban kills an omen-bird by mistake, he wraps it in a piece of cloth and buries it carefully in the earth, and with it he buries rice and flesh and money, entreating it not to be vexed and to forgive him, because it was all an accident. He then goes home and will speak to no one on the way, and stays in the house for the rest of that day at least. The Ibans read omens not only from the...", "...it my humble apologies.

The time for the steamer to make the journey from Come-by-Chance to St. Antoine is from four to five days, but when there is much ice these days have been known to stretch to a month. The distance in mileage is under three hundred, but because of the many harbours into which the boat has to put to land supplies, it is really a much greater distance. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> ports of call between St. John's and St. Antoine, most of which are tiny fishing settlements consisting of a few wooden houses at the water's edge.

As soon as James II. came to the throne, the interest of English Churchmen in the Brethren appears to have waned, and neither William III. nor Queen Anne took any steps on their behalf. And yet the connection of the Brethren with England was not entirely broken. The bond of union was Daniel Ernest Jablonsky. He was Amos Comenius's grandson. In 1680 he came to England; he studied three years at Oxford, and finally received the degree of D.D.

You are informed that the X brothers \"own thirty-three plantations,\" which probably means <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> different large farms, ranging from two hundred to two thousand acres each. Three to five thousand acres of land under cultivation is as large a body of land as seems advantageous to handle together.

Only a very few...", "...with the potassic permanganate test the same as if no strychnine was present. \"A solution of 1 mgrm. of morphine sulphate, treated as above, with a solution of 0.1 mgrm. strychnine, offered positive proof of the presence of the latter.\"[448] [448] Flueckiger's _Reactions_, translated by Nagelvoort, Detroit, 1893. Dragendorff was able to render evident .025 mgrm. mixed with twenty times its weight of quin. sulphate; the same observer likewise recognised .04 mgrm. of strychnine in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> times its weight of caffeine. Veratrine is likewise not injurious. =The physiological test= consists in administering the substance to some small animal (preferably to a frog), and inducing the ordinary tetanic symptoms. It may be at once observed that if definite chemical evidence of strychnine has been obtained, the physiological test is quite unnecessary; and, on the other hand, should the application of a liquid or substance to a frog induce tetanus, while chemical...", "...type of English characteristic of the translations now on the market. \"And what book would be your choice?\" \"There is one book that Luther himself likes better than any other. Let us begin with that: his Commentary on Galatians...\" The undertaking, which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task, proved a most difficult one, and at times became oppressive. The Letter to the Galatians consists of six short chapters. Luther's commentary fills seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> octavo pages in the Weidman Edition of his works. It was written in Latin. We were resolved not to present this entire mass of exegesis. It would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages, ordinary octavo (like this), since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic of Latin, and particularly of Luther's Latin. The work had to be condensed. German and English translations are available, but the most acceptable English version,...", "...when she's tired out with Aunt Charlotte. You insult her religion. You say the beastliest things you can think of--\" Her father pushed back his chair; they rose and looked at each other. \"You wouldn't dare to do it if Mark was here!\" He strode to the door and opened it. His arm made a crescent gesture that cleared space of her. \"Go! Go upstairs. Go to bed!\" \"I don't care where I go now I've said it.\" Upstairs in her bed she still heard Aunt Lavvy's breaking voice: \"For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years--for thirty-three years--\" The scene rose again and swam before her and fell to pieces. Ideas--echoes--images. Religion--the truth of God. Her father's voice booming over the table. Aunt Lavvy's voice, breaking--breaking. A pile of stripped chicken bones on her father's plate. V. Aunt Lavvy was getting ready to go away. She held up her night gown to her chin, smoothing and folding back the sleeves. You thought of her going to bed in the ugly, yellow, flannel...", "...so many of the introductory pages of Lovelace's _Lucasta_ occasionally enlivened the solitude and relieved the distress of the poet whose praises they had once sung with so much vigour. As Marvell was undoubtedly a friendly man, and one who loved to be alone with his friends, and had never any house of his own to keep up, living for the most part in hired lodgings, it would be unkind to doubt that he at least did not forget Lovelace in his poverty and depression of spirit. In 1649 <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> poets combined to weep over the early grave of the Lord Henry Hastings, the eldest son of the sixth Earl of Huntingdon, who died of the smallpox in the twentieth year of his age. Not even this plentiful discharge of poets' tears should rob the young nobleman of his claim to be regarded as a fine example of the great learning, accomplishments, and high spirits of the age. We can still produce the thirty-three poets, but what young nobleman is there who can boast such...", "...half has not been told to me. Happy are thy servants who stand before thee continually to listen to thy words of wisdom. Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath placed thee on a throne to rule righteously and in justice.' When other kingdoms heard the words of the Queen of Sheba, they feared Solomon exceedingly, and he became greater than all the other kings of the earth in wisdom and in wealth. Solomon was born in the year 2912 A.M., and reigned over Israel forty years. Four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years elapsed between the date of Solomon's reign and that of the Temple's destruction.\" (From Polano's translation of selections from the Talmud.) =Sonnet=:[6]-- \"Eyes, calm beside thee, (Lady could'st thou know!) May turn away thick with fast-gathering tears: I glance not where all gaze: thrilling and low Their passionate praises reach thee--my cheek wears Alone no wonder when thou passest by; Thy tremulous lids bent and suffused...", "...Titus, bishop, and left him there to finish the work which he had begun. Afterwards the Apostle, on a journey to Nicopolis, a city of Macedonia, wrote this Epistle to Titus, in which he directs him to ordain bishops and priests for the different cities, shewing him the principal qualities necessary for a bishop. He also gives him particular advice for his own conduct to his flock, exhorting him to hold to strictness of discipline, but seasoned with lenity. It was written about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years after our Lord's Ascension. Titus Chapter 1 What kind of men he is to ordain priests. Some men are to be sharply rebuked. 1:1. Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness: 1:2.

But hath in due times manifested his word...", "...ones they didn't always fit, so this little sewing machine that went to war came in very handy. Sometimes the owner would rip off the collar or rip out the sleeves, or almost rip up the whole coat and with her mouthful of pins skillfully put it together again until it looked as if it belonged to the laddie who owned it. Then with some clever chalk marks replacing the pins she would run it through her little machine, and off went another boy well-clothed. One week she altered more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> coats in this way. The soldiers called her \"mother\" and loved to sit about and talk with her while she worked. The men went in battalions to the Luneville Sector for Trench Training facing the enemy. Of course, the Salvation Army sent a detachment also. Over here they had to give up huts. No huts at all were allowed so near the front. No light of fire or even stove, no lights of any kind or everything would be destroyed by shell fire at once. An order went out that...", "...one morning, she astonished and alarmed the Marquis and Lestoc by sending, without any previous warning, for the Princess Elizabeth, and by addressing a series of searching questions to her at a private interview. Fortunately for the success of the plot, the daughter of Peter the Great was more than a match for the Duchess Regent. From first to last Elizabeth proved herself equal to the dangerous situation in which she was placed. The Duchess discovered nothing; and the heads of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> conspirators remained safe on their shoulders. This piece of good fortune operated on the cunning and resolute Lestoc as a warning to make haste. Between the danger of waiting to mature the conspiracy, and the risk of letting it break out abruptly before the organisation of it was complete, he chose the latter alternative. The Marquis agreed with him that it was best to venture everything, before there was time for the suspicions of the Duchess to be renewed; and the...", "...and in 1839 they endeavoured, though in vain, to establish a new congregation at Horton, Bradford. In comparison with the number of societies abandoned, the number of new congregations was infinitesimal. The same tale is told by their statistical returns. In 1824 they had 2,596 communicant members; in 1834, 2,698; in 1850, 2,838; and, in 1857, 2,978; and thus we have the startling fact that, in spite of their efforts at church extension, they had not gained four hundred members in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> years. For this slowness, however, the reasons were purely mechanical; and all the obstacles sprang from the Brethren's connection with Germany. First, we have the persistent use of the Lot. For some years the English Brethren adhered to the custom of enforcing its use in marriages; and even when it was abolished in marriages they still used it in applications for membership. No man could be a member of the Moravian Church without the consent of the Lot; and this rule...", "...in Leipzig in the year 1840. [45] \"Gott in der Geschichte,\" III. [46] It is found complete in its original form in Horst's \"Demonomagie,\" II. [47] Many etymologies as profound occur in the \"Witch-hammer.\" The word _diabolus_ (devil) is derived from _duo_, \"two,\" and _bolus_, \"morsel,\" which is thus explained, that the devil fishes at the same time after two morsels, the soul and the body. [48] This deduction, replete with indecencies which can not be handled, occupies <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-three</span> pages of the \"Witch-hammer.\" It pretends to be very convincing. It has also sent women by hundreds of thousands to death. [49] To give the reader a clearer idea of the really diabolical blindness and brutality which characterizes the terrible book we are giving an account of, we quote the following statement from the \"Witch-hammer,\" p. 223: \"We (the inquisitors Sprenger and his colleagues) find that of all women that we have condemned to the flames very few have..."]
