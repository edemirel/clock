They condensed the name and authority of the senate in a single magistrate, or two colleagues; and as they were changed at the end of a year, or of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months, the greatness of the trust was compensated by the shortness of the term. But in this transient reign, the senators of Rome indulged their avarice and ambition: their justice was perverted by the interest of their family and faction; and as they punished only their enemies, they were obeyed only by their adherents.

Around each was a small row of pearls, which reached nearly to the bell below, thus forming a jewel resembling very many drops of pearls. It is the most beautiful jewel that I ever saw. In the right side of her nose was a white stone, set with gold, in the shape of a star. From it hung a large pearl. There was a hole bored in the partition between the nostrils. This hole had a jewel in it, about an inch in length, in the middle of which was a...", "...the diamond, though, as before said, all such hits should be attended to by the pitcher. For a batter who hits along the foul-line, he will play nearer his base, and for one who invariably hits toward right-field, he will move around toward second base, going, in some instances, even as far as the short-stop's regular position. For left-hand hitters he will generally have to play nearer the bat, because these players always get to first quicker than right-hand batters. They are five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet nearer first base, and by the swing of the bat they get a much quicker start. If there is a runner on third and not more than one out, he will have to play near the base before the ball is pitched, the object being to give the runner as little start as possible, so that he cannot score on a sacrifice hit. When the ball is pitched the baseman runs off to his proper position, unless, of course, he has received a signal from the catcher to expect a throw. The third baseman...", "...gentlemen, belonging to my brother, and that, notwithstanding he wore no sword, having been lately wounded in the right arm, his presence was sufficient to inspire the rest with courage. In order, therefore, to make sure work, they resolved on attacking him with two or three hundred men, thinking that night would throw a veil over the disgrace of such an assassination. Le Guast, who commanded a regiment of guards, furnished the requisite number of men, whom he disposed in five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> divisions, in the street through which he was to pass. Their orders were to put out the torches and flambeaux, and then to fire their pieces, after which they were to charge his company, observing particularly to attack one who had his right arm slung in a scarf. Fortunately they escaped the intended massacre, and, fighting their way through, reached Bussi's lodgings, one gentleman only being killed, who was particularly attached to M. de Bussi, and who was probably mistaken...", "...that make us a great deal of trouble are their daily food. Some of the things they are fond of are little animals, like mice and ground squirrels, that eat our crops. Others are insects which spoil our fruit and eat up our vegetables, cankerworms and cutworms, and a hundred more. Besides these, many birds eat the seeds of certain weeds that farmers have to fight all the time. One reason this helps us so greatly is that birds eat much more for their size than we do. A boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight years could not possibly eat a whole sheep in one day, but a young bird can easily eat more than his own weight every day. They want more than three meals too. They need to eat very often. One catbird will take thirty grasshoppers for his breakfast, and in a few hours he will want thirty more.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years we find him studying--\"as hard as anybody,\" in his opinion; but not again is ill-health to drive him home, though always hovering at his elbow. Let us take glimpses, here and there, at these years, with the happy privilege of the reader, of attending the school of his hero without being compelled to study his hero's lessons. At the close of his full year he goes back to May's Lick. To rest? Yes, if to do what lies closest to the heart is rest. He borrows a horse, gets his...", "...spearmen, starting immediately after the full moon, had marched the hundred and fifty miles between Athens and Sparta in the wonderfully short time of three days. Though too late to share in the glory of the action, they requested to be allowed to march to the battle-field to behold the Medes. They proceeded thither, gazed on the dead bodies of the invaders, and then, praising the Athenians and what they had done, they returned to Lacedaemon. The number of the Persian dead was <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand four hundred; of the Athenians, a hundred and ninety-two. The number of Plataeans who fell is not mentioned, but as they fought in the part of the army which was not broken, it cannot have been large. The apparent disproportion between the losses of the two armies is not surprising, when we remember the armour of the Greek spearmen, and the impossibility of heavy slaughter being inflicted by sword or lance on troops so armed, as long as they kept firm in their ranks....", "...\"What's it worth?\" asked Mr. Latham. \"Approximately, I mean?\" \"We know the color is perfect,\" explained Mr. Czenki precisely. \"If, in addition, the cutting is perfect, and the depth is right, and the weight is six carats or a fraction more, it's worth--in other words, if that is the most perfect specimen in existence, as it seems to be, it's worth whatever you might choose to demand for it--twenty, twenty-five, thirty thousand dollars. With this color, and assuming it to be <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> carats, even if _badly_ cut, it would be worth ten or twelve thousand.\" Mr. Latham mopped his brow. And this had come by mail, unregistered! \"It would not be possible to say where--where such a stone came from--what country?\" Mr. Latham inquired curiously. \"What's your opinion?\" The expert shook his head. \"If I had to guess I should say Brazil, of course,\" he replied; \"but that would be merely because the most perfect blue-white diamonds come from Brazil.

On Saturday last, 28th, fell <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight inches more, so that we had a foot depth of snow, cold weather, and, of course, good sleighing. The vice-president having, with great judgment and science, calculated the gradations of cold in different latitudes, discovered that for every degree he should go north he might count on _four and a half inches_ of snow. Thus he was sure of _sixteen and a half_ inches at Philadelphia; _twenty-one inches_ at New-York, and so for all the intermediate space. Hence he wisely...", "...in the neighborhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia; and his flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as the Hellespont and the Black Sea.

Since the captivity of Romanus, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled under the weight of the Imperial crown, till the provinces of the East and West were lost in the same month by a double rebellion: of either chief Nicephorus was the common name; but the surnames of Bryennius and Botoniates distinguish the European and Asiatic candidates.

They've come as far as Anglebury today.\" The voice seemed to proceed from the belly of the cow called Cherry, but the speaker was a milking-woman, whose face was buried in the flank of that motionless beast. \"Hav' anybody seen her?\" said another. There was a negative response from...", "...gray jerkins--bareheaded too, since on mounting the rise above the valley-fog we had done off our morions (for fear of the moonlight) and hidden them in a furze-brake, where belike next summer the heather-bees found and made hives of them. Fog, rolling up from the sea--seven or eight miles away--filled all the valley below us: and this fog was the reason of our riding. For the valley formed the neck of a trap in which the King held our general with two thousand five hundred horse, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand infantry, and I know not how many guns. His own artillery lined the heights under which we rode--that is, to left or east of the river; he had pushed across a couple of batteries to the opposite hills, and between them easily commanded the valley. It was just the ease of it that made him careless and gave us our chance. He had withdrawn the better part of his horse to the coast, to make a display against our scattered base; and our general, aware of this, was even...", "...foremost man carrying a pile of plates, and after him came another with a basket of knives, after him another with a basket of forks, then another with spoons, and so on, each man carrying a supply of some one article for the table.

And this mark of degradation was renewed, and again impressed upon the race, in the careful and deliberate preparation of their revised code published in 1836. This code forbids any person from joining in marriage any white person with any Indian, negro, or mulatto, and subjects the party who shall offend in this respect, to imprisonment, not exceeding <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months, in the common jail, or to hard labor, and to a fine of not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars; and, like the law of 1786, it declares the marriage to be absolutely null and void. It will be seen that the punishment is increased by the code upon the person who shall marry them, by adding imprisonment to a pecuniary penalty. So, too, in Connecticut.

'Niece!' said I; 'why, there can't be more than five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years between you.' 'About that, I suppose,' said he; 'my half-sister, her mother, was more than twenty years older than I at the time of my birth.'

For, employing objects in movements is adding the aid of objects to whatever aid there is in making the movements. Turning to the results, we consider the _C_ set by itself with reference to the effect of the use of objects vs. images in general. The summary from Table IV. shows that under the conditions given, after intervals of from slightly less than one day to two days, five of the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> subjects recall object couplets better than noun couplets. One subject, _M_ recalls noun couplets better. It also shows that under the conditions and after the intervals mentioned all six subjects recall movement couplets better than verb couplets.

With respect to the second of these, viz., revolving the spindles and thus winding the threads upon them, it may be said this action causes what is termed the \"Winding Chain\" to pull off a small drum of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> inches diameter, thus rotating the latter and thereby the spindles. Here, however, comes in now the action of the very beautiful and effective piece of mechanism, \"Roberts' quadrant\" (see Fig. 26).

The six pieces--only between <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> and seven hundred lines in all--were at once recognised as showing a refined and uncommon literary gift.

But in a new and favored country like America, a high rate of interest is a strong stimulus to saving. Again, interest may fall while saving continues at the same or a greater pace. Ordinarily a fall from <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> per cent. to five, giving men a smaller motive for abstinence, would be expected to cause less saving, yet this is not always the case. Custom and example help to fix a habit of saving in individuals and cause them to continue saving at a lower rate of interest. With the growth of wealth, the prevailing ideas as to the amount needed for a competence change, impelling to greater saving. The tendency, however, of a fall in the rate of interest is to weaken, and that of a rise of the...", "...sandstone, and shale. \"Coal containing but little bituminous matter occurs in in beds in the sandstone.

The cost of maintaining a land army of even a hundred thousand men, and a naval force to correspond, would have been, in simple money value, only a tithe of what the rebellion has cost the nation, to say nothing of the valuable lives that have been sacrificed for the losses on the rebel side, as well as those on the side of the government, are equally to be counted. The actual losses to the country have been not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight thousand millions of dollars, or nearly one-half the assessed value of the whole property of the United States according to the census returns of 1860, and which has only been partially cancelled by actual increase of property since.

Of course all the cattle herds had more or less strays among them, so it was easier to cut out one of these than to argue the matter. There was plenty of herds on the trail then, so this band of Indians got bolder than bandits. In the year I'm speaking of, I went up with a herd of horses belonging to a Texas man, who was in charge with us. When we came along with our horses--only <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> men all told--the chief of the band, called Running Bull Sheep, got on the bluff bigger than a wolf and demanded six horses. Well, that Texan wasn't looking for any particular Injun that day to give six of his own dear horses to. So we just drove on, paying no attention to Mr. Bull Sheep. About half a mile farther up the trail, the chief overtook us with all his bucks, and they were an ugly looking lot.

However, even after discounting these and possibly other instances, a significant array of conjectures remains. Still, it is not fair to call the Parisinus Aldus's _only_ manuscript. We know that he had other material in the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> volumes of manuscripts and collated editions sent him by Giocondo, as well as the latter's copy of _P_. There could hardly have been in this number a source superior to the Parisinus, but Giocondo may have added here and there his own or others' conjectures, which Aldus adopted unwisely, but at least not solely on his own authority; the most apparent case of interpolation (224, 8) Keil thought might have been a conjecture of Giocondo's.

To the same use I would pray you to apply twenty-five guineas, which I have lent the two Mr. Fitz-hughs of Marmion, and which I have desired them to repay into your hands.

He began whipsawing lumber, but after disablement from a gunpowder explosion he found lighter employment in keeping a billiard room. He then set out westward again, breaking a road for his wagon as he went.

When the town of Columbus, Mississippi, was founded nearby in 1819 he sawed boards to build a house on speculation. From this he was diverted to the Indian trade, bartering whiskey, cloth and miscellaneous goods for peltries. He then became a justice of the peace and school commissioner at Columbus, surveyed and sold town lots on public account, and built two school houses with the proceeds. He then moved up the river to engage anew in the Indian trade with a partner who...", "...into our valley; he would then find his way parallel with the stream direct to our camp.

Nearly an hour passed away without any further sign. Bill could not have fired those <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> shots in succession to attract our attention, as it would have been a needless waste of ammunition: if he had expected a response to a signal, he would have fired a single shot, to be followed by another some minutes later.

The fins are also a source of gelatine. The Tope is a small shark found in tropical and temperate seas. It averages about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet in length.

As you may suppose, the news brought everybody upon deck, and when almost immediately afterwards a string of other pieces, glittering...", "...of three weeks our course was set for Bergen, where we changed the oil for refined paraffin, and at the same time had the motor thoroughly overhauled. Since then there has never been anything wrong with the engine. From Bergen we went to Christiansand, where the Fram was docked, and, as already mentioned, the remaining outfit, with the dogs and dog-food, was taken on board. The number of living creatures on board when we left Norway was nineteen men, ninety-seven dogs, four pigs, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> carrier pigeons, and one canary. At last we were ready to leave Christiansand on Thursday, August 9, 1910, and at nine o'clock that evening the anchor was got up and the motor started. After the busy time we had had, no doubt we were all glad to get off. As our departure had not been made public, only the pilot and a few acquaintances accompanied us a little way out. It was glorious weather, and everyone stayed on deck till far into the light night, watching the land slowly...", "...inside without warning,\" he said. \"That's why I turned on the searchlight. I cannot see a soul aboard the trawler. Can you?\" \"Not I,\" answered Bob. \"Nor I.\" \"Nor I.\" \"Well, I'm going to board her. We'll soon find out how matters stand.\" The Sub Chaser's speed slackened at a signal once more, and she slipped alongside the trawler. A rope ladder dangled down the side. \"Fend off, you men, and hold your position,\" said the young naval officer resolutely. \"I'm going aboard. Do <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of you follow me.\" Seizing the ladder, he clambered up swiftly, revolver in hand, peered over the edge, then swung over the rail and dropped to the trawler's deck. \"All right,\" he called down. \"Not a soul in sight.\" Eager to be at his heels, the three chums held back until the six sailors commanded to follow had complied. Then they, too, gained the deck of the trawler. Hurried search revealed the craft was deserted. Not even a watchman had been left aboard. The doors to the...", "...if very forcibly asked for, but then in too small quantities to be satisfactory to an American, who is accustomed to taking his drinks ice cold.

Brandy is three pence, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> cents of our Bird of Freedom money, and when the amount is considered, your three pence buys about the same as twelve and one-half cents in New York. Malt liquors are about the same. The glass is a trifle smaller, and the regular price at the small publics is two pence, an equivalent, quantity considered, of five cents. The quality of malt liquors is a long way below the American article, and America, singular as it may seem, drinks better English ale than the Englishman does....", "...in diameter. These rings appear very ancient, and are believed to be contemporaneous with the Druidical stones. Castings ejected within these circular spaces, if blown to the north-east by south-west winds would form a layer of mould within the trench, thicker on the north-eastern than on any other side. But the site was not favourable for the action of worms, for the mould over the surrounding Chalk formation with flints, was only 3.37 inches in thickness, from a mean of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> observations made at a distance of 10 yards outside the embankment. The thickness of the mould within two of the circular trenches was measured every 5 yards all round, on the inner sides near the bottom. My son Horace protracted these measurements on paper; and though the curved line representing the thickness of the mould was extremely irregular, yet in both diagrams it could be seen to be thicker on the north-eastern side than elsewhere.

The third magistrate saw his way to impressing himself,--\"Make it six months,\" he said. The Chairman agreed with him, until Colonel Vero said, \"I should give him a year.\" That shocked him. \"It'll take a long time for it to blow over, you know,\" he whispered to Fortnaby, who smiled and shrugged. \"I don't suppose <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> will hurt him.

He was such a very valuable piece of property, and had become so absolutely necessary to the planter to whom he was hired, that he determined to buy him at any cost. His old master held him proportionately high. But by paying one thousand dollars down, and promising to pay another thousand in a certain time, the purchase was made, and this chattel passed over into the hands of a new...", "...burning sticks and drag it away to play with. On two occasions he had narrowly avoided setting fire to the hut by this means. On the present occasion, no sooner had his mother left him to himself upon the ground, than he seized from the fire an attractive brand, one end of which was glowing charcoal, and turned to investigate the bright-coloured print which was close at hand. Madilenda returned with the water, and saw, to her horror, that Tobe had laid the fire-stick on the print, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven folds of which had been already burnt through. She snatched away the firebrand, and quenched the burning material with the water which she had brought for Mamagobatyana. The dress, of course, was completely ruined.

Anyhow, she had sinned--some of us do now and then--and her family and friends, naturally shocked and indignant, had closed their doors against her.

For a while she had kept both herself and the child on the twelve shillings a week that twelve hours' drudgery a day procured her, paying <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> shillings out of it for the child, and keeping her own body and soul together on the remainder. Six shillings a week does not keep body and soul together very unitedly.

I need joy almost as much as love; and who will give me joy if you do not?\" CHAPTER XXVII THE PRIMROSE PATH After her return to Paris, for <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks Therese lived in the ardent half sleep of happiness, and prolonged delightfully her thoughtless dream. She went to see Jacques every day in the little house shaded by a tree; and when they had at last parted at night, she took away with her adored reminiscences. They had the same tastes; they yielded to the same fantasies. The same capricious thoughts carried them away. They found pleasure in running to the suburbs that border the city, the streets where the wine-shops are...", "...command of Justinian served you in good stead; Veranilda would not otherwise have escaped so easily. Chorsoman, fat-witted as he is, willingly believed that Veranilda and Aurelia, and you yourself, were all in my net--which means the net of Bessas, whom he fears. Do you also believe it, my good Basil?' For answer Basil embraced his friend, and kissed him on either cheek. 'I know how this has come about,' he said; and thereupon related the story of the visit of Olybrius to Aurelia <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months ago. It seemed probable that a report of Veranilda's beauty had reached Matasuntha, who wished to adorn her retinue with so fair a remnant of the Amal race. How, he went on to ask, would Marcian excuse himself at Rome for his failure to perform this office? 'Leave that to my ingenuity,' was the reply. 'Enough for you to dare defiance of the Emperor's will.' Basil made a scornful gesture, which his friend noted with the same melancholy smile. 'You have no misgiving?'...", "...and] hippopotami, but nevertheless Ra-Heru-Khuti sailed over the waters in his boat, and when the crocodiles and the hippopotami had come nigh unto him, they opened wide their jaws in order to destroy Ra-Heru-Khuti.

From there we cut into the railway, and crossed it at Vredefort, passing through the main body of the advance in doing so.

In this country one can often see thirty or forty miles, and in that space on the parched, light-coloured ground you may see from some point of vantage five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> separate streams of advance slowly rolling northward, their thin black lines of convoy overhung by a heavy pall of dust. As we closed in and became involved for a moment in the whole mass of the general advance, though accustomed to think no small beer of ourselves as an army, for we number 11,000 men, we realised that we were quite a small fraction of the British force. Endless battalions of infantry, very dusty and grimy, but going light and strong (you soon get into the habit of...", "...forced into one confederation; and witness the attempt by the government, which I have described in another chapter, to take over and make a monopoly of the wholesale and retail oil business of the country.

For a number of years the dye-stuff industry of Germany was practically controlled by <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> great companies, some of these companies employing as high as five hundred chemists in research work. In 1916 these six companies made an agreement looking to a still closer alliance not only for the distribution of the product but also for the distribution of ideas and trade secrets. For years, these great commercial companies supplied all the countries of the world not only with dyestuffs and other chemical products but also with medicines discovered by their chemists and made...", "...A LITTLE WELL, AND YOU DO MUCH.] 2058.

The prospect of being left alone was unendurable to her, for in Montevideo she had no personal friends, while the political friends of her family were all out of the country, or living in very close retirement. Across the water she would be with friends and safe for a season from her dreaded enemy. This proposal seemed a very sensible one, and relieved my mind very much, although it only served to remove my difficulty for a time. In the department of Camelones, about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> leagues from Montevideo, I found the house of a fellow-countryman named Barker, who had lived for many years in the country and had a wife and children. We arrived in the afternoon at his estancia, and, seeing that Demetria was very much knocked up with our long journey, I asked Mr. Barker to give us shelter for the night. Our host was very kind and pleasant with us, asking no disagreeable questions, and after a few hours' acquaintance, which made us quite intimate, I took him...", "...It's very nice of you to live with me in a dream, and to love me, and so on; but I can't help my husband having disagreeable relatives, can I?

Now if you only knew the least little thing about the world, Henry, you'd know that in a large family, though the sisters quarrel with one another like mad all the time, yet let one of the brothers marry, and they all turn on their unfortunate sister-in-law and devote the rest of their lives with perfect unanimity to persuading him that his wife is unworthy of him. They can do it to her very face without her...", "...I made my way to the Bourne Path, thinking it hardly possible that in the face of yesterday's events Frances could have gone to meet Hamilton. Still one can never tell; therefore I took the benefit of the doubt and set forth to make sure. When perhaps two miles from Sundridge, the day being warm, I climbed to a ledge of rock on the shelving bank of the bourne, twelve or fifteen feet above the path, and sat down to rest in the cool shade of a clump of bushes. Below me, perhaps five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet above the path and far enough back among the bushes to be hidden from passers-by, was another rocky shelf or bench, admirably fitted to accommodate two persons.

It became necessary instantly to send away the young royal family; and the Chateau de la Muette, in the Bois de Boulogne, was selected for their reception. Their arrival at that residence, which was very near Paris, drew so great a concourse of people into its neighbourhood, that even at daybreak the crowd had begun to assemble round the gates. Shouts of \"Vive le Roi!\" were scarcely interrupted for a moment between <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> o'clock in the morning and sunset. The unpopularity the late King, had drawn upon himself during his latter years, and the hopes to which a new reign gives birth, occasioned these transports of joy. A fashionable jeweller made a fortune by the sale of mourning snuff-boxes, whereon the portrait of the young Queen, in a black frame of shagreen, gave rise to the pun: \"Consolation in chagrin.\" All the fashions, and every article of dress, received names expressing the spirit of the moment....", "...kennel of hounds. \"Sunday, December 23.

All were clad in blue or dark suits, wore flannel shirts, dickeys and no cuffs. They would congregate in noisy groups, talk with furious energy, and smoke Virginia cigarettes with an air of daredevilry. Now and then one of these would be sitting alone, reading unexpected papers such as the _Times_, borrowed from the office. Spasmodically, too, one would be seen improving his mind. Victoria, within <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months, noticed three starts on the part of one of the boys; French, book-keeping and electrical engineering. Many were older than these. There were little groups of young men rather rakishly but shabbily dressed; often they wore a flower in their buttonhole. The old men were more pathetic; their faces were expressionless; they came to eat, not to feast. Victoria and Betty had many conversations about the customers. Every day Victoria felt her faculty of wonder increase; she...", "...The revolution of the sun carries a spot across its face in about fourteen days.

Du Roy's divorce had just been granted. His wife had resumed the name of Forestier, and, as the Walters were to leave on the 15th of July for Trouville, it was decided that he and they should spend a day in the country together before they started. A Thursday was selected, and they started at nine in the morning in a large traveling landau with <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> places, drawn by four horses with postilions. They were going to lunch at the Pavilion Henri-Quatre at Saint Germain. Pretty-boy had asked to be the only man of the party, for he could not endure the presence of the Marquis de Cazolles.

These, again, are for the winter shooting, as it is only their winter coats which have a value. The fox is plentiful.

The flowers come late, but within a month or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks after the bloom appears, the fruit is full grown, but it remains on the tree till autumn. The tree's bark is smooth and very thin. The absence of stripes distinguishes this tree from striped maple, which has nearly the same range.

Four days later, Duke William of Normandy landed in Pevensey Bay, with 60,000 horse and foot. Harold hastened south to meet him with troops exhausted by battle and marching. After halting <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> days in London to collect reinforcements, the English force entrenched itself on the hill of Sautlache and awaited attack. The Normans were unable to penetrate the abattis, but they gained the victory which changed the whole history of the English race by the stratagem of a feigned retreat. Harold's undisciplined auxiliaries, contrary to direct orders (which were obeyed by the \"regular\" troops in the centre), swarmed out of the palisades in pursuit of the fleeing Normans, who...", "...to its kind.

The answer is: \"For the same reason that the elephant has a trunk.\" I trust that a certain rugged pedagogical virtue in this reply may atone for its lack of elegance. The elephant has a trunk, as the insect has <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> legs, for the reason that such is the specific nature of the animal; and we may assert with a degree of probability that amounts to practical certainty that this specific nature is the outcome of a definite evolutionary process, the nature and causes of which it is our tremendous task to determine to such extent as we may be able. But this does not yet touch the most essential side of the problem.

To this prodigious strength, he joins courage, prudence, coolness, and an exact obedience; he preserves moderation even in his most violent passions; he is more constant than impetuous in love: in anger he does not forget his friends; he never attacks any but those who have given him some offence; and he remembers favours as long as injuries.

Every one through whose hands a bill passed lost on that bill what it lost in value, during the time it was in his hands. This was a real tax on him; and in this way, the people of the United States actually contributed those sixty-six millions of dollars during the war, and by a mode of taxation the most oppressive of all, because the...", "...out scouting parties, and roused the country so that in every bit of forest along the road to Princeton there were men, dead shots, to make difficult a British advance to retake Trenton. The reverse had brought consternation at New York. Lord Cornwallis was about to embark for England, the bearer of news of overwhelming victory. Now, instead, he was sent to drive back Washington. It was no easy task for Cornwallis to reach Trenton, for Washington's scouting parties and a force of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred men under Greene were on the road to harass him. On the evening of the 2d of January, however, he reoccupied Trenton. This time Washington had not recrossed the Delaware but had retreated southward and was now entrenched on the southern bank of the little river Assanpink, which flows into the Delaware. Reinforcements were following Cornwallis. That night he sharply cannonaded Washington's position and was as sharply answered. He intended to attack in force in the morning....", "...for one and ninepence; this would leave the same sum to carry me to Hazleton, beyond which my plans did not at present extend.

The improved breeds were warranted to lay five eggs apiece a week; and eggs were worth--that is, _he was paying_--six dollars a dozen. His thousand hens would lay twenty thousand eight hundred and thirty-three dozen eggs per annum, which, at <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> dollars per dozen, would amount to the sum of one hundred and twenty-four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight dollars. Even deducting therefrom the original cost of the hens and their keep,--say thirty-six thousand dollars,--the very pretty trifle of eighty-eight thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight was the remainder--clear profit.

Therefore in determining whether it is your duty to forsake a party which is wrong on some single question you are to decide, first, whether that question is important enough to warrant sacrificing every other measure in which you agree with your party, and having every measure espoused by the other which you think bad enacted if it get control. Second, you have not only in such cases to sacrifice every other thing you think desirable to prevent the one thing you think...", "...ultramontane clergy to everything German has given to the Old Catholic movement for some years past a new impulse and decided advantage.--_In France_ the Abbe Michaud of Paris lashed the characterlessness of the episcopate and was excommunicated, and the Abbes Mouls and Junqua of Bordeaux were ordered by the police to give up wearing the clerical dress.

On top of all, stones are thrown. The bodies of grown persons are stretched out to their full length, but with children the knees are generally drawn up. This is one Way in which the pagan Tarahumares bury their dead.

Every day came news of fire somewhere in the tenement districts of the city, with one or more, perhaps a dozen, roasted to death, or horribly burned.

When the departure of the French fleet was ascertained, Sir Henry Clinton put to sea from New York in December, 1779, for the Savannah River, escorted by Vice-Admiral Arbuthnot. The details of the operations, which were leisurely and methodical, will not be given here; for, although the Navy took an active part in them, they scarcely can be considered of major importance.

Clinton then returned to New York, leaving Lord Cornwallis in command in the south. The latter proposed to remain quiet during the hot months; but the activity of the American partisan troops prevented this, and in July the approach of a small, but relatively formidable force, under General Gates, compelled him to take the field.

His enemies fastened themselves on to each of his legs, but he still fought; a brown ant jumped upon his back and tried to break his brilliant cuirass; another, with his body bent double, covered him with poison. The Hercules still fought. At last, three of the fiercest of the ants worked with their sharp teeth upon the middle of his body, and at last cut him in two. The...", "...but my thoughts.

It is situated about three-fourths of a mile from the banks of the river, and about eighty miles above its junction with Ohio, opposite Cincinnati. A spring here breaks out at the foot of a hill, forming a basin of water about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet in diameter and two feet deep, at the bottom of which issues a stream of gas, which in volume and force is about equal to the blast forced from a common smith's bellows; but there is no cessation of its force, which is such as to create a violent ebullition in the water. Being heavier than common atmospheric air, the gas, on passing up through the water, constantly occupies the surface, which is still the lower part of an indenture in the earth at that place.

At its mouth the Columbia is narrowed to about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> miles in width by cape Disappointment extending in a south west direction far out into the stream, the cape being washed on the west side by the ocean.

The present population of the country is reckoned at a little under eight millions; and in 1806, it seems, from the best authorities we can get, to have been a little under <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> millions. Even this rate of increase, one-third every half-century, is far above the rate of increase since the Conquest; for, at that rate, a population a little over a million and a quarter would have brought up the number to what it is at present, and we cannot at the lowest estimation suppose the inhabitants after the siege of Mexico to have been less than three or four millions.

SPANISH LITERATURE AND ITS DIVISIONS.--At the period of the subversion of the Empire of the West, in the fifth century, Spain was invaded by the Suevi, the Alans, the Vandals, and the Visigoths. The country which had for <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> centuries been subjected to the dominion of the Romans, and had, adopted the language and arts of its masters, now experienced those changes in manners, opinions, military spirit, and language, which took place in the other provinces of the empire, and which, were, in fact, the origin of the nations which arose on the overthrow of the Roman power. Among the conquerors of Spain, the Visigoths were the most numerous; the ancient Roman subjects were speedily confounded with them, and...", "...the ruin brought on by heavy taxes and high prices; no, the family must support itself, or go wholesale to the workhouse. This is one of those clumsy rude modes of proceeding that a wealthy people, not overburthened with knowledge, naturally takes to overcome a difficulty, but without care or tenderness for the feelings of those relieved, or that regard for public interest, which ought to go hand in hand. For this it would be well to search a remedy. A father and mother, and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> children, will cost, at least, fifty pounds a year in a workhouse; but, perhaps, the aid of twelve or fifteen pounds would keep them from going there, and by that means save the greatest part of the money, while the country, which loses their industry, would be doubly a gainer.

It is highly prejudicial to the...", "...there two or three years and in March 1775 we moved down Holstien near the Big Island, [Long Island] where we remained until Sept 1775 when Col Calloway and his company came along going to Kentucky, when my father William Pogue packed up and came with him with our family, Col Boone and with his wife and family and Col Hugh Mcgary, Thomas Denton and Richard Hogan were on the road before us and when we arrived at Boonesborough the latter part of September There was only fur [four] or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> cabbins built along on the Bank of the Kentucky river but not picketted in being open on two sides.\"[8] This was the great pathway of early pioneers to Kentucky, and the course of the marvelous floodtide of immigration which swept over the mountains in the last three decades of the eighteenth century.

This occurred about 9.45 p.m.; and probably about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months before the death of Herod (St. Matthew ii. 15). The total lunar eclipse which occurred on October 4, 1884, was remarkable for the almost total disappearance of the moon during totality.

Amgiad then demanded how far it was to the isle of Ebene? He was answered, four months' voyage by sea, and a year's journey by land. The man he talked to left him hastily, having satisfied him as to these two questions. Amgiad, who had been but <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks coming from the isle of Ebene with his brother Assad, could not comprehend how they had reached this city in so short a time, unless it was by enchantment, or that the way across the mountain was a much shorter one, but not frequented because of its difficulty.

In that extremely long poem in <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> columns of about 360 lines(25) there are no rubrics, which shows at once that it is not a cult song service. Moreover, Dungi had not been deified when the poem was written. It is really an historical poem to this king whose deification had at any rate not yet been recognized at Nippur. It belongs in reality to the same class of literature as the historical poem on his father Ur-Engur, translated on pages 126-136.

The arrival of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> little Dukes was an occasion of anxiety and excitement for us all, and we were much relieved when the event was safely over, and we saw Lady and her beautiful family established in peace and comfort. Matters had run smoothly for about four or five weeks, when one day I was startled by a series of sharp yelps, which I knew came from Lady. I ran to the window, and saw the poor creature rolling in the middle of the street, in the greatest pain.

Incidentally we might note that there were two other such divisions in the state. Under the circumstances the 1st and 2d Battalions of Artillery added to their already creditable reputation and presented a fine appearance. There were five companies in the two battalions, each consisting of a captain, two lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, six gunners, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> bombardiers, one drummer, one fifer, and sixty-four privates or \"matrosses.\" Part of each company was armed, equipped and drilled as infantry; but each company proudly exhibited two bronze six-pounder cannon with limbers, and a single caisson. The ordnance had increased in caliber since 1784, the change being made in 1840. The state prescribed by law what manner of uniform the artillery companies should wear.

Yet this region lies in the same latitude with Scotland, York Factory being on the parallel of 57 degrees north, which passes close to Aberdeen!

The planet was consequently not to be seen at that time except faintly in the twilight. But on the 21st of October the sun set in the latitude of Ellisland at 4h 53m, and Venus 1h 3m afterwards.

This magnificent building stands immediately upon the bank, one hundred and twenty feet above the river. _It is seven hundred and fifty feet in length, and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred feet broad!_ Stone steps conduct from the base of the rock on which it is situated to an elevation, from which others descend to a large square, in the interior of the building.

If this were done he would guarantee that the towing craft should have <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hours in which to get away. When this letter was read on board the repeller it created considerable merriment, and an answer was sent back that no conditions but those of absolute surrender could be received from the British ship.

The game then begins by the player next the dealer leading a card, the others following suit, the highest card taking the trick, and so on until the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> tricks have been won. When the six tricks are played, the points are taken for High, Low, Jack, and Game. Should no player have either a court card or a ten, the player next to the dealer scores the point for the game.

Suddenly Mr. Loring dropped his instrument and in a tone of terror exclaimed: \"Look at that bear.\" I looked as he pointed in the direction of a large rock, and there were three huge grizzly bears. Loring, being longer legged than I, left me like a shot from a gun. I ran to a tree, near by, from four to <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet in circumference, and very speedily found myself perched among its branches. I looked for the bears.

Taking Rucker and Thorpe's nine districts, and the magnetic data found for the nine imaginary central stations, they employed these to determine the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> constants of Liznar's formula.

Such considerations need not interfere with our enjoyment of the poetry, for the author's imagination may have made a poetical fancy seem real to him as he wrote; but they certainly do not lessen our doubts in regard to the value of the sonnets as autobiography. The majority of the sonnets, at least, cannot be said to throw any light on Shakespeare's life. There are, however, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> sonnets, connected with each other in subject, which, more definitely than any of {69} the others, shadow forth a real event in the poet's life. These are numbers XL, XLI, XLII, CXXXIII, CXXXIV, CXLIV. They seem to show that a woman whom the poet loved had forsaken him for the man to whom the sonnets are written; and that the poet submits to this, owing to his deep friendship for the man. Two of these sonnets are given below. SONNET CXLIV \"Two loves I have of comfort...", "...work in the morning.

He had sunk or burned thirteen and captured thirty-one ships with his seven, and all the piled-up munitions of war were in his hands. King Charles gave up the siege, marched his army out of Norway, and the country was saved. The victory cost Tordenskjold but nineteen killed and fifty-seven wounded. On his own ship <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> men were killed and twenty wounded. Of infinite variety was this sea-fighter. After a victory like this, one hears of him in the next breath gratifying a passing whim of the King, who wanted to know what the Swedish people thought of their Government after Charles's long wars that are said to have cost their country a million men.

The talk passed from the boomerang to dreams--usually a fruitful subject, afloat or ashore--but this time the output was poor.

One of the most striking of the stories told was furnished by a gentleman who had served on the staff of the Viceroy of India. He read the details from his note-book, and explained that he had written them down, right after the consummation of the incident which they described, because he thought that if he did not put them down in black and white he might presently come to think he had...", "...Obj. 3: Although the intellective power is not the act of a body, nevertheless the essence of the human soul, which is the form of the body, requires that it should be more noble, in order that it may have the power of understanding; and hence it is necessary that a better disposed body should correspond to it. _______________________ QUESTION 6 OF THE ORDER OF ASSUMPTION (In Six Articles) We must now consider the order of the foregoing assumption, and under this head there are <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> points of inquiry: (1) Whether the Son of God assumed flesh through the medium of the soul?

The first passenger train arrived the next day. In the winter of 1868 Cheyenne contained not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand inhabitants.

Later tradition indeed supplements it with legendary matter, but it is impossible to say what substratum of fact, if any, underlies these comparatively recent stories.

Gaul was indebted for her earliest civilization to her Greek settlements like Marseilles, which had been colonized from Asia Minor some <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> centuries before the Christian era; and close relations appear to have been maintained even to the latest times. During the Roman period the people of Marseilles still spoke the Greek language familiarly along with the vernacular Celtic of the native population and the official Latin of the dominant power [252:1]. When therefore Christianity had established her head-quarters in Asia Minor, it was not unnatural that the Gospel should flow in the same channels which had already...", "...in the plans of the harbours on this coast by Captain Owen; and an excellent description is given of them by Mr. Taylor (Loudon's \"Mag. of Nat.

To shoot a duck on the wing with a bullet is not easy, but the natives seldom returned empty handed; and many a time I have seen a tiny lad of ten or twelve years old bring down his bird with a sling at twenty or thirty yards.

The Indian answered, \"They came from heaven.\" \"Who brought them?\" asked Cabeca. \"Men with...", "...already shown that it was partly derived from former works, though I cannot undertake to say to what extent that was the case. In its general character our book resembles one which was popular in the middle ages, as the _Secretum Secretorum_, falsely attributed to Aristotle,[78] and which was also known under the title _De Regimine Principum_. The popularity of this work was so great that MS. copies occur in most of our public libraries, and not less than nine English translations and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> French translations are known.[79] A Scots translation by sir Gilbert de Hay, entitled \"_The Buke of the Governaunce of Princis_,\" is contained in a MS. at Abbotsford, accompanying a version of _The Tree of Batailes_, already noticed in pp. iii. vi. Another work of the same class is that of which Caxton published (about the year 1484) a translation entitled _The booke of the ordre of Chevalrye or Knyghthode_, and of which the Scots translation by sir Gilbert de Hay was printed...", "...The trick had failed with Rantaine; it had succeeded with him.--Rantaine had slunk away abashed; Clubin disappeared in triumph. He had substituted himself for Rantaine--stepped between him and his mistress, and carried off her favours. As to the future, he had no well-settled plan. In the iron tobacco-box in his girdle he had the three bank-notes. The knowledge of that fact was enough. He would change his name. There are plenty of countries where sixty thousand francs are equal to <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred thousand. It would be no bad solution to go to one of those corners of the world, and live there honestly on the money disgorged by that scoundrel Rantaine. To speculate, to embark in commerce, to increase his capital, to become really a millionaire, that, too, would be no bad termination to his career. For example.

In five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years they might be selected to be called to the bar as Utter Barristers, whose number was fixed. There was no formal examination. The Utter Barrister spent at least three more years performing exercises and assisting in directing the studies of the younger men. After this time, he could plead in the general courts at Westminster, but usually carried on law work in the offices of other men and prepared cases for them.

Unfortunately for himself, the view was cursorily suggested in scattered passages of an appendix to a work on a different subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr. Matthew himself drew attention to it in 1860, after the publication of the \"Origin of Species.\" We observe finally that Mr. Herbert Spencer, in an essay published in 1852, and republished <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years later, contrasted the theories of the creation and the development of organic beings. He argued from the analogy of domestic productions, from the changes which the embryos of many species undergo, from the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, and from the principle of general gradation, that species have been modified; and he attributed the modification to the change of circumstances. The two volumes comprising the \"Origin of Species\" constitute, as the...", "...track, and lost me, so thought he had better look me up and be on hand in case I had returned to camp, and the bear should come.

The cook obligingly interested himself in my performance and kept tally on my aim, pointing out to me when it was high, when it was low, to the right or to the left. Then he took his <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> shooter and put a half dozen bullets in the bull's-eye offhand. I lost my interest in shooting. The cook gave me some lunch, and while I was eating he stood before the fire looking at it through the fingers of his.

Partly he was trying to score off Sylvia, but at the same time he was sincerely curious to know, for he never could resist the amplification of a comparison. \"Oh, any ink-slinger with a brain of pulp,\" she answered savagely. He bowed. \"I suppose you're suffering from the virus of sentimental redemption?\" she sneered. Michael was rather startled by her divination. \"What should I redeem her from?\" \"I thought you boasted of knowing Lily <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years ago?\" \"I don't know that I boasted of it,\" he replied, in rather an injured tone. \"But I did know her--very well.\" \"Couldn't you foresee what she was bound to become?

This latter request was a sure sign that he was getting better. Then he began his story. ***** Although <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years had passed since he had visited this part of the great island, Manson knew his way inland to the lake.

Leaving this scene of wild fanaticism, we rode on a few miles farther to the Kootub Minar, the loftiest isolated tower in the world, that has stood there <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred years, looking down on all the strange scenes that have passed within its horizon, since watchers from its summit saw the armies of Tamerlane march by. We rode back through a succession of ruins, stopping at several royal tombs, but most interested in one where the sons of the aged king of Delhi took refuge after the fall of the city, and from which they were taken out by Captain Hodson, and shot in the presence of their deluded followers, and their bodies exposed in the...", "...established, up to 1530, when Charles V. made over Malta and all its dependencies in perpetual sovereignty to the keeping of these Knights. They had no sooner fortified the island than there began the nine months' siege of the Turks, one of the most memorable sieges in history. When it was ended, the Turks re-embarked ten thousand of the forty thousand men they had landed, and of the nine thousand Knights present under the Grand Master Jean de la Valette when the siege had opened, but <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred capable of bearing arms remained alive. The order continued in possession of their island until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the French, under General Bonaparte, took it with but little trouble. The French in turn were besieged by Maltese and English, and after two years capitulated. In 1814 the island was transferred to England. It now, in its monuments and its memories, speaks of the days of chivalry; but present and mixed with these is the ubiquitous...", "...taller for three months, and for several days of the fourth month. The widow went into the storehouse to look at her foster-children, and what did she behold on raising the lid of the basket?

Salme was besieged by suitors.

The Moon drove up in a grand chariot drawn by fifty horses, and attended by a train of sixty grooms. He was a pale slender youth, and found no favour in the eyes of...", "...resisted every attempt to seduce him. Although his resignation was refused he stood his ground manfully, and it became clear that some other expedient would have to be resorted to. In the small hours of the 13th June what this was was made clear: by a rapid reshuffling of the cards Dr. Wu Ting-fang's resignation was accepted and the general officer commanding the Peking Gendarmerie, a genial soul named General Chiang Chao-tsung, who had survived unscathed the vicissitudes of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years of revolution, was appointed to act in his stead and duly counter- signed the fateful Mandate which was at once printed and promulgated at four o'clock in the morning. It has been stated to the writer that had it not been so issued four battalions of Chang Hsun's savage pigtailed soldiery, who had been bivouacked for some days in the grounds of the Temple of Heaven, would have been let loose on the capital.

She remembered the difference when, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months before, she had been torn from the breast of that more spirited protectress. Miss Overmore, then also in the vestibule, but of course in the other one, had been thoroughly audible and voluble; her protest had rung out bravely and she had declared that something--her pupil didn't know exactly what--was a regular wicked shame.

It was followed by a smaller two-horse wagon. Both of the drivers were Greasers. \"What you got on there,\" yelled Dunk mischievously. The Mexicans replied with a curious glance, and one of them gave the usual, \"No sabe!\" After wiping their perspiring faces with their handkerchiefs, the boys and Hawke pulled out from under the trees and rode out into the sun again.

A considerable proportion of the sides of this bedroom was given up to books; in one corner was a very high wash-hand-stand, so high that Mr. Pulitzer, who was well over <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet tall, could wash his hands without stooping. The provision of this very high wash-hand-stand illustrates the minute care with which everything had been foreseen in the construction and fitting-up of the yacht. When a person stoops there is a slight impediment to the free flow of blood to the head, such an impediment might react unfavorably on the condition of Mr. Pulitzer's eyes, therefore the wash-hand-stand was high enough to be used without stooping.

On such occasions they admitted no aid from the gentlemen around them, but each stepping for an instant on a servant's hand, settled herself in a moment on horseback. Nothing could be more perfect than the whole thing, but the wonder was that Mr. Tristram should have allowed it. The party from Noningsby consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven on horseback, besides those in the carriage.

If this be considered as a point of inferiority in the armour-plated American species, we must remember that while beetles and grasshoppers have as many as <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> legs apiece, man, the head and crown of things, is content to scramble through life ungracefully with no more than two. There are a great many tropical American pond-fish which share these adventurous gipsy habits of the pretty little Callichthys.

They had what they called the \"Academy Band,\" and grand music it made, with a hat-box for a drum, cricket-bat for violoncello, and paper flute and trumpets.

It is not easy to pronounce whether the servitude of Demetrius, or the exile of his brother Thomas, [90] be the most inglorious. On the conquest of the Morea, the despot escaped to Corfu, and from thence to Italy, with some naked adherents: his name, his sufferings, and the head of the apostle St. Andrew, entitled him to the hospitality of the Vatican; and his misery was prolonged by a pension of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand ducats from the pope and cardinals. His two sons, Andrew and Manuel, were educated in Italy; but the eldest, contemptible to his enemies and burdensome to his friends, was degraded by the baseness of his life and marriage.

To this result the influence of Bishop Fitzpatrick had contributed essentially. His reason he did not disguise. Portions of Boston were under the control of the Irish.

Hence he used his influence against the new Constitution. Such was his frank statement when the contest was over. About the twentieth of June, when I had...", "...the site of the fort.

At the request of Louis, Racine wrote another tragedy the following year--viz., \"Athalie;\" in the opinion of French critics the most perfect of all tragedies.

This first part of the legend corresponds with those numerous European popular tales, in which, now the devil, now the aquatic monster, now the serpent, demands from a father the son who has just been born to him without his knowledge.

The Australians have been in heavy fighting, almost daily, for <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> solid weeks; they started with three of the most terrible battles that have ever been fought--few people, even here, realise how heavy that fighting was. Then the tension eased as they struck those first blows northwards. As they neared Mouquet the resistance increased. Each of the last five blows has been stiffer to drive. On each occasion the wedge has been driven a little farther forward. This time the blow was heavier and the wedge went farther. The attack was made just as a...", "...sheep require but little water when fed upon turnips, so does the camel exist almost without drinking during the rainy season when pastured upon succulent and dewy herbage. During the hottest season, when green herbage ceases to exist in the countries inhabited by camels, they are led to water every alternate day, thus they are supposed to drink once in forty-eight hours; but when upon the march across deserts, where no water exists, they are expected to carry a load of from five to <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred pounds, and to march twenty-five miles per day, for three days, without drinking, but to be watered on the fourth day. Thus a camel should drink the evening before the start, and he will carry his load one hundred miles without the necessity of drinking; not, however, without suffering from thirst. On the third day's march, during the hot simoom, the camel should drink if possible; but he can endure the fourth day. This peculiarity of constitution enables the camel to...", "...Dearest Susan: as I think of her I seem to see one of those tiny, tiny \"building rotifers\" collecting out of reality its exquisite house.

Scarce three safe hours remained to me; I must be off at once. To go looking for Adam was out of the question. Even if I could find him, I dared not risk him.

But I was not to know that passion for five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years yet, and in the mean time I kept on as I had been going, and worked out my deliverance in the predestined way. What I liked then was regularity, uniformity, exactness.

A few illustrations will suffice to give some idea of the later development of the lower invertebrates and vertebrates.

In some species the shells were commonly ten inches long; the double shell of one of these Tertiary bivalves has been found which measured thirteen inches in length, eight in width, and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> in thickness. In the higher branch of the Mollusc world the naked Cephalopods (cuttle-fish, etc.) predominate over the nautiloids--the shrunken survivors of the great coiled-shell race. Among the sharks, the modern Squalodonts entirely displace the older types, and grow to an enormous size. Some of the teeth we find in Tertiary deposits are more than six inches long and six inches broad at the base. This is three times the size of the teeth of the largest living shark, and it is...", "...the grapple of death. In a corridor of the Escurial, Philip II. was met by a man who had long stood waiting his approach, and who with proud reverence placed a petition in the hand of the pale and sombre King. The petitioner was Pedro Menendez de Aviles, one of the ablest and most distinguished officers of the Spanish marine. He was born of an ancient Asturian family. His boyhood had been wayward, ungovernable, and fierce. He ran off at eight years of age, and when, after a search of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months, he was found and brought back, he ran off again. This time he was more successful, escaping on board a fleet bound against the Barbary corsairs, when his precocious appetite for blood and blows had reasonable contentment. A few years later, he found means to build a small vessel in which he cruised against the corsairs and the French, and, though still little more than a boy, displayed a singular address and daring.

An information from some quarter it was necessary to have before any decisive action could be taken, and it was furnished by this man Swayze, who had been a spy and \"horse-provider\" during the Revolutionary War, and who now proved his fitness for the position of a legislator by deliberate perjury.

Twenty men were left with the canoes, and Swan with the rest marched towards the town, by a road which led partly through woodland, and partly through savannas well stocked with cattle. They arrived at the town by ten in the forenoon, and entered without opposition, the inhabitants having quitted it on their approach.

Her large eyes, surrounded by a bluish circle, were moist with tears; her form, once so lithe, was bent as if beneath a burden; her cheek, wasted and leaden, rested on a hand that was spare and feeble; her brow seemed to bear the marks of that crown of thorns which is the diadem of resignation. I thought of the cottage. How young she was <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months ago! How cheerful, how free, how careless! What had I done with all that? It seemed to me that a strange voice repeated an old romance that I had long since forgotten: Altra volta gieri biele, Blanch' e rossa com' un flore, Ma ora no.

It was Grace at last, on her way back from the interview with Mrs. Charmond. He threw down the tree he was planting, and was about to break through the belt of holly when he suddenly became aware of the presence of another man, who was looking over the hedge on the opposite side of the way upon the figure of the unconscious Grace. He appeared as a handsome and gentlemanly personage of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight and twenty, and was quizzing her through an eye-glass. Seeing that Winterborne was noticing him, he let his glass drop with a click upon the rail which protected the hedge, and walked away in the opposite direction.

Inevitably, there had been little or no plowing yet for the vast Corn-crop of that State; yet barely two weeks would intervene before the close of the proper season for Corn-planting. Even if these should be wholly favorable, the plowing could not be effected in season, and much ground must be planted too late or not planted at all. In every such case, a machine that would plow <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight furrows as fast as a man ought to walk, would add immensely to the year's harvest, and be hailed as a general blessing. I recollect that a German observer of Western cultivation--a man of decided perspicacity and wide observation--recommended that each farmer who had not the requisite time or team for getting in his Corn-crop in due season should plow single furrows through his field at intervals of 3 to 3-1/2 feet, plant his Corn on the earth thus turned, and proceed,...", "...illegal in Japan, but its teeth have been drawn (1) by the enactment that \"those who, with the object of causing a strike, seduce or incite others\" shall be sentenced to imprisonment from one to six months with a fine of from 3 to 30 yen; (2) by the power given to the police (_a_) to detain suspected persons for a succession of twenty-four hour periods, and (_b_) summarily to close public meetings, and (3) by the franchise being so narrow that few trade unionists have votes.

The practice in the county of Hereford has generally been to let the calves suckle from four to <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months, and bull calves often run eight months with the cow. But their dairy qualities are perhaps as good as those of any cattle whose fattening properties have been so carefully developed; and, though it is probable that they could be bred for milk with proper care and attention, yet, as this change would be at the expense of other qualities equally valuable, it would evidently be wiser to resort to other stock for the dairy.

It was now past noon; within the next five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hours there must be some hard thinking if this unexpected development was to be turned to the best account. CHAPTER VIII--REINECKE RETURNS At the bungalow the native servants received Tom with smiles of welcome. It seemed that Reinecke had given out that his guest had gone away only for a time; that the war, a distant and unreal thing to them, could have turned apparent friends into enemies was as yet beyond their comprehension. Quickly and cheerfully they prepared a...", "...and in spite of their occasional importance as public documents, there has been scarcely a book upon the forms of English government or upon the history of records, which gives a detailed account of the method of issuing, entering, and publishing proclamations. It remained for Mr. Robert Steele to compile during the past year, \"A Bibliography of Royal Proclamations, 1485-1714, with an Historical Essay on their Origin and Use.\" This work, in two folio volumes, forms volumes five and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of the Earl of Crawford's splendidly published series, the _Bibliotheca Lindesiana_, and in this country can be consulted at most of the large libraries. Mr. Steele so thoroughly treats of the issuing, enforcement, and history of proclamations, that more than a brief allusion to their method of publication is unnecessary in this place. Proclamations, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries at least, usually underwent the following routine. They were drawn up by the...", "..._dreams_. A further significant fact, which the court ignored as irrelevant, was the ghastly identity of Carse's supposed crimes and those confessed by Emil Drukker. It is impossible that this duality of murders could be brought about by mere coincidence, for the similarity of detail was carried too far. This fact alone presupposes the statement that there was a horrible and unnatural bondage between Emil Drukker and Jason Carse--the bondage of the diary! One night of each week for <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks Jason Carse was compelled by some unknown power to dream about a murder confessed and described in Drukker's diary. On each of these nights, while Carse watched it in a dream, an identical murder was committed somewhere in the city and the man whom he recognized as the murderer was Emil Drukker. It was as if Carse's dreams, projected into reality by the sheer vividness of the diary, had resurrected Emil Drukker from his grave and set him free to re-enact his former crimes!...", "...patience; Florence Nightingale seemed to bear a charmed life. There is no record of any single instance, through that terrible winter and spring, of her being unable to perform the duties she had taken upon her. She might have said with Sir Galahad: \"My strength is as the strength of ten Because my heart is pure.\" CHAPTER XIII. MISS NIGHTINGALE UNDER FIRE. In May, 1855, Miss Nightingale decided to go to the Crimea, to inspect the hospitals there. In the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months spent at Scutari, she had brought its hospitals into excellent condition; now she felt that she must see what was being done and what still needed to be done elsewhere. Accordingly she set sail in the ship _Robert Lowe_, accompanied by her faithful friend Mr. Bracebridge, who, with his admirable wife, had come out with her from England, and had been her constant helper and adviser; M. Soyer, who was going to see how kitchen matters were going _la-bas_, and her devoted boy...", "...four or a hundred.\" The _Provincial Record of New Hampshire_ estimates it at eighty. Charlevoix claims two hundred and thirty, and Villieu himself but a hundred and thirty-one. Champigny, Frontenac, and Calli\u00e8res, in their reports to the court, adopt Villieu's statements. Frontenac says that the success was due to the assurances of safety which Phips had given the settlers. In the Massachusetts archives is a letter to Phips, written just after the attack. The devastation extended <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven miles. There are also a number of depositions from persons present, giving a horrible picture of the cruelties practised.

On the contrary, they willingly confess that they have learned much from diverse expression of opinion, all the more so as they now learn with pleasure that their efforts in behalf of culture are constantly becoming more closely allied to the general progress of higher education in Germany. With much gratification they call attention to the _Propyloea_, to the critical and descriptive programs of no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> exhibitions of painting and statuary, to the many expressions of opinion in the _Jenaisische Litteraturzeitung, and to the published translation of the Life of Benvenuto Cellini. Although these writings have not been printed and bound in the same volumes and do not form parts of a single work, they have, nevertheless, all been written in the same spirit. They have proved a leaven to the whole, as we are learning slowly, but not without gratification; so that there is no longer...", "...Leaving the camp the next morning after the leopard-hunt, we proceeded in a northerly direction for thirty-three miles along the west base of Langberg, and arrived, on the second day, opposite Speck Kopjie, where another pass crosses the mountain, which is a very stony and rough road, but the scenery grand on both sides, similar to that we passed through a few days ago, and arrived at a farm belonging to Potgieter, a Boer.

And beyond, in a north-east direction, is Mount Hexley, Maremane and Coses, a Kaffir station. The formation of the hills is very peculiar, lofty, isolated koppies, covered, many of them, with thick bush, others almost bare, the naked rocks piled one upon another in grotesque forms. The dry river-bed passing through this part is a branch of the...", "...then take the cars, and at noon put on your furs and your skates, and go skimming over frozen Donner Lake, seven thousand feet above the valley, among snow banks fifteen feet deep, and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty crags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea.

And some of us have swept around snow-walled curves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand feet above the sea, and looked down as the birds do, upon the deathless Summer of the Sacramento Valley, with its fruitful fields, its feathery foliage, its silver streams, all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted atmosphere, and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance--a dreamy, exquisite glimpse of fairyland, made all the more charming and striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow, and savage crags and...", "...History of the Calves' Head Club'--probably Ned Ward--gives an account of the melodramatic and diabolical ceremonies observed at their banquets. An axe was hung up in their club-room as a sacred symbol--the destroyer of the tyrant. But the eating and drinking, for which, as Addison says, clubs were instituted, were not neglected by the members. At the banquet held in 1710 there was spent on bread, beer, and ale the sum of L2 10s.; on fifty calves' heads, L5 5s.; on bacon, L1 10s.; on <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> chickens and two capons, L1; on three joints of veal, 18s.; on butter and flour, 15s.; on oranges, lemons, vinegar, and spices, L1; on oysters and sausages, 15s.; on the use of pewter and linen, L1; and on various other items additional sums, bringing the total up to L18 6s. No wine, it will be noticed, is included in the above bill, but there is no doubt a considerable amount for this item should be added to it. Early in the last century street clubs became common in various...", "...lest this angel should lose her taste for earthly pleasures. The first winter went by. The Count had drawn on M. Cardot for the trifling sum of thirty thousand francs over and above Chesnel's remittance. As Cardot very carefully refrained from using his right of remonstrance, Victurnien now learned for the first time that he had overdrawn his account. He was the more offended by an extremely polite refusal to make any further advance, since it so happened that he had just lost <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand francs at play at the club, and he could not very well show himself there until they were paid. After growing indignant with Maitre Cardot, who had trusted him with thirty thousand francs (Cardot had written to Chesnel, but to the fair Duchess' favorite he made the most of his so-called confidence in him), after all this, d'Esgrignon was obliged to ask the lawyer to tell him how to set about raising the money, since debts of honor were in question. \"Draw bills on your...", "...(Med'i-ter-ra'ne-an).] [Footnote 6: Explorer: one who explores or discovers new countries.] 3. Columbus has a sea-fight; he goes to Lisbon.--According to some accounts, Columbus once had a desperate battle with a vessel off the coast of Portugal. The fight lasted, it is said, all day. At length both vessels were found to be on fire. Columbus jumped from his blazing ship into the sea, and catching hold of a floating oar, managed, with its help, to swim to the shore, about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> miles away. He then went to the port of Lisbon.[7] There he married the daughter of a famous sea-captain. For a long time after his marriage Columbus earned his living partly by drawing maps, which he sold to commanders of vessels visiting Lisbon, and partly by making voyages to Africa, Iceland, and other countries.

The fewest cases have been reported among children over two years of age. It was due to the apparent immunity of this age-group that, until very recently, German writers doubted the identity of infantile and adult scurvy. The exclusion of children of this age is merely fortuitous and, moreover, is by no means absolute. One of the earliest cases of scurvy in children, reported by Montfalcon, occurred in a child <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years old. Bateman in America described a case in a child of about this age. Barlow, in one of his first articles, reported scurvy in a small group of older children. The case so frequently quoted by German authors in this connection is that of Fraenkel, who described both clinically and pathologically a case of scurvy in a boy eight years of age. These cases by no means exhaust the number which are reported. Recently, Tobler has given us an account of scurvy, occurring during the...", "...them for ever from the society of the Caesars; while he _wonders_ how we could have hoped to buy a real Piscennius and a Pertinax in the same adventure, and both so well preserved too? \"Were we ignorant of the prices usually set upon the heads of all those emperors who had enjoyed but a few weeks' reign?\" Did not every body, for instance, know that the African Gordians, both father and son, were, in _bronze_, worth their weight in gold? that a Vitellius in bronze was cheap at <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> pounds? and that he might be considered fortunate indeed who could convert his spare ten-pound notes into as many Pertinax penny-pieces, or come into the possession of a half-penny or a second module, as it is called, of Pescennius Niger, at the same price?

At daybreak, the position of the two fleets was twenty-five miles west of Cape St. Vincent, a headland on the Portuguese coast, a hundred and fifty miles northwest of Cadiz. During the night the wind had shifted from the eastward to west by south, and, being now fair, the Spaniards were running for their port, heading about east-southeast; but they were in disorder, and were divided into two principal fragments, of which the headmost, and therefore leewardmost, numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> ships. It was separated from the other division of twenty-one by a space of six or eight miles. In the whole force, of twenty-seven ships, there were seven of three decks, the least of which carried one hundred and twelve guns; the remainder were principally seventy-fours, there being, however, one of eighty-four guns. Jervis's fleet consisted of fifteen ships-of-the-line,--two of one hundred guns, four of ninety-eight or ninety, eight seventy-fours, and one sixty-four.

Upon the whole, there is no reason for doubting that in its general outlines the sketch made by Father Hennepin pourtrayed the scene more faithfully than did his written description, of which the following is a literal translation: \"Betwixt the Lake Ontario and the Lake Erie there is a vast and prodigious cadence of water, which falls down after a surprising and astonishing manner, insomuch that the universe does not afford its parallel. This wonderful downfall is about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred feet, and is composed of two great cross-streams of water, and two falls, with an island sloping across the middle of it. The waters which fall from this horrible precipice do foam and boil after the most hideous manner imaginable, making an outrageous noise, more terrible than that of thunder; for when the wind blows out of the south their dismal roaring may be heard more than fifteen leagues off.\" Hennepin and La Motte were soon afterwards joined by La Salle and Tonty,...", "...both into trade-unions and into a new political party.

Already in 1662 the University of the Sorbonne had signed <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> articles denying not only the divinely constituted primacy of the Pope, but asserting an undue independence in the powers of the king himself. To revive these articles as well as to strengthen his position in regard to the Holy See, the French Monarch convoked at Paris in 1682 an assemblage of the clergy which was attended by thirty-four archbishops and bishops, besides as many minor prelates. The members of this assemblage were invited individually by the king's order, and only...", "...and Otaha is hilly, broken, and irregular, except on the sea-coast, yet the hills look green and pleasant, and are in many places clothed with wood.

Snowcapped hills rose high above them; but where they journeyed, they were in a beautiful temperate climate, with rich soil and abundance of flowers.

These gutters would be a serious obstacle to wheeled conveyances, such as lofty waggons, which would be unable in many cases to pass beneath.

After a time the triplets give way to the following powerful passage: [Music: Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.] after a few bars of which the triplets are resumed. \"Pleni sunt coeli et terra gloria ejus,\" is a <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> part fugue, and \"osanna\" is a double chorus.

THE IMPALA STAMPEDE. Not all our days were spent in excitement--far far from it. For <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven months the rains were too heavy, the heat too great, the grass too rank, and the fever too bad in the Bushveld for any one to do any good there; so that for more than half of the year we had no hunting to speak of, as there was not much to be done above the Berg. But even during the hunting season there were many off-days and long spells when we never fired a shot. The work with the waggons was hard when we had full loads, the trekking slow and at night, so that there...", "...country is destined to afford, by the improved navigation of its streams, and by the introduction of turnpikes, roads, and bridges, are introduced, there is reason to conclude that the annual amount of lead produced will far surpass the proceeds of those mines under the present arrangement, and, indeed, it is impossible to calculate the extent to which it may be carried. It is, perhaps, a moderate estimate to say, that they are capable of being made to yield, by judicious management, <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> millions of pounds of lead per annum, and that they will furnish employment to three thousand hands. During my late tour throughout the western country, including nearly a year's residence in the interior of Missouri, I devoted much time to this interesting subject, and have been enabled to collect a body of facts on the physical resources and character of that country, and particularly of its mines and minerals, which it is my design to lay before the public.

It is a point conceded, now, on all sides, that had the Confederate army pursued its success on the evening of the first day, the army under General...", "...a competence which enables him to live retired in Waitsburg. He was born in Lee county, Iowa, December 17, 1859, a son of John and Katharina (Martin) Schmitt, both natives of Germany. In 1840 they emigrated to America and located in Iowa, whence they removed to Nebraska where the mother passed away. Subsequently the father returned to Iowa with his children but after living there for a year went to Umatilla county, Oregon, and became the owner of a good farm there. He is deceased and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of his ten children have also passed away. Henry Schmitt passed his boyhood and youth mainly in Iowa, and after completing the course in the common schools became a student in the high school at Burlington, from which he was graduated. For some time thereafter he resided at home, assisting his father, but on attaining his majority began farming in Umatilla county, Oregon, the family in the meantime having removed west. He purchased one hundred and sixty acres of land on which he...", "...on the lookout, and seeing that our ambulance was kept closed up on the wagon carrying the rest of the detachment, we could, I thought, stand off any ordinary party of hostile Indians. About noon I observed that the scouts in advance had left the trail and begun to reconnoitre a low ridge to their right, the sequel of which was that in a few minutes they returned to the wagons on a dead run and reported Sioux just ahead. Looking in the direction indicated, I could dimly see five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> horsemen riding in a circle, as Indians do when giving warning to their camp, but as our halt disclosed that we were aware of their proximity, they darted back again behind the crest of the ridge. Anticipating from this move an immediate attack, we hastily prepared for it by unhooking the mules from the wagon and ambulance, so that we could use the vehicles as a barricade. This done, I told the interpreter to take the Mandan scouts and go over toward the ridge and reconnoitre...", "...Finley, Commissioner of Education of the state of New York, in an address delivered before the Illinois chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa, speaks of his visit to Oxford just before the war and of a visit to Cambridge, England, a few weeks after it had begun. At Oxford he found the calm of the cloister, with its memorials of poets, scholars, statesmen, princes, and soldiers, where there were ancient academic conventions that paid no heed to the passing customs of the world outside. Only <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks later at Cambridge--a Cambridge which had a month or six weeks before been as Oxford--the town was filled with men in khaki. In this charming address Doctor Finley speaks of a portrait of Samuel Butler which he saw at Cambridge,--a portrait of the man who described in his book \"Erewhon\" a land where criminals were treated as sick, and the sick as criminals; where there were \"Colleges of Unreason,\" colleges in which students were promoted for excellence in vagueness and were...", "...a bank-book; same initials, you see.

Then he immediately spoke to John's comrade, and promised him all the money he might receive at the next evening's performance, if he would only rub the ointment on four or five of his dolls. But the fellow-traveller said he did not require anything in return, excepting the sword which the showman wore by his side. As soon as he received the sword he anointed <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of the dolls with the ointment, and they were able immediately to dance so gracefully that all the living girls in the room could not help joining in the dance. The coachman danced with the cook, and the waiters with the chambermaids, and all the strangers joined; even the tongs and the fire-shovel made an attempt, but they fell down after the first jump.

On December 5th their ship anchored in a bay called Banner Cove, in the west end of Picton Island. The missionaries landed, and then natives came. Fearing violence the missionaries took refuge on the _Ocean Queen_ for a few days, and then, on December 18th, landed again, built a wigwam near the beach, moored their boats handy by, and let the big ship sail away.

While much of this remarkable growth is due to the general awakening of the University, yet no small part of the credit belongs to the inspiration of Professor Kelly Miller who became Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1907 near...", "...some trick.\" Whether it was the cool determination exhibited by Bob and his men, or the consciousness that they were in the wrong that took all the fight out of the deserters, we cannot tell; but they were cowed by something, and when Corporal Owens and his troopers filed into the dug-out, and the former sternly commanded them to \"throw up,\" every carbine was dropped to the ground and five pairs of hands were raised in the air. \"Where's the other?\" demanded Bob. \"There ought to be <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of you.\" \"Here I am,\" said a faint voice. Bob looked in the direction from which the voice came, and saw Talbot sitting in a dark corner, his carbine lying by his side and both his hands raised above his head. He wore a handkerchief around his forehead, and, dim as the light was, Bob could see that it was streaked with blood. \"Are you badly hurt?\" he asked with some anxiety. \"No, he isn't,\" exclaimed Bristow, before the wounded man could speak. \"A glancing ball cut a...", "...the mud at the shock of a footstep; but the tadpoles sported recklessly in the sunny water, for as yet their legs as well as their troubles were to come.

Apparently there had already been an exchange of hostilities. One of the half-dozen had received a blow in the eye which had half closed that organ and another showed signs of having suffered on the nose, much to the damage of his clothing; these injuries had evidently enraged and excited the sufferers.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that the people had not the least suspicion of danger attending their idol. The night was cloudy: yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same posture and place that it did before. The people seemed to be all at their rest; only that in the great hut, where we saw the three priests, we saw a light, and going up close to the door, we heard people talking as if there were five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of them; we concluded, therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, those men would come out immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it from destruction; and what to do with them we knew not.

It was a day that convinced the Allies that the German positions could not be broken down by frontal attack, just as the battles of the Marne had convinced the Germans that the road to Paris was not yet open. The <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> days from September 12 to 18 had revealed beyond preadventure that the German line along the ridge of the Aisne was not merely a convenient halting place for a rear-guard action, but that it was formed of lines of strong fortifications, almost impregnable and absolutely beyond the hope of storming. The forces were too evenly balanced for any concerted action to produce a desired effect, the possession of air scouts eliminated any question of a surprise. In other words, the...", "...uncomfortable\" boxes for the aristocrats. In the winter, the heat was usually furnished by one stove in the center of the end of the barn-like structure where the spectators congregated between the acts. Often, spectators carried their individual footwarmers with them to assure themselves of comfort during the play. Candles at first were the sole means of illumination.

Three of the most eminent men with whom Johnson came in contact in later life, had also been students at Oxford.

In 1865 the salmon fisheries were extinct in all but five or <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> of the thirty rivers known to have been originally inhabited by them. In many of these rivers the last salmon had been taken, and in others the occurrence of individual specimens was extremely rare.

Unlike any of the other Folk, his hair (snow-white) was not twisted into a fantastic knot and fastened with gold pins, but hung loose and was cut square off at about the level of his shoulders, forming a tremendous, bristly mass that reminded one of a lion's mane.

If Noah's deluge was a legend, we should at least have to admit that Peter did not know this: what too would be said of Christ's allusion to it? I was unable to admit Dr. Arnold's views; but to see a vigorous mind, deeply imbued with Christian devoutness, so convinced, both reassured me that I need not fear moral mischiefs from free inquiry, and indeed laid...", "...the date of the inquisition. The mixed character of hospitals commonly reckoned leper-hospitals is shown by several other instances. St Mary Magdalene's at Lynn (1145) provided for a prior and twelve brethren or sisters, nine of whom were to be whole and three leprous. St Leonard's at Lancaster (time of king John) was endowed for a master, a chaplain, and nine poor persons, three of them to be leprous. St Bartholomew's at Oxford provided for a master, a clerk, two whole brethren and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> infirm or leprous brethren; but the infirm or leprous brethren had all been changed into whole brethren by the time of Edward III[179].

When these beads are worn out, so that they cannot be strung neatly, and even on one thread, they no longer consider them good.

All along this coast strip of Venezuela are plantations generally covered with cocoa trees. From the beans of this tree are made cocoa and chocolate. Coffee is also a staple crop. At the piers will be noticed bags of coffee and cocoa beans, great quantities of rubber and piles of hides. As we are nearer to them than other foreign countries we now use much of their products.

The question is a rather complex one and other factors come into play, including the intensity of the heaven world life.

Some people will have only two or three hundred years between incarnations while others may have <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven centuries and still others a much longer period. In getting a right understanding of the subject of rebirth, or reincarnation, it is necessary to keep in mind the fact that the soul, or center of individualized consciousness, is the man and that the physical body is merely an instrument he uses for a number of years; that the causal body is his permanent body for the whole of human evolution; that the mental plane is his home plane and that from there he sends forth...", "...he was hunting sentries or jackal--so long as he was hunting he was quite happy--while the feelings of the sentry and the jackal were also probably similar!

Realising what capital material he had to deal with, Mick was determined that, whatever people might think of him, his job was to get the Regiment to the highest state of efficiency in the...", "...By this time, 1882, slavery is almost nominal at Sarawak. I read, in a _Sarawak Gazette_, six months ago, that Rajah Brooke had proposed to his Supreme Council, which consists of four Malays and two Englishmen, that slavery should be by law abolished in Sarawak territory. He had proposed this, he said, six months previously, and the Malay councillors present assented heartily as far as themselves and the people of Kuching were concerned, but they thought it would be desirable to give <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months' notice to the outlying rivers and coasts, where the people were not as advanced in civilization as those at the capital. Now the six months had passed away, were they prepared to assent to the law?

In the same _Gazette_ I noticed a letter from the Resident at Bintulu, one of the farthest stations from Kuching, in which...", "...look round.\" \"Is that all?\" That was all; nothing more could be learnt from the young man, and Gammon promised to come forthwith.

It was a single bright gas jet, burning very close to a window about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred feet distant from him in an air line. Several tall chimneys of intervening houses rose almost between him and this light, and, perhaps, their dark, spectral shapes aided him in identifying it so readily. The lower sash of the window through which the light shone was curtained, but the upper part was uncovered; and an observer on the tower, being fifty or sixty feet above the top of the curtain, could easily look into the room.

Marius seems to have been no politician. He became a soldier and then a General; and because he was great as a soldier and General, the affairs of the State fell into his hands with very little effort.

Napoleon claimed to have sent an order during the night with directions for Bernadotte to reinforce Davout. This was a double-meaning statement intended to place the blame for Davout's exposure on Bernadotte's slow movements. Bernadotte denied having received any message, and the consequence was an increased bitterness between him and Napoleon, destined to grow still stronger, and finally to become of historic importance. Davout was crossing the river Saale about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> o'clock in the morning of the fourteenth, and was well over with about two thirds of his corps, when suddenly his advance-guard found itself facing a portion of the enemy at the hamlet of Hassenhausen.

There was, indeed, an elderly man asleep in a rocking-chair on the porch. Who could he be? CHAPTER II GRANDPA FORD Eagerly peering from the carriage in which they had ridden from the Pineville station, the six little Bunkers looked to see who the man was on their porch. He seemed to be asleep, for he sat very still in the rocking-chair, which had been forgotten and left on the porch when the family had gone...", "...an encroachment on the rights of the Senate; and that it mixed too much the Legislative & Executive, which as well as the Judiciary departments, ought to be kept as separate as possible.

On the other hand he was averse to vest so dangerous a power in the President alone. As a method for avoiding both, he suggested that a privy Council of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> members to the president should be established; to be chosen for six years by the Senate, two out of the Eastern two out of the middle, and two out of the Southern quarters of the Union, & to go out in rotation two every second year; the concurrence of the Senate to be required only in the appointment of Ambassadors, and in making treaties, which are more of a legislative nature. This would prevent the constant sitting of the Senate which he thought dangerous, as well as keep the...", "...there's the pretty Di. Vernon!' (I had bade them good-by a dozen times.) I rushed into the street, and seeing half-a-dozen ladies not far off, gave them a touch-and-go shake; rushed up a wrong street, then back again, and finally came out on the square and saw the little schooner's sails bellied out full; passengers waving their handkerchiefs, and the people all around crying out to me to hurry, or I should lose my chance. But I _didn't_ hurry. The idea of hurry, after we had waited <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks! That captain too, had he been asleep all this time, and just awaked? No; I did not hurry, but walked leisurely across the square, looking over my shoulder occasionally to see if ---- was any where in sight, for she had promised to be at the dock; and passing over the long wharf in the same stubborn way, I stepped on board the schooner with a stiffer upper lip than I ever remember to have had in that climate.

Having completed some repairs of machinery, and other necessary operations, which had occasioned a delay of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> days at Franklin, we left that place on the same day, at four o'clock in the afternoon. The inhabitants of the village were assembled on the banks of the river to witness our departure, and signified their good wishes by repeated cheers and acclamations. The fuel we had taken on board, being of an indifferent quality, we were able to make small progress against the rapid current of the Missouri. We anchored, for the night, three miles above Franklin. Finding the valves, and other...", "...disease, I think it may be of interest to your Committee to know what happened here in the early part of 1918. At that time there came to reside with her father in ----, a township about nine miles south of ----, a woman, ----, who, shortly after her arrival consulted the late Dr. ----, and was found to be the subject of secondary syphilis.... In all, three cases of gonorrhoea, four of soft chancre (three of whom suffered from phagadoemic ulceration which laid them up for weeks), and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> cases of purely syphilitic infection came under my care, all traceable to this same woman. As every case of gonorrhoea and soft chancre afterwards developed syphilis, ultimately I had thirteen cases of syphilis under my treatment alone. Others, I have good reason to believe, went to other towns, and doubtless some failed to seek any kind of help.... Having prevailed upon the woman to come to my surgery ... I told her that she was suffering from three varieties of venereal disease,...", "...I am getting sick of it.

The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched.

As the passengers and light baggage were carried by stage, the freight traffic was carried on by the old time teamsters, with their huge wagons, with <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight horses attached to each, and moving along the turnpikes, traveling together for company and protection. These turnpikes presented a bustling appearance, with the dashing stage coaches, parties on horseback, the long trains of teamsters' huge wagons, and the many taverns that lined these thoroughfares. The passenger on the stage coach had time to study nature and his surroundings as he passed along, and to be fortunate enough to secure the box seat with the stage driver...", "...But he was simple, economical, and incorruptible. He stood aloof from society and from political parties, exposed to the sarcasms of the aristocrats into whose ranks he had entered. (M966) He made great military reforms, changing the burgess levy into a system of enlistments, and allowing every free-born citizen to enlist. He abolished the aristocratic classification, reduced the infantry of the line to a level, and raised the number of the legion from four thousand two hundred to <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> thousand, to which he gave a new standard--the silver eagle, which proclaims the advent of emperors. The army was changed from a militia to a band of mercenaries. After effecting these military changes, he sought political supremacy by taking upon himself the constitutional magistracies. In effecting this he was supported by the popular, or democratic party, which now regained its political importance. He, therefore, obtained the consulship for the sixth time, while his friends...", "...This is to illustrate the folly of the attempt of conservatism to check the onward career of pure and enlightened liberalism toward perfect civilization, etc., etc. [Illustration] 4.

He enjoyed himself in this manner nearly all day, while his neighbors gathered around outside and placed their elbows upon the fence, watching him and wondering what on earth he meant.

Around 1800, plows were still rarely used in new grounds, but they appear to have been rather common in the old fields. George Washington used the plow to lay off his tobacco rows into three-foot squares, the hills were then made directly on the cross so that in the early stages of its growth the tobacco could be cultivated with the plow each way. The plow lightened the burden of cultivation by requiring less hoe work. When the plant began to bloom, usually <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven weeks after planting, the plant was topped; that is, the top of the plant was pinched out with the thumb and finger nails. The number of leaves left on the plant depended largely upon the fertility of the soil. In the early days of the colony, planters left twenty-five or thirty leaves on a plant, by 1671 the number had been reduced to twelve or sixteen in very rich soil.

At that early date, which I think we may throw far back in the space of the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> centuries of the estimate, or may even throw further back still, the Clyde was mainly navigated by canoes of two feet or so in depth, though we ought to have statistics of remains of larger vessels discovered in the river bed. {49a} I think we may say that the finances of Glasgow, in St. Kentigern's day, about 570-600 A.D., would not be applied to the construction of Dr. Munro's \"tower with its central pole and very thick walls\" {49b} erected merely for the purpose of warning...", "...black color, the slight violet tint being only apparent on close inspection, especially in fresh moist specimens.\" It is a small but very beautiful form, at first sight to be mistaken for a short _S. fusca_, though much more intensely black.

It is human industry and energy that have made it what it is. Nothing seems too bold or difficult for the enterprise of Chicago men.

It was found that the business quarter was laid too low--that it was damp, and could not be properly drained. It was determined to raise the whole quarter bodily from <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> to eight feet higher! And the extraordinary feat was accomplished with the help of screw-jacks, safely and satisfactorily. With the growth of population--and its increase was most rapid (from 4000 persons in 1837 to about 350,000 at the present time)--the difficulty of obtaining pure water steadily increased.

Captain Evans's ship sank one German destroyer and rammed another, passing clear over its stern and cutting it nearly in two. The whole of England was ringing with this exploit, and it was a decided tribute to our men that Admiral Jellicoe consented to detail the commander of the _Broke_.

At Western Port, Mr. Bass found high water to take place half an hour after the moon's passage, and the tide to rise from ten to fourteen feet.

Vainly she tried to shake off an unaccustomed feeling of nervousness: she was trembling from head to foot. A wild, unconquerable desire seized her to see her husband again, at once, if only he had not already started.

In the hill country the share tenant could usually plant and cultivate only four acres of tobacco, had to spend 120 days working the crop, and could use the same land for tobacco only once in <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> years. So, although a price of 6.5 cents a pound covered expenses of the planter of Burley in the Blue Grass, who could use the same land for tobacco once in four years, this price did not repay the hill planter.

The wily Serjeant knew enough about human nature to feel that it was necessary to discover some dramatic incident to change benevolent sympathy into passion, and he certainly found what he wanted. Miss Travers, it appeared, had been burnt low down on her neck when a child: the cicatrice could still be seen, though it was gradually disappearing.

These fortifications belonged neither to the Dutch method of Marollais, nor to the French method of the Chevalier Antoine de Ville, but to the system of Manesson Mallet, a skillful engineer, who about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or eight years previously had quitted the service of Portugal to enter that of France. The works had this peculiarity, that instead of rising above the earth, as did the ancient ramparts destined to defend a city from escalades, they, on the contrary, sank into it; and what created the height of the walls was the depth of the ditches. It did not take long to make D'Artagnan perceive the superiority of such a system, which gives no advantage to cannon. Besides, as the fosses were...", "...so great a respect from the Prince, did again desire the master of the ceremonies to know what time might suit with the Prince's leisure to give Whitelocke leave to wait on him. This afternoon the master came to Whitelocke, and informed him that the Prince had appointed four o'clock this afternoon to give Whitelocke audience, and the master said that he would come with the Queen's coaches to bring Whitelocke to the castle when it was time; and accordingly he came between five and <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> o'clock this evening. Whitelocke and his company went with the master to the castle, and as soon as he was alighted out of his coach, he was received by the Marshal and gentlemen of the Prince, a great number of them, at the foot of the stairs; some of them were very richly habited. They walked first up the stairs, and those of Whitelocke's train followed them; the master of the ceremonies was on Whitelocke's left hand.

According to Burckhardt, it stands upon several low hills that divide it into quarters, the largest of which is occupied by Jews. The whole may contain <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> hundred houses, of which one hundred and fifty belong to the people just named, and nearly as many to the Christians. The summit of the principal eminence is crowned with an ancient castle, part of which is regarded by the descendants of Israel as being contemporary with their earliest kings.

The island, as we mainlanders at Kangwe used to call it, was a great haunt of mine, particularly after I came down from Talagouga and saw fit to regard myself as competent to control a canoe. From Andande, the beach of Kangwe, the breadth of the arm of the Ogowe to the nearest village on the island, was about that of the Thames at Blackwall. One half of the way was slack water, the other half was broadside on to a stiff current. Now my pet canoe at Andande was about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet long, pointed at both ends, flat bottomed, so that it floated on the top of the water; its freeboard was, when nothing was in it, some three inches, and the poor thing had seen trouble in its time, for it had a hole you could put your hand in at one end; so in order to navigate it successfully, you had to squat in the other, which immersed that to the water level but safely elevated the damaged end in the air. Of course you had to stop in your end firmly, because if you went...", "...and under its roof he was stretched, gray-faced and with sharpened nose. The broken leg had been bound between rough splints of board, and he had traveled a week in the wagons in uncomplaining agony. Now, spent and silent, he awaited death, looking at the newcomers with the slow, indifferent glance of those whose ties with life are loosening. But the mother, in the ruthless unbearableness of her pain, wanted something done, anything. An Irishman in the company, who had served <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> months as a helper in a New York hospital, had told her he could amputate the leg, as he had seen the operation performed. Now she clamored for a doctor--a real doctor--to do it. He tried to persuade her of its uselessness, covering the leg in which gangrene was far advanced, and telling her death was at hand. But her despair insisted on action, her own suffering made her remorseless.

Scarcely had it died away when the pussys began to appear. They leaped from the roofs of the houses, from the doorways, and even from among the shady clumps of long grass. Every house added <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven to the number, and soon hundreds of pussycats were standing before the Queen, bowing gracefully and crying, \"Welcome, your Majesty!\" in all sorts of voices. They were plump and comfortable looking, and Dot had no idea there were so many kinds and colors of pussys in the world. Some had long, silky hair, and some short, velvety hair; some had long, bushy tails, some short tails and some no tails at all. They were white and black, blue and gray, yellow and red, speckled...", "...but it grew weaker as the body languished; and before my release I could hardly read more than an hour or two a day.

I saw my visitors in the prison cages, only our faces being visible to each other through a narrow slit. We stood about <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet apart, with a warder between us to stop \"improper conversation.\" I could not shake a friend's hand or kiss my wife. The interviews lasted only half an hour. In the middle of a sentence \"Time!\" was shouted, the keys rattled, and the little oasis had to be left for another journey over the desert sand.

It was probably this postponement of any definite settlement that occasioned Prince Albert's absence from England at the Coronation, in June, 1838.

And the seventh day on which, in imitation of the Lord, we are supposed to rest from our labors--is that, too, an indefinite period of time? Moreover, to intimate that six days were not enough for an almighty god to create the universe in would be nothing less than skepticism. It is expressly stated in the bible that nothing \"is too hard\" for God; why, then, are not six days of twenty-four hours enough? They _were_ enough, before Darwin. To extend the <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> days into six periods is to make terms with science, and when one begins to do that one has already lost his faith. In the bible of India, God only _thought_ of creating a world, and behold the world was. That way of creating is more becoming to a god. He, who could create out of nothing, could create also without time. The Hindu god is bigger than the Hebrew. The former only thinks the world into being. The latter needs six eras, or indefinite time, for the same piece of work. It...", "...to encounter the painter's.

Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter.

The necessity for more ordinations was the chief reason why the Church Missionary Society so earnestly advocated an increase of bishops.

Our next move took us in a west-north-west direction, and in our progress we not only secured abundant game of the ordinary varieties, but encountered and killed a young lion,--to use the popular term,--the first living specimen I had seen in the country. I had seen their skins in possession of the Indians, and heard stories of their chase. This was a youthful creature, about the size of a well-grown calf of <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> weeks. I was riding side by side with the chief across a piece of low bushy land, when the dogs gave token that they scented something uncommon. We halted, and the chief cried out to the dogs, \"Chew! Chew!\" They were off in a jiffey, rushing hither and thither through the bushes, barking furiously, and soon drove the beast from his covert. Other Indians, a little distance off, ascertaining what was in the wind, made after the game with a reinforcement of dogs. The chase began in...", "...not a few on the roof, handling the baskets there so roughly, as to occasion loud complaints from the fowls within. I rode up to the carriage, to see that the people inside were not improperly treated; but the only one there was an old gouty gentleman, who, from the nature of his cargo, must either have robbed his own house, or that of a very good fellow, for the carriage was literally laden with wines and provisions. Never did victors make a more legal or useful capture; for it was now <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> in the evening, and it had evidently been the old gentleman's fault if he had not already dined, whereas it was our misfortune, rather than our fault, that we had not tasted anything since three o'clock in the morning, so that when one of our men knocked the neck off a bottle, and handed it to me, to take a drink, I nodded to the old fellow's health, and drank it off without the smallest scruple of conscience.

THE INHABITANTS.

The way there is by a narrow road cut in the Montagne Verte, and overhung with lavender and bunches of wild flowers. We entered upon a street <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> feet in width: it is the main street. Scarlet-capped children, wondering at their own magnificence, stood bolt upright in the doorways and looked on us in silent admiration.

The growth of a grade of American hemp that will sell for <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> to eight cents per pound, instead of three to three and a half cents per pound, as at the present time, means that our farmers must follow more closely the careful practices of Europe, and especially that they must adopt water retting in place of the present practice of dew retting, which gives a fiber dark in color and uneven in quality. A careful consideration of the practices of Italy and France as set forth in Fiber Report No. 11, Department of Agriculture, will materially aid...", "...we afterwards found to be Chain Island, discovered in my former voyage. But as I was not sure of it at this time, and being desirous of avoiding the delay which lying by in the night occasioned, I hoisted out the cutter, and manned her with an officer and seven men, with orders to keep as far a-head of the ships, with a light at her masthead, as a signal could be distinguished, which she was to make in case she met with any danger. In this manner we continued to run all night; and, at <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> o'clock the next morning, I called her on board, and hoisted her in. For it did not appear she would be wanted again for this purpose, as we had now a large swell from the south, a sure sign that we were clear of the low islands; therefore I steered for Otaheite without being apprehensive of meeting with any danger.

Had he remained in his original encampment his force would have been annihilated by the overwhelming numbers of the enemy so soon as they reached the right bank of Nieuport haven, while Maurice could have only looked hopelessly on from the opposite shore. At least nothing worse than absolute destruction could befal him now.

The most conspicuous building, as seen from our camp, is a detached sort of fortress, which looks like nothing so much as the castle of Bluebeard in a pantomime. It stands on a rising knoll, and consists of a square building of two stories high. Upon the top, and greatly overhanging each side, are four extraordinary-looking erections, like great dog-kennels or pigeon-cots, but which must be <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> or seven feet square. Almost the whole of these constructions project over the walls. What may be the use of these curious appendages to the tower, it is impossible to say. Next to this square tower stands a building as incongruous with it in its construction as it is possible to conceive. It is round, and has a high thatched roof, like a beehive. In addition to these main structures are several low sheds. The whole are enclosed in a high wall with a tower in it, underneath which...", "...of laws.[7] Accordingly, July 30, 1619, the first legislative assembly that ever convened on the American continent met in the church at Jamestown. It consisted of the governor, six councillors, and twenty burgesses, two from each of ten plantations.

The assembly, after a prayer from Rev. Richard Buck, of Jamestown, sat <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> days and did a great deal of work. Petitions were addressed to the company in England for permission to change \"the savage name of Kecoughtan,\" for workmen to erect a \"university and college,\" and for granting the girls and boys of all the old planters a share of land each, \"because that in a new plantation it is not known whether man or woman be the more necessary.\" Laws were made against idleness, drunkenness, gaming, and other misdemeanors, but the death penalty was prescribed...", "...the tendons, and took more wine in a week than he had done for many years.

The first onset was received and checked, and the battle commenced and lasted until about three o'clock in the evening. During that time six successive charges were made, which were <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> times gallantly repulsed, each time with fearful loss to the enemy. Later in the evening my lines were several times assaulted vigorously, but each time with like result. The worst of the fighting occurred on General Harrow's and Morgan L.

During the milling, these processes of crushing the grain and removing the bran are repeated from <span class=\"clocktext\">six</span> to nine times, each pair of rollers being set somewhat closer than the pair before, until the grain is pulverized.
