My anxiety to show the country and its cattle met a hearty second in Mr. Hunter, and abandoning the buckboard, we took horses and rode up the Brazos River as far as old Fort Belknap. All cattle were wintering strong. Turning south, we struck the Clear Fork above my range and spent a night at the ranch, where my men had built a second cabin, connecting the two by a hallway. After riding through my stock for two days, we turned back for the Brazos. My ranch hands had branded <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> hundred calves the fall before, and while riding over the range I was delighted to see so many young steers in my different brands. But our jaunt had only whetted the appetite of my guest to see more of the country, and without any waste of time we started south with the buckboard, going as far as Comanche County. Every day's travel brought us in contact with cattle for sale; the prices were an incentive, but we turned east and came back up the valley of the Brazos.

The Argentine mind is fed upon French thought, science, and literature. It is now, however, to be seen that the intellectual influence of France is losing ground, as well as her commercial influence, as to-day the sense of national fraternity is based upon solidarity of interest. Now the decadence of French trade with the Argentine is truly alarming. If we consult the publications of the National Department of Statistics, we find, for instance, that in the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years from 1876 to 1907 the German exports to the Argentine have increased by 2450 per cent.; the Belgian, by 1002 per cent.; those from the United States by 1898 per cent.; Italian exports by 907 per cent.; English by 992 per cent.; but French exports have increased only by 204 per cent. Compared with other nations, France has least been able to hold her own in the matter of trade with the Argentine. In 1876 the importations from France formed 23.2 per cent. of the total...", "...was evidently moulded into its present shape by an Austrian or Tyrolese craftsman--a singer well versed in court poetry and courtly etiquette. The date when the Nibelungenlied received its latest form was probably about the end of the twelfth century, and this last version was the immediate source of our present manuscripts. The date of the earliest known manuscript of the Nibelungenlied is comparatively late. We possess in all twenty-eight more or less complete manuscripts preserved in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> fragments, fifteen of which date from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Its Fragmentary Nature Even a surface examination is sufficient to testify to the fragmentary nature of the Nibelungenlied. We can discern through the apparent unity of texture of the work as we now possess it the patchwork where scribe or minstrel has interpolated this incident or joined together these passages to secure the necessary unity of narrative. Moreover, in none of the several...", "...admitted that machinery, in the largest sense of the word, has increased the means of every man to procure a shelter from the elements, and to give him a multitude of conveniences within that shelter. Most will agree that a greater number of persons are profitably employed in affording this shelter and these conveniences, with tools and machines, than if they possessed no such mechanical aids to their industry.

But after the close of the Civil War the production increased by leaps and bounds, till in 1907 it was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> times as great as in 1865; and the percentage which it formed of the world's production rose to some 14% in 1870, 21% in 1880, 35% in 1900 and 43% in 1907. In this last year the United States production of pig iron was nearly 7 times, and that of Germany and Luxemburg nearly 5 times, that of 1880. In this same period the production of Great Britain increased 28%, and that of the world more than tripled.

To-day a depth of thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> feet has been attained. At its narrowest points the St. Lawrence has a steamship channel four hundred and fifty feet wide and thirty feet deep from side to side. In the days when high insurance rates were established against the St. Lawrence route, there was practically not a lighthouse nor channel buoy from Tadousac to the Straits of Belle Isle.

The women were kept in a perpetual state of alarm by the proximity of the savages. Maternal love and anxiety for those <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> innocent children now exposed to captivity and death at the hands of the prowling redskins, made the lives of those unfortunate matrons one long, sad vigil.

Help get down some of these tins.\" There was no lack of response to this appeal, and the sun rose upon a busy scene. Glasses and beakers clinked, and men sat or stood around, devouring \"bully\" beef or canned tongues and other provisions, some of the rougher sort now and then shying the empty tins in scornful hate at the dead bodies of the fallen savages--for, after all, the corpses of four of their countrymen still lay unburied within. \"You've done for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> all told, Jekyll,\" presently remarked Overton, who had set some of his men to count the dead immediately around the place. \"Not a bad bag for seven guns.

Masters and society in general were burdened with the care of illegitimate mulatto children, and it became necessary to frame laws compelling the guilty parties to reimburse the masters for the maintenance of these unfortunate waifs.\"[457] To remedy this laws were passed in 1715 and 1717 to reduce to the status of a servant for seven years any white man or white woman who cohabited with any Negro, free or slave. Their children were made servants for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, a black thus concerned was reduced to slavery for life and the maintenance of the bastard children of women servants was made incumbent upon masters. If the father of an illegitimate child could be discovered, he would have to support his offspring.

A common average crop is three-fifths of a pound of mushrooms to the square foot of bed, and a good fair average is four-fifths of a pound. This would give over a thousand pounds of mushrooms a season from this cellar when it is in full running capacity.

Thirty of these we find in the lists of Manetho, an Egyptian priest who lived in the third century B.C., and who compiled a chronicle of the kings of the country from the manuscripts kept in the Egyptian temples.

About ten years ago the priest was induced to take a farm that had been held by a former parish priest; the previous proprietor, the father of the defendant, promising a lease for three lives, or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years. After the priest entered into possession the landlord ascertained that he could not fulfil his promise. 'As he did not possess such a power under the terms of the estate settlement, he offered, instead, a lease for the priest's own life, and 20 l. to aid in building a house. The priest continued in possession of the farm, and paid the rent agreed on, thus, as he alleged, accepting the arrangement proposed.

There was another close by, which I did not see, thirty-three feet; and I heard of one no less than forty feet. These trees are remarkable for their smooth cylindrical boles, which run up to a height of sixty, and even ninety feet, with a nearly equal diameter, and without a single branch. The crown of branches at the summit is out of all proportion small to the trunk; and the leaves are likewise small compared with the branches.

Chief Engineer Judah, in his report, had designated Barmore's, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles from Sacramento, as the beginning of the mountains. This corresponded with a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, made in April, 1864, in the case of the Liedsdorff grant.

Not content with slaughtering an enemy who meets him in honorable battle, defending his wife and home, he thrust thongs of ox-hide through the prostrate Hector's feet, bound him to...", "...with the command against Crown Point and Ticonderoga, though Lord Howe was sent out with the last named as the real soul of the enterprise.

James Wolfe, but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years old, had already been eighteen years in the army; was at Dettingen and Fontenoy, and had won laurels at Laffeldt.

But the transactions of the British fire offices have grown much more rapidly, and indicate that, outside of the metropolitan district, the practice of insurance has extended greatly.

Between the years 1820 and 1830, however, a moderate reform of Parliament had been advocated by the leaders of the Whig party. In 1830 this party rather unexpectedly obtained a majority in Parliament, for the first time for a long while, and the ministry immediately introduced a reform bill. It proposed to take away the right of separate representation from fifty-six towns, and to reduce the number of representatives from two to one in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> others; to transfer these representatives to the more populous towns and counties; to extend the franchise to a somewhat larger number and to equalize it; and finally to introduce lists of voters, to keep the polls open for only two days, and to correct a number of such minor abuses.

FOR ENGLAND, HOME, AND DUTY. THE DEATH OF NELSON. It was the 21st October, 1805. The English fleet had been for many days lying off the coast of Spain, eagerly waiting for the navies of France and Spain to leave their shelter in Cadiz harbour. At length, to his joy, Lord Nelson received the signal that they had put out to sea; and he now prepared to attack the combined fleet (which consisted of forty vessels) with his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> ships. Yet, though the enemy not only had more vessels, but they were larger than his own, Nelson confidently expected victory, and told Captain Blackwood he would not be satisfied unless he captured twenty ships.

Thus, in a house of seventy-three members only, reduced to sixty-nine by the absence of Howard, Russell, Wentworth, and Grey, Gardiner had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> votes whom he might count upon as certain; he knew his power, and at once made fatal use of it.

There remained with him <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> men, besides the squaw and two children of Pierre Dorion. There was no game to be met with in the neighborhood; but beavers were occasionally trapped about the river banks, which afforded a scanty supply of food; in the meantime they comforted themselves that some one or other of the foraging detachments would be successful, and return with relief. Mr. Hunt now set to work with all diligence, to prepare caches, in which to deposit the baggage and merchandise, of which it...", "...3, 1872; and in 1873, at his request, I obtained a loan from the Board of Works for the thorough draining of a portion of the farm.

In fourteen hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> an infallible body of ecclesiastics pronounced this young woman to be \"a child of perdition, a sorceress, a seducer, a harlot and a heretic.\" Five hundred years after, another infallible body of ecclesiastics belonging to the same church pronounced the same \"harlot\" and \"heretic\" to be \"angelic\" and \"divine.\" One infallible pope allowed her to be burned in fourteen hundred thirty-one; another infallible pope denounced her murderers as detestable criminals--which shows how...", "...house at Bath, came to live with her.

Her immense correspondence occupied a very large portion of her time. There was scarcely a person at all prominent in the religious world who was not brought into association with her. Miss More's prolonged life did not close until 1833, when she had arrived at her eighty-ninth year. The <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years that remained to her after quitting Cowslip Green was as full of work and usefulness as the previous part of her life. It will be impossible within the space now left to do more than indicate the chief events of this period, which was not remarkable for any fresh departure either in educational or religious work. Miss More had already marked out for herself two distinct and definite lines of usefulness--the education of the poor, and the improvement of morals and...", "...line of communications.

It was known that Clodius had been saved by the wholesale bribery of a large number of the judges. There had been twenty-five for condemning against <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> for acquittal.[226] Cicero in the Catiline affair had used a phrase with frequency by which he boasted that he had \"found out\" this and \"found out\" that--\"comperisse omnia.\" Clodius, in the discussion before the trial, throws this in his teeth: \"Comperisse omnia criminabatur.\" This gave rise to ill-feeling, and hurt Cicero much worse than the dishonor done to the Bona Dea.

These articles differed little from those of the Cortes of Castile.

From this time forward the state of affairs in Acadia was a peculiar one.

Schubert was not a virtuoso and passed his life almost in obscurity, but we now recognize that, although he lived but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, few composers wrought more lastingly than he. Of course, the proper place for an estimate of his genius is in the chapter on song, but as a pianoforte composer he is, even to this day, making his influence more and more felt. Living in Vienna, Beethoven's city, and a fervent admirer of that genius, it was natural that he should have composed sonatas, and there is a whole volume of them among his pianoforte works.

The official returns of France, Belgium and Germany within the last few years, all show that free trade in drink in these countries has proved an utter failure; and that under it, poverty, insanity and crime are increasing with terrible rapidity. Another remarkable illustration of this is to be found in the recent experience of Switzerland. By article <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> of the Swiss Constitution of 1874 freedom of trade is specially guaranteed. The same year as the new Constitution was approved, the canton of Argovie wanted to know if this clause would prevent it limiting the number of drink shops in its borders.

They were travesties of the courts of law, with a lady of rank for a judge, and minstrels for advocates; and they discussed subtle questions relating to affairs of love, usually between troubadours and ladies.

Not unfrequently they led to tragedies, as is easily understood when we notice that the first of one set of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> Laws of Love runs as follows:--'Marriage cannot be pleaded as an excuse for refusing to love.'

LADY DE GULES, like a goose, fancied herself sea-sick, which I believe she would do if a glass of salt-water were set upon her dressing-table; but we would...", "...best cured at a slow stroke. In training for a short course, such as Henley and college races, a crew may be taken twice each day backwards and forwards over the distance; the first time at thirty a minute each way, the second time at the 'set' pace of the day, over the course, relapsing into the usual 'thirty' on the reverse journey. The 'set' stroke depends on the stage of training. A fortnight before the race the crew may begin to cover the course, on the second journey, at about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> a minute. A stroke a day can be added to this, until racing pace is reached. If men seem stale, an off-day should be given at light work. Meantime, each day, attention should be paid to 'starting,' so that all may learn to get hold of the first stroke well together. In order to accustom the men to a quicker stroke and to getting forward faster, a few strokes may be rowed, in each start, at a pace somewhat in advance of the rate of stroke set for the day's grind over the...", "...and honorable a gentleman.\" \"I thank you, fair sir,\" said Nigel feebly. \"I also rejoice that I have encountered so debonair a person, and I shall ever bear in mind the pleasure which I have had from our meeting.\" So saying, he laid his bleeding head upon his enemy's brazen front and sank into a dead faint. XV. HOW THE RED FERRET CAME TO COSFORD The old chronicler in his \"Gestes du Sieur Nigel\" has bewailed his broken narrative, which rose from the fact that out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of warfare no less than seven were spent by his hero at one time or another in the recovery from his wounds or from those illnesses which arose from privation and fatigue. Here at the very threshold of his career, on the eve of a great enterprise, this very fate befell him. Stretched upon a couch in a low-roofed and ill-furnished chamber, which looks down from under the machicolated corner turret upon the inner court of the Castle of Calais, he lay half-unconscious...", "...and his men withdrew, and Drake was left with less than fifty. But he was determined to be revenged on Spain for the treachery to Hawkins at Ulua (the modern Vera Cruz); and equally determined to get some Spanish treasure. So, keeping out of sight for the next five months, till the rainy season was over and the next treasure train was ready, he went wide of Nombre de Dios and made for Panama (the Pacific end of the trail across the Isthmus). He had nineteen picked Englishmen and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> Maroons, who, being the offspring of Negro slaves and Indians, hated Spaniards like poison and knew the country to a foot. On the 7th of February, 1573, from the top of a gigantic tree that stood on the Divide, Drake first saw the Pacific. Vowing to sail an English ship across the great South Sea he pushed on eagerly. Three days later his fifty men were lying in wait for the mule train bringing gold from Panama. All had their shirts on over their coats, so as to know...", "...stood the Temple of Jerusalem, which was the work of the Phoenician builders whom Hiram lent to Solomon.[66] These substructions, laid bare at their base by the excavations of the Palestine Exploration Fund, are found to consist of blocks measuring from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and from ten to twelve feet in height. The width of the blocks at the angles of the wall, where alone it can be measured, is from twelve to eighteen feet. At the south-west angle no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> courses of this massive character have been counted by the recent explorers, who estimate the weight of the largest block at something above a hundred tons![67] A similar method of construction is found to have prevailed at Tyre, at Sidon, at Aradus, at Byblus, at Leptis Major, at Eryx, at Motya, at Gaulos, and at Lixus on the West African coast. The blocks employed do not reach the size of the largest discovered at Jerusalem, but still are of dimensions greatly exceeding...", "...you are, MacKay!\" exclaimed Captain Whiteley, bringing his fist down on the table with a thump which threatened to throw on the floor the few dishes which the motion of the ship had not already dashed out of the retaining frames. \"Right you are!

And we wished that we were dead. We would have been dead, too, before long.

I was shown at Guadalajara a piece of scarlet cloth, which, both for its excellent quality and for its skilful dyeing, seemed to me to be quite comparable with the best cloths of Julienne. These latter cost at their place of manufacture as much as thirty-nine _livres_ the ell. At Guadalajara, I noted from the tariff established in the factory, that the price of the finest scarlet cloth was only from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> to thirty-two _livres_ the ell. Comparing these and other figures on the tariff, I came to the conclusion that there was about the same difference in price between Spanish cloths and French cloths, in favour of the former. What seems more singular still is that the factories which work at the King's expense are generally administered in a thriftless fashion, and that the factory of Guadalajara was being greatly mismanaged at the time in question.

Her sorrow was like sympathy for a mangy alley cat which she could not take home. She had no place to go. She walked for hours, planlessly, and dined at a bakery and lunch-room in Harlem. Sometimes she felt homeless, and always she was prosaically footsore, but now and then came the understanding that she again had a chance. CHAPTER XIX So, toward the end of 1912, when she was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years old, Mrs. Una Golden Schwirtz began her business career, as confidential secretary to Mr. Truax, of Truax & Fein. Her old enemy, routine, was constantly in the field.

No doubt you will be told that the government spending program of the past five years did not cause the increase in our national income. They will tell you that business revived because of private spending and investment. That is true in part, for the government spent only a small part of the total. But that government spending acted as a trigger to set off private activity. That is why the total addition to our national...", "...They are not opposed to slavery; to the slavery of three millions of men. They may not like slavery in the abstract, or they may like it, I do not pretend to judge; but slavery in the concrete, at the South, they do like; opposition to that slavery, in the mildest form, or the sternest, they do hate. That is a serious charge to bring against the prominent rulers of the State. Let me call your attention to a few facts which prove it. Look at the men we send to Congress. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> New England men in Congress. By the most liberal construction you can only make out five anti-slavery men in the whole number. Who ever heard of an anti-slavery Governor of Massachusetts in this century? Men know what they are about when they select candidates for election. Do the voters always know what they are about when they choose them? Then these men always are in favor of a pro-slavery President. The President must be a slaveholder. There have been fifteen...", "...the Thunderer making sail for the fleet; that he was waiting for the Centaur, Terrible, and Vigilant; and that having received advice from Lord Shuldham that the Shrewsbury was to sail from Plymouth on Thursday, he should likewise wait for her.

The French fleet sailed on the 7th, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> ships of the line, two fifty-gun ships, and eight frigates.

He was always victorious, but the nations whom he crushed never accepted defeat. As soon as his back was well turned they flew to arms, and again drew him from his repose in the great palace which he had built at Calach, close to that of his father.[69] Under the immediate successors of Shalmaneser the Assyrian _prestige_ was maintained at a high level by dint of the same lavish...", "...intention in asking you the question was not to be told a commonplace which he knew as well as you, but to learn your true opinion as to his life or death.

Professor Miles, of the Michigan Agricultural College, was engaged to give expert advice; other locations were examined, and finally Moreton Lodge Farm, near Guelph, was purchased.

Its development along practical lines and its recognition as a potent factor in provincial growth were largely due to...", "...Lauder.

And that day was the seventh of the month, and that month, he reckoned with awful distinctness, had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> days in it! It is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twenty-four days on fifty shillings. Nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in all the loneliness of London. Dick paid seven shillings a week for his lodging, which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and drink. Naturally, his first purchase was of the materials of his craft; he had been without them too long.

Next I compared my chronometer with Captain Wooley's. Captain Wooley, the harbourmaster, gives the time to Suva, firing a gun signal at twelve, noon, three times a week. According to his chronometer mine was fifty-nine seconds fast, which is to say, that, sailing west, I should be crashing on the reef when I thought I was fifteen miles off from it. I compromised by subtracting <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> seconds from the total of my chronometer's losing error, and sailed away for Tanna, in the New Hebrides, resolved, when nosing around the land on dark nights, to bear in mind the other seven miles I might be out according to Captain Wooley's instrument. Tanna lay some six hundred miles west- southwest from the Fijis, and it was my belief that while covering that distance I could quite easily knock into my head sufficient navigation to get me there.

I went to Alder Creek Camp to get the money. I had a difficult journey. The wagons of the Donners were loaded with tobacco, powder, caps, school-books, shoes, and dry goods. This stock was very valuable. I spent the night there, searched carefully among the bales and bundles of goods, and found five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> dollars. Part of this sum was gold, part silver. The silver I buried at the foot of a pine tree, a little way from camp. One of the lower branches of another tree reached down close to the ground, and appeared to point to the spot. I put the gold in my pocket, and started back to my cabin; got lost, and in crossing a little flat the snow suddenly gave way, and I sank down almost to my arm-pits.

With a view to supplementing this knowledge, and making the condition of the Upper Province known to the world, he addressed a series of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> questions to the principal inhabitants of each township. Looking over these questions at this distance of time, the reader, unless he be minutely acquainted with the state of affairs in Upper Canada in 1817, will be amazed to think that the seeking for such information should have been regarded by any one as criminal or objectionable. Not one of the questions is unimportant, and the answers, taken collectively, form a photographic representation of the condition of the...", "...a like healthy suspicion of manuscripts and inscriptions, however ancient; for a bulletin may lie, even though it be written in cuneiform characters.

The tribesmen with whom we had just made friends sat in hundreds on the ridges watching the progress of the fight.

At Rosedale the tracks are crossed again at the station, and the run into and through Hammonton is made, the road being pretty good if you keep to the side paths. This makes in all about thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles, and the rider can stop at Hammonton for the night, though there are very few good accommodations, or even passable ones, to be found anywhere on the route from Philadelphia to Atlantic City; but the lack of good accommodations is really the one objection to making a two-days-trip of the Atlantic City route.

Curio denounced him to Pompey, and Vettius was thrown into prison, where he was afterward found dead, before the truth of the matter could be brought out. Of course Curio's opposition to Caesar effected little, except, perhaps, in drawing Caesar's attention to him as a clever politician. To Curio's quaestorship in Asia reference has already been made. It fell in 53 B.C., and from his incumbency of this office we can make an approximate estimate of his date of birth. Thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> was probably the minimum age for holding the quaestorship at this time, so that Curio must have been born about 84 B.C. From Cicero's letter to him, which has been given above, it would seem to follow that he had performed his duties in his province with eminent success. During his absence from Rome his father died, and with his father's death one stimulating cause of his dislike for Caesar may have disappeared.

On January 24 two fleets put to sea, one under Dirk Simonsz Uitgeest for the coast of Brazil; another under Pieter Adriansz Ita for the West Indies. Both were successful and came back laden with spoil. It was reserved, however, for the expedition under Piet Hein to make all other successes seem small. This fleet, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> ships of war, left Holland at the end of May for the West Indies with instructions to lie in wait for the Spanish Treasure Fleet. Many attempts had been made in previous years to intercept the galleons, which year by year carried the riches of Mexico and Peru to Spain, but they had always failed. After some weeks of weary cruising, Piet Hein, when off the coast of Cuba, was rewarded (September 8) by the sight of the Spanish fleet approaching, and at once bore down upon them....", "...faster than the interest upon the debt.

The difference in yield between the two was greatest at first, and diminished toward the last, which practically amounts to the same thing as the male being earlier than the female.

C, during the spring of 1915 was so unusual that it is believed that a short account, together with a list of the records, will be of interest to the readers of BIRD-LORE. In considering the following remarks, it may be well to bear in mind that records of the bird migration in this locality have been made each year for the past <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years. Also, the amount of time spent in making observations during the past season is significant. From March 19 to May 7, field trips were made by Mr. Bruner on forty-seven days out of a possible fifty. Prior to and after this period observations were made by him for several weeks at intervals of from two to four days.

On the 18th the left wing advanced South-East on Frettes and Champlitte, the right assembled at Is sur Tille, and its advanced guard, after a march of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles, reached the bridges at Gray. On the flank and rear of the Corps there had been some trivial fighting, but the cruel march across the mountains had been accomplished, and the cultivated valley of the Saone was reached. General von Manteuffel had already received news of the satisfactory course of the first day's fighting on the Lisaine. Later telegrams from General von Werder reported that the French Army of the East would probably be obliged to retire under...", "...went again in search of the mayor, whom he had failed to find earlier in the day. On the way he was joined by poor Faller, pale as death, and crying: \"Oh, this is horrible, horrible! A thunder-bolt from a clear sky!\" Lenz tried to reassure him. Two and a half thousand florins was something of a loss, to be sure, but he hoped to stand under it. He thanked his faithful comrade for his sympathy. \"What!\" cried Faller, stopping short on the road, \"are you involved too? He owes me <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> florins. He had that amount of mine in good clocks, that I left with him as I should have left them in the bank, meaning to pay off an instalment upon my house. Now I am put back at least two years.\" Lenz hurried on. He could not stop with his friend, but must be off to the mayor's. Faller looked sadly after him, almost forgetting his own misfortune in that of his friend. The doctor was shocked at the blow which had fallen on the landlord. His own loss was...", "...which most delighted him, that Leighton's conceptions were directly and invariably inspired by nature. Those who are conversant with Italy and other Southern countries will possess the key to much that is misjudged by others in Leighton's work. Scenes which entranced his sensibilities as a boy, and, lingering ever in his fancy, gave subjects for his paintings when his art was mature, may appear to one without special knowledge of the South as mere echoes of classic art. When he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> Leighton exhibited the picture \"Lieder ohne Worte.\"[3] It is no record, probably, of any particular place, nor of any particular fountain; but when strolling on a road in or near a southern town or village in Italy, a view which might originally have inspired the motive may be seen at any moment.

Police and hospital ambulances were soon filled with the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> wounded men, who were taken to the city hospital.

On our arrival the men found their rations cooked and their quarters prepared; but, having arrived the last, our regiment had the worst accommodation, and eight hundred men were pent up in a building scarcely capacious enough for half the number. The soldiers were in consequence much crowded, and slept upon the straw without any bedding, and most uncomfortably.

According to Cicero, Marcus Crassus, for reasons known to himself, had been interested in Clodius. During the night he sent for the judges one by one. He gave them money. What else he either gave or promised them, must continue veiled in Cicero's Latin.[2] Before these influences the resolution of the judges melted away, and when the time came, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> out of fifty-six high-born Roman peers and gentlemen declared Clodius innocent. The original cause was nothing.

This is the largest quantity I ever heard of, and the largest tree I ever saw, being upwards of twenty feet high and of proportionate dimensions.\" The Doctor is of opinion, however, that as the coffee-tree begins to bear at the end of its fourth year, an _average_ yield at the end of the sixth year may be calculated on of at least four pounds. Three hundred trees may be planted on an acre, giving each twelve feet, and in six years the culture will become profitable...", "...and Taylor crossed the river with the main body of his little army.

Dr. Furnivall has divided the play into two parts, with fifty-one scenes altogether, twenty in the first and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> in the second part. There is some evidence that some of the scenes were inserted only to give time for a shift of scenes. Probably they had two pageants or movable trucks which would remind one somewhat of the movable stage that was attempted in the last generation. The burning of the temple and some of the incidents of the wanderings at sea may very well have provided opportunity for spectacular effects of ambitious character.

The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large. But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden, instead of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> millions as now. And not only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first national census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a population of 103,208,415.

You have no right to come this sort of move.\" Such was the language of the heir of Mr. Tite Barnacle, and it faithfully mirrors the sentiments of the Canadian oligarchy and their hangers-on towards Mr. Gourlay in the year of grace 1817. Most of them had a pecuniary interest in preserving the existing state of things undisturbed. No taxes were imposed on unsettled lands, and a goodly...", "...Holy Grail,\" \"The Charge of the Light Brigade,\" \"The Revenge,\" \"The Defence of Lucknow,\" \"In the Valley of Cauteretz.\" With regard to this beautiful poem I cannot help recalling an amusing and most unexpected laugh.

Many Spanish Californians were represented on the floor. The different points brought up and discussed, in addition to those finally incorporated in the constitution, are both a valuable measure of the degree of intelligence at that time, and an indication of what men considered important in the problems of the day. The constitution itself was one of the best of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> state constitutions that then existed. Though almost every provision in it was copied from some other instrument, the choice was good. A provision prohibiting slavery was carried by a unanimous vote.

The British captain's report was quite different. He insisted that the \"President\" fired the first shot, that the action continued nearly an hour, that it was his hail to which no attention was paid, and finally he intimated that the \"President\" had rather the worse of the encounter. The last statement is easily disproved, for the \"President\" was almost unscathed, and the only injury to her people was the slight wounding of a boy, in the hand. On the \"Little Belt,\" <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> were killed or wounded. The other points led to a simple question of veracity between the two officers. Each government naturally accepted the report of its officer; and, so far as the governments were concerned, the matter soon passed into oblivion.

All Carteret's nautical ability, all his _sang-froid_, all his enthusiasm were needed to save so inefficient a vessel from destruction, and to make important discoveries, under such conditions.

In 1896-7 the number was two hundred and twenty-seven thousand men and in 1906-7, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> thousand five hundred men. But the remarkable circumstance comes out that in British cavalry and infantry there is no increase. The only important addition to the fighting strength of the army are an increase in our artillery and an increase in the number of British officers to the tune of one thousand.

Just what period this work embraced is not certain, but the suggestion that each book treated of one year and that the whole was a history of the years 41-71 A. D. is not improbable.

In view of chronological difficulties, it has been found convenient to adopt the dynastic system of reckoning chosen by Manetho, an Egyptian priest who lived in the third century before Christ. Manetho divided the history of Egypt into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> dynasties, of which some twenty-six comprise the period between Mena's Conquest and the Persian Conquest, while the others cover the period of Persian, Hellenic, and Latin supremacy.

Of a partridge shot and divided into six portions Franklin says: \"I and my companions ravenously devoured our shares, as it was the first morsel of flesh any of us had tasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> days.\" The praiseworthy conduct of Franklin and of his companions in prosecuting the work of outlining the arctic coasts of North America is not to be measured alone by the fortitude and courage shown in crossing the barren grounds.

It is situated to the south of the deanery. It is of small dimensions, being only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> feet long; and this is exactly double its breadth. The vaulted roof springs from clustered shafts in the walls; in the eastern half, on each side, are two tall windows of two lights, with most graceful tracery; at the east is a window of five lights, of equally beautiful tracery, filled with stained glass, of which the five lower figures are ancient and said to have been brought from Cologne.

It is interesting to note, on looking over a catalogue of the Kennel Club Show, that in 1884 the classes for Toy Spaniels numbered five, with two championship prizes, one each for Blenheims and Black and Tans, and the total entries were 19. At this date neither Tricolours nor Rubies were recognised as a separate variety by the Kennel Club, and they had no place in the register of breeds until the year 1902. At the Kennel Club show in 1904 <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> classes were provided and eight challenge certificate prizes were given, the entries numbering 109. The formation of the Toy Spaniel Club in 1885, and the impetus given to breeders and exhibitors by the numerous shows with good classification, have caused this beautiful breed to become more popular year by year. Fifty years ago the owners might be almost counted on the fingers of one's hands; now probably the days of the year would hardly cover them.

The precise statistical relation between them in the State of New York would seem to be this: about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> per cent. of the adult criminals cannot read or write, while of the adult population at large about six (6.08) per cent. are illiterate; or nearly one-third of the crime is committed by six-hundredths of the population.

He found in it the seeds of no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> different water and marsh plants (Grasses, Sedges, Toad-rush, etc.). This showed, as is very often the case, that Darwin was the first to discover a very important point.

C.) into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> dynasties. Manetho's dynasties enable scholars to determine the relative order of the kings, and thus form the backbone of our chronology. Around his statements the discoveries of the excavators and explorers are grouped. Manetho's work has not, however, come down to us.

He was so brave a Northman that he became king over the whole of Norway. In eight hundred and sixty-one, when he began to reign, Norway was divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> little kingdoms, over each of which ruled a little king. Harald Fairhair began his reign by being one of these little kings. Harald was only a boy, ten years of age, when he succeeded his father; but as he grew up he became a very strong and handsome man, as well as a very wise and prudent one. Indeed he grew so strong that he fought with and vanquished five great kings in one battle.

There being no fences to separate the great ranches, cattle roamed at will; nor were the owners seriously concerned, for every man had his distinct, registered brand and in proper season the various herds were segregated by means of _rodeos_, or round-ups of strayed or mixed cattle.

After the advent of the SYREN, the Bonins became the favourite fishing-ground for both Americans and British, and for many years the catch of oil taken from these teeming waters averaged four thousand tuns annually. That the value of the fishery was maintained at so high a level for over a quarter of a century was doubtless due to the fact that there was a long, self-imposed close season, during which...", "...cloud cobwebs from the sky till the cheery old sun smiled again, and shone Mother Nature a bright \"good morning.\" \"Now March,\" said she, \"there is one more thing you can do to help.

If this plan is executed, and succeeds, as is projected, without interruption for one hundred years, the sum will then be one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> thousand pounds, of which I would have the managers of the donation to the town of Boston then lay out, at their discretion, one hundred thousand pounds in public works, which may be judged of most general utility to the inhabitants, such as fortifications, bridges, aqueducts, public buildings, baths, pavements, or whatever may make living in the town more convenient to its people, and render it more agreeable to strangers resorting thither for health or a temporary...", "...gain of thirty-three pounds more of weight, with the use of five bushels less of food for those curried, than for the neglected ones. This result was owing to the fact that all the functions of the body were more perfectly performed when, by friction, the skin was kept free from filth and the blood in it exposed to the air. The same will be true of the human skin. A calculation has been made on this fact, by which it is estimated that a man, by proper care of his skin, would save over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> dollars in food yearly, which is the interest on over five hundred dollars. If men will give as much care to their own skin, as they give to currying a horse, they will gain both health and wealth. XII. CLOTHING.

In a few minutes the full significance of all these ships became known. Here was a sight that no other foreign port in the world had ever seen. Twenty-nine ships were flying the American flag at once. There were really <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> connected with the navy, directly and indirectly, in port, but two of the colliers flew foreign flags.

These were published by Taylor in the California Farmer under date of April 20, 1860. In the fall of 1888 Mr. H. W.

Two women were found in the Salinas Valley to the south who claimed to be of Esselen blood, but neither of them was able to recall any of the language, both having learned in early life to speak...", "...logs from the water, and began the work. A square pen was built, with bastions from each angle, capable of covering a thousand men. The logs were laid in two parallel rows, and sixteen feet apart; bound together with cross-timbers dove-tailed and bolted into logs, and the wide space filled with sand. When completed, it presented the appearance of a solid wall, sixteen feet wide; but its strength was yet to be tested. Behind this, Moultrie placed four hundred and thirty-five men, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> cannon, some of them twenty-sixes, some eighteens, and the rest of smaller caliber--throwing in all five hundred and thirteen pounds. \"It was at this juncture that Lee arrived from the north, and took command of the troops.

Pressing rapidly northward, passing successively Hartwood church, Rappahannock Station, Catlet's Station, Manassas Junction, Centerville and Green Springs--all familiar as the scenes of past experience, and many of them sacred to the memory of dead comrades--they forded the Potomac at Edwards' Ferry on the 25th of June and reached the mouth of the Monocacy, having marched <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles on that day. Arriving at that point, tired and foot-sore, as may be imagined after such a march, they found an aide-de-camp ordered to conduct them to their allotted camp ground. He appeared to be one of those nice young men who were so often appointed to positions on the staff for their beauty or their fragrance, or for the general elegance of manners, rather than for their ability to be of any real service. This young person, with no apparent idea of where he wanted...", "...that does not involve absolute extinction. Is it, then, a matter of surprise that Florida is so sparsely populated?\" CHAPTER II.

A local tobacconist is a person in authority, a State official, and the nation safeguards the interests and the fair name of those who serve it faithfully.

Now this particular tobacconist, though tremulously sensitive, like all Southerners, on a point of honour, was as good-natured and forgiving as might be consistent with his rank of Government official. He passed for a respectable married man with an...", "...and fulness, indicating a soprano voice of great power. The song was encored, and Miss Greenfield came back, took her seat at the piano, and began, to the astonishment of the audience, a different air in a deep and very clear bass or barytone voice, which she maintained throughout, without any very great appearance of effort or without any breaking! She can, in fact, go as low as Lablache, and as high as Jenny Lind, a power of voice perfectly astonishing. It is said she can strike <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> full clear notes, and we could readily believe it. After the surprise had subsided, there was time to find out the errors and defects. It must be confessed that Miss Greenfield has a very heedless way of throwing her beautiful notes about, has far from perfect command over them, and wants the knowledge of ornamental points, which can only be given by instruction from the best masters. There were plenty evidences that it was not from lack of ability to understand what was...", "...But some refused to run, and others had no chance, so that the contest was really between General Grant and Horace Greeley, who was caricatured unmercifully. The benevolent face of the great editor, spectacled, and fringed with a snow-white beard, appeared on fans, on posters, on showcards, where, as a setting sun, it might be seen going down behind the western hills. \"Go west,\" his famous advice to young men, became the slang phrase of the hour. He was defeated, for Grant carried <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> states, and Greeley six. In many respects this was a most interesting election. For the first time in our history the freedmen voted for presidential electors. For the first time since 1860 the people of all the states took part in the election of a President of the United States, while the number of candidates, Labor, Prohibition, Liberal Republican, Democratic, and Republican, showed that the old issues which caused the war or were caused by the war were dead or dying,...", "...the amount of its flow a matter of practical importance and popular observation, is the sugar maple, Acer saccharinum, of the Anglo-American Provinces and States.

[Footnote: Emerson (Trees of Massachusetts. p. 403) mentions a maple six feet in diameter, as having yielded a barrel, or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> and a half gallons, of sap in twenty-four hours, and another, the dimensions of which are not stated, as having yielded one hundred and seventy-five gallons in the course of the season.

Of her children, her daughter Beatrice was afterwards rescued by Peter of Aragon, who exchanged for her a son of Charles of Anjou, whom he held prisoner; but the three boys were given over to the cruellest fate. Immured in a narrow dungeon, and loaded with chains, they remained thus half-naked, ill-fed, and untaught for the period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years. Not until 1297 were they released from their chains and allowed to be visited by a priest and a physician. Charles of Anjou, meanwhile, filled with the spirit of cruelty and ambition, sought to destroy every vestige of the Hohenstauffen rule in southern Italy, the scene of Frederick's long and lustrous reign.

The Autonomists sought what their name indicates; the Revolutionists demanded and secured national independence. Shortly before the final dispersion of the Army of the Revolution, there was organized a body with the imposing title of _La Asamblea de Representantes del Ejercito Cubano_, or the Assembly of Representatives of the Cuban Army. It was composed of leaders of the different military divisions of that army, and included, as I recall it, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> members. This group made no little trouble in the early days of the American occupation. It gathered in Havana, held meetings, declared itself the duly chosen and representative agent of the Cuban people, and demanded recognition as such by the American authorities. Some of its members even asserted that it constituted a _de facto_ government, and held that the Americans should turn the whole affair over to them and promptly sail away.

The word _ky[=o]ka_ is written with a Chinese character signifying \"insane\" or \"crazy;\" and it means a particular and extraordinary variety of comic poetry. The form is that of the classic _tanka_ of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> syllables (arranged 57577);--but the subjects are always the extreme reverse of classical; and the artistic effects depend upon methods of verbal jugglery which cannot be explained without the help of numerous examples. The collection published by Takumi includes a good deal of matter in which a Western reader can discover no merit; but the best of it has a distinctly grotesque quality that reminds one of Hood's weird cleverness in playing with grim subjects.

In 1760 hunting on Indians' lands or on other people's lands, shooting in the city, or hunting on Sunday, were forbidden under penalty of whipping up to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> lashes. In 1750-1751 the penalty for offending against the night watch in Philadelphia was made twenty-one lashes and imprisonment in the work-house for three days at hard labor; for the second offence, thirty-one lashes and six days. Sometimes it was provided that a slave might be punished as a free man, if his master would stand for him.

The poems are well known to all Japanese, of whatever sort or condition.

CSOKONAI, MIHALY VITEZ (1773-1805), Hungarian poet, was born at Debreczen in 1773. Having been educated in his native town, he was appointed while still very young to the professorship of poetry there; but soon after he was deprived of the post on account of the immorality of his conduct. The remaining twelve years of his short life were passed in almost constant wretchedness, and he died in his native town, and in his mother's house, when only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of age. Csokonai was a genial and original poet with something of the lyrical fire of Petofi, and wrote a mock-heroic poem called _Dorottya or the Triumph of the Ladies at the Carnival_, two or three comedies or farces, and a number of love-poems. Most of his works have been published, with a life, by Schedel (1844-1847).

Since his manuscript was in type, however, a few additions have been made to our Assyriological knowledge. A fresh examination of the Babylonian dynastic tablet has led Professor Delitzsch to make some alterations in the published account of what Professor Maspero calls the ninth dynasty. According to Professor Delitzsch, the number of kings composing the dynasty is stated on the tablet to be twenty-one, and not <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> as was formerly read, and the number of lost lines exactly corresponds with this figure. The first of the kings reigned thirty-six years, and he had a predecessor belonging to the previous dynasty whose name has been lost.

Fifty-six corrupt boroughs were disfranchised, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> were deprived of one member each, and two others were reduced; and the hitherto inadequate representation of other towns and boroughs was rectified.

The first steamer to cross the Atlantic was the _Savannah_, of 300 tons, which arrived in Liverpool from Savannah, Georgia, in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> days, her voyage having been made partly under sail. So to America belongs the credit of having shown the practicability of employing steam power for the most difficult and dangerous voyages.

Dr. Lardner in particular, and other scientists, expressed their belief that no vessel could carry coal enough to steam...", "...a little dimmed as he reached, smilingly, into the skirts of a somewhat shiny but scrupulously brushed coat and produced a brightly colored handful.

The luck was not altogether against him, for, if every man had his due, von Rheinhoff should have added Tam's scalp to the list of his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> victims. Tam only saved himself by taking the risk of a spinning nose dive into that zone of comparative safety which is represented by the distance between the trajectories of high-angle guns and the flatter curve made by the flight of the eighteen-pounder shell. Nor were his troubles at an end that day, for later he received instructions to watch an observation balloon, which had been the recipient of certain embarrassing attentions from enemy aircraft. And in some...", "...of Worcester sustained the rights of the Colonies, and when, on the 19th of April, 1773, the messenger of war, on his white horse, dashed through the town, shouting, \"To arms! to arms! the war is begun,\" the response was immediate; the bell was rung, cannon fired, and the minute-men, true to name, rallied on the Common, where they were paraded by Capt. Timothy Bigelow. At about five o'clock in the afternoon they took up their line of march. Capt. Benjamin Flagg soon followed, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> men,--a total of one hundred and eight men. Capt. Bigelow having halted at Sudbury, to rest his men, was met by Capt. Flagg, when they both pushed on to Cambridge, where the organization of the army was being made. Timothy Bigelow, whose abilities were at once recognized, was appointed Major in Col. Jonathan Ward's regiment. On the 24th of April another company, of fifty-nine men, all from Worcester, enlisted under Capt. Jonas Hubbard. During the seven dark years that...", "...prepared enemy, in front of batteries and warships, though it needed to be done, was yet, from a military point of view, a very rash act. On the other hand, General Gage made a very unwise military movement. No wonder he was censured for the reckless sacrifice of his soldiers at Bunker Hill. =170. Bunker Hill Monument.=--On the crown of the hill and in the center of the old redoubt stands the splendid monument that tells of this famous struggle. The square shaft is of Quincy granite, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> feet on each side at the base, fifteen feet at the top, two hundred and twenty-one feet in height. Inside, a stairway of two hundred and ninety-four stone steps leads to a room at the top, whose four windows command a view of wonderful extent and beauty. Just by the base of the monument we can see to-day a little grassy ridge, the slight remains of the breastworks of 1775. The corner-stone was laid by Lafayette in 1825, exactly fifty years after the battle, and on that...", "...was to be ransomed, it was they who furnished the money; if costly gifts were to be given to the Pope, it was they who made them. The value of the vessels of gold and silver, the robes and copes of silk and velvet, the chalices, the altar-pieces, and the shrines enriched with jewels, was inestimable. The feasts which the abbots gave were almost regal. At the installation of the abbot of St. Augustine, at Canterbury, there were consumed fifty- eight tuns of beer, eleven tuns of wine, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> oxen, three hundred pigs, two hundred sheep, one thousand geese, one thousand capons, six hundred rabbits, nine thousand eggs, while the guests numbered six thousand people. Of the various orders of the Benedictines there have been thirty-seven thousand monasteries and one hundred and fifty thousand abbots. From the monks, twenty-one thousand have been chosen as bishops and archbishops, and twenty- eight have been elevated to the papal throne. From these things, and...", "...must go by Charing Cross.\" The ballad-writer goes on to deny that the Cross ever spoke a word against the Parliament, though he confesses it might have inclined to Popery; for certain it was that it \"never went to church.\" The workmen were engaged for three months in pulling down the Cross.[374] Some of the stones went to form the pavement before Whitehall; others were polished to look like marble, and were sold to antiquaries for knife-handles. The site remained vacant for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years. After the Restoration Charing Cross was turned into a place of execution. Here Hugh Peters, Cromwell's chaplain, and Major-General Harrison, the sturdy Anabaptist, Colonel Jones, and Colonel Scrope were executed. They all died bravely, without a doubt or a fear. Harrison was the son of a Staffordshire farmer, and had fought bravely at the siege of Basing; he had been major-general in Scotland; had helped Cromwell at the disbanding of the Rump; had served in the...", "...respects his experience had been wide and varied.

And during his frequent visits to Europe and America he had become acquainted with the inner working of the chief universities of the world. Finally he had the unique privilege of being connected with the Presidency College for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, from which no temptation could sever him. He had the deepest sense of the sacred vocation of the teacher. They may well be proud of a consecrated life--consecrated to what? To the guidance of young lives, to the making of men, to the shaping and determining of souls in the dawn of their existence, with their dreams yet to be realised. Education in the West and in the East showed how different customs and ways might yet express a common ideal. In India the teacher...", "...of the situation caught Yorimasa's fancy, for he was very quick-witted, and one day, smiling to himself, he sat down at his writing-table and composed a poem lamenting his bad luck. From the earliest ages the Japanese have trained themselves, at the times when their feelings are stirred by some event which causes happiness or sorrow or disappointment, not to give way to their emotions, but to control their minds sufficiently to compose a poem on the subject. Yorimasa's poem was of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> syllables,[1] and in five short lines he said gracefully that \"one who has not the means of climbing upwards remains under the tree and passes his life in picking up beechnuts.\" Now in Japanese the word for beechnuts is _shi-i_, and this word also means the Fourth Rank at Court. So that the couplet was a pun on his not being promoted. Yorimasa read the poem laughingly to some of his friends, and they, admiring his wit, repeated it and talked about it till it became quite...", "...here will fetch your mistress home for fifteen hundred pounds.\" \"Why, even that is an extortion.\" \"Nay,\" says Jack, \"if you think fifteen hundred pounds too much for my carcase and a ship of twenty men, you may seek a cheaper market and welcome, for I've no stomach to risk my life and property for less.\" \"To the fifteen hundred pounds you must add the ransom of two thousand pounds. Thus Mrs. Godwin and her daughter may be redeemed for thirty-five hundred pounds to her saving of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> thousand five hundred pounds,\" says the Don. And here Dawson and I were secretly struck by his honesty in not seeking to affright the steward from an honest course, but rather tempting him to it by playing upon his parsimony and avarice. \"Three thousand five hundred,\" says Simon, putting it down in writing, that he might the better realise his position. \"But you say, friend merchant, that the risk is as ten to one against seeing thy money again.\" \"I will run the risk...", "...want to come to me.\" \"Well, she mustn't come a step!\" exclaimed the Doctor. \"You'll forbid it, will you not, Doctor?

The city shuddered because it knew, and because it did not know, what was in store. People began to fly by hundreds, and then by thousands. Many were overtaken and stricken down as they fled. Still men plied their vocations, children played in the streets, and the days came and went, fair, blue tremulous with sunshine, or cool and gray and sweet with summer rain. How strange it was for nature to be so beautiful and so unmoved! By and by one could...", "...directions. We explained as well as we could; and then talked of the journeys we had respectively performed. This gave Mustapha an opportunity of astonishing us in his Turkish way. He said that he had come with 200 men and 300 camels from Tripoli in sixteen days, having stopped only one day, and travelled regularly from three in the afternoon to nine next morning. We marvelled, as in duty bound; but refrained not from making inquiries; the result of which was, that the real time was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> days, only eight days less than we had occupied. We did not scold Mustapha for his exaggeration, but might perhaps have done so without offence. When a Turk does tell a lie, he submits to be accused of it with good-humour. After leaving the hyperbolical Governor, we went to see Sheikh Mohammed Boro, Sakontaroua of Aghadez, who has arrived here _en route_ from Mekka. He was recommended to us by Hassan Pasha of Tripoli; but Mr. Gagliuffi does not think much of him. We shall...", "...that he has pictured not only Gustaf Vasa and Master Olof, but also the other historical characters, in close accordance with what history has to tell us about them. Among the chief figures there is only one--Gert the Printer--who is not known to history, and one--the wife of Olof--who is so little known that the playwright has been at liberty to create it almost wholly out of his own imagination. At the juncture represented by the initial scenes of the play, Olof was in reality <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years old, but he is made to appear still younger. The King should be, and is, about twenty-seven, while Lars Andersson is about fifty-four, and Bishop Brask about seventy. Gert must be thought a man of about sixty, while Christine must be about twenty. The action of the play lasts from 1524 to 1540, but Strindberg has contracted the general perspective, so to speak, giving us the impression that the entire action takes place within a couple of years. I have tried to work...", "...tentacles had re-expanded; but in one leaf, a dozen, and in a second leaf, half a dozen, submarginal tentacles had become inflected. As the glands of the five leaves in the solution were simultaneously darkened, no doubt they had all absorbed a nearly equal amount of the salt: and as 1/288 of a grain was given to the five leaves together, each got 1/1440 of a grain (.045 mg.). I did not count the tentacles on these leaves, which were moderately fine ones, but as the average number on <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> leaves was 192, it would be safe to assume that each bore on an average at least 160. If so, each of the darkened glands could have received only 1/230400 of a grain of the nitrate; and this caused the inflection of a great majority of the tentacles. This plan of immersing several leaves in the same vessel is a bad one, as it is impossible to feel sure that the more vigorous leaves do not rob the weaker ones of their share of the salt. The glands, moreover, must often...", "...and waste the fair forests which their forefathers did guard so choicely.

The extent of forest supposed by Mirabeau would be about thirty-two per cent. of the whole territory. In a country and a climate where the conservative influences of the forest are so necessary as in France, trees must cover a large surface and be grouped in large masses, in order to discharge to the best advantage the various functions assigned to them by nature. The consumption of wood is rapidly increasing in that empire, and a large part of its...", "...books, large supplies of sugar, etc., were condemned to be left behind.

He is bold, authoritative, and very able; still only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of age; but then he is not spiritual: perhaps this was the state of Luther himself at first. It is an interesting time in the world; all things proclaim the approach of the kingdom of God, and Armenia is not forgotten.

I prefer to call this Part 'Minor Odes of the Kingdom,' without attempting to translate the term Ya. The Ta Ya or Greater Ya, in three Books, contains <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> pieces, sung on great occasions at the royal court and in the presence of the king. p. Lacharme called it 'Magnum Rectum (Quod rectum est superiore ordine).' But there is the same objection here to the use of the word 'correct' as in the case of the pieces of the previous Part. I use the name 'Major Odes of the Kingdom.' The greater length and dignity of most of the pieces justify the distinction of the two Parts into Minor and Major.

All Sweden had read the book which moved the heart of the king; and the assembled representatives rent the air with their acclamations. In the following spring, the old University town of Upsala, where her friend Bergfalk occupies a chair, granted the _right of suffrage_ to fifty women owning real estate, and to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> doing business on their own account. The representative whom their votes went to elect was to sit in the House of Burgesses. Miss Bremer was not ashamed to shed happy tears when this news reached her.

The first is one hundred and ninety-six feet on each front, and forty-six feet high. The second is one hundred and thirty-one feet square, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> feet high. Both of these pyramids stood on raised foundations, which M. Charney calls esplanades. As no other pyramids are mentioned, we are to suppose these are the two principal ones.

In February, for example, the House had to go through the ceremony of counting the votes for President of the United States,--a mere ceremony, since Mr. Monroe had been re-elected almost unanimously, and the votes of Missouri were of no importance. The tellers, to avoid giving cause of contention, announced that Mr. Monroe had received two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> votes, including those of Missouri, and two hundred and twenty-eight if they were excluded. At this announcement members sprang to their feet, and such a scene of confusion arose that no man could make himself heard. After a long struggle with the riot, the Speaker declared the House adjourned. For six weeks Mr. Clay exerted his eloquence, his arts of pacification, and all the might of his personality, to bring members to their senses. He even had a long conference with...", "...and at Akhund Ziarut, thirty miles on the road to Ghazni, there is a gorge which would, if held, add to security on that quarter.\" The country between Kandahar and the Helmund has the same general characteristics--plains and mountain spurs alternately,--and while generally fit for grazing is, except in a few spots, unfit for cultivation.

PREFACE MORE than two hundred years have elapsed since the first cargo of slaves was landed on the banks of the James River, in the colony of Virginia, from the West coast of Africa. From the introduction of slaves in 1620, down to the period of the separation of the Colonies from the British Crown, the number had increased to five hundred thousand; now there are nearly four million. In fifteen of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> States, Slavery is made lawful by the Constitution, which binds the several States into one confederacy. On every foot of soil, over which Stars and Stripes wave, the Negro is considered common property, on which any white man may lay his hand with perfect impunity. The entire white population of the United States, North and South, are bound by their oath to the constitution, and their adhesion to the Fugitive Slaver Law, to hunt down the runaway slave and return him to...", "...received various sentences of fine and imprisonment, together with, in some cases, the indignity of the pillory. Prosecutions for libel abounded in those days. Horace Walpole says that, dating from Wilkes's famous No. 45, no less than two hundred informations had been laid, a much larger number than during the whole thirty-three years of the previous reign. But the great majority of these must have fallen to the ground, for, in 1791, the then attorney-general stated that, in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, there had been seventy prosecutions for libel, and about fifty convictions, in twelve of which the sentences had been severe--including even, in five instances, the pillory. The law of libel was extremely harsh, to say the least of it. One of its dogmas was that a publisher could be held criminally liable for the acts of his servants, unless proved to be neither privy nor assenting to such acts. The monstrous part of this was that, after a time, the judges refused to...", "...county. The firm of Foot & Hoyt continued four years longer, until in 1853, Mr. Hoyt withdrew from the practice of law and turned his attention wholly to the business of real estate, not as a broker, but as an operator on his own account, or in company with others, nearly all his operations being adjacent to the city. For the last twenty years his transactions have been very heavy, having made of land belonging to him wholly, or in part, in the city of Cleveland and its environs, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> recorded sub-divisions, covering an area of five hundred acres, on which he has personally, or in connection with others interested with him, opened and named no less than seventy-six streets, including the well-known Croton, Laurel, Greenwood, Humbolt, Mahoning, Kelly, Lynden, Maple, Mayflower and Siegel streets, and Longwood avenue.

The cavalry after six months of war still possesses an excess of officers. There are on an average thirty-six officers to a regiment instead of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> considered to be the necessary minimum. The artillery, which has suffered relatively little, has also an excess of officers, and is further able to count upon a large number of Captains and other officers, who before the war were employed in the arsenals or in technical research. Finally the reserve artillery officers have nearly all proved to be excellent battery commanders. The losses in the junior commissioned ranks have naturally been highest in the infantry. There is,...", "...Though poor, his parents gave him a good education. He became a civil engineer, and the first work he got to do was on a road being built in Georgia. He remained in the South two years, but on the breaking out of the Civil War he returned North, and entered the service of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Cassatt's ability won rapid promotion. In nine years he built new roads, reorganized the company's shops, and improved the construction of cars and locomotives. Then, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years old, the position of general manager was created for him. One of the first things he did in this position was to introduce the air-brake, which at that time received scant encouragement from railroad men. Cassatt was told that it was useless. His experiments cost thousands of dollars, but they established the practicability of the air-brake. It was Cassatt also who developed the idea of combining individual roads into one great system. In 1872 he executed a grand...", "...present, counting thirty, were crowded into the upper apartment of the beacon, where the writer took a central position, while two of the artificers, joining hands, supported the Bible.

Such were the arts of war, by which the Roman emperors defended their extensive conquests, and preserved a military spirit, at a time when every other virtue was oppressed by luxury and despotism.

We may compute, however, that the legion, which was itself a body of six thousand eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> Romans, might, with its attendant auxiliaries, amount to about twelve thousand five hundred men. The peace establishment of Hadrian and his successors was composed of no less than thirty of these formidable brigades; and most probably formed a standing force of three hundred and seventy-five thousand men. Instead of being confined within the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans considered as the refuge of weakness or pusillanimity, the legions were encamped on the...", "...to play?\" \"No; I'd like to, but I guess I won't have time.

We shall hereafter see that the theory which accounts for the ordinary form of atolls, apparently includes this occasional peculiarity in their structure. In the midst of a group of atolls, there sometimes occur small, flat, very low islands of coral formation, which probably once included a lagoon, since filled up with sediment and coral-reefs. Captain Beechey entertains no doubt that this has been the case with the two small islands, which alone of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> surveyed by him in the Low Archipelago, did not contain lagoons. Romanzoff Island (in lat. 15 deg S.) is described by Chamisso (Kotzebue's \"First Voyage,\" volume iii., page 221.) as formed by a dam of madreporitic rock inclosing a flat space, thinly covered with trees, into which the sea on the leeward side occasionally breaks.

From a collection of the best experiments by previous workers he selected eighty-two (fifty-one on the velocity of water in conduit pipes, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> on its velocity in open canals); and, discussing these on physical and mechanical principles, he succeeded in drawing up general formulae, which afforded a simple expression for the velocity of running water.

You will notice that Chaucer meant to make his 'Canterbury Tales' much longer than he lived to do. His innkeeper proposes that each of the pilgrims shall tell four stories. Only twenty-four of these exist. You will never find any character drawn by Chaucer acting, speaking, or looking inconsistently.

When a sister gets in this condition, they move her from mission to mission and very often send reports ahead of her, that she is irreligious and has a \"bad\" spirit, causing the other sisters to treat her with suspicion and contempt. This is done until her heart is broken, and the final result is a general break-down in health. Then she can go and sit alone in some secluded...", "...out of the sixty-seven, have been selected by the claimants. These negroes, I am informed, do not belong to the Indians on whom the claims have been made.\" This opened up new hopes for those to whom the claimants admitted they had no title. There is, however, something about this surrender which we are not able to explain. It is certain that Lieutenant Reynolds left New Orleans on the twenty-first of May with all the prisoners, both Indians and negroes then at that city, except <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> left in charge of the sheriff, and seven Spanish maroons, whom he discharged. The remaining thirty-one were left in the charge of the sheriff, with the slave-catching vultures watching, and eager to fasten their talons upon them so soon as opportunity should permit. The separation was painful. Families were again severed: parents were torn from their children, and brothers and sisters compelled to bid adieu to each other; and as they could see no escape for those left at New...", "...of trees, the ground is generally too thickly covered with leaves to allow much room for ground mosses.

The _Cultivator_, an American agricultural journal, for June, 1842, states that twenty gallons of sap were drawn in eighteen hours from a single maple, two and a half feet in diameter, in the town of Warner, New Hampshire, and the truth of this account has been verified by personal inquiry...", "...bodyguard. Beyond these facts, gleaned from his _Roman History_, we have almost no knowledge of the man. The date of his birth is unknown, likewise that of his death, though from his writings it appears that he lived well toward the close of the fourth century.

It was divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> books; but of these thirteen have been lost, and some of those which survive are imperfect. Although the narrative is broken into rather provokingly here and there by digressions on earthquakes and eclipses and speculations on such utterly foreign topics as the theory of the destruction of lions by mosquitoes, it nevertheless constitutes an invaluable source of information on the men and events of the era which it covers. Its value is greatest, naturally, on the period of...", "...is it possible, it is easy, to make a friction {71} fire, if you know how; and hopeless, if you don't. I have taught many boys and men (including some Indians) to do it, and some have grown so expert that they make it nearly as quickly as with an old-fashioned sulphur match. When I first learned from Walter Hough, who learned from the Indians, it took me from five to ten minutes to get a blazing fire--not half an hour, as some books have it. But later I got it down to a minute, then to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> seconds from the time of taking up the rubbing-sticks to having a fine blaze, the time in getting the first spark being about six seconds. My early efforts were inspired by book accounts of Indian methods, but, unfortunately, I have never yet seen a book account that was accurate enough to guide anyone successfully in the art of fire-making.

There was a store in the village kept by a great citizen,--not a citizen of Kaskaskia alone, but a citizen of the world. This, I am aware, sounds like fiction, like an attempt to get an effect which was not there. But it is true as gospel. The owner of this store had many others scattered about in this foreign country: at Vincennes, at St. Louis, where he resided, at Cahokia. He knew Michilimackinac and Quebec and New Orleans.

Because it is autobiographical, and biographical of his family and friends, he found the necessity of frequently rewriting it, as time, event, and God changed them.

One of his critics--a clergyman--said that if Thomas Paine wished to preach sedition, there was plenty of room to do it outside of England. Paine followed the suggestion, and straightway sought out Franklin to ask him about going to America. Every idea that Paine had expressed was held by Franklin and had been thought out at length. Franklin was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years older than Paine, and time had tempered his zeal, and beside that, his tongue was always well under control, and when he expressed heresy he seasoned it with a smile and a dash of wit that took the bitterness out of it. Not so Paine--he was an earnest soul, a little lacking in humor, without the adipose which is required for a diplomat.

There he was interred with high honors. Like Nero he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of age at the time of his demise. The fall of this terrible man, before whom all Italy had once trembled, and whose name was celebrated far and wide, relieved Julius II of a pretender who in time might have been a hindrance to him; for Caesar, as an ally and a condottiere of Venice, would have spared no effort to force him into a war with the Republic for the possession of Romagna, or into a war with France on his withdrawal from the League of Cambray, and the...", "...any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation of course would be large. But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds even any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have a hundred millions of people to share the burden, instead of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> millions as now. And not only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after that period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first national census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should in 1900 have a population of 103,208,415.

Had the creed of Manes been accepted by the Persian monarch, the progress of real Christianity in the East would, it is probable, have been impeded rather than forwarded--the general currency of the debased amalgam would have checked the introduction of the pure metal. It must have been shortly after his rejection of the teaching of Manes that Sapor died, having reigned <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, from A.D. 240 to A.D. 271.

This, indeed, is a favorite trick of Reynard. At the time of my story, my friend Tom Edwards (ten years of age) and myself were in the turkey business, equal partners. We owned a flock of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> turkeys. These roosted by night in a large butternut tree in front of Tom's house--in the very top of it, and by day they wandered about the edges of the clearings in quest of beech-nuts, which were very plentiful that fall.

We know, for instance, that the extraction of the fourth root of a number of six figures calls for eighteen multiplications, ten subtractions and three divisions and that the horse does <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> sums in five or six seconds, that is to say, during the brief, careless glance which he gives at the black-board on which the problem is inscribed, as though the answer came to him intuitively and instantaneously.

He organized the Keystone Bridge Works, and took a contract to build a railroad-bridge across the Ohio River. The work was a success, and practically the Keystone Bridge Works was without a competitor in America. But America was buying most of her iron in Birmingham. In Eighteen Hundred Sixty-eight, Andrew Carnegie made a trip to Europe, taking his mother with him. He was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years old and a man of recognized worth and power. The pride of the mother in her son was modest yet profound, and his regard for her judgment, even in bridge-building and railroad affairs, was sincere and earnest.

They replied that they had come in search of Wenamon, who had robbed some of their countrymen of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> debens of silver. The prince was placed in a difficult position, for he was desirous to avoid giving offence either to Dor or to Egypt from whence he now expected further payment; but he managed to pass out on to clearer ground by means of a simple stratagem. \"I cannot arrest the envoy of Amon in my territory,\" he said to the men of Dor. \"But I will send him away, and you shall pursue him and arrest him.\" The plan seems to have appealed to the sporting instincts of the...", "...apartment of the beacon, where the writer took a central position, while two of the artificers, joining hands, supported the Bible.

Of these only four were common to the two islands, which are separated by a distance of only twelve leagues; and two even of these four (namely _Helix rhodostoma_ and _H. ventrosa_) are species of general diffusion, common to Madeira, the Canaries, and the south of Europe.[919] The confined range of these mollusks may easily be explained, if we admit that...", "...is on his authority that the story is given as fact. Mirabeau had just been released from the dungeon of the castle of Vincennes near Paris. He had been confined there for three years and a half, by virtue of that most odious mandate, a _lettre-de-cachet_. His imprisonment had been of a most painful nature; and it was prolonged at the instance of his father, the Marquis de Mirabeau. On his being reconciled to his father, the confinement terminated, in the year 1780, when Mirabeau was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of age. One of his father's conditions was, that Mirabeau should reside for some time at a distance from Paris; and it was settled that he should go on a visit to his brother-in-law, Count du Saillant, whose estate was situated a few leagues from the city of Limoges, the capital of the Limousin. Accordingly, the count went to Vincennes to receive Mirabeau on the day of his liberation, and they pursued their journey at once with all speed. The arrival of Mirabeau at...", "...from the peasant point of view, would you expect? Abraham took it all with the same stoicism with which he had once taken the whippings. By the unwritten law of the creekside he was his father's property, and so was his labor, until he came of age. Thomas used him as a servant or hired him out to other farmers. Stray recollections show us young Abraham working as a farm-hand for twenty-five cents the day, probably with \"keep\" in addition; we glimpse him slaughtering hogs skilfully at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> cents a day, for this was \"rough work.\" He became noted as an axman. In the crevices, so to speak, of his career as a farm-hand, Abraham got a few months of schooling, less than a year in all.

By 4 p.m. he was in full retreat south, on the Dallas road, and got by before the head of General Cox's column had reached it; still several ambulances and stragglers were picked up by this command on that road. General Corse reported two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> rebel dead, four hundred and eleven prisoners, three regimental colors, and eight hundred muskets captured. Among the prisoners was a Brigadier-General Young, who thought that French's aggregate loss would reach two thousand.

R. Fox Bourne's interesting and exhaustive Memoir of this noble knight and Christian gentleman. In his short life of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years are crowded achievements as scholar, poet, statesman and soldier, which find perhaps few, if indeed any equal, in the records of history; a few only of these chosen from among many appear in the following pages. The characters of Mary Gifford and her sister, and the two brothers, Humphrey and George Ratcliffe, are wholly imaginary. The books which have been consulted for the poetry of Sir Philip Sidney and the times in which he lived are--Vol. I. of _An English...", "...the weather reports, the thermometer will usually be higher at Walla Walla than at Portland or Astoria. It has been as high as seventy degrees in January during a big Chinook. As can be imagined, snow will vanish like a dream under a wind of such temperature, or even one at fifty degrees or fifty-five degrees, which is more common. A few general statistics as to the average records at Walla Walla may be of interest. The average annual temperature as shown by official records during <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years is fifty-three degrees. The average for January is thirty-three degrees; for July and August, seventy-four degrees. The lowest ever recorded was seventeen degrees below zero, and the highest was 113 degrees. The average rainfall is 17.4 inches. The average date of the last killing frost of spring is March 30th, and the first of autumn is November 7th. The average number of clear or mainly clear days is 262, of cloudy is 103. The prevailing wind is always from the...", "...to the last Monday in October. Our naval force in service in January of this year, independent of the lake squadrons, gun-boats, etc., for harbor defences, was but seven frigates, seven sloops-of-war, four brigs, three schooners, and four other small vessels. The secretary, however, reported in February three seventy-fours and three forty-fours on the stocks, besides smaller vessels, which would make thirty-three vessels, large and small, in actual service or soon to be afloat, while <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> were on the lakes. The army, by law, was increased at this session to 64,759 men, while the militia of the union amounted to 719,449 men. Added to this, the president was authorized to accept the service of volunteers to the number of 10,000, their term of service not to exceed one year. With such an imposing array of force on paper, with the increased revenue from the direct tax laid the year before, with a loan of $25,000,000, and treasury notes amounting to...", "...believed more might be deciphered, and Tischendorf, with his unconquerable energy, collating them both in 1854, was able to re-edit them more accurately, Cod. Q in the third volume (1860) and Cod. P in the sixth (1869) of his Monumenta sacra inedita. The volume (called the Codex Carolinus) seems to have been once at Bobbio, and has been traced from Weissenburg to Mayence and Prague, till it was bought by a Duke of Brunswick in 1689. Codex P contains, on forty-three or forty-four leaves, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> fragments of 518 verses, taken from all the four Evangelists(182); Codex Q, on thirteen leaves, twelve fragments of 247 verses from SS. Luke and John(183); but all can be traced only with great difficulty. A few portions, once written in vermilion, have quite departed, but Tischendorf has made material additions to Knittel's labours, both in extent and accuracy. He assigns P to the sixth, Q to the fifth century. Both are written in two columns, the uncials being bold, round...", "...the sub-rostrum is the largest. _Latera_, small, with their inner surfaces transversely elongated, the larger being the most elongated.

In the large specimen with only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> valves, the three pairs of latera, corresponding to the upper, rostral, and carinal latera in Scalpellum, were larger in a marked manner than the others; but in the specimen with fifty-four valves, this could hardly be said to be the case. In this latter specimen, some of the valves in the lowermost whorl were exceedingly minute. _Peduncle_, broad, about as long as the capitulum; surface of attachment wide; calcareous scales minute, placed in transverse rows, which become...", "...comely that the like of it was never heard of in tales or seen in reality, and he sat on his brave horse and beat its iron ribs with a Circassian whip.

That verse is said to be a prophecy of the good or bad luck that will befall him during the coming year. This as a mode of divination is extensively practised. Another form of this superstition consists in foretelling the events in a man's life from the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs, the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> verses of this chapter being supposed to have a mystical reference to the corresponding days of the month. Thus, it is predicted of persons born on the 14th that they will get their \"food from afar.\" A correspondent of _Notes and Queries_, writing from a Northamptonshire village, tells us that \"this is so fully believed in by some that a boy has actually been apprenticed to a _linen_-draper, for no other reason than because he was born on the 24th of the month; whilst those...", "...and range; thence westerly along the unsurveyed township line between townships ten (10) and nine (9) south to the southeast corner of township nine (9) south, range thirty-two (32) east; thence northerly along the range line between ranges thirty-two (32) and thirty-three (33) east to the northeast corner of township nine (9) south, range thirty-two (32) east; thence westerly along the second (2d) standard parallel south to the southeast corner of township eight (8) south, range <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> (31) east; thence northerly along the surveyed and unsurveyed range line between ranges thirty-one (31) and thirty-two (32) east to the northeast corner of township eight (8) south, range thirty-one (31) east; thence westerly along the township line between townships seven (7) and eight (8) south to the southeast corner of township seven (7) south, range thirty (30) east; thence northerly along the range line between ranges thirty (30) and thirty-one (31) east to the...", "...is as a rule called Sinai in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, though the name Horeb occurs in Exod. iii. 1, xxxiii. 6.

And the results--the destruction of the fleet, the loss of almost all the colonies, the complete annihilation of trade and commerce!

Largely through the instrumentality of Benton, and in spite of the opposition of Clay, Calhoun, and Webster, this instrument was ratified in the Senate by the close vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> to fifteen. Although new slave territory was thus acquired, the vote on the treaty was factional and not sectional, being equally divided between the Northern and the Southern States, Calhoun and six other Southern senators opposing it, chiefly from hostility to the administration.

Charles II. also played tennis. The old game is very different from the modern lawn-tennis which is now so popular: it was always the game of the select few, and not of the many, like its precocious offspring; and there are only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> tennis-courts in England at the present day.

Although lie was elected prior of the Salamanca convent, he was not to be allowed to enjoy that position, for a royal appointment as bishop of Nueva Segovia caused him, howbeit unwillingly, to return to the Philippines. Entering those islands once more in 1718, he assumed the duties of his office, but died in Vigan in June of the following year in the sixty-third year of his age, and after a residence in the islands of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years.

It seems to abound with bays and harbours, the N.E. coast especially; but the vast quantity of ice must render them inaccessible the greatest part of the year; or, at least, it must be dangerous lying in them, on account of the breaking up of the ice cliffs.

According to Godfrey's statement, Malcolm had kept watch at the south door while the abbot and himself had carried the three chests out and sunk them in the centre and at the deepest part of the fish pond. It was hidden in the same pond in which he had previously concealed the Borgia jewels--namely, in the lake at a spot indicated, being one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> paces south of the grand altar. The pond was never dry, it appeared, even in the hottest summer, and like all other monastery waters contained carp for Fridays. The Borgia treasure he managed to secure before leaving Crowland with his friend Malcolm Maxwell, but the abbey plate and jewels and the silver altar he had been compelled to leave, the two others who alone knew the secret, in addition to himself, having died.

At Venice Wendelin, after producing <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> books in the previous two years, reduced his output to six in 1473, and soon after seems to have ceased to work for himself. Jenson's numbers sank from twenty-eight in 1471-2 to six in 1473-4. Valdarfer gave up after 1471, and is subsequently found at Milan. Other Venetian printers also dropped out, and only two new firms began work in 1473.

It is now thinner than what we call honey. To thicken it, the bees swarm over the open cells, moving their wings very rapidly, thus evaporating some of the water. A hive of bees have been known to make over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> pounds of honey in a single day, although the average is very much less than this.

The room was not glazed, so that the smoke was carried out sideways in the direction of the wind. The roof was furnished with a sort of chimney in the shape of a spire, which terminated the building with a ball. The whole light-room was of stone, and its height to the top of the spire-funnel was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> feet. From the rude mode by which light was obtained, the stone mullions which supported the cupola-roof became so much damaged, that in 1717 it was necessary to remove the light to the apartment below, till the light-room and upper works were restored. But the new light being so defective that it could not be seen at sea at a greater distance than six miles, many accidents and complaints arose, when it was determined to construct the light-room of iron instead of stone....", "...realised any physical relief from that source.'

Tagal literature does not amount to very much, and the policy of the Government of late years has been to teach Spanish as well as the native dialects in the schools.

Two of the police and military were killed, and twenty-four wounded; while of the rioters <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> were killed, and sixty-seven wounded--making in all one hundred and twenty-eight victims. There was much indignation expressed at the troops for firing without orders, and firing so wildly as to shoot some of their own men.

Boucher had been one of the brilliant group of artists of the d'Etioles' circle.

To set down Boucher's favour at Court to her is ridiculous. He was painting for the queen's apartments at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> when the Pompadour was a school-girl of twelve. But in the year following her rise to power, Boucher painted four pictures for the large room of the Dauphin, which were \"placed elsewhere\"; and, the year after that, he was at work upon two pictures for the bedroom of the king at the castle of Marly.

It is significant of this tendency that when, a few years since, an enterprising Parisian journal hung in its _salle_ the portraits of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> actresses, etc., and invited the votes of the public by ballot as to the most beautiful of them, not one of the three women who came out at the head of the poll was French.

Neutrality, to be held inviolate, was the answer to the cry from both the North and the South; but armed neutrality, said Kentucky.

In 1602 we find that he purchased from William and John Combe, of Stratford, a hundred and seven acres of arable land near the town, for which he paid L320; in 1605, too, he bought for L440 a moiety of the tithes of Stratford for an unexpired term of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, which investment seems to have brought him in little except a wearisome lawsuit.

The work of von Raumer stimulated many to a study of the writings of the earlier educational reformers, and numerous books and papers on educational history and theory soon began to appear. Most important, for American students, was Henry Barnard's monumental _American Journal of Education_, begun in 1855, and continued for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years. This is a great treasure-house of pedagogical literature for American educators. After 1850 the organization of a technique of instruction for the elementary-school subjects took place rapidly, in the normal schools of all lands, as it had earlier in the German teachers' seminaries. By 1868 the study of the new Herbartian psychology and educational theory was well under way in Germany, and by 1890 in the United States.

At a later period, on the other hand, this relation of receipts was entirely reversed. For instance, in 1582-3 the wardens secured only L4 10s. 4d. from their ale, while proceeds from other sources amounted to L17 9s. 7d.[252] In the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years from 1556-7 to 1587-8 in this parish the recorded wardens' expenditures had more than doubled.

He spent several days in fasting and prayer, and in strict retirement, after which he resorted to the tomb of St. Martin, and taking any book of Scripture which he chose, he opened it, and took as answer from God the first passage that met his eye. Should this passage prove inappropriate, he opened another book of Scripture. The eleventh chapter of Proverbs, which contains <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> verses, is often taken to give omen of the character of a life. The manner of consulting it is simple; it is but to look for the verse answering to the day of the month on which the questioner was born. The answer will be found in most cases to be exceedingly ambiguous. The practice of consulting certain books for purposes of augury is of high antiquity. Herodotus speaks of the custom, and of the fraud of Oxomacritus, a celebrated diviner, who made use of Musoeus for...", "...to-morrow to do it.\" In the same cheerful spirit, he writes to his son a few days after his marriage, and then on a journey to Virginia: \"The whole scene here on Thursday last was so delightful that I hardly knew whether I was on the earth, or floating between earth and heaven.

Besides these, most of whom were got off against the Governor's protests, there were ten Jews with 322 slaves, in preventing the departure of whom he was more successful.

Finally, three vessels sailed away for Jamaica in September, 1675, carrying 1,231 people, including <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> Indians, and more negroes than whites. On arriving at that island they were granted lands in St. Elizabeth, afterwards known as Surinam quarters, and thus Guiana again became a factor in the development of the English islands.

It must not be overlooked, however, that there is a very striking difference in absolute mass and weight between the lowest human brain and that of the highest ape--a difference which is all the more remarkable when we recollect that a full grown Gorilla is probably pretty nearly twice as heavy as a Bosjes man, or as many an European woman. It may be doubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> or two ounces, or that the heaviest Gorilla brain has exceeded twenty ounces. This is a very noteworthy circumstance, and doubtless will one day help to furnish an explanation of the great gulf which intervenes between the lowest man and the highest ape in intellectual power;* but it has little systematic value, for the simple reason that, as may be concluded from what has been already said respecting cranial capacity, the difference in weight of brain between the highest...", "...final stores of coal.

The shore end was successfully laid and made fast to the cable on board the \"Great Eastern,\" and on Friday morning, the 13th of July, 1866, the huge ship set sail for Newfoundland, accompanied by her consorts of the telegraph fleet. The voyage occupied fourteen days, the ship making an average run of about one hundred and eighteen miles per day, and paying out about one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles of cable in the same period of time. The weather was fair during the whole voyage, but the anxiety of the officers in charge was none the less on that account. There were accidents to be dreaded more than unfavorable weather.

The first is one hundred and ninety-six feet on each front, and forty-six feet high. The second is one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> feet square, and thirty-one feet high. Both of these pyramids stood on raised foundations, which M. Charney calls esplanades. As no other pyramids are mentioned, we are to suppose these are the two principal ones. Perhaps they are also pyramids of the sun and moon. Our chief interest is concerned with the remains of the habitations he discovered here.

Those men, few in number, who made themselves a name at that epoch, rallied round Charlemagne and were developed under his patronage. To know him well and appreciate him justly, he must be examined under those various grand aspects, abroad and at home, in his wars and in his government. From 769 to 813, in Germany and Western and Northern Europe, Charlemagne conducted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> campaigns against the Saxons, Frisians, Bavarians, Avars, Slavons, and Danes; in Italy, five against the Lombards; in Spain, Corsica, and Sardinia, twelve against the Arabs; two against the Greeks; and three in Gaul itself, against the Aquitanians and the Britons; in all, fifty-three expeditions; among which those he undertook against the Saxons, the Lombards, and the Arabs were long and difficult wars.

One day in September, when the engineer and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> men were on the rock, the tender broke from its moorings, and began to drift away from the rock, just as the tide was rising. Mr. Stevenson, perched on an eminence above the rest, surveying them at their labours, was the first, and for a while, the men being all intent on their work, the only one, who observed what had happened. He said nothing, but went to the highest point of the rock, and kept an anxious watch on the progress of the vessel and the rising of the sea.

We were assured in 1830 that thirty-six of the members of Congress were born in the little State of Connecticut. The population of Connecticut, which constitutes only one forty-third part of that of the United States, thus furnished one-eighth of the whole body of representatives. The States of Connecticut, however, only sends five delegates to Congress; and the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> others sit for the new Western States. If these thirty-one individuals had remained in Connecticut, it is probable that instead of becoming rich landowners they would have remained humble laborers, that they would have lived in obscurity without being able to rise into public life, and that, far from becoming useful members of the legislature, they might have been unruly citizens.

The total distance from Quebec to Halifax was 633 miles, and the time required for the trip varied from twenty-one to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> days. A mail route from Montreal into Upper Canada was also established, but this was rather a military post, intended to serve the military stations and frontier settlements. The mail was despatched only once a year and was, in consequence, known as the \"yearly express.\" The route followed was by the St. Lawrence from Montreal to Matilda, Augusta, and Kingston; across Lake Ontario to Niagara; thence to Detroit Fort, at the base of Lake St. Clair, and across Lake Huron to...", "...metrical verse also counts syllables, but we combine them into different kinds of accented feet. Without accent, this was not possible, so the Japanese poet limits their number and uses them in a pattern of alternating lines.

The favourite form, the \"tanka,\" is in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> syllables, and runs five, seven, five, seven, seven. There is a longer form, the \"naga-uta,\" but it has never been held in as high favour. The poems in the Diaries are all tankas in the original.

Nor does the prevalence of a greater number of cases necessarily imply a heavier mortality. For Bianchi reports of Rome that cases of dysentery constituted but 2.28 per cent. of all the admissions into the Ospedale di San Spirito in 1873, while in 1874 the percentage increased to 3.68; yet the mortality of 1873 was 17.02 per cent.,...", "...and afterward Chief Justice of England, in the celebrated trial of William Palmer for taking the life of John Parsons Cook by poison, that finally turned the tide, in this closely contested case, against the prisoner, and resulted in his conviction and execution.

The command which Rimini thus held was purely political; it passed from her to Ravenna automatically whenever that entry was threatened. Why? The answer is very simple: because Rimini could not easily be defended, while Ravenna was impregnable. Ravenna stood from fifteen to eighteen miles north and east of the Aemilian Way and some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles north and a little west of Rimini. Its extraordinary situation was almost unique in antiquity and is only matched by one city of later times--Venice. It was built as Venice is literally upon the waters.

At the full tides it is washed by a considerable quantity of sea water, as well as by the river, and thus...", "...less pride and dignity of character under Republican institutions than in the despotisms and monarchies of the old world? Your Codes and Constitutions savor of such an opinion. Fortunately, history furnishes a few saving facts, even under our Republican institutions.

This act of injustice is sufficient to account for the moral darkness that seems to have settled down upon that unhappy State.

Because women voted there, was the institution of marriage annulled, the sanctity of...", "...wood to the right leaped fire--another and unsuspected body of blue infantry. The echoes were yet ringing when, from above, an unseen battery opened on the luckless cavalry. The blue rifles cracked again, the horses began to rear and plunge, several men were hit.

So he had but thirty-seven and a half cents. This sum he drew from his pocket, and counted over with scrupulous accuracy, so as to be sure of the amount.

It will be observed that all these statements refer to and exhibit the disbursements of peace periods.

In 1814 the annual expenses incident to the War of 1812 reached their highest amount--about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> millions--while our population slightly exceeded 8,000,000, showing an expenditure of only $3.80 per capita. In 1847 the expenditures growing out of the war with Mexico reached fifty-five millions, and the population about 21,000,000, giving only $2.60 per capita for the war expenses of that year.

At last, in 1854, on the translation of my warm friend Edward Forbes, to Edinburgh, Sir Henry de la Beche, the Director-General of the Geological Survey, offered me the post Forbes vacated of Paleontologist and Lecturer on Natural History.

But I held the office for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years, and a large part of my work has been paleontological. At that time I disliked public speaking, and had a firm conviction that I should break down every time I opened my mouth. I believe I had every fault a speaker could have (except talking at random or indulging in rhetoric), when I spoke to the first important audience I ever addressed, on a Friday evening at the Royal Institution, in 1852.

In his orders for books sent to Jefferson the direction of his studies is evident. He sought largely for those which treated of the science of government; but they were not confined to that subject. Natural history had great charms for him. He was a diligent student of Buffon, and was anxious to find, if possible, the plates of his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> volumes, in colors, that he might adorn the walls of his room with them. He made careful comparisons between the animals of other continents, as described and portrayed by the naturalist, and similar orders in America.

Besides, thirty-one dollars would not last long at a summer resort--and he remembered he would not have <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> dollars when he landed; he would have what was left after he had paid his fare from San Francisco, and had eaten once or twice. Straightway he became hungry, perhaps because a porter came down the aisle announcing the interesting fact that breakfast was now being served in the diner--fourth car rear.

The others of the one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> were acquitted.

If the plan should be carried out as successfully as he expected, he reckoned that this sum would amount in one hundred years to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> thousand pounds. It was his wish, and so expressed in his will that one hundred thousand pounds should be spent upon public works, \"which may then be judged of most general utility to the inhabitants; such as fortifications, bridges, aqueducts, public buildings, baths, pavements, or whatever makes living in the town more convenient to its people, and renders it more agreeable to strangers resorting thither for health or temporary residence.\" It was also his wish that the...", "...his love of ease, had a vein of cruelty. It has been shown that he caused his brother Djem to be poisoned. This was in accord with the family law. A more serious instance was that he put to death his great general, Ahmed Keduk, to whom he was deeply indebted for success in putting down the insurrection of Djem. Ahmed had deeply offended the Sultan by brusquely opposing his peaceful policy, and Bayezid forcibly removed the incautious critic. The net result to the Turkish Empire of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of Bayezid's reign was, on the one hand, the incorporation of Herzegovina, and the expulsion of the Venetians from the Morea; on the other, the loss of three fortresses in Asia Minor to the Mamelukes of Egypt and the withdrawal from the South of Italy.

The State as an institution, while supported by the toil of the producers, was wholly a capitalist State with the capitalists in complete supremacy to fashion and use it as they chose. They used the State political machinery to plunder the masses, and then, at the slightest tendency on the part of the workers to resist these crushing injustices and burdens, called upon the State to hurry out its armed forces to repress this dangerous discontent.

Bird, established a further record by scoring over a hundred runs in each innings. Of the contests between Oxford and Cambridge, the latter (up to 1909) had lost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> and won thirty-five. Oxford's 503 in 1900 and Cambridge's 392 in the same match furnished the highest aggregates. The largest individual innings was 172 not out by J. F. Marsh in 1904; but as a feat of batting it was intrinsically inferior to the 171 by R. E. Foster in 1900. Of the thirty centuries scored up to 1909, Oxford was credited with sixteen.

If he was guilty of neglect in the case of this young man--and by his own confession he was--he was certainly profoundly grieved at his death. In the Argument to the _Dialogus de Morte_ he laments that he ever let the youth leave his house without sending him back to England, and tells how he was cozened by Daldo, the crafty tailor, out of a premium of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> gold crowns, in return for which William was to be taught a trade. \"But during the summer, Daldo, who had a little farm in the country, took the youth there and let him join in the village games, and by degrees made him into a vinedresser.

The council entered on its third task at a very late period, with the result that the requisite time for an adequate deliberation was not available. Nevertheless, on the 1st of November, Gregory was enabled to publish <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> constitutions, which may be taken to represent the fruits of the synod and its labours. The most important of the enactments passed is that regulating the papal election. It prescribed that the new election conducted by the college of cardinals should be held in conclave (q.v.), and its duration abridged by progressive simplification of the cardinal's diet.

THE town of Manchester, including Salford, contains 270,960 inhabitants, and is distant from London 186 miles, and from Liverpool <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> by the railroad. The origin of this town, which is remarkable for the extent of its trade, and the importance of its manufactures, may be traced to remote antiquity. In the time of the Druids, it was distinguished as one of the principal stations of their priests, and celebrated for the privilege of sanctuary attached to its altar, which, in the British language, was called _Meyne_, signifying a stone. Prior to the Christian era, it was one...", "...COUNCIL--FIRST DISPUTES--THE GERMS OF DEFEAT. For the second time the situation was distinctly marked out. If the Council did not know how to define the Commune, was it not in the most unmistakable manner, and before the eyes of all Paris, declared to mean a camp of rebels by the fighting, the bombardment, the fury of the Versaillese, and the rebuff of the conciliators? The complementary elections of the 16th April--death, double election returns, and resignations had given <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> vacant seats--revealed the effective forces of the insurrection. The illusion of the 26th March had vanished; the votes were now taken under fire. Also the journals of the Commune and the delegates of the Syndical Chambers in vain summoned the electors to the ballot-box. Out of 146,000 who had mustered in these arrondissements at the election of the 26th March, there came now only 61,000. The arrondissements of the councillors who had deserted their seats gave 16,000 instead...", "...after peak; this was the chain of mountains running to the south-east, which we now saw from the other side. In our own vicinity, on the other band, we saw nothing but the backs of the mountains so frequently mentioned. We afterwards learned how deceptive the light can be.

All the sledge-meters gave seventeen geographical miles, or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> kilometres (nineteen and a quarter statute miles). This day's work -- nineteen and a quarter miles, with an ascent of 5,750 feet -- gives us some idea of what can be performed by dogs in good training.

After the war commenced, by the firing on Fort Sumter, the first object of the United States Government was to save Washington from falling into the hands of the enemy. Between the 18th of May and the 23d of June, 1861, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> fully organized regiments and three independent companies arrived in that city. Of these, four were from Pennsylvania, also the three independent companies, four from Massachusetts, eleven from New York State, four from New Jersey, two from Rhode Island, three from Connecticut, one from Michigan, and two from Ohio. These regiments numbered about 28,000 men. Besides these, there were about 4,000 District of Columbia militia, organized under Colonel Stone, and about 4,000...", "...lest he should devour the young ones; they are allowed to remain with their mother for the space of ten weeks, when they are removed, and fed for some time with bread and biscuit.

The negotiations continued, and, in January, 1596, a royal edict, signed at Folembray, near Laon, regulated, in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> articles and some secret articles, the conditions of peace between the king and Mayenne. The king granted him, himself and his partisans, full and complete amnesty for the past, besides three surety-places for six years, and divers sums, which, may be for payment of his debts, and may be for his future provision, amounted to three million five hundred and eighty thousand livres at that time (twelve million eight hundred and eighty-eight thousand francs of the present day)....", "...vigorous as ever, and bids fair to long be an active member, in fact as well as in title, of the firm of Morgan & Root.

Some other straggling low rocks lie west of the cape, and one south of it; but they are all near the shore. From Christmas Sound to Cape Horn the course is E.S.E 1/4 E., distant <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> leagues. In the direction of E.N.E., three leagues from Cape Horn, is a rocky point, which I called Mistaken Cape, and is the southern point of the easternmost of Hermite Isles. Between these two capes there seemed to be a passage directly into Nassau Bay; some small isles were seen in the passage; and the coast, on the west side, had the appearance of forming good bays or harbours. In some charts, Cape Horn is laid down as belonging to a small island. This was neither...", "...nine and a half seconds; and a year later Maud made the world's record--two minutes eight and three-quarter seconds.

The first, which deals with the mythical period, contains <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> tales of similar type in which the characters are for the most part the same, although the last five tales do not properly fit into the cycle, and the concluding story of Indayo is evidently a recent account told in the form of the older relations.

He was full of vigour for his work, but shell-shock had left him with a heart that could not stand a strain of this kind, and all his own fine courage could not help the surgeons in a losing fight. We are not sorry for him--we learn that, not to be sorry for the dead. But for ourselves? This terror is always so fresh, so unexampled.

The campaign is recorded in several inscriptions, in all of which Shalmaneser claims a complete victory. The most famous inscription of this king is the one on the so-called Black Obelisk, an alabaster monolith found at Nimrud in 1846. This monument is inscribed on all four sides with an account, in one hundred and ninety lines, of the expeditions undertaken during <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of the king's reign. In the text of the inscription reference is made to campaigns against the west land (Syria and Palestine) in 859, 854, 850, 849, 846, 842, and 839. In addition to the inscription the monument contains, on the upper portion, five series of four reliefs each, each series representing the tribute brought to the Assyrian king by kings whom he had conquered or who sought his favor. In the inscription itself, no mention is made of Israel or the king...", "...of sky into mountains, the mountains like stone work wrought up with huge hammers.

This stock was very valuable, and had it reached California, would have been a fortune to the Donners. I searched carefully among the bales and bundles of goods, and found five-hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> dollars. Part of this sum was silver, part gold. The silver I buried at the foot of a pine tree, a little way from the camp. One of the lower branches of another tree reached down close to the ground, and appeared to point to the spot.

Readable, interesting, and in many places charming, Stendhal's _Life of Rossini_ is at the same time meagre, and, worse still, untrustworthy. But there is no reason why a tolerable Life of Rossini, including an account of all the changes and reforms introduced by this composer into Italian opera, should not have been published when he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years of age. There would have been nothing of moment to add to it but a narrative of Rossini's visit to London, of his residence in Paris, and above all, of the circumstances under which he produced _William Tell_ together with his reasons--if they could only be discovered--for abandoning composition when he had once produced that work.

Rather it was strengthened. In all his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> lean and lonely years Link had never before fallen in love. At the age when most youths are sighing over some wonder girl, he had been too busy fighting off bankruptcy and starvation to have time or thought for such things.

This form subdivides itself into two parts, viz., the upper half containing three lines of five, seven, and again five syllables, and the lower half consisting of two lines of seven syllables each.

One of the detachments said they lost one man; but a negro man who was with them, and heard what was said, soon after told me that he helped to bury <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> of them; this did me some good to find my countrymen giving them battle; for I never heard such swaggering as among Gen.

And even through all these misfortunes, the Kingdom of Wessex did in some sort become greater. Remember that in 880, when Alfred had done so many great things, he was still only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years old. We can see how much people always remembered and thought of Alfred, by there being many more stories told of him than of almost any other of the old Kings. One story is that Alfred, wishing to know what the Danes were about and how strong they were, set out one day from Athelney in the disguise of a minstrel or juggler, and went into the Danish camp, and stayed there several days, amusing the Danes with his playing, till he had seen all that he wanted, and then...", "...the famous Franciscan Church at Innsbruck with its world-renowned tomb in memory of his grandfather Maximilian I.

The number of days of Calends depend upon the number of days in the month, and the day of the month on which the Ides fall. If the month has <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> days and the Ides fall on the thirteenth, there are nineteen days of Calends; but if the Ides fall on the fifteenth, there are only seventeen days of Calends. As the Ides fall on the thirteenth of all the months of thirty days, they have eighteen days of Calends.

There were thirty-five of these tribes who gave each their vote: _four were from the city, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> from the country_.

The proverbs of Solomon are priceless for the same reason; they are full of wisdom--wisdom so expressed that it can be easily comprehended. When I was a boy my father would call me in from work a little before noon, read to me from Proverbs and comment on the sayings of the Wise Man. After his death (when I was twenty) I recalled his fondness for Proverbs and read the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> chapters through each month for a year. I was increasingly impressed with their beauty and strength. I have used many of them in speeches. The one I have most frequently used in the advocacy of reforms reads: \"A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.\" I have often used a story to illustrate how much can be said in a few words.

The second edition, in which he in the same words discloses the use of a convex lens in the aperture as a secret he had intended to keep, was not published till 1589, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> years after the first. In this interval the use of the lens was discovered and clearly described by Daniello Barbaro, a Venetian noble, patriarch of Aquileia, in his work _La Pratica della perspettiva_ (p. 192), published in 1568, or twenty-one years before Porta's mention of it. The lens used by Barbaro was an ordinary convex or old man's spectacle-glass; concave, he says, will not do.

In his account of feudal society and of the effect which its conditions had upon such literature as there was in that day, Mr. Van Laun could hardly pass over those tribunals so characteristic and so foreign to our modes of thought and feeling nowadays--the courts of love, of which the troubadours were, in a sort, the advocates. These courts were governed by a Code of Love, which had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> statutes or ruling maxims. Of these maxims the most significant, and some of the most remarkable, are the following: The plea of wedlock is not a sufficient excuse from love. None can be bound by a double love. It is undoubted that love is always diminishing or increasing. A two years' widowhood is enjoined for a deceased lover. It is shameful to love those with whom marriage would be shameful.

Then Professor Willis came and told us that we were wrong, and showed us other signs to prove that the west front was the latest part built.

For that Jocelin built the west front I have no doubt at all. It is certain that he built the oldest parts of the palace at Wells and of the manor-house at Wookey[33], and the style in both of those buildings exactly agrees with the foreign style of the west front, and not with the local style of the nave. And these buildings are certainly earlier than some works in the local style.

It may be doubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> or two ounces, or that the heaviest Gorilla brain has exceeded twenty ounces. This is a very noteworthy circumstance, and doubtless will one day help to furnish an explanation of the great gulf which intervenes between the lowest man and the highest ape in intellectual power;[31] but it has little systematic value, for the simple reason that, as may be concluded from what has been already said respecting cranial capacity, the difference in weight of brain between the...", "...decided upon was that of the famous Belgian military engineer Henri Alexis Brialmont.

To the naked eye the brain is a large jelly-like mass enclosed in a bony covering, about one-fourth of an inch thick, called the skull. Inside the skull it is protected by a thick membrane. At its base emerges the spinal cord, a long strand of nerve fibers extending down the spine. For most of its length, the cord is about as large around as your little finger, but it tapers at the lower end.

After the Confederates had brought <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> pieces of artillery into action, Col. Burrell and his men surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Highly respected because of their stubborn bravery, the men were soon exchanged; and upon returning to the Union lines were accorded an ovation.

The southern coast of Spain then witnessed an engagement between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> French and about an equal number of English ships, and in spite of this equality of force the French fleet was destroyed.--[The actual forces present were 27 English ships of the line and 38 Franco-Spanish ships of the line; see James' Naval History, vol. iii. p. 459.] This great battle afforded another proof of our naval inferiority.

In the third ten years it was very nearly double, being 88_s._ 8_d._ from 1810 to 1819, and 45_s._ 9_d._ from 1780 to 1789. A portion of these prices, however, must be attributed to a depreciated currency. During that period of thirty years, very few of the great scientific improvements which have cheapened production had been introduced, although better modes of cultivation unquestionably prevailed. During the twenty years from 1820 to 1839 there were only three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> Inclosure Bills passed; and the price of wheat had fallen to about the average of the ten years from 1790 to 1799, and it continued at that average for another ten years. In the ten years from 1840 to 1849, we cannot gather the amount of land brought into new cultivation from the number of Inclosure Bills, as there was a General Inclosure Act passed in 1835, to prevent the expense of particular bills for small tracts of land.

He was with a friend who had thirty acres of corn growing, and was much vexed to see blackbirds walking about among the young plants. They seemed very busy about something, and he was sure they were pulling up his crop. So he got out his guns, and Mr. Warren went with him to punish the birds. They shot <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> of them. Then they began to see what they had been eating. In all the thirty-one, only seven had the least bit of corn, and even they were mostly filled with insects. The rest were stuffed full of insects which do much harm to young corn, mostly cut-worms.

The importance of this crop as an element of wealth may be estimated from the fact that the census value of it in 1849-50 was $112,000,000; that its cultivation and preparation for market employed upward of 800,000 agricultural laborers, 85 per cent of whom were slaves and the residue (120,000) white citizens; that upward of 120,000...", "...acres: between fifty acres and a hundred there are 3479 owners, holding 250,147 acres, or an average of just under seventy-two acres. These make up a body of small proprietors, owning from one to a hundred acres, numbering 18,117. _Eason's Almanac_ for 1879, which has been published while I write, estimates the number of \"proprietors in fee\" of agricultural holdings at 20,217. The same authority gives the number of leaseholders in perpetuity as 10,298; for terms of years exceeding <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> as 13,712; for thirty-one years and under, 47,623 (many of which may be short leases); and of leases for lives, or lives and years alternative, as 63,759. The number of tenancies at will is 526,628, or 77.2 per cent, of the whole number of holdings. These statistics were collected in 1870, and they have doubtless been in some degree modified by the working of the Church Act and the Land Act. I have omitted from my extracts from the Domesday list the proprietors of under one...", "...Germany will shortly publish a volume commemorative of the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America by Columbus, which will, it is said, be one of the most elaborate publications ever issued by the society.

The memorial volume will contain forty-five maps relating to the discovery of America, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> of which are said to have never been published.

The idea was this: If one man saves sixpence a week, it would take him thirty-one weeks to get a One Pound War Certificate. But if <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> people each save sixpence a week, they can buy a Certificate at once and keep on buying one every week. Thus their savings begin to earn interest immediately. Thus every War Savings Association became a co-operative saving and investment syndicate--a pool of profit. How are the Certificates distributed? The usual procedure is to draw lots. In a small Association no member is ordinarily permitted to win more than one Certificate in a period of thirty-one weeks, except by...", "...the dough. That makes me sweat.

The speed of the machine is generally about seventeen miles an hour over the ground, and from twenty-two to thirty miles an hour relative to the air. Constant effort was directed to keep down the velocity, which was at times fifty-two miles an hour. This is the purpose of the starting and gliding against the wind, which thus furnishes an initial velocity without there being undue speed at the landing. The highest wind we dared to experiment in blew at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> miles an hour; when the wind was stronger, we waited and watched the birds.'

On the morning after the anonymous letters had been found in the street he came into the House of Assembly and made a short speech.

He had been ready thus to go on to the end, but he saw himself environed by enemies, and felt that his usefulness had been destroyed. He wished, therefore, in the interest of the country, not from any fear for himself, to withdraw from the storm, and for a time at least to remain in retirement. The displeasure and hatred of the...", "...until the end of the school term. At the end of each term there were always a large number of students who cared nothing for their books, and all but gave them away. Looking three months ahead, I bought these books and sold them to new students who entered the following year. One year alone I cleared $40 in this way. The second-hand book business among the students began from this effort on my part to add to my little pile of cash money. Having completed the course with a class of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> members, May 26, 1896, I started straight for my home, Meridian, Miss. For six years, as a student, I had been at Tuskegee and under its influences; now I had only my conscience to dictate to me and to keep me straight.

You have a pass; you can catch the eastern mail at noon, and overtake the cattle train in time to see the beeves unloaded.\" \"Which herd did you come up with?\" inquired Joel, fumbling through his pockets for the forgotten pass. \"With the one at Ogalalla. It's full <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> hundred steers, single ranch brand, and will run about equally twos and threes. Same range, same stock, as your Lazy H's, and you are perfectly safe in buying them unseen. Just the same cattle that you bought last year, with the advantage of a better season on the trail. All you need to do is to agree on the prices and terms; the cattle are as honest as gold and twice as good.\" \"Leave me a horse and take the outfit home,\" said Joel with decision. \"If an order comes for...", "...up to his breast with a little smile. \"Come,\" he whispered, his passionate eyes devouring her. She fought against the fascination with which they dominated her, resisting him dumbly with tight-locked lips till he held her palpitating in his arms. \"Little fool,\" he said with a deepening smile. \"Better me than my men.\" The gibe broke her silence. \"Oh, you brute!

Only a month since I left Biskra. A month!

She did not cry. The complete breakdown of the first night had never been repeated. Tears of shame and anger had risen in her eyes often, but she would not let them fall. She would not give her captor the...", "...was the closing of the Rhine by the Dutch in the sixteenth century--nearly destroyed the commercial importance of the place; but the river was opened in 1837 and the city is now growing rapidly. \"One of the principal objects of interest in Cologne is the great cathedral, called in German the _Domkirche_.

It has two towers in process of erection, which will be five hundred feet high, if they are ever completed. It was commenced in the year 1248, and the work went on, with occasional interruptions, till about a hundred years ago, when it was suspended by war.

When the infantry retreated three carriages broke down in the attempt to get through the thicket and fallen timber, and the guns were lost. Night ended the conflict on this part of the field, and both sides occupied their original positions.

Out of two thousand men, the Missourians lost three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> in killed and wounded, and the Arkansas brigades, of equal strength, one hundred and forty-two. Within a few minutes of the time when our whole line became engaged, an officer came to inform me that General Walker was wounded.

I found him suffering from a contusion in the groin, and...", "...to plan the Council of Labor, to both of which I shall refer more specifically later. The Board of Railway Labor Arbitration of 1912 was perhaps the most important labor arbitration body brought into existence up to that time. Its decisions affected the whole Eastern district: that is, that section of our country lying east of Chicago and East St. Louis, and north of the Ohio River to Parkersburg, West Virginia, and of the Potomac River to its mouth. Fifty-two railroad lines and over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> thousand engineers were involved. The latter negotiated through the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. The representatives of the Brotherhood and the members of the Conference Committee of Managers of the railroads held several conferences in March, 1912, at which the Brotherhood made certain requests. The conferences ended with the refusal of the roads to grant these requests or any part of them, whereupon ninety-three per cent of the members voted for a strike....", "...there's not a day passes over my head I don't wish for education.

As there is no separation of words in Sanskrit, the _gyanis_ or interpreters of the guru's hymns prefer to follow the ancient practice of junction of words. This makes the reading of the Sikh scriptures very difficult, and is one of the causes of the decline of the Sikh religion. The hymns in the _Adi Granth_ are arranged not according to the gurus or bhagats who compose them, but according to rags or musical measures. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> such measures in the _Adi Granth_, and the hymns are arranged according to the measures to which they are composed. The gurus who composed hymns, namely the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and ninth gurus, all used the name Nanak as their nom-de-plume. Their compositions are distinguished by mahallas or wards. Thus the compositions of Guru Nanak are styled mahalla one, the compositions of Guru Angad are styled mahalla two, and so on.

We know not when he was born, or when he died, except that from one or two incidental passages in his work it is plain that he lived nearly to the end of the fourth century: and it is even uncertain whether he was a Christian or a Pagan; though the general belief is, that he adhered to the religion of the ancient Romans, without, however, permitting it to lead him even to speak disrespectfully of Christians or Christianity. His History, which he divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-one</span> books (of which the first thirteen are lost, while the text of those which remain is in some places imperfect), began with the accession of Nerva, A.D. 96, where Tacitus and Suetonius end, and was continued to the death of Valens, A.D. 378, a period of 282 years.
