His death occurred, and put an end to the expedition, which Thorfinn took up with his marriage to the young...", "...man is in debt he'll try to pay it off. They always do, at least.

The spherical shape of the mirror itself, one of the easiest possible structures to erect in space, had dictated the placement of the rods through its center since there was no single focal point for the entire mirror surface. But it had also added a complication. From this position, the rods could have been designed to fire either straight forward or straight back. However, due to the hollow nature of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> hundred foot laser barrel; the necessity for access to the rods from inside that barrel; and the placement of the control booth at its outside end, the firing could only be forward, straight towards the sun on which the mirror was focused.

This problem had been solved by one of the largest mirror surfaces that man had ever created--flat to a quarter of a wave-length of light, and two hundred fifty...", "...them into their camp, and murdered all except one, who, although wounded, succeeded in making his escape.

As early as a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, shortly after England had acquired the Canadas, Captain Jonathan Carver, who had been an officer in the British provincial army, conceived the idea of fitting out an expedition to cross the continent between the forty-third and forty-sixth degrees of north latitude.

In the low panelled hall-sittingroom of the BURLACOMBE'S farmhouse on the village green, MICHAEL STRANGWAY, a clerical collar round his throat and a dark Norfolk jacket on his back, is playing the flute before a very large framed photograph of a woman, which is the only picture on the walls.

Get started, please.\" The driver was off like a shot. Jimmy looked at his watch. \"You've got <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes to make it,\" he said. The driver's only response was to put on more speed. Over rough roads he went spinning, as recklessly as the mountaineer had done in his Ford. But the great car he drove took up shocks and the speed did not seem so great. Jimmy wanted to protest, but when he glanced at the speedometer he thought better of it. He sat in silence, watching the road, as they went roaring along. Once on the cement highway, the driver opened his throttle, and...", "...batter.

John Adams called him \"a Roman\" because he resembled Cato more than any of his contemporaries.

The captivity of North Israel exceeds that of Judah by the interval between the destruction of Samaria (722) and the fall of Jerusalem, a period which actually measured about a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. In the Hebrew text, however, the length of Israel's captivity is given as three hundred and ninety years--that is, it must have lasted for three hundred and fifty years before that of Judah begins. This is obviously quite irreconcilable with the facts of history, and also with the prophet's intention. He cannot mean that the banishment of the northern tribes was to be protracted for two centuries after that of Judah had come to an end, for he uniformly speaks of the...", "...of water in places the Canadian canoe came through without taking any water on board.

It was a long, and not particularly well-proportioned apartment,--according, at least, to modern notions,--for it had rather the appearance of two rooms thrown into one. At the distance of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet, the walls, before somewhat narrow, were met by an arch, supported by carved pilasters, which opened into a space nearly double the width of the previous part of the room, with a domed ceiling and an embayed window of such depth that the recess almost formed a chamber in itself.

So he ordered a general charge.

They soon came to that conclusion themselves and began a running retreat for the Red Cloud Agency. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles, over the roughest kind of ground, we drove them before us. Soon they were forced to abandon their spare horses and all the equipment they had brought along. Despite the imminent risk of encountering thousands of other Indians at the Agency, we drove our late adversaries directly into it.

During the fight, Farragut watched it and gave his directions from a place high up in the main rigging of his flagship, the Hartford.

You can hire a horse, saddle and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week, and the owner will take care of them at his own expense. It is time to close this day's record--bed time.

By 1621 missions had reached the Nevomes and Sahuaripas in the upper Yaqui River valley. A revolt among the Nevomes in 1622 was put down by Hurdaide. The Mayo and Yaqui valleys were now made a separate rectorate. Several of the pioneers now left the scene. In 1620 Ribas went to Mexico as provincial; in 1625 Father Perez died, after <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, of service, and in 1626 Hurdaide was succeeded by Captain Perea.

His first prize was a big French ship, which, although Davis had only a small sloop and a crew of but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> men, he managed to take by a bold and clever trick. After taking a few more ships in the West Indies, Davies sailed across the Atlantic to the Island of St. Nicholas in the Cape Verde Islands.

When Davis reluctantly left this delightful spot, five of his crew were missing, \"being so charmed with the Luxuries of the Place, and the Conversation of...", "...but, magistrates, order your fields to be cultivated as usual.

At any rate, his success was very moderate. He was very glad, then, to be appointed Professor of Anatomy at Dartmouth College in 1838, a position that he held until 1840. About this time, too, he received prizes for some _Medical Essays_ that are even to-day regarded as valuable. Thus he was gradually fitting himself for the honorable office offered him in 1847, that of Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in the Medical School of Harvard University. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years Holmes filled this position with the greatest success. He was given the fifth hour in the day as his lecture period because he was the only one able to hold the attention of students who had already been listening to four long and difficult lectures.

His features were tolerably regular, but his prominent forehead, his grey eyes deeply set beneath the brows, and close to his hook nose, his large mouth and high cheek bones, gave him something of a resemblance to a bird of prey.

Smolny had demanded some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> millions of rubles from the State Bank, and the cashier had locked the vaults, only paying out money to the representatives of the Provisional Government.

In passing through the plains, which were yesterday so arid and dry, I found immense pools, nay almost large reaches of water lodged in the hollows, and in which boats might have floated. Such was the result of only an hour or two's rain, whilst the ground itself, formerly so hard, was soft and boggy in the extreme, rendering progress much slower and more fatiguing to the horses than it otherwise would have been. By steadily persevering we made a stage of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles, but were obliged to encamp at night some miles short of the little height I had been steering for. During our ride we passed several dry watercourses at five, ten, twenty-five, thirty, and thirty-five miles from our last encampment. The last we halted upon with good feed for the horses, and rainwater lodged everywhere. All these watercourses took their course to the north, emptying and losing themselves in the plains.

It was once a two story stone building, with ponderous walls. In length it is fifty-five feet by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet broad--pierced for six windows in each story, with a well-proportioned door, in the centre. In 1843, at the date of my first visit, the floor of the second story was yet tolerably strong: I ascended to it by a rickety, old staircase. The ruin was sketched in 1858, by Col. Benj.

The lofty mountain to the north-west of it is called _La Montagne des Ormes_; for more than a century, the Charlesbourg...", "...railroad engineering. Since the war with Chile railroad enterprise has been checked. The number of miles of road in operation rose from 962 in 1875 to 1,615 in 1880, but was, owing to the abandonment of certain lines, diminished to 813 in 1884. Since that time about 400 miles of new road have been opened. In the Republic of Bolivia the first railroad was built about twenty years ago from Antofogasta to Solar. After the cession of the province of Antofogasta to Chile there remained but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles of road in Bolivia. More than 200 miles have since been added by the construction of several short roads, chiefly the property of mining companies. The Republic of Chile was the first of the South American states to initiate the construction of railways. The building of a line from the seaport Caldera to Copiapo was commenced in May, 1850, and was completed on January 2, 1852. This line was constructed and operated by a private company.

But it turned out to be somebody else, and my good intentions also turned out to my misfortune. Then we ran back toward the schools of tuna.

We found the tuna milling and lolling around, slowly drifting and heading toward the southeast. We also found a very light breeze had begun to come out of the west. Captain Dan wanted to try to get the kite up, but I objected on the score that if we could fly it at all it would only be to drag a bait behind the boat.

P.'s birthday._ Some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, in New York city, at Tammany hall, of which place I was then a frequenter, I happen'd to become quite well acquainted with Thomas Paine's perhaps most intimate chum, and certainly his later years' very frequent companion, a remarkably fine old man, Col. Fellows, who may yet be remember'd by some stray relics of that period and spot. If you will allow me, I will first give a description of the Colonel himself. He was tall, of military bearing, aged about 78, I...", "...he fought him. When he was guilty of foul play himself (as was sometimes the case, for who is perfect?) he felt inclined to jump out of his own body and turn about and thrash himself! And he would have done so often, had it been practicable. Yes, there is no doubt whatever about it March Marston was mad--as mad, after a fashion, as any creature, human or otherwise, you choose to name. Young Marston's mother was a handsome, stout, blue-eyed, flaxen-haired woman, of a little over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> summers. She was an English emigrant, and had, seventeen years before the time we write of settled at Pine Point, on the banks of the Yellowstone River, along with her brother, the blacksmith above referred to. At that time she was the sweetest maiden in all the village, and now she was the handsomest matron. Indeed, the bloom of her youth remained on her cheeks so little impaired that she was often mistaken by strangers for March Marston's elder sister. The men of the...", "...he took her out on to the moor under Karva. They always went the same way, up the green sheep-track that they knew; they always turned back at the same place, where the stream he had seen her jumping ran from the hill; and they always took the same time to go and turn. They never stopped and never lingered; but went always at the same sharp pace, and kept the same distance from each other. It was as if by saying to themselves, \"Never any further than the stream; never any longer than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes; never any nearer than we are now,\" they defined the limits of their whole relation. Sometimes they hardly spoke as they walked. They parted with casual words and with no touching of their hands and with the same thought unspoken--\"Till the next time.\" But these times which were theirs only did not count as time. They belonged to another scale of feeling and another order of reality. Their moments had another pulse, another rhythm and vibration. They burned as...", "...the writer's earlier experiences with these children. Although they were not frightened, and plainly understood that they were to go anywhere in the room, and were to do or say anything that was necessary, they almost invariably waited to be told when to step to the board; when an answer was wrong; when something had been overlooked or forgotten; when the pointer should be taken up or laid aside; and when they were through with a question. Between three and four recitation periods of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes each were consumed, before they were able to do all that was necessary in answering the extremely simple questions above, with a half-dozen more, without help. Their frequent smiles of chagrin, too, proved beyond question that they were fully in earnest in their efforts. This helplessness was not exhibited on the first few days either. It was their custom to wait for assistance and directions--even to sit down--and it was a custom so well established that five weeks...", "...of their flesh, they are not worth breeding, unless to cross with the common varieties; in which case, the musk drake must be put to the common duck. This will produce a very large cross, while the opposite course will beget a very inferior one. THE GOOSE. THE WILD GOOSE. The goose belongs to the same family as the duck, but is classed with the genus _anser_. The _gray-leg_ goose--a common wild goose of England--is by some regarded as the original of the domestic bird. It is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> inches long; upper parts ash-brown and ash-gray; under parts white. This variety is migratory, proceeding to the Northern parts of Europe and Asia in summer, and to the South in winter. The _Canada_, or Cravat goose, the wild goose of this country, is a fine species, forty inches long, often seen in spring and autumn in large, triangular flocks, high in air, and led by an old, experienced gander, who frequently utters a loud _honk_, equivalent, doubtless, to \"All's well!\"...", "...\"I have come to the conclusion that for our purpose police statistics are no good at all. As an evidence of this I will mention something with which I am acquainted in Birmingham. On a certain Saturday the number of persons arrested for drunkenness and brought before the magistrates was said to be 29--that was the total number of drunken cases credited, or rather, as I should say, debited to the town, according to the police statistics. During three hours of that same Saturday night, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> houses in different parts of the town, beer houses, spirit shops and shops of other descriptions, were watched by different persons appointed for the purpose; and these persons reported that during those three hours 9159 males and 5006 females came out of those shops; and, out of these numbers, of the male persons there were 622 drunk, and 176 females in the same state. There is a total of 798 drunken persons, alleged to have been seen coming out of 35 houses in three...", "...in the battle of Franklin.

Burnside was thirty-seven when he made the admirable record of his North-Carolina campaign. Howard was thirty-two when he was assigned to the command of a corps, and only a year older when he succeeded McPherson in the command of the army of the Tennessee. McPherson was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> when he gave up his heroic life on the bloody field before Atlanta.

In the low panelled hall-sittingroom of the BURLACOMBE'S farmhouse on the village green, MICHAEL STRANGWAY, a clerical collar round his throat and a dark Norfolk jacket on his back, is playing the flute before a very large framed photograph of a woman, which is the only picture on the walls. His age is about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> his figure thin and very upright and his clean-shorn face thin, upright, narrow, with long and rather pointed ears; his dark hair is brushed in a coxcomb off his forehead.

There is something about the whole...", "...looked up at the food. It was still beyond his reach and he made no effort to get it, but instead, he reached from his perch on the big box for the next smaller box, which was approximately sixteen inches, by fourteen, by twelve. This he succeeded in pulling toward him, at the same time raising it slightly from the floor, but his efforts caused the large box to topple over and he quit work. The experiment was discontinued after a few minutes, the total period of observation having been <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes. Skirrl handled the boxes with ease and with evident pleasure and interest. He also noticed the carrot at various times during the interval, but his attention was fixed on it only for short periods. The test was continued on August 24 when, instead of a carrot, a half banana was used as bait. It was placed only five feet from the floor, and three boxes were as formerly placed in distant corners of the cage. When admitted, Skirrl looked at the banana, then pulled...", "...a few facts from the very short brief with which I have been provided. This Institution was founded in the year 1838. During the first five years of its existence, it was not particularly robust, and seemed to have been placed in rather a shaded position, receiving somewhat more than its needful allowance of cold water. In 1843 it was removed into a more favourable position, and grafted on a nobler stock, and it has now borne fruit, and become such a vigorous tree that at present <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> old people daily sit within the shelter of its branches, and all the pensioners upon the list have been veritable gardeners, or the wives of gardeners.

He then put in a claim of about the same amount for his expenses to Europe in 1844, and for amounts paid a deputy during his absence. The Government paid his claim, thus showing that they believed him morally entitled to the interest which he had repaid. In 1860, Ryerson made a three months' educational tour, addressing County Conventions. In all, he attended <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> meetings, giving addresses on the subjects of \"Vagrant Children,\" \"Free Schools,\" and \"Public Grammar Schools.\" He was given a public dinner by the teachers of Northumberland and Durham on the occasion of his official visit to Cobourg. In 1866 he made a similar tour, addressing forty meetings in seven weeks. His chief object was to create public opinion in favor of legislation on compulsory attendance, public libraries and township Boards of Trustees. Later in the same year...", "...and bring us safely home again. Soon afterwards we were rattling away to Waterloo Station, with our traps, including our still blank journals, our sketch-books, fishing-rods, our guns, several works on natural history, bottles and boxes for specimens, spy-glasses, and lots of other things. Papa laughed when he saw them. \"It would not do if we were going to join a man-of-war; but we have room to stow away a good number of things on board the Lively, although she is little more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> tons burden.\" In a quarter of an hour the train started for Southampton; and away we flew, the heat and the dust increasing our eagerness to feel the fresh sea-breezes. \"Although the Lively can show a fast pair of heels, we cannot go quite so fast as this,\" said papa, as he remarked the speed at which we dashed by the telegraph posts. On reaching the station at Southampton, we found Paul Truck, the sailing-master of the cutter, or the captain, as he liked to be...", "...eight pears. Adelaide washed, wiped, pared, quartered and removed the core from each pear. The cup of sugar, half cup each of water and vinegar, cinnamon stick and whole cloves were put into the saucepan and placed over the fire, then the teaspoon of mixed ground spices was also added; the latter were tied in a small piece of muslin. These Adelaide let boil for five minutes, after which she skimmed the syrup and added the pears. It was necessary to boil the pears very gently for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes, stirring them frequently with the wooden spoon, but carefully so as not to break the fruit. When they were done Adelaide lifted the pears out carefully with a silver fork into the sterilized pint jar, and poured in the syrup to overflowing. With a silver knife, which she inserted between the fruit and jar, she let all air bubbles rise to the top and break, then fitted on a new rubber smoothly, sealed the jar quickly and stood it upside down out of the way of any...", "...of the House. In a remarkably brilliant speech before the House on December 5 and 6, 1867, he maintained the doctrine that the president and all other civil officers could be impeached for acts that were not indictable, although the contrary was held by many eminent lawyers, including President Dwight, of Columbia College, who wrote a treatise in support of his theory. But the House preferred articles that did not allege an indictable offence and the Senate sustained them by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to eighteen, one less than the number necessary for conviction. On April 22 and 23, 1868, Mr. Boutwell, on behalf of the managers, addressed the Senate, delivering one of the strongest and ablest arguments on record, and thus completing, as a lawyer, the most exhaustive labor he ever attempted. He was a member of the Committee of Fifteen which reported the Fourteenth Amendment, and while serving on the committee on the judiciary he reported and carried through the House...", "...our force for us on the third day, so that at the end of the week, or Saturday night, the job was nearly done, and well done, too. On the third day I had taken the precaution to throw out in the inside of our enclosure a sort of open fence, on which I could put the wet boards to dry, which at first I had placed on our side fence. I told McLoughlin, what was true enough, that the south sun was better for them than the sun from the west. So I ran out what I may call a screen <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet from the church, and parallel with it, on which I set up these boards to dry, and to my great joy I saw that they would wholly protect the roof of my little house from any observation from the houses the other side of the way while the workmen were at work, or even after they were inhabited. There was not one of the workmen with me who had forethought enough or care for our master's interest to ask whose boards those were which we left there, or why we left them...", "...among these are extensive rights of pasture on four commons, near the town; and, as we have observed, liberation from all tolls throughout the kingdom.

Young Boyer Fonfrede required to be included in the proscription of his colleagues, and the members of the Right and the Plain rose, exclaiming, \"All! all!\" This petition, though declared calumnious, was the first attack upon the convention from without, and it prepared the public mind for the destruction of the Gironde.

The amount and quality of the blood, and its physiological effect upon the vessels and cells of the brain, must largely depend upon the regularity and perfect discharge of this function; and in the case of married women the whole economy is subject to the large changes which come from conception, pregnancy, child-birth, and lactation.

The Chinese squadron had similarly convoyed four thousand troops to the Yalu River. These were landed on the 16th, and on the morning of the 17th the fleet started on its return.

In 1809 the French besieged her with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand men.

Those who were thought to have embraced Christianity returned to their practises as soon as they rejoined their fellows. \"The reason for this want of success,\" says the father, \"is the bad impression produced on the minds of these intelligent natives by the cruelties and immoralities of the Christians, which are more barbarous than those of the islanders...", "...Rockies; and the legend of Monte Cristo scarcely more fabulous than the exploits of Van Horne in getting the money or the work done without it.

Nearing Juneau we passed the Davidson glacier sufficiently near to distinguish the strange and beautiful effects produced upon its white and glittering surface by cloud and sunshine. This is the second largest ice-field in Alaska, the finest being its immediate neighbour, the Muir glacier, which drains an area of 800 square miles.[90] The actual ice surface covers about 350 square miles, the mass of it, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles long and ten to fifteen miles wide, while surrounding it on three sides are mountains averaging 4000 to 6000 ft. in height. Vessels dare not approach the ice wall, about 250 ft. high, nearer than a quarter of a mile, as masses of ice continually fall from its surface, and submarine bergs, becoming detached from its sunken fore-foot rise to the surface with tremendous force. The colour of the ice on the Muir glacier is as curious as it is beautiful, varying from the...", "...upon its being called in. And from very good arguments they find that there cannot be less of it in Ireland and Scotland than L100,000; so that there is but L150,000 missing; and of that, suppose that there should be not above 650,000 still remaining, either melted down, hid, or lost, or hoarded up in England, there will then be but L100,000 left to be thought to have been transported.

At last Hastings withdrew from the Council, followed by Barwell.

For the moment it seemed as if Francis and his party had carried the day. Hastings had his back to the wall, he seemed to be well-nigh friendless.

The BALANCED SENTENCE is made up of parts similar in form, but often contrasted in meaning; as, _He is a man; Jones is a gentleman._ 90. SENTENCE LENGTH. As to the length of the sentence there is no fixed rule. Frequently, sentences are too long, and are, in their thought, involved and hard to follow. On the other hand, if there is a succession of short sentences, choppiness and roughness are the result. One should carefully examine sentences which contain more than thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> words to see that they are clear in their meaning and accurate in their construction.

The chief reason, however, why the Union made so much less stir than the Federation, lies in the nature of the work it undertook to do.

Much of Aunt Sarah's spare time was devoted to her chickens, which fully repaid her for the care given them. She was not particular about fancy stock, but had quite a variety--White Leghorns, Brown Leghorns, big, fat, motherly old Brahma hens that had raised a brood of as many as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> little chicks at one time, a few snow-white, large Plymouth Rocks and some gray Barred one. The _latter_ she _liked_ particularly because she said they were much, more talkative than any of the others; they certainly did appear to chatter to her when she fed them. She gave them clean, comfortable quarters, warm bran mash on cold winter mornings, alternating with cracked corn and \"scratch feed\" composed of a mixture of cracked corn, wheat and buckwheat, scattered over a...", "...engineering than the construction of street sewers.

The only question to my mind is: What is \"higher education\" and how do you get it? With which goes the secondary enquiry, What is a woman and is she just the same as a man? I know that it sounds a terrible thing to say in these days, but I don't believe she is. Let me say also that when I speak of coeducation I speak of what I know. I was coeducated myself some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, at the very beginning of the thing. I learned my Greek alongside of a bevy of beauty on the opposite benches that mashed up the irregular verbs for us very badly.

Then, after dinner, I went down to my cellar, one of the finest in the city, twelve feet high and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet long, all built of hewn stone, under the main street. It was as dry as an oven, and even improved wine in the long run. As my spirits of wine might arrive before the end of the month, I arranged four large beams to hold the pipes, and saw that the well, cut in the rock, had enough water for mixing it. On going up about four o'clock, I perceived the old architect, Kromer, who was walking across the market, his measuring-stick under his arm. \"Ah!\" said I, \"come...", "...came weakly: \"Catch hold of Hallam. I'm down and----\" But Dan understood, even before he heard. While Dave clutched at one of the life buoys Dalzell shot out an arm, dragging Hallam in to safety. Now, it was Darrin who, with both arms, contrived to link the buoys together. At last the youngsters had a chance to observe the fact that the battleships had put about and were coming back. \"We'll soon be all right,\" sighed Dave contentedly, as soon as he could speak. \"There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> hundred officers, middies and sailors of the American Navy to look after our safety.\" From where they lay as they hung to the buoys the chums could even see the launches lowered. Dan, with some of the emergency lashing about the buoy, succeeded, after a good deal of effort, and with some aid from Dave, in passing a cord about Hallam and under the latter's armpits that secured that midshipman to one of the buoys. The next move of the chums was to lash the buoys...", "...her; nor had she the courage to present herself before him.

However, this did not satisfy him, and he legally arranged to pay to the community an annuity of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> livres, being the interest of the seven hundred livres I refused to accept. After his death, his son, a member of the Legislative Assembly, added to this an annuity of three hundred livres, interest on six thousand, which was donated for three yearly Masses, for the repose of his father's soul, which Masses are celebrated to this day on the 22d, 23d, and 24th of April; so charitable were these gentlemen to the embryo Congregation.

In brackets was the notation: \"Special Service work.\" \"But I only spent <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cents for car fare, and the suit of clothes I soaked is as good as ever,\" declared Ralph. \"You do as you're told, Fairbanks,\" directed Denny, with a magnanimous wave of his hand. \"Now then, we, Tim and I and Matthewson, the road detective, estimate you had better keep active hands off railroading for about two weeks.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago some workmen of Rochdale, noticing the great profits made by shopkeepers in retail trade, resolved to work together by buying their own supplies wholesale, and distributing them amongst the members of the society which they established.

Hiram gradually picked up a retail route in the town, which customers paid more for the surplus vegetables--and butter--than could be obtained at the stores.

The torch-bearers and other attendants generally brought his retinue up to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or forty men, and sometimes even more. There were stations on the road every ten miles where relays were obtained, and there was always more or less delay at these stations, so that the palkee was not a rapid means of travel.

As usual, the native chauffeur was dashing along at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles an hour when he should not have driven faster than twenty at the most. One of the front wheels slid into a deep rut, the car turned completely over and the resulting casualties numbered one man dead and our Czech seriously injured.

But his activity always found varied outlets. He secured a lucrative share in the profits of the King's Playhouse, one of the two theaters of the time which alone were allowed to present regular plays, and he held the mainly honorary positions of poet laureate and historiographer-royal.

Its level is very much broken by low, winding ridges, and it is variegated by numerous light-streaks. At its western end it blends into the Marsh of Mists (I) and the Marsh of Putrefaction (K).

The bay is semicircular in form, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles long and eighty-four miles broad. Its surface is dark and level. At either end a splendid cape extends into the Sea of Showers, the eastern one being called Cape Heraclides, and the western Cape Laplace. They are both crowned by high peaks.

He went a long way towards gaining this object of his ambition, for he embarked on a career which, in rather less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, resulted in an empire extending from the Great Wall of China to the frontier of Asia Minor, and from the Sea of Aral to the River Ganges and the Persian Gulf. He had, by this time, conquered twenty-seven separate States and extinguished nine dynasties. He effected his purpose, not only by force of arms, but by a deliberate policy of terrorism.

Between 1829 and 1858 twenty-three Irish Land Reform Bills were introduced in the House of Commons; every one was rejected. In the same period <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> Coercion Bills were introduced; every one was passed.

The old one had improved in condition; the other which he had purchased at Logan Station with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> dollars of John's money, was a fine animal. It should have been as the price was a good one.

The two ships, the Grande Hermine and the Emerillon, lay at anchor ready to sail. Owing to the diminished numbers of his company, Cartier had decided to abandon the third ship. He announced a final ceremony to signalize the approaching departure. On May 3, 1536, a tall cross, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet high was planted on the river bank. Beneath the cross-bar it carried the arms of France, and on the upper part a scroll in ancient lettering that read, 'FRANCISCUS PRIMUS DEI GRATIA FRANCORUM REX REGNAT' Which means, freely translated, 'Francis I, by the grace of God King of the French, is sovereign.'

By this time even Grant was so annoyed at what seemed to him unreasoning delay that he sent Logan to take command at once and \"fight.\" But on the fifteenth of December Thomas came out of his works and fought Hood with determined skill all day. Having gained a decisive advantage already he pressed it home to the very utmost on the morrow, breaking through Hood's shaken lines, enveloping...", "...and mesquite exist.

We gave them a clean cloth until they needed us, but as they came up we divided out and were ready to give the lead a good push. If a cow changed his mind about taking a swim that morning, he changed it right back and took it.

The country has become very sandy, and the plants less varied and abundant, with the exception of the _amorpha_, which rivals the grass in quantity, though not so forward as it has been found to the eastward. At the Big Trees, where we had intended to noon, no water was to be found.

About one o'clock P.M., on the 13th, we captured Royall's camp at Old Church; about sunset we reached Tunstall's, nine miles distant, and at daylight on the 14th got to a point on the Chickahominy twelve miles from there, where we stayed until noon. So if we had been pursued at the rate of a mile an hour, we would have been overtaken. But the danger was not over when we were over the Chickahominy. We were still <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles from Richmond and in the rear of McClellan's army, which was five or six miles above us. It was necessary to pass through swamps where the horses sunk to their saddle girths, and when we emerged from these, we had to go for twenty miles on a road in full view of the enemy's gunboats on one side of us in the James River, and McClellan's army within a few miles on the other.

The dynamos belong to the alternating type, and are comparatively simple in construction. In a previous chapter upon the dynamo it was stated that the fundamental feature was the relation that the field-magnet and the armature sustained to each other, and that in some cases the field-magnet revolves while the part that is technically called the armature remains stationary. In other cases the armature revolves and the field-magnets are stationary. In the latter case...", "...But sweet St. Barbara will never be forgotten.

The appreciative Spaniards honored her memory by bestowing her pretty name on the choicest spot of the coast, a belt of land seventy miles long and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> wide, from Point Concepcion to Buena Ventura. No one can dare to doubt this tragic tale, for Barbara's head may still be seen preserved as a relic in the temple of All Saints at Rome.

The small family average was almost precisely the same as in Nashville. There were only 161 children under 6 years of age, and 60 married couples were childless! The interpretation has already been suggested in the foregoing quotations. From all of this it is clear, not only that the coloured birth rate is low and is falling, but why it is low, and why it is falling. It is almost impossible that it should long remain so much as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> per thousand per annum, or even thirty-four or thirty-three. It seems certainly descending towards thirty--that is, 300 births per myriad yearly. But the present death rate is 296 per myriad; it fell only three, from 299 to 296, in the decade from 1890 to 1900; it actually rose from 308 to 313 in the cities of the non-registration area.

As he sailed out, he encountered a Chinese pirate, who very soon surrendered. He put seventeen soldiers aboard of her and continued his course. While rounding Cape Borgador near Cagayan one fair morning at dawn, they found themselves near a Japanese ship, which Juan Pablo engaged with the admiral's galley in which he himself was. With his artillery he shot away their mainmast, and killed several men.

Immediately above the landing a wide and deep ravine opens to the river. For some distance back from the river its bottom was filled with back-water and was impassable. Half a mile back it was still deep, abrupt, and wet, though passable for infantry. Here Colonel Webster gathered from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to fifty guns. Two of Hurlbut's batteries--Mann's, commanded by Lieutenant Brotzman, and Ross'--had done brilliant service; Brotzman's battery of four pieces had fired off one hundred and ninety-four rounds per gun.

Thirty-six Guelph houses were pulled down: among them the Tosinghi palace in the New Market, a building measuring one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet in height, and faced with many tiers of marble columns.

Therefore, Jesus, during his fight against Pharisees, Sadducees and priests, had to make his principal home on Mount Olivet. But he could not split the mountain, as Zachariah imagined God would, and move one part North and the other South; therefore, the curtain of the temple had to be torn in twain when Jesus died, although none has ever mentioned the fact. The curtain was there some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years after the death of Jesus; had it been torn, somebody must have noticed it. The earthquake mentioned by Zachariah, of course, was borrowed to embellish Calvary.... Because Zachariah states God coming to Jerusalem, 'And the Lord my God cometh, all the saints with thee,' therefore the saints and not the sinners had to resurrect and visit the city on that particular day. But in the fertile imagination of Zachariah, the day of that terrible combat must be dark.... This...", "...but his love for California was too strong and he returned in 1875.

These I cultivated with the same assiduity as I had used with the German. I...", "...say after you have read this. I cannot yet decide whether I have lost a great happiness, the greatest that could come to any man, or escaped the worst misfortune that could befall me. But, such as it is, I will try to set the fact honestly down.

I am no longer young, though at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> an Altrurian is by no means so old as an American at the same age. The romantic ideals of the American women which I had formed from the American novels had been dissipated; if I had any sentiment towards them, as a type, it was one of distrust, which my very sense of the charm in their inconsequence, their beauty, their brilliancy, served rather to intensify. I thought myself doubly defended by that difference between their civilization and ours which forbade reasonable...", "...their way up stream, Henderson acting as pilot. The quarry was first reached, being situated only about half a mile above Fay Island, and a single glance sufficed to satisfy Gaunt that here was stone not only of splendid quality, but amply sufficient in quantity for every possible want of the party. The quarry-face consisted of an almost perpendicular cliff of grey limestone springing out of the soil at a distance of only some fifty feet from the margin of the stream; it was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet in height, and fully one hundred and fifty feet long, and of course of unknown depth, though a very hasty examination of the top showed that it extended fully fifty feet back from the face. Captain Blyth and Nicholls landed here, provided with the powder and such tools as they needed, and instructed by the engineer--who promised to rejoin them, as soon as he had inspected the coal outcrop--began at once to lay bare the stone at the top of the cliff. The rest of the...", "...in a little less than forty-two days, the distance of the planet from the earth being at this time, about thirty-six million miles. Nothing occurred for many days to interrupt our journey. We became accustomed to our strange surroundings, and many entertainments were provided to while away the time. The astronomers in the expedition found plenty of occupation in studying the aspects of the stars and the other heavenly bodies from their new point of view. At the expiration of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> days we had drawn so near to Mars that with our telescopes, which, though small, were of immense power, we could discern upon its surface features and details which no one had been able to glimpse from the earth. As the surface of this world, that we were approaching as a tiger hunter draws near the jungle, gradually unfolded itself to our inspection, there was hardly one of us willing to devote to sleep or idleness the prescribed eight hours that had been fixed as the...", "...defense against cavalry or infantry; and at nearly all the regular railroad-stations we had smaller detachments intrenched. I had little fear of the enemy's cavalry damaging our roads seriously, for they rarely made a break which could not be repaired in a few days; but it was absolutely necessary to keep General Hood's infantry off our main route of communication and supply. Forrest had with him in Middle Tennessee about eight thousand cavalry, and Hood's army was estimated at from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty thousand men, infantry and artillery, including Wheeler's cavalry, then about three thousand strong. We crossed the Chattahoochee River during the 3d and 4th of October, rendezvoused at the old battle-field of Smyrna Camp, and the next day reached Marietta and Kenesaw. The telegraph-wires had been cut above Marietta, and learning that heavy masses of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, had been seen from Kenesaw (marching north), I inferred that Allatoona was...", "...details of working parties, especially as our outpost and reconnoitring duty was also very laborious. This duty was done by infantry, for cavalry I had none, except the squad of mounted messengers, who kept carefully out of harm's way, more to save their horses than themselves, for they had been enlisted under an old law which paid them for the risk of their own horses, which risk they naturally tried to make as small as possible. My reconnoitring parties reached Big Sewell Mountain, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles up New River, Summersville, twenty miles up the Gauley, and made excursions into the counties on the left bank of the Kanawha, thirty or forty miles away. These were not exceptional marches, but were kept up with an industry that gave the enemy an exaggerated idea of our strength as well as of our activity.

Lee had arrived at Lewisburg to assume direction of the Confederate...", "...to Hall that he intended to write for serial publication no more than the six newspaper letters. He said: To write a book of travel would be less trouble than to write six detached chapters. Each of these letters requires the same variety of treatment and subject that one puts into a book; but in the book each chapter doesn't have to be rounded and complete in itself. He suggested that the six letters be gathered into a small volume which would contain about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or forty thousand words, to be sold as low as twenty-five cents, but this idea appears to have been dropped. At Ouchy Clemens conceived the idea of taking a little trip on his own account, an excursion that would be a rest after the strenuous three months' travel and sightseeing--one that he could turn into literature. He engaged Joseph Very, a courier used during their earlier European travels, and highly recommended in the Tramp Abroad. He sent Joseph over to Lake...", "...if Donna Ippolita had not pressed me to come. She assured me that I should find good company there, and that the cook would excel himself. I felt rather curious to see the company, and with the idea of shewing Zanovitch that I was not likely to become a charge on his purse, I dressed myself magnificently once more. As I had expected, I found Medini and his mistress there, with two foreign ladies and their attendant cavaliers, and a fine-looking and well-dressed Venetian, between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and forty, whom I would not have recognized if Zanovitch had not told me his name, Alois Zen. \"Zen was a patrician name, and I felt obliged to ask what titles I ought to give him. \"Such titles as one old friend gives another, though it is very possible you do not recollect me, as I was only ten years old when we saw each other last.\" Zen then told me he was the son of the captain I had known when I was under arrest at St. Andrews. \"That's twenty-eight years ago;...", "...side, and with which the throat of the murdered youth had been cut. The baillie immediately recognized the instrument as one which he had on the previous day given to the workman who had served as the apprentice's guide, for the purpose of pruning some willows.

The assassin, who is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age, was a native of Billwaerder, and previously to the perpetration of the murder, had always borne an irreproachable character.\" It is well known that sensations from without will not only frequently excite dreaming, but will also often determine the character of the dreams. The following story is evidently an example of a dream of this nature.

I should, say that proper nouns and abbreviations, such as Joe, Jim, Alf, Hal, Flo, Ike, etc., are disallowed. Now, the present puzzle is a variation of the above. It is simply this: Instead of using the fifteen letters given, the reader is allowed to select any fifteen different letters of the alphabet that he may prefer.

If we are not yet too well convinced of the reality of this melancholy picture, let us but look for a moment into the next period of twenty-five years; and we shall see twenty-eight millions of human beings without the means of support; and before the conclusion of the first century, the population would be one hundred and twelve millions, and the food only sufficient for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> millions, leaving seventy-seven millions unprovided for. In these ages want would be indeed triumphant, and rapine and murder must reign at large: and yet all this time we are supposing the produce of the earth absolutely unlimited, and the yearly increase greater than the boldest speculator can imagine. This is undoubtedly a very different view of the difficulty arising from population from that which Mr Godwin gives, when he says, 'Myriads of centuries of still...", "...a fine sermon, but too flowery for my tastes,\"--\"Yes, we expect a good Shrove this year,\"--\"His _Data of Ethics_ won't stand examination,\"--\"Our fellows will lick yours well next time,\"--\"Picking the grapes and lemons at Tivoli,\"--\"Poor old Kirby, what an age he is,\"--\"'Twilight and evening bell, and after that the dark, And may there be no sadness of farewell, when I embark,' that's the way it runs,\"--\"He cut in his physic year, and is running a paper in Boston,\"--\"It is up now to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> shillings a ton, and will go higher,\" etc., etc. The older men, under the more kindly influence, were calm as sophomores.

Jervis was cruelly embarrassed. A trusted subordinate of high reputation had been before Cadiz with seven ships-of-the-line, watching a French division in that port. Summoned, in view of the threatening attitude of Spain, to reinforce the main fleet in San Fiorenzo Bay, he lost his head altogether, hurried past Gibraltar without getting supplies, and brought his ships destitute to the admiral, already pressed to maintain the vessels then with him. Although there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> hostile ships in Toulon and the British had only twenty-two, counting this division, there was nothing to do but to send it back to Gibraltar, under urgent orders to return with all speed. With true military insight and a correct appreciation of the forces opposed to him, Jervis saw the need of fighting the combined enemies then and there. Unfortunately, the division commander, Admiral Mann, on reaching Gibraltar, became infected with the spirit of discouragement then...", "...choice. One of their number, Jacques Marquette, was chosen to accompany him. He passed up the lakes to Michillimackinac; and found his destined companion at Point St. Ignace, on the north side of the strait; where, in his palisaded mission-house and chapel, he had labored for two years past to instruct the Huron refugees from St. Esprit, and a band of Ottawas who had joined them. Marquette was born in 1637, of an old and honorable family at Laon, in the north of France, and was now <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age. When about seventeen, he had joined the Jesuits, evidently from motives purely religious; and in 1666 he was sent to the missions of Canada. At first he was destined to the station of Tadoussac; and, to prepare himself for it, he studied the Montagnais language under Gabriel Druilletes. But his destination was changed, and he was sent to the Upper Lakes in 1668, where he had since remained. His talents as a linguist must have been great; for, within a few...", "...one of his legs just above the ankle.

Eight of the strongest men of the party then undertook the task of carrying the injured man a distance of four miles, and up a hill 1,700 feet high. It is indicative of the extraordinary formation of the Grand Canon that the last half mile was an angle of 45 degrees, up a loose rock slide.

In Northeastern Oregon, where the great crops of wheat are beginning to be grown, the farmer is at the mercy of the Transportation Company, which hitherto has sucked the oyster and left the farmer the shell. For what profit can there be in growing wheat at thirty and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cents a bushel, that same wheat being worth one hundred cents in Portland, and the difference being absorbed in freight and charges? And yet, so great is the charm of novelty, so prone are a large number of the emigrants to this State to try a new place, that land up there fetches from five to fifteen dollars an acre, just about the same price for which they could buy a farm in the valley foot-hills, where wheat was worth seventy-five cents against the thirty-five, and...", "...line between townships nineteen (19) and twenty (20) south to the southeast corner of township nineteen (19) south, range thirty-six (36) east; thence northerly along the range line between ranges thirty-six (36) and thirty-seven (37) east to the quarter-section corner on the east line of section thirty-six (36), township nineteen (19) south, range thirty-six (36) east, westerly on a line through the centers of sections thirty-six (36) and thirty-five (35) to the center of section <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> (35), northerly on a line through the centers of sections thirty-five (35), twenty-six (26), twenty-three (23), and fourteen (14) to the center of section fourteen (14), easterly on a line through the center of section fourteen (14) to the quarter-section corner between said section fourteen (14) and section thirteen (13), and northerly along the section lines on the west boundary of sections thirteen (13), twelve (12), and one (1) to the northwest corner of section one...", "...traps.

You should have let Ravick get that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> centisol price established for the Co-operative, and then had Murell offer seventy-five or something like that.\" \"You crazy?\" Joe demanded. \"Why, then the Co-op would have been stuck with it.\" \"That's right. And as soon as Murell's price was announced, everybody would drop out of the Co-operative and reclaim their wax, even the captains who owe Ravick money. He'd have nobody left but a handful of thugs and barflies.\" \"But that would smash the Co-operative,\" Joe...", "...of the time. He did not himself possess a watch, and he could not rely upon some distant church clock informing him of the passage of the night. Fortunately he remembered that Tom Graham, who slept in a bed next door but one to his, possessed a watch. He would time his departure by Tom Graham's watch. Then there was the difficulty of egress--how was he to get away? In his strong desire to play the more heroic part, he would have liked to have dropped from the window of his bedroom some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet on to the paving-stones of the courtyard below. But then he reflected that he would not improbably break his neck, and it would be just as well not to begin his adventures by doing that; that sort of thing would come in its proper place a little later on. He might knot his sheets together, and form an impromptu rope, and descend by means of that: there were charms about the idea which commended themselves to him. He had seen a picture somewhere of a gallant youth...", "...at that moment, standing opposite the sources which had baffled the genius and courage of the most celebrated men for three thousand years.\" Bruce's narrative contains many other curious observations, but we must now pass on to his account of Lake Tzana. \"Lake Tzana,\" according to his narrative, \"is by far the largest sheet of water known in these regions. Its extent, however, has been greatly exaggerated. Its greatest breadth from Dingleber to Lamgue, i.e. from east to west, is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles, but it decreases greatly at each end, and in some parts is not above ten miles broad. Its greatest length is forty-nine miles from north to south, measured from Bab-Baha to a point a trifle to the S.W.1/4W. of the spot where the Nile, after flowing through the lake with an ever perceptible current, bends towards Dara in the Allata territory. In the dry season, from October to March, the lake decreases greatly; but when the rains have swollen the rivers, which unite...", "...extract contains the local tradition regarding the reception given to this Protestant Bishop, and has been kindly supplied by a priest of the diocese, whose parish was, in early times, the theatre of the apostolate of many a distinguished saint of our Irish Church:-- \"Lyons was an apostate from the beginning; he went to England and acknowledged the Queen's supremacy, and was left in quiet possession of the revenues of the diocese till his death, a period of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. On his return from England he was deserted by his clergy, who secreted all the plate connected with the cathedral and monastery, as also the bells, and chimes of bells, all solid silver, which were then valued at L7,000. The commissioners subsequently hanged all the aged friars that remained, on pretence that they knew where the above-named property was concealed, and refused to reveal it. At all events, the plate remained...", "...muckrakers, though unquestionably several hundred children ten to twelve years old, and possibly a few younger, were employed years ago. The nature of the work permits the employment of operatives under sixteen only in the spinning room; the girls, many of them older than sixteen, mend the broken ends of the yarn at the spinning frames, and the boys remove the full bobbins and fix empty ones in their stead. The possible percentage of workers under sixteen in a spinning mill varies from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty-five. In a mill which weaves the yarn into cloth, the percentage is greatly reduced, as practically no one under sixteen can be profitably employed in a weaving room. Public sentiment against the employment of children became aroused only slowly. Crusades against such industrial customs are usually led by organized labor, by professional philanthropists, by sentimentalists, and by socialistic agitators. The mill operatives of the South have shown little...", "...teachable--one of the most certain indications of her great capacities. Her _Marguerite_ was almost entirely her own, for she had not learned how to use dramatic instruction; her _Aida_ was almost Madame's own, for she had learned, then, and besides, did not understand the character; her _Bruenhilde_ was herself, trained and assisted into the best canons of interpretation by a loyal Wagnerian. It is a short part, of course, but it showed what she could have done with the rest of it. At <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> she could have done the whole _Ring_; at forty I believe no one could have equalled her. Carter got himself snarled hopelessly into a tangle with the government officials in Berlin (he was no diplomat, though a good fellow, and wild about Margarita, so that poor little Alice had more than one bad quarter-hour, I'm afraid) and it took Roger a great deal of Bradley influence with the American consul and a lot of patient correspondence to unravel his unlucky brother-in-law....", "...be rich.

What was Richard Gilbert about to say? The young, sweet, wistful face was fair enough in that tender light, to turn the head of even a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> year-old-lawyer. But those impulsive words were not spoken, for \"Norry, Norry!\" piped Aunt Hester's shrill treble. \"Where's that child gone? Doesn't she know she'll get her death out there in the evening air.\" Norine laughed. \"From romance to reality!

Perhaps she is right; but I wonder if she didn't stop to look at the moon sometimes, too, when she was seventeen?\" It...", "...for whose preservation we are indebted to his own mention of it in a private letter; an opinion so characteristic of his habits of thought, his reasoned motives of action, that, although it has before been quoted, it is fitting to repeat it in his own words and in full. When he reached England, the naval situation, as far as then known, was that Napoleon had twenty-one French ships-of-the-line in Brest, and twenty-eight or nine, French and Spanish, in Ferrol; while Cornwallis had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> British off Brest. This was the condition on the 15th of August, when Nelson parted from the fleet off Ushant. Very soon after his arrival in town, news was received that Villeneuve had gone to sea from Ferrol, and that Cornwallis, when informed of the fact, had divided his fleet, with great lack of judgment, keeping himself seventeen ships to confront the Brest squadron, while eighteen were sent to look for Villeneuve under the command of Admiral Calder. In the public...", "...There were no flour barrels, and no coopers, at Bloomfield, but a few miles north towards the lake there was a good custom grist mill. He went into the woods, cut an oak tree, set his men to saw it into blocks of the right length, from which the rough staves were split. The wheat which his customers brought in, was stored at the mill and ground. When the cooper stuff was seasoned, the barrels were made, rough enough, but strong, and his stock of flour and potash hauled through the mud <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles to the mouth of Ashtabula creek. A schooner was at anchor outside, and as soon as his venture was on board, he took passage with it to Buffalo, and by canal to New York. The New York dealers were surprised and gratified, for they perceived at once the capacity of a new country on the shores of Lake Erie, of which they had hitherto only known in theory, not in practical results. In quality the flour was not behind that of the Genesee country, which seemed a wonder in...", "...of the 11th of September, of which I have spoken to you a thousand times, is almost completely healed, although I am still a little lame, but that in a few days there will scarcely remain any traces of this accident.

I have just learnt that he has sailed, not, as I expected, in a packet, but in a good frigate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> guns: it would be unlucky indeed if he were taken. From his lips, and the epistle which I confided to him five or six days ago, you will learn all that your affection for me may make you wish to know. I wish you also knew the precise day of my return, and I am most impatient to fix that day myself, and to be able to say to you, in the joy of my heart,--upon such a day I set out to rejoin you, and obtain all earthly happiness.

She took no notice of my rude and clumsy remark, though she had good reason to be offended. \"Simi,\" she said, \"shall I give thee sleep?\" \"Ay,\" I replied, \"give me sleep till the master of this house returns.\" She rose and bent over me, and then I noticed for the first time that, instead of being about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or forty years of age, as I had judged her to be by her hard, clear features and somewhat \"bony\" appearance externally, she could not be more than five-and-twenty, or even younger. She placed her right hand on my forehead, and held my right hand in her own. \"Sleep,\" she said--\"sleep well and dreamlessly, man with the strong will to accomplish all that is before thee.

Love at eight and forty is a very pleasant and indolent emotion, marking the most delightful stage in the progress of the great human passion. At twenty-five we talk it; at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> we act it; at forty-five it is pleasant to sit down and think about it. The very young man loves without really analyzing. Ten years later he analyzes without really loving. In another decade he has compounded the proportions of love and analysis, and becomes, under favoring conditions, the most dangerous and hence the most acceptable of suitors. The man in middle life takes his adored one tolerantly, and keeps his reservations to himself. In the ordinary course of events...", "...of these plunderers of Christians were themselves born in the Faith. In the long list of Algerine viceroys, we meet with many a European. Barbarossa himself was born in Lesbos, probably of a Greek mother. His successor was a Sardinian; soon afterwards a Corsican became pasha of Algiers, then another Sardinian; Ochiali was a Calabrian; Ramad[=a]n came from Sardinia, and was succeeded by a Venetian, who in turn gave place to a Hungarian, who made room for an Albanian. In 1588 the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> galleys or galleots of Algiers were commanded by eleven Turks and twenty-four renegades, including nations of France, Venice, Genoa, Sicily, Naples, Spain, Greece, Calabria, Corsica, Albania, and Hungary, and a Jew. In short, up to nearly the close of the sixteenth century (but much more rarely afterwards) the chiefs of the Corsairs and the governors were commonly drawn from Christian lands. Some of them volunteered--and to the outlaws of Europe the command of a Barbary...", "...with the tides, landed him upon the almost pathless snows of Langeland. Crossing that dreary waste diagonally some dozen miles to another arm of the sea ten miles wide, which the ices of a winter of almost unprecedented severity had also bridged, pushing boldly on, with a recklessness which nothing but success redeems from stupendous infatuation, he crossed this fragile surface, which any storm might crumble beneath his feet, and landed upon the western coast of Laaland. A march of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles over a treeless, shelterless and almost uninhabited expanse, brought him to the eastern shore. Easily crossing a narrow strait about a mile in width, he plunged into the forests of the island of Falster. A dreary march of twenty-seven miles conducted him to the last remaining arm of the sea which separated him from Zealand. This strait, from twelve to fifteen miles in breadth, was also closed by ice.

Amidst the boastings which he sent home, and by which France was amused, Leclerc felt that his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand soldiers had made no progress whatever in the real conquest of Saint Domingo. He was aware that France had less power there than before she had alienated L'Ouverture. He felt that Toussaint was still the sovereign that he had been for ten years past.

Another Assembly began in 1877, with high expectations, at Lake Bluff overlooking Lake Michigan, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles north of Chicago. It was confidently supposed that on a direct railroad line from the great city, Lake Bluff would draw large audiences, and Dr. Vincent was engaged to organize and conduct an Assembly upon the Chautauqua plan, with lecturers and workers from that headquarters.

He wrote letters to the king, humbly praying that he might be allowed to return to the Government of Ireland as soon as order was restored, but in the long run he had to feign contentment with the minor post of Master of the Horse. {161} CHAPTER X Lord Hartington was the son of that Duke of Devonshire who had been viceroy for seven years, and was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> when his commission was signed by the king. Hartington appears to have been a typical Cavendish; everybody trusted and admired him without forming too great an opinion of his abilities; but he was a safe man, and this attribute brought him the premiership in November, 1756, when he was summoned from Dublin to take the control of the ministry. Pitt, it is interesting to note, served under him during his brief premiership--it ended the following May--as Secretary of War....", "...death in 518 Justin used for his own election to the throne money that he had received for the support of another candidate. Being ignorant even of the rudiments of letters, Justin entrusted the administration of state to his wise and faithful quaestor Proclus and to his nephew Justinian, though his own experience dictated several improvements in military affairs. An orthodox churchman himself, he effected in 519 a reconciliation of the Eastern and Western Churches, after a schism of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years (see HORMISDAS). In 522 he entered upon a desultory war with Persia, in which he co-operated with the Arabs. In 522 also Justin ceded to Theodoric, the Gothic king of Italy, the right of naming the consuls. On the 1st of April 527 Justin, enfeebled by an incurable wound, yielded to the request of the senate and assumed Justinian at his colleague; on the 1st of August he died.

Through the division of labor we are passing from the independence of nations to the interdependence of nations. International banking, transportation, and commerce, by establishing communities of interest in all parts of the world, are binding the peoples of the earth into one great industrial organization. As striking evidence of this development, more than one hundred and fifty international associations[4] and more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> international unions of states have been formed. The modern intricate system of communication is a veritable nervous system which, in the event of any local paralysis or upheaval, informs the entire industrial organism.

Ladies without gents, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cents. Bergstrom's two-piece orchestra. Chug usually went alone, but he escorted home one of the ladies-without-gents. It was not that he begrudged the fifty cents. Chug was free enough with his money. He went to these dances on a last-minute impulse, almost against his will, and out of sheer boredom. Once there he danced every dance and all the encores. The girls fought for him. Their manner of dancing was cheek to cheek, in wordless rhythm. His arm about the ample waist...", "...on deck. It was thus recorded to Cameron's credit; but the circumstance, on becoming known, was regarded with so much satisfaction that honourable mention was made of it in the official records.

With singular success he laid the remainder of the kelson open for recovery, and then, sinking deeper, drew from the mud, in two hauls, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet of the keel. He also weighed a small vessel of six tons burden, belonging to a Mr. Cussell, which drove, under a strong current, upon one of the lighters.

This was an alteration we could not very well account for, since all the charts laid down regular soundings everywhere to the northward of Pedro Blanco. We for this reason kept a careful look out, and altered our course to N.N.W., and having run thirty-five miles in that direction, our soundings again gradually diminished to twenty-two fathom, and we at last, about...", "...It was not the traders that needed protection as against the troopers, but the troopers that needed protection as against some of the traders.

The quartermaster whose tent I shared was charged four shillings for a single \"whisky and soda,\" and was informed that if he wanted a bottle of whisky the price would be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> shillings. On such terms tradesmen who, before the war, had laid in large and semi-secret stores now reaped a magnificent harvest. One provision merchant was reported to have thus sold L700 worth of goods before breakfast on a certain Saturday morning, in which case he would perhaps reckon that on that particular date his breakfast had been well earned. It probably meant in part a wholesale army order; but even in that case it would be for cash, and not a case of...", "...distance of perhaps twenty paces.

Behind the bush--a thick, spreading juniper--the bear crouched motionless for some seconds, his little red eyes aglow, and his jaws beginning to slaver with eagerness. Then selecting the unconscious ewe, because he knew she was not likely to desert the lamb, he rushed upon his intended victim. The ewe, as it chanced, was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or forty feet distant from the enemy, as he lunged out, black and appalling, from behind the juniper. At the same time the ram was not more than twenty or twenty-five feet distant, straight above the lamb, in a direction at right angles to the path of the bear. The ewe looked up with a startled bleat, wheeled, sprang nimbly before the lamb, and faced her doom dauntlessly, with lowered head.

Their arms is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet long.\" Bobby picked a squid from the heap in the bottom of the boat. It had instinctively turned from a reddish-brown to a livid green, the colour of sea-water; indeed, had it been in the water, its enemy would have had hard work to see it.

Of that life of fifty years Butler had spent <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> in prison. The judge expressed his regret that a man of Butler's knowledge, information, vanity, and utter recklessness of what evil will do, could not be put away somewhere for the rest of his life, and sentenced him to fifteen years' imprisonment with hard labour. \"An iniquitous and brutal sentence!\" exclaimed the prisoner.

The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet long and ten feet wide.

Kirby believed, that if the house-fly were made equal to the horse in size, and had its muscular power increased in the same proportion, it would be able to traverse the globe with the rapidity of lightning.

But the dexterity...", "...were hunting for merchant ships they often came across war-ships, and you can be sure they did not always run away. No, indeed; they were usually ready to fight, and during the war no less than sixteen war-vessels were captured by our ocean rovers. On the other hand, the British privateers did not capture a single American war-ship. As for merchant vessels, our privateers brought them in by the dozens. One fleet of sixty vessels set out from Ireland for the West Indies, and out of these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> were gobbled up by our privateers, and their rich stores brought into American ports. During the whole war the privateers took more than seven hundred prizes. I might go on to tell you of some of their hard fights, but I think you would rather read the story of Paul Jones, the boldest and bravest of them all, the terror of the seas to the British fleet. Paul Jones, you should know, was born in Scotland. But he made America his home. And as he was known to be a good...", "...a train which would have missed the connection by a week but for the thoughtfulness of some British officers who were along, and who knew the ways of trains that are run by natives without white supervision.

The train bands stepped ashore and gossiped with friends a quarter of an hour, then pulled out and repeated this at the succeeding villages. We had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles to go and six hours to do it in, but it was plain that we were not going to make it. It was then that the English officers said it was now necessary to turn this gravel train into an express. So they gave the engine-driver a rupee and told him to fly. It was a simple remedy.

Only noting as we pass, how, thus early, we may see that the progress of exact science was not only towards an increasing number of previsions, but towards previsions more accurately quantitative--how, in astronomy, the recurring period of the moon's motions was by and by more correctly ascertained to be nineteen years, or two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> lunations; how Callipus further corrected this Metonic cycle, by leaving out a day at the end of every seventy-six years; and how these successive advances implied a longer continued registry of observations, and the co-ordination of a greater number of facts--let us go on to inquire how geometrical astronomy took its rise. The first astronomical instrument was the gnomon. This was not only early in use in the East, but it was found also among the Mexicans; the sole...", "...house we had just left, \"well, they are two of a family of six--two younger than those.

The outline of the story was that the twins were closely alike and singularly attached, and had identical tastes; they both obtained Government clerkships, and kept house together, when one sickened and died of Bright's disease, and the other also sickened of the same disease and died seven months later. Both twins were apt to sicken at the same time in no less than nine out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cases. Either their illnesses, to which I refer, were non-contagious, or, if contagious, the twins caught them simultaneously; they did not catch them the one from the other. This implies so intimate a constitutional resemblance, that it is proper to give some quotations in evidence. Thus, the father of two twins says:-- \"Their general health is closely alike; whenever one of them has an illness, the other invariably has the same within a day or two, and they usually...", "...that at a distance appeared to be either a fort or house: some black marks on its face took our attention and resembled characters of a very large size, as if they had been painted for the purpose of attracting the attention of vessels passing by; but a closer examination with the telescope prove them to be only the shadows of the projecting parts of the surface.

Something in the atmosphere created by spice and sugar must have developed the money-making germ. With the plutocrats of Belgium it was different.

Gadarenes is the best attested reading in Mt. viii. 28, Gerasenes in Mk. v. 1 and Lk. viii. 26; Gergesenes has only secondary attestation. Gadara is identified with Um Keis on the Yarmuk, some six miles SE of the Sea of Galilee. This cannot have been the site of the miracle, though it is possible that Gadara may have controlled the country round about, including the shores of the sea. Gerasa is the name of a city in the highlands of Gilead, twenty miles E of Jordan, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> SE of the Sea of Galilee, and it clearly cannot have been the scene of the miracle. Near the E shore of the sea Thomson discovered the ruins of a village which now bears the name Khersa. The formation of the land in the neighborhood closely suits the narrative of the gospels.

The intervals between these posts were sometimes closed by thatch neatly tied to sticks, which were planted upright in the ground and fastened to the eaves; but more commonly, it would seem, the...", "...description.

Indeed it happens now oftener than it used to, because people remain much longer in the sexual arena. The cultivated Jewess no longer cuts off her hair at her marriage. The British matron has discarded her cap and her conscientious ugliness; and a bishop's wife at fifty has more of the air of a _femme galante_ than an actress had at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> in her grandmother's time. But as people marry later, the facts of age and time still inexorably condemn most parents to comparative solitude when their children marry. This may be a privation and may be a relief: probably in healthy circumstances it is no worse than a salutary change of habit; but even at that it is, for the moment at least, a wrench. For though parents and children sometimes dislike one another, there is an experience of succor and a habit of dependence...", "...in England, and his chapter, of the one part, and the Lord Henry de Coleville Knight, of the other part.

The Summer Beauty, a hardy white tulip, is well worth the ten cents asked for each one. Some of you may like to raise some freaks; then try parrot tulips at about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cents a dozen.

The great wing shall shelter a deathless poet; the little wing shall serve as a young girl's bower.\" The plan seemed to me nobly harmonious; but as time went on it fell into confusion. When the master grew reasonable, the castle turned utterly crazy; the great wing became too little, the little wing fell to ruin. Thus we see that, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years before the date of _The Master Builder_, Ibsen's imagination was preoccupied with a symbol of a master building a castle in the air, and a young girl in one of its towers.

In 1777 and 1781 the Gilbert Acts were passed,[346] which, as amended by Acts of 1826 and 1838,[347] enabled an incumbent, with the consent of the bishop and patron, or, during a vacancy in the living, the bishop, to borrow money for the purpose of providing a parsonage house, or rebuilding it in case of its having become ruinous, upon the security of a mortgage of the income of the benefice for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. The loan was not to exceed the amount of the gross net income of the benefice, and was to be repayable with interest by thirty yearly instalments. The Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty were empowered to lend money for the purposes of the Acts; and, in practice, the loans are generally obtained from them.

The plan for the enterprise failed, but success came in an unexpected manner; for it pleased God that, when the Spanish ships discovered the Chinese, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> Chinese vessels were setting out to look for supplies for the corsair. As they were sailing along quite free from care, they caught sight of the Spaniards, and turned about and fled. It happened that, as the Spaniards pursued them, firing their arquebuses, the Chinese ships almost ran aground; whereupon all the men jumped overboard and fled to the fort, abandoning their ships.

There was a double object in making the walls of the city so extensive. First, to provide for future growth; and, second, to enable the people to withstand a longer siege. How well the second purpose was served is shown by the fact that during the Taiping rebellion the city of Nanking was besieged for thirteen years.

The facts were that the imperial train was being driven at the rate of ninety versts an hour over a road calculated to withstand at the utmost a speed of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> versts; that the engineer humbly warned the Tzar of the danger, and was gruffly ordered to go still faster if possible, and that the miracle would have been the avoidance of calamity.\"] [Footnote 2: On the Zemstvos compare p. 173, n. 1.

When it was passed over to him, he glanced at the amount-seven thousand dollars. \"I--I can't afford to pay more than six per cent,\" he said huskily. Martin wanted to laugh, but, instead, demanded:- \"How much would that be?\" \"Lemme see. Six per cent--six times seven--four hundred an' twenty.\" \"That would be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> dollars a month, wouldn't it?\" Higginbotham nodded. \"Then, if you've no objection, well arrange it this way.\" Martin glanced at Gertrude. \"You can have the principal to keep for yourself, if you'll use the thirty-five dollars a month for cooking and washing and scrubbing.

Attracted by the report, large crowds flocked towards the place of execution, which, in order to give greater solemnity to the spectacle, had been fixed at the southern gate of the old...", "...the prize is a hundred _scudi_. When an _ambo_ is played for, the same two numbers may be played as single numbers, either _al posto_ or _senza posto_, and in such case one of the numbers alone may win. So, also, a _terno_ may be played so as to include an _ambo_, and a _quaterno_ so as to include a _terno_ and _ambo_, and a _cinquino_ so as to include all. But whenever more than one chance is played for, the price is proportionally increased. For a simple _terno_ the limit of price is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> pauls. The ordinary rule is to play for every chance within the numbers taken; but the common people rarely attempt more than a _terno_. If four numbers are played with all their chances, they are reckoned as four _terni_, and paid for accordingly. If five numbers are taken, the price is for five _terni_. Where two numbers are played, there is always an augment to the nominal prize of twenty per cent.; where three numbers are played, the augment is of eighty per cent.;...", "...of mankind from one of its poles to the other.

Substantial agreement is to be noted between the two enumerations, except for the larger percentage of those under 15 years of age in 1905 (19.6 per cent male, 18.4 per cent female), and the smaller percentages in the grouping <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty-four years (18.4 per cent male, 16.4 per cent female). Doubtless this effect is produced because so many of the cases in 1909 were individuals attending evening school, who were required to be above 14 years of age, and because few over forty-five years of age are attracted to such a place. The other small difference in percentages is due probably to the small number of individuals, 365, in the figures for 1909.

Tiberius retaliated by forbidding the magistrates to exercise any of their functions, and by suspending, in fact, the entire administration of the government.

Seventeen out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> tribes had already voted for the deposition of Octavius, and the addition of one tribe would reduce him to a private condition, when Tiberius stopped the voting, anxious, at the last moment, to prevent the necessity of so desperate a measure.

The flowers on many other species were crossed and self-fertilised, but as only a few were thus treated, the results cannot be trusted, as far as fertility is concerned, and are not here given. Some other cases have been rejected, as the plants were in an unhealthy condition. If we look to the figures in the two tables expressing the ratios between the mean relative fertility of the crossed and self-fertilised flowers, we see that in a majority of cases (i.e., in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> out of fifty) flowers fertilised by pollen from a distinct plant yield more, sometimes many more, seeds than flowers fertilised with their own pollen; and they commonly set a larger proportion of capsules. The degree of infertility of the self-fertilised flowers differs extremely in the different species, and even, as we shall see in the section on self-sterile plants, in the individuals of the same species, as well as under slightly changed conditions of life. Their...", "...Judgment--presumably the one outside the church at Riva Valdobbia. Bordiga adds that Melchiorre was still living in 1620, when Tanzio was at work on these frescoes. CHAPEL No. 28. CHRIST BEFORE HEROD. Bordiga says that this chapel was begun in 1606, as shown by a letter from Monsignor Bescape, Bishop of Novara, authorising the Fabbricieri to appropriate three hundred scudi from the Mass chest for the purpose of erecting it, but it was not finished until 1638. The statues, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> in number, are by Giovanni D'Enrico, and the frescoes by Tanzio, but we have no means of dating either the one or the other accurately. The figure of Herod is incomparably finer than any others in the chapel, if we except those of two laughing boys on Herod's left that are hardly seen till one is inside the chapel itself. Take each of the figures separately and few are good. As usual in D'Enrico's chapels, there is a deficiency of the ensemble and concert which no one...", "...demanded Valeria. \"There are no streets in Xuchotl,\" he answered. \"No squares nor open courts.

Unfortunately for the operative the night was dark and the fugitive was decidedly more familiar with the surrounding country than Larry was. By the time he had secured the assistance of the police half an hour had elapsed, and there weren't even any telltale footprints to show in which direction the missing man had gone. \"See that men are placed so as to guard the railroad station,\" Simmons directed, \"and pass the word up and down the line that a medium-sized man, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age, with black hair and a rather ruddy complexion--a man wanted by the government on a charge of false pretenses--is trying to make his escape. If anyone reports him, let me know at once.\" That, under the circumstances, was really all that Larry could do. It ought to be an easy matter to locate the fugitive, he figured, and it would only be a question of a few days before he was safely in jail.

South of the Army of the Tennessee, and confronting it, was Van Dorn, with a sufficient force to organize a movable army of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty thousand men, after being reinforced by Price from Missouri. This movable force could be thrown against either Corinth, Bolivar or Memphis; and the best that could be done in such event would be to weaken the points not threatened in order to reinforce the one that was. Nothing could be gained on the National side by attacking elsewhere, because the territory already occupied was as much as the force present could guard.

Where the sunlight touched them the British trenches flashed into rows of gleaming bayonets. For the allotted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes the rain of fire went on. It paused as it had begun, on the instant. The momentary silence was as stunning as the uproar. It was the signal. The whistles blew for the charge.

The Baroness now came in--a...", "...once a bridge of land from Asia to America in this region? There is no evidence of such a link between the two continents, for a few raised beaches indicate that during recent geological times the Aleutian Islands have been uplifted rather than depressed. The passage from Asia to America at Bering Strait, on the other hand, is comparatively easy. The Strait itself is fifty-six miles wide, but in the middle there are two small islands so that the longest stretch of water is only about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles. Moreover the Strait is usually full of ice, which frequently becomes a solid mass from shore to shore. Therefore it would be no strange thing if some primitive savages, in hunting for seals or polar bears, crossed the Strait, even though they had no boats. Today the people on both sides of the Strait belong to the American race. They still retain traditions of a time when their ancestors crossed this narrow strip of water. The Thilanottines have a legend that two...", "...Allison was the trusted adviser of President after President --Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, McKinley, Roosevelt all called upon him. There was no Senator who had to a greater extent their confidence. Had he lived he would have been as close, if not closer to President Taft.

He served eight years in the House and more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years in the Senate, a total of forty-three years and five months in Congress. For forty-three years the history of his life embodies the complete financial legislative history of the United States. Another conspicuous member of the Thirty-ninth Congress was Nathaniel P.

He was many times elected to Congress from Massachusetts, and in 1856, after a long contest which...", "...gayety; they go to operas, theaters and balls, for they are young.

Federation at no time actually dropped out of sight, but it was not until <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years later that any practical steps were taken towards its accomplishment. Meanwhile a sort of makeshift was devised, and the Imperial parliament passed a measure permitting the formation of a federal council, to which any colony that felt inclined to join could send delegates.

M. de Villeneuve was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age, but good-looking and animated, and Madame de Meglior was in some slight degree uneasy at first at the evident friendship he evinced for Euphrasie, for she did not approve of disproportionate marriages, and she thought Adelaide's example a bad one.

The stone seats (of which there are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> rows in three divisions) were only gradually constructed as the means of the community allowed. Access to the highest seats was given by external staircases, and there was no system of underground chambers for wild beasts, combatants, &c.

That's particularly agonizing when you have to go at a walking pace along a muddy road full of holes, and when you are thirsty.

As a rule one does not sleep for one day and night, and then the...", "...1863, stated that from May to October there were from ten thousand to fourteen thousand cavalry in the Army of the Potomac, while the number of horses furnished them for the same period was thirty-five thousand; adding to these the horses taken by capture and used for mounting men, the number would be sufficient to give each man a horse every _two months_. There were two hundred and twenty-three regiments of cavalry in the service, which, at the same rate, would require four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand horses. This is an immense expenditure of animals, and is attributable in part to the peculiarities of the volunteer service--such as the lack of care and knowledge on the part of the officers, and the disposition of the men to break down their horses by improper riding, and sometimes out of mere wantonness, for the purpose of getting rid of animals they do not like, for the chance of obtaining better. A measure has recently been adopted to remedy these evils, by...", "...and bread. Soon the neighbours knew that we had meat every day and some of them told the investigator. By this time she had made it a habit to spy on my every move. She reported me to the office. Again I was called and questioned and again I lied and cried.

But when I got home I was wiser, and since then, instead of buying bread and meat, I have to put the money in the bank.

The commander Kirke appears to have acted somewhat strangely on this occasion, for instead of having Michel quietly buried, he ordered a splendid funeral, accompanied with military honours. When the remains were lowered into the grave, a salute of eighty guns was fired, as if the deceased had been an officer of high rank. Whatever may have been the reasons for showing these tokens of honour to the remains of...", "...hour after we had encamped, Elders Lyman E.

Then the door opened and a tall, stoutly-built old lady with white hair swept into the room and stood regarding them. Mr. Davis, unprepared for the changes wrought by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, stared at her aghast. The black silk dress, the gold watch-chain, and huge cameo brooch did not help to reassure him. \"Good-good afternoon, ma'am,\" said Mr. Wotton, in a thin voice. The old lady returned the greeting, and, crossing to a chair and seating herself in a very upright fashion, regarded him calmly. \"We--we called to see you about a dear old pal--friend, I mean,\" continued Mr. Wotton; \"one o' the best. The best.\" \"Yes?\" said the old lady....", "...S. Best, Harry McDonald, John Hislop, William H. Edwards, Elmer Kane, L. H. Jewell, J. H. Jacobs, A. J. Gregory, and J. A. McCormick.

He looked at the tzatzkes, as they were swaying thoughtfully hither and thither, and it somehow seemed to him that it was not the birds but the clover blossoms which did the chirping.

Bruce's drawings of Gondar and its vicinity, which we showed to the Baharnagash, _tended to raise us in his opinion almost beyond the level of mortality_.\" If, then, Bruce's historical account of Abyssinia, as is admitted, be correct, ought he to have been accused of \"falsehood,\" \"exaggeration,\" and \"want of veracity\" by men of rank and education, because, after a lapse of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, certain antiquities which he described had disappeared, and the dresses of the ladies were found to be different from his account of them?

The poem consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> stanzas, not one of which repeats both the metrical pattern and rhyme scheme of any other. The stanzas range from six to eighteen lines in length, and the lines themselves from four short syllables to the long Alexandrine.

As it usually happens, the desire for these distinctions increases with their possession.

He was evidently somewhere between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and forty years of age. \"Oh, it's you, is it?\" he said. \"Why are you back? Any news?\" The captain saluted, military fashion, and replied: \"We took two prisoners, sir. They were encamped in a tent in the woods. One of them says he is an American citizen, and says he knows you, so I brought them in.\" \"I wish you had brought in the tent, too,\" said the general with a wan smile. \"It would be an improvement on sleeping in the open air. Are these the prisoners? I don't...", "...began to live as before. ILYAS In the Government of Ufa there lived a Bashkir, Ilyas. His father had left him no wealth. His father had died a year after he had got his son married. At that time Ilyas had seven mares, two cows, and a score of sheep; but Ilyas was a good master and began to increase his possessions; he worked with his wife from morning until night, got up earlier than anybody, and went to bed later, and grew richer from year to year. Thus Ilyas passed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years at work, and came to have a vast fortune. Ilyas finally had two hundred head of horses, 150 head of cattle, and twelve hundred sheep. Men herded Ilyas's herds and flocks, and women milked the mares and cows, and made kumys, butter, and cheese. Ilyas had plenty of everything, and in the district everybody envied him his life. People said: \"Ilyas is a lucky fellow. He has plenty of everything,--he does not need to die.\" Good people made Ilyas's friendship and...", "...Durand, or \"Henri Greville,\" who has lately achieved so universal a reputation.

Madame Greville is a comfortable-looking lady of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> with the air of forty, and is a most agreeable talker. In her varied experience she has seen a good deal of the up and downs of life, but has now settled down, as she told me, \"to making her three novels a year.\" I hardly think she will ever again reach the level of the _Expiation de Saveli_.

The ruins of an imperial palatinate are still to be seen there, but in Fliedner's time it had become a little village of workmen dependent on a few manufacturers. On January 18, 1822, alone, and on foot, to save his poor society the expense of his journey, Fliedner entered the town where his life was henceforth to be centered. He was to share the parsonage with the widow of a previous pastor, and his sister was to be his housekeeper. His income was one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> dollars a year. Only a month after his arrival the great firm of velvet manufacturers who provided the work-people with employment failed, and the little church community seemed about to be dispersed. The government offered him another and better appointment, but he felt that he must be a true shepherd, and not a hireling, and would not leave his people. He decided to make a journey to collect money to form a permanent endowment for his church. A journey over sixty years...", "...than Themistocles in managing the affairs of Greece in the isthmian congress. This able and eminent Arcadian forcibly represented to the ephors the danger of forfeiting the Athenian alliance, and the insufficient resistance against the Persian that the fortifications of the isthmus would afford. The ephors heard, and immediately acted with the secrecy and the vigilance that belongs to oligarchies. That very night they privately despatched a body of five thousand Spartans and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand helots (seven to each Spartan), under the command of Pausanias. The next morning the ephors calmly replied to the angry threats of the Athenians, by protesting that their troops were already on the march, and by this time in Oresteum, a town in Arcadia, about eighteen miles distant from Sparta. The astonished deputies [99] hastened to overtake the Spartan force, and the ephors, as if fully to atone for their past procrastination, gave them the escort and...", "...ever attained before. Markham has since beaten him. Parry reached 82 deg. 45', and in reaching it the party had, in the necessarily circuitous course taken, and counting the constant retracing of their steps, travelled a distance nearly sufficient to have reached the North Pole itself in a direct line. It became evident that the nature and drift of the ice were such as to preclude the possibility of a final success greater than that recorded. They had now been absent from the ship <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> days, and one-half their supplies were exhausted. Parry therefore determined to give the party a day's rest, and then set out on the return. He says:--\"Dreary and cheerless as were the scenes we were about to leave, we never turned homewards with so little satisfaction as on this occasion.\" Still, the southern current was now an advantage, and they knew that every mile would tell. The return was made successfully and without any very serious casualties. Lieutenant Ross shot...", "...his servant, planted firmly on the threshold, jerked her head over her shoulder to call to him. \"There's a yoong laady wants to see yo, Mr. Greatorex!\" There was no response but a sharp tapping on the hob, as Greatorex knocked the ashes out of his pipe. Maggie stood looking at Alice a little mournfully with her deep-set, blue, pathetic eyes. Maggie had once been pretty in spite of her drab hair and flat features, but where her high color remained it had hardened with her <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. \"Well yo' coom?\" Maggie called again and waited. Courageous in her bright blue Sunday gown, she waited while her master rose, then, shame-faced as if driven by some sharp sign from him, she slunk into the scullery.

Instead of the black broadcloth that Alice had...", "...is certain also that English speech has become much less precise--much less uniform among the educated and \"gentlemanly\" classes--and English ears are consequently less exacting. With the gradual elimination of class distinctions in England, or rather with the blurring of the lines which separate one class from another, a multitude of persons pass for \"gentlemen\" in England to-day who could not have dreamed--and whose fathers certainly did not dream--of being counted among the gentry <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago. The fact may be for good or ill; but one consequence has been that the newcomers, thrusting up into the circles above them, have taken with them the speech of their former associates, so that one hears now, in nominally polite circles, tones of voice, forms of speech, and the expression of points of view which would have been impossible in the youth of people who are now no more than middle-aged.

When it came to a question of Baree, Hatchett put down his foot with emphasis. \"What! Make a dam' passenger of a dog? Never. Let him follow ashore--or die.\" This would undoubtedly have been Baree's choice if he had had a voice in the matter. Day after day he followed the canoe, swimming streams and working his way through swamp and forest. It was no easy matter. In the deep, slow waters of the Lower Peace the canoe made <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles a day; twice it made forty. But Hatchett kept Baree well fed, and each night the dog slept at David's feet in camp. On the sixth day they reached Fort Vermilion, and Hatchett announced himself like a king. For he was on inspection. Company inspection, mind you. Important! A week later they arrived at Peace River landing, two hundred miles farther west, and on the twentieth day came to Fort St. John, fifty miles from Hudson's Hope. From here David saw his first of the...", "...of the year. There never will be any icebound ships on the coast of British Columbia, for the warm breath of the tropics is felt there throughout the year. While the map is unfolded, look at Puget Sound, and think of its connection with Japan and China. Latitude and longitude are to be taken into account when we make long journeys. Liverpool is between the 53d and 54th parallels, or about two hundred and sixty miles farther north than Puget Sound, where a degree of longitude is only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles in length. Puget Sound is on the 49th parallel, where the degrees are thirty-eight and a half miles in length. San Francisco is near the 37th parallel, where the degrees are nearly forty-nine miles in length. Liverpool is three degrees west of Greenwich, from which longitude is reckoned. The 122d meridian passes through Puget Sound and also through the Bay of San Francisco.

How much of his life was spent at Rome is uncertain.

These railway connections would of themselves make Nashville an important post, but it had also the advantage of water communication with the Ohio. It lies at the southern bend of the Cumberland River, the course of which is nearly due north from the city to its mouth, and the stream is navigable for steamboats the greater part of the year.

[What a singularly intelligent army we had in those days, according to Mr. Floyd --though not according to the Congress of 1832.] So Mr. Floyd decided that the Government was not responsible for that $3,200 worth of rubbish which the Indians destroyed, but was responsible for the property destroyed by the troops--which property consisted of (I quote from the printed United States Senate...", "...age which follows youth after a longer or shorter interval.

The British troops in America were still conducting like savages. Congress requested Franklin to prepare a school-book, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> prints, each depicting one or more of the acts of English brutality. The object was to impress the minds of children with a deep sense of the insatiable and bloody malice with which the English had pursued the Americans. The plan was never executed.

In consequence of those curious notes being mislaid for upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, the sole record of the productions of those \"ingenious and amiable twins\" was very nearly lost to the world. The _three sheets of letter-paper_ on which he had written an account of certain old volumes of wood engravings,--that containing the cuts executed by the Cunio being one of the number,--he had lost for upwards of thirty-five years.

Gradually the sea became more open, and by noon on February 12 the water had deepened to two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> fathoms. Good progress was made to the south; the vessel dodging icebergs and detached floes. The discovery of a comparatively open sea southward of the main pack was a matter of some moment.

Each of the candidates, however, had an army under his control at the very gates of Rome, and the two illegal elections were secured from the people by fear.

It mattered not that the Governor denied it; that McComb contradicted it; that no proof supported it; or that the Assembly acquitted him by a party vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to twenty; the story did effective campaign service, and lived to torture Aaron Burr, one of the commissioners, ten years afterward. Burr tried to escape responsibility by pleading absence when the contracts were made; but the question never ceased coming up--if absence included all the months of McComb's negotiations, what time did the Attorney-General give to public business?

No one will doubt that this act of his Lordship was occasioned solely by the resolutions and the petition passed at the Bath meeting.

Against these odds was fought and won the battle of Plassey, on the 23d of June, 1757,--the date from which, by common consent, the British empire in India is said to begin.

He was an erratic and fantastic child during eighteen years, then he stepped into manhood, as one steps over a door-sill.

The final outcome was that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> girls did the work formerly done by one hundred and twenty; the accuracy of the work was increased by sixty-six per cent; the wages of the girls were doubled; the working day was shortened from ten and one-half hours to eight and one-half hours; and the profit of the factory was substantially increased.

At one dispensary three out of four applicants had dysentery. All those admitted to hospital were over twenty years of age; of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cases under Dr O'Brien, nine died, all of which had ulceration of the great intestine, in one case gangrenous. The mortality was not nearly so great among the richer classes, in which respect dysentery reversed the rule of typhus fever.

You are handsome, Annushka, and very rich; but as soon as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or forty strikes for you your time is up. Don't listen to any one, my girl; live, have your fling till you are forty, and then you will have time to pray forgiveness--there will be plenty of time to bow down and to sew your shroud. A candle to God and a poker to the devil! You can do both at once! Well, how is it to be? Will you make some little man happy?\" \"I will,\" laughed Anna Akimovna. \"I don't care now; I would marry a working man.\" \"Well, that would do all right!...", "...never published my picture.\" \"But they will,\" said Lola. \"You'll see. You do better than most that get theirs in now.\" Carrie felt deeply grateful for this. She almost loved Lola for the sympathy and praise she extended. It was so helpful to her--so almost necessary. Fulfilling her part capably brought another notice in the papers that she was doing her work acceptably. This pleased her immensely. She began to think the world was taking note of her. The first week she got her <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> dollars, it seemed an enormous sum. Paying only three dollars for room rent seemed ridiculous. After giving Lola her twenty-five, she still had seven dollars left. With four left over from previous earnings, she had eleven. Five of this went to pay the regular installment on the clothes she had to buy. The next week she was even in greater feather. Now, only three dollars need be paid for room rent and five on her clothes. The rest she had for food and her own whims....", "...to send them, as they will never be heard from.\" He advised us to dispose of them for 25 cents per dozen; this was the highest price pigeons were worth in Adrian. To please him we tried to sell them for that price, but could not, so, taking them to the express office, we shipped them. In about four days the returns came, netting us 70 cents per dozen, about the lowest price we ever got. They explained that the pigeons had been poorly handled or they would have brought more. This was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, _and these were probably the first pigeons shipped from this State to New York_. We have shipped thousands since. They would probably average $2 per dozen. We have sold them as high as $3.75 per dozen and have seen them quoted as high as $6 per dozen.

About eighteen per cent of the population belong to this class of semi-metayers, while twenty-two per cent are laborers paid by the month or year, and are either \"furnished\" by their own savings or perhaps more usually by some merchant who takes his chances of payment. Such laborers receive from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to fifty cents a day during the working season. They are usually young unmarried persons, some being women; and when they marry they sink to the class of metayers, or, more seldom, become renters. The renters for fixed money rentals are the first of the emerging classes, and form five per cent of the families. The sole advantage of this small class is their freedom to choose their crops, and the increased responsibility which comes through having money transactions....", "...He promises to make me very happy, and I love to believe he will.\" The writer of this charming letter was married to the artist about three months after it was written. The marriage was arranged entirely by the friends of the young couple. They had not set eyes on each other before Ingres went to the city gates to meet his affianced bride. They met near the Tomb of Nero. It was there that Ingres first took the hand of the partner who was to caress and console him during the next <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. This charming and laughing \"fille a Madame Angot\" turned out to be the admirable companion which every artist dreams of but so rarely possesses: one who will share all his hopes, but never his doubts; who believes and admires, smiles and is patient, and accepts all sacrifices for the glory of the one she loves. Almost immediately after his marriage Ingres' luck changed. Murat was overthrown in 1814.

As they \"sailed, or rather rowed\" downstream, with the ebb, the Spanish prisoners prayed to be taken aboard, lest the Indians should take them and torture them all to death. \"We had much ado to find a sufficient number of boats for ourselves,\" says Ringrose, for the Indians had carried many of the canoas away.

We'll miss the Green Streak edition if we don't get back to the office _pronto_.\" She thrust her wrist watch beneath Salt's nose. He looked at the moving hands and muttered: \"Jeepers!

Meeting, however, a slight swell of ground, which blocks what would seem to have been its natural course, the river \"suddenly turns west,\" and breaking through a low ridge by a narrow ravine, pursues its way by a course a little north of west to the Mediterranean, which it enters about midway between Sidon and Sarepta.[159] The length of the stream, including main windings, is probably not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles. We have spoken of the numerous promontories, terminations of spurs from the mountains, which break the low coast-line into fragments, and go down precipitously into the sea. Of these there are two between Tyre and Acre, one known as the Ras-el-Abiad or \"White Headland,\" and the other as the Ras-en-Nakura. The former is a cliff of snow-white chalk interspersed with black flints, and rises perpendicularly from the sea to the height of three hundred feet.[160] The...", "...the young women between twenty and thirty. Such postponement is due to the difficulty of earning sufficient to rear and support a family; and it undoubtedly leads, in the country districts, to sexual immorality. The form of this immorality, however, is very seldom that of prostitution, and less frequently that of illegitimacy than one would imagine. Rather, it takes the form of separation and desertion after a family group has been formed. The number of separated persons is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to the thousand,--a very large number. It would of course be unfair to compare this number with divorce statistics, for many of these separated women are in reality widowed, were the truth known, and in other cases the separation is not permanent. Nevertheless, here lies the seat of greatest moral danger. There is little or no prostitution among these Negroes, and over three-fourths of the families, as found by house-to-house investigation, deserve to be classed as...", "...were at Dantzig, the headquarters of the regiment he commands, the famous \"Death's Head Hussars.\" Some say that it is a tradition in the Hohenzollern family for the Crown Prince to appear to oppose the King. Then, when the King dies, the Crown Prince enjoys a certain popularity in the first years of his rule from those who have been against the Government, and by the time this popularity has waned the new ruler is firmly seated on the throne. The Crown Prince, born in 1882, will be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> in May next. His military education began long before he was ten years old. In accordance with Hohenzollern custom, on his tenth birthday, he became an officer of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and on this birthday was introduced to the other officers and took part in a regimental dinner. Before this great event he had learned enough of military drill and usages to carry himself as an officer. In 1895, he and his brother Eitel entered as cadets at Ploen in Schwerin,...", "...planks in the national platforms of all the political parties are described in Chapter XXIII.

It was only necessary for thirteen Legislatures to hold out against ratification to prevent the adoption of the amendment and those of the nine southeastern States from Maryland to Louisiana were certain to do this. All of them defeated it except that of Florida, which did not vote on it. By March 22, 1920, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> Legislatures had ratified, leaving but four States from which to obtain the thirty-sixth and final ratification. Delaware defeated it in June, leaving only Tennessee, Connecticut and Vermont. A provision in the State constitution of Tennessee prevented action by its Legislature.

The President was authorized to employ state officials to enroll the men made subject to duty, provided the governor of the state gave his consent; otherwise he was to employ Confederate officials. The conscripts thus secured were to be assigned to the state commands already in the field until these organizations were recruited to their full strength.

That the number of them is large may be inferred from the fact that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> may be found in the British Museum alone (Catalogue, i. pp. 146-203). Syriac Lectionaries are of two classes, (i) those according to the Greek Use, and (ii) those according to the native Syriac Use. The former, or _Malkite_ Lectionaries, may be dismissed from the present enquiry. They are only Greek works in a Syriac dress, and their value is historical rather than critical(452). The true Syriac Lectionaries, whether Jacobite or Nestorian, follow as to their main...", "...firs and sugar pines, and camped in the now-famous Mariposa grove. Later, after making my home in the Yosemite Valley, I became well acquainted with Mr. Clark, while he was guardian. He was elected again and again to this important office by different Boards of Commissioners on account of his efficiency and his real love of the Valley. Although nearly all my mountaineering has been done without companions, I had the pleasure of having Galen Clark with me on three excursions. About <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago I invited him to accompany me on a trip through the Big Tuolumne Canyon from Hetch Hetchy Valley. The canyon up to that time had not been explored, and knowing that the difference in the elevation of the river at the head of the canyon and in Hetch Hetchy was about 5000 feet, we expected to find some magnificent cataracts or falls; nor were we disappointed. When we were leaving Yosemite an ambitious young man begged leave to join us. I strongly advised him not to...", "...of starlings (_Sturnus vulgaris_) was shot in the morning; by noon a new mate was found; this was again shot, but before night the pair was complete; so that the disconsolate widow or widower was thrice consoled during the same day. Mr. Engleheart also informs me that he used during several years to shoot one of a pair of starlings which built in a hole in a house at Blackheath; but the loss was always immediately repaired. During one season he kept an account and found that he had shot <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> birds from the same nest; these consisted of both males and females, but in what proportion he could not say: nevertheless after all this destruction, a brood was reared.[153] These facts are certainly remarkable. How is it that so many birds are ready immediately to replace a lost mate? Magpies, jays, carrion-crows, partridges, and some other birds, are never seen during the spring by themselves, and these offer at first sight the most perplexing case. But birds of the...", "...in the interior of the country. Mr. Wallace chose the Rio Negro for his next trip, and I agreed to take the Solimoens. My colleague has already given to the world an account of his journey on the Rio Negro, and his adventurous ascent of its great tributary the Uapes. I left Barra for Ega, the first town of any importance on the Solimoens, on the 26th of March, 1850. The distance is nearly 400 miles, which we accomplished in a small cuberta, manned by ten stout Cucama Indians, in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> days. On this occasion, I spent twelve months in the upper region of the Amazons; circumstances then compelled me to return to Para. I revisited the same country in 1855, and devoted three years and a half to a fuller exploration of its natural productions. The results of both journeys will be given together in subsequent chapters of this work; in the meantime, I will proceed to give an account of Santarem and the river Tapajos, whose neighbourhoods I investigated in the...", "...current becomes more rapid, and requires two trips to the Decharge des Sables,[3] where the goods are carried one hundred and thirty-five paces, and the canoe towed.

The reader can now readily appreciate that with a crafty organization like this the \"pusher\" could not testify, even if he desired, that he had got the bad money from either Lupo or Morello. In fact, the \"pusher\" never even heard of either of the leaders except in some indirect way. Always, however, when the money was passed over to the pusher by one of Cecala's deputies or remote...", "...plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favorable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavorable ones to be destroyed.

In June, 1842, I first allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in pencil in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into one of two hundred thirty pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess. But at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is astonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg, how I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the tendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become modified. That they have...", "...once active hostilities ceased, or were even suspended; but the consequence of my capture would certainly mean for me the loss of any advantage I might otherwise have gained from our success. Now my name would figure in no despatches, unless as \"missing,\" a bitter disappointment, when I had so slowly and painfully gained something of a position. But I had no time to reason it out before we had crossed the threshold of the General's room. He was a clear-featured, bright-eyed man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or forty, visibly harassed with the hard fortune of the day, but he did not allow his preoccupation to affect his bearing towards us. \"Reverend sir,\" he said, addressing the priest, \"I take it for granted you are a non-combatant, but as it has fallen to your lot to be brought within our lines, you must perforce remain a prisoner. If you will satisfy me as to your name and position, I shall judge if I can grant you the less galling restrictions of parole.\"...", "...am so glad you have come. I shall make you my confidential friend.\" Then the conversation drifted into other channels. CHAPTER XVI. ANDY AT WORK. Punctually as the clock struck eight the next morning Andy entered the store of Mr. Flint on Union Square. He looked for his employer, but the jeweler seldom arrived before nine, his residence being in Harlem. Behind the counter, arranging the goods in one of the cases, was a man with reddish hair who might at a guess be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age. It was Mr. Flint's head clerk, Simon Rich, who had been absent when Andy made his first call. \"What can I do for you, boy?\" he asked, superciliously. \"Is Mr. Flint in?\" \"No. You can tell me your business.\" \"I have come here to work.\" \"Oh!\" This exclamation was long-drawn out. Mr. Rich then proceeded to examine Andy from head to foot in a manner which was extremely offensive. Andy understood that for some reason this man would be his enemy. He...", "...with the court to-morrow. My opinion is that the Hulls did this. All through his testimony the fellow sweated fear.

It totalled 473, including mahouts and elephant-tenders, grooms, armourers, taxidermists, tailors, shoemakers, a native doctor and a dispenser, and boatmen, not to mention the Viennese conductor and the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> members of the orchestra, cooks, bakers, and table-waiters. The Maharajah certainly did things on a grand scale. One of the English guests gave, with perfect truth, his place of birth as required in the Indian Census Return as \"a first-class carriage on the London and North-Western Railway, somewhere between Bletchley and Euston; the precise spot being unnoticed either by myself or the other person principally concerned.\" The daily routine of life in the camp was...", "...always boozed--nipping, you know.' Kate did not answer, and an uneasy silence ensued, which was broken at length by the appearance of a hiccuping, long-whiskered man. 'How are you, o-o-old man? Eh! who is--? I don't think I have the pleasure of this lady's acquaintance.' 'Mrs. Ede--Mr. Hayes, our acting manager. Now, look here, Hayes, you go and get the tickets. I can't leave this lady.

The English Exchequer was to advance the money on the basis of interest at 3-1/8 per cent., instead of at 3-1/2 per cent. Though sufficient time has not yet elapsed to show whether the great bribe offered by the Act of 1885, at the expense of the British taxpayer, will succeed in overcoming the apathy of the tenants, it cannot escape notice that if the Act of 1885 succeeds better than the previous Acts, it will owe that success solely to the greater amount of risk...", "...them down again.] JAMES.

An elegant Acacia, about thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet high, grew on its small flats: it had large drooping glaucous bipinnate leaves, long broad pods, and oval seeds, half black, and half bright red.

This done, he planted on every farm eight acres of grapes and some fruit-trees; and on the whole place over five miles of outside willow fencing and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles of inside fencing. Willows grow rapidly in that region, and make a very close fence, yielding also fire-wood sufficient for the farmer's use. All this had to be done gradually, so that the payments for labor should not exceed the monthly contributions of the associates, for they had no credit to use in the beginning, and contracted no debts. When the planting was done, the superintendent cultivated and pruned the grape-vines and trees, and took care of the place;...", "...and in so doing had plunged myself into a very awkward predicament, out of which I did not at all clearly see how I was to extricate myself; but, whatever might be the result to myself of my imprudence, it had at least been the means of saving several men from an undeserved flogging, and this reflection served somewhat to comfort me.

In accomplishing this distance, the sheep had been six and the horses five days without water, and both had been almost wholly without food for the greater part of the time.

A supplementary vote was awarded to every married man who had attained the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years and paid five francs in taxes on his dwelling. An additional vote was given to every owner of land or house property of the value of two thousand francs, or to the possessor of an income of a hundred francs derived from Belgian public funds.

But, though for these reasons I do not suggest that the details I have given are of biographical importance, I feel absolutely certain on two essential points: (1) Browning unquestionably compared the scene he witnessed to _Lear_ and compared it in the most striking and poignant way.

This greyish-brown moth has two darker, sometimes reddish, cross lines on the fore wings, and one such line on the hind wings. It is presumably only to be regarded as an accidental visitor to England. The first record was of a specimen captured in the Warren at Folkestone in July, 1866, and since that year others were obtained in the same locality, but apparently not more than about half a dozen altogether. None seems to have been recorded for over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. The specimen, whose portrait is shown on Plate 38, Fig. 3, was obtained from Dresden. Abroad, the range includes Central and Southern Europe, Asia Minor, Syria, and Armenia. THE GRASS EMERALD (_Pseudoterpna pruinata_).

The woman remained for a moment motionless, listening to the sound of their retreating footsteps; and when all was silent, she sprang with a bound towards the door, the bolts of which she fastened with an impetuous gesture; then, returning and placing herself beside the wounded man, she fixed upon him a long and melancholy look. This woman, though really <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age, appeared to be scarcely more than five-and-twenty. She was of an extraordinary, but a strange style of beauty; it attracted attention, commanded admiration, but created an instinctive repulsion. In spite of the majestic splendour of her graceful form, the elegance of her carriage, the freedom of her motions, full of voluptuous ease,--in spite of the purity of the lines of her fair face, slightly tinged by the warm rays of an American sun, which the magnificent...", "...\"to whom God whispers in the ear.\" His character now exhibited more than ever the marks of the poet and seer; the time was at hand when all the subdued enthusiasm of his mind was to break forth in the opening Suras of the Kuran. The inspiration had not yet descended upon him, but it was imminent, and the shadow of its stern requirements was about him as he attended to his work of supervising Khadijah's wealth or took part in the religious life of Mecca. In A.D. 605, when Mahomet was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years old, the chief men of Mecca decided to rebuild the Kaaba. The story of its rebuilding is perhaps the most interesting of the many strange, naive tales of this adventurous city. Valley floods had shattered the house of the gods. It was roofless, and so insecure that its treasury had already been rifled by blasphemous men. It stood only as high as the stature of a man, and was made simply of stones laid one above the other. Rebuilding was absolutely necessary, but...", "...on from a high bank, which her own shot could not reach. The Margaretta again weighed, and running into the bay, at the confluence of the two rivers, anchored. The following morning, which was Monday, the 11th of May, four young men took possession of one of the lumber sloops, and, bringing her alongside of a wharf, they gave three cheers as a signal for volunteers. On explaining that their intentions were to make an attack on the Margaretta, a party of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> athletic men was soon collected. Arming themselves with firearms, pitchforks, and axes, and throwing a small stock of provisions into the sloop, these spirited freemen made sail on their craft, with a light breeze at northwest. When the Margaretta observed the approach of the sloop, she weighed and crowded sail to avoid a conflict that was every way undesirable,--her commander not yet being apprised of all the facts that had occurred near Boston....", "...was three of his best poems: _To the Oregon Robin_, _To the Golden Crown Sparrow of Alaska_, and _To the Lapland Longspur_. Since that trip in 1899, he has written no verse, I believe, except _The Return_. Before then he was an irregular contributor of poetry to the current magazines since the appearance of _Waiting_, in 1862. He says now that he does not seem to be in a mood for poetry, but that he may find his muse again some day. The total number of his poems in print amounts to only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and none of them are lengthy. The longest of all is his very life which is to me one continuous poem. His verses are only sparks from the life in which they grew, and never rise to the height of the fountain head. Perhaps one way to test a poet is to measure him by the number of single line poems that can be found in his poetry; lines that make the real poem of a number of verses. Pope thought that a long poem was a contradiction of terms, and we certainly know many...", "...a kind of beach near the forest. I had a look round, but the natives and the brig were both hidden by a big, hummucky heap of twisted lava, the born fool in me suggested a run for the woods.

When the militia of one county in South Carolina was mustered during the Revolution, it was found that every one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> hundred men enrolled were natives of Pennsylvania. These were mainly sons of North Irishmen, and from the Carolina Irish sprang Calhoun, the most aggressive statesman that has appeared in America, and Jackson, the most brilliant military genius in the whole course of our history.

Soon afterward a multitude...", "...in at the head of a storming-party and wild work followed with the bayonet. All the Americans inside were either killed or captured.

The chance for a sortie then seeming favourable, Lieutenant Anderson of the Navy headed his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> merchant mates and skippers in a rush along Sault-au-Matelot Street. But his effort was premature. Morgan shot him dead, and Morgan's Virginians drove the seamen back inside the barricade.

The missions in 1647.--By 1647 St. Augustine was headquarters for fifty Franciscans, who worked among the neighboring tribes. Northward a line of ten missions extended up the Georgia coast to Chatuache near the Savannah River. Toward the western interior, within a radius of one hundred and fifty miles there were ten more, and toward the south four. In the Apalachee district there were eight in eight large towns, with three more on the way to St. Augustine. At these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> missions 26,000 converted Indians were served. The Apalachee revolt.--Just now, however, the prosperous Apalachee missions suffered a severe blow. The chiefs, refusing to render personal sendee and tribute, headed a rebellion in which several Spaniards were slain. The governor led a campaign against them, several battles were fought, and a number of chiefs hanged. The Indians were subdued, but they were so embittered that the Franciscans abandoned the missions.

Frank's cards lay face downward on the table, and every one was wondering what he could have found to go up against Snell's pat hand. He was wonderfully calm, as he turned to Bart, and asked: \"Will you loan me something?\" \"Every cent I have,\" was the instant reply, as Hodge took out a roll of bills and threw it on the table. \"Use what you want.\" There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> dollars in the roll. Frank counted it over carefully, and then put it all into the pot, raising Snell twenty-five dollars! When he saw this, Snell's nerve suddenly left him. His face paled and his hands shook. \"Whoever heard of such infernal luck as that fellow has!\" he grated. \"Held up a pair, and must have fours now!\" Frank said not a word. His face was quiet, and he seemed waiting for Snell to do something. \"If you haven't the money to call him----\" began...", "...was struck by a tornado off the coast of Peru.

Why, because she hit me over the 'ead with a broom-handle.\" Mrs. Smith tossed her head. \"Fancy you remembering that for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years!\" she said. \"Fancy forgetting it!\" retorted Mr. Davis. \"I suppose she had a hot temper,\" said the old lady. \"'Ot temper?\" said the other. \"Yes.\" He leaned forward, and holding his chilled hands over the fire stood for some time deep in thought. \"I don't know what it is,\" he said at last, \"but there's a something about you that reminds me of her.

If, however, the people should think otherwise, they had it in their power to correct the mistake, by ratifying the proposed amendment. Their not having as yet ratified it, was to him an argument that they thought the ratio too low; or, at least, that they considered the question as doubtful. Some of the States, he observed, have postponed the consideration of the amendment; and eight only have as yet agreed to it. On the whole, the House might safely adopt the ratio of one to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand; for that the increasing population of the United States would ever supply a representation sufficiently numerous to answer every good purpose. Mr. CLARK observed, that his objection was not merely on account of the pay of the members, but an increase in the representation would bring an additional expense on the people, by increasing the number of public officers; as almost every man would wish to see his friend provided for. The liberties of America could be in...", "...born in Padua, and came to Rome during the reign of Augustus, where he resided in the enjoyment of the imperial favor and patronage. He was a warm and open admirer of the ancient institutions of the country, and esteemed Pompey as one of its greatest heroes; but Augustus did not allow political opinions to interfere with the regard which he entertained for the historian. His great work is a history of Rome, which he modestly terms \"Annals,\" in one hundred and forty-two books, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> are extant. Besides his history, Livy is said to have written treatises and dialogues, which were partly philosophical and partly historical. The great object of Livy's history was to celebrate the glories of his native country, to which he was devotedly attached. He was a patriot: his sympathy was with Pompey, called forth by the disinterestedness of that great man, and perhaps by his sad end. He delights to put forth his powers in those passages which relate to the...", "...general?\" Arthur replied: \"I prefer to walk on the boulevards and smoke big eight-sou cigars.\" This reply, which left nothing to be desired in the way of frankness, indicated a most generous inclination to consume the fortune which his parents had so laboriously amassed in business, and which, in fact, they left to their beloved son without undue delay. At the age of twenty-two, Arthur, who had as yet done nothing else than promenade and smoke, found himself an orphan and possessed of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand francs a year. Thereupon, he abandoned himself to his taste for pleasure, augmented by a very keen penchant for the fair sex; and the fair sex is never ungrateful to a rich and open-handed man. Arthur was not handsome: his crooked nose, his small eyes, and his pointed chin, did not tend to make him a very attractive youth; however, the women told him again and again that he was charming, adorable, irresistible, and he believed it. We are so ready to believe...", "...was formed of four layers of gutta percha alternating with four of Chatterton's compound (a solution of gutta percha in Stockholm tar); the wire and conductor being seven hundred pounds per mile, and nine-twentieths of an inch thick.

The whole cable was an inch and one eighth thick, weighed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and three-quarter hundredweights per mile, and was strong enough to endure a breaking strain of seven tons and three-quarters. During the various processes of manufacture, the electrical quality of the cable was tested to an unusual extent.

Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen minutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five minutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was less aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five seconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case, the path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip, which only required <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> seconds. Of course, the whole thing did not amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning from experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of animal behaviour. Comparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased masterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records of observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of feeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they...", "...possess for the Zebedean authorship; yet, as Calmes admits, \"it cannot be considered decisive.\" In his work against the Heresies and in his letter to Florinus, about 185-191, he tells how he had himself known Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna, and how Polycarp \"used to recount his familiar intercourse with John and the others who had seen the Lord\"; and explicitly identifies this John with the Zebedean and the evangelist. But Irenaeus was at most fifteen when thus frequenting Polycarp; writes <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to fifty years later in Lyons, admitting that he noted down nothing at the time; and, since his mistaken description of Papias as \"a hearer of John\" the Zebedean was certainly reached by mistaking the presbyter for the apostle, his additional words \"and a companion of Polycarp\" point to this same mistaken identification having also operated in his mind with regard to Polycarp. In any case, the very real and important presbyter is completely unknown to Irenaeus, and his...", "...a little sad, very youthful and yet determined! A bloody bruise showed over his temple.

That settles it. The list is closed. Every Liberal candidate who tried his fortune with an Irish constituency has suffered a signal discomfiture at the polls. Some of them have been beaten by Conservatives, others by Nationalists. In one way or another all have been sent back to private life. At the general election of 1880, Ireland returned to Parliament eighteen Liberals, and twenty-six Liberal Home Rulers, twenty-four Conservatives and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> Parnellites. Thus, out of the one hundred and three Irish members, Mr. Gladstone could count forty-four supporters against sixty-nine Conservatives and Parnellites. In the present election the Conservatives will probably have eighteen seats, while the Parnellites will secure the remaining eighty-five seats. The Liberals and Liberal Home Rulers are wiped out to the last man.

Following the latter a short distance farther, a well-built stone bridge was discovered, with five arches, the centre one about twenty feet above the water, which was here from five to six fathoms deep; the span of the principal arch was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet, and upon the top of the bridge was a sort of sentry-box, or small look-out place, secured with a padlock. Near at hand, upon the left bank of the river, was a very pretty village, in which there was one large house, distinguished from the others by having Chinese characters carved upon it, the meaning of which, of course, could not be ascertained. About a quarter of a mile above the bridge, the banks of the river were studded with well-built houses, surrounded by...", "...grand piano, and several music stands, and a violin case on a chair near by. The furniture of the room was covered with a cool, fresh chintz. In short, it was a charming room, quite different from the rooms at Meredith Manor, which, of course, were old and magnificent and stately; but it had a refreshing, wholesome look about it which, in spite of himself, Mr. Cardew appreciated. He had just taken in the room and its belongings when the door was opened and a lady of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age entered. She was dressed very simply in a long dress made in a sort of Empire fashion. The color was pale blue, which suited her calm, fair face, her large, hazel-brown eyes, and her rich chestnut hair to perfection. She came forward swiftly. \"I am Mrs. Ward,\" she said, and held out her hand. Mr. Cardew considered himself a connoisseur as regards all women, and he was immediately impressed by a certain quality in that face: a mingling of sweetness and...", "...hither.... His plantation did, it seems, prosper, yet not without loss in men and effort. In the spring of 1623 when forty new men reported to the settlement things were not good. \"Of all Mr. Gookins men which he sent out the last year we found but seven, the rest being all killed by the Indians, and his plantation ready to fall to decay.\" At the time of the Indian massacre he refused to take refuge in a stronger place deeming his settlement strong enough to withstand attack. With <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> men he succeeded in this and, it seems, was the first to reach England with news of the massacre. His son Daniel Gookin, Jr., evidently took over the management of the settlement when he left. The census of 1625 from \"Newportes newes\" lists only the muster of Daniel Gookin and would indicate that neither he, nor his son, was in residence at the time. The listing shows only a total of twenty servants, eight of whom came in the _Flyinge Hart_ in 1621 and twelve of the...", "...it had been a one-man race. Fifteen minutes later, however, we had a \"free for all\" which gave him his initiation.

Mr. Coltman, who was driving, had already thrown on the brakes, but Roy, thinking in his excitement that he had stopped, jumped--and jumped too soon. The speed at which we were going threw him violently to the ground.

In passing through the plains, which were yesterday so arid and dry, I found immense pools, nay almost large reaches of water lodged in the hollows, and in which boats might have floated. Such was the result of only an hour or two's rain, whilst the ground itself, formerly so hard, was soft and boggy in the extreme, rendering progress much slower and more fatiguing to the horses than it otherwise would have been. By steadily persevering we made a stage of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles, but were obliged to encamp at night some miles short of the little height I had been steering for. During our ride we passed several dry watercourses at five, ten, twenty-five, thirty, and thirty-five miles from our last encampment. The last we halted upon with good feed for the horses, and rainwater lodged everywhere. All these watercourses took their course to the north, emptying and losing themselves in the plains.

Then Fountain bade his old friend good-bye and boarded the train with his prisoner, taking a seat near the centre of the rear car.

But scarcely had he reached his friend's side, when a noise behind him caused him turn--just in time to see his Mexican running for rear door. Instantly Fountain sprang after him, before he got to the door the man had leaped from platform. Without the slightest hesitation, Fountain jumped after him, hitting the ground only a few seconds behind him but thirty or forty yards away, rolling like a tumbleweed along the ground.

It is very gratifying to the author to note the large increase in the sale of \"The Faith of Our Fathers.\" Apart from personal considerations, it is pleasing to know that the popular interest in the Catholic Church and whatever pertains to her doctrines and discipline, is growing more widespread and earnest. Since 1879, when the eleventh revised edition was given to the public, there have been <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> editions, and the number of copies sold reaches nearly a quarter of a million. This desire to understand the teachings of the Church of our Fathers is not confined to our own country. It is manifest in other lands, as shown by the translations that have been made of this exposition of Catholic belief into French, German, Spanish, Italian, Norwegian and Swedish. In the hope that they will add to the usefulness of the book, several passages upon doctrinal subjects have...", "...not business, for I doan sell it again once I gif it to her.

Two pieces of artillery, eight hundred muskets, two standards, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> wagons and one hundred dragoon horses fell into the hands of the Americans. Notwithstanding the cruel warfare which Tarleton had waged against the Americans, to the honor of the victors it is said not one of the British prisoners was killed, or even insulted after they had surrendered.

At Rheims Joan conceived the noble thought of putting an end to the civil strife--the furious strife that had raged between the Burgundians and the Armagnacs, and that for so many years had desolated and exhausted the land, and delivered it over to the foreigner.

From about 1633 to 1639 these volumes were composed of paper of rather small size, making a page of a hundred and thirty to a hundred and thirty-three millimetres; from 1639 onwards the paper was larger, and the page from about a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to a hundred and thirty-seven.

Californians, during that period of the War when the North was suffering a series of defeats, had little use for greenbacks. At one time, a dollar in currency was worth but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cents, though early in April it was accepted at sixty-five, late in August at ninety, and about the first of October at seventy-five cents; even interest-bearing gold notes being worth no more. This condition of the money market saw little change until some time in the seventies; and throughout the War greenbacks were handled like any other commodity.

Also, I noticed it was mighty hard to keep awake after dinner unless I got out into the air and kept moving. I felt well enough and the doctors said I was organically all right. I kept informed on those points--but I was fat! Also, though I lied to myself, I knew I was getting fatter. CHAPTER III FACING THE TISSUE On New Year's Day, 1911, I weighed myself. I don't know why, for I hadn't been on a scale for two or three years. I set the weight at two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and it bounded up like a rubber ball; so I shoved it along to two hundred and forty and it still stayed up in the air. When I got a balance I found I weighed two hundred and forty-seven pounds. I was amazed! Also, I was scared; for it instantly occurred to me that if I had gone up to two hundred and forty-seven in two or three years from two hundred and thirty-five I should keep on going up if my manner of living didn't change--and that presently I should weigh three...", "...of the questions she has to answer; and, meanwhile, if a crowd of little children come in, she turns from her writing and calculations and plays with them as if she had nothing else to do.

More than nineteen hundred children have passed through her hands. With what pride she showed us the copy-books, and pointed out some particularly good compositions.

The rain, which had begun in earnest about ten minutes after we got airborne, had been steadily increasing to the point it was now almost blinding. This was the risk I'd chosen to take, but let me admit right here: The weather had me seriously scared, my fingernails digging into the armrests and my pulse erratic. And now was there something else? We'd only been in the air for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes, and already we had some kind of mechanical issue looming?

She had been drinking water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands. Ten yards away, to her right, half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion. His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer's. His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping. Givens did what he could. His six-shooter was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> yards away lying on the grass. He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess. The \"rucus,\" as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused. When he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard a couple of faint cracks. Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him, with a heavy jar, to the ground. He remembered calling out: \"Let up, now--no fair gouging!\" and then he...", "...equestrian order, reviving the ancient custom of a cavalcade [179], which had been long laid aside. But he did not suffer any one to be obliged by an accuser to dismount while he passed in review, as had formerly been the practice. As for such as were infirm with age, or (102) any way deformed, he allowed them to send their horses before them, coming on foot to answer to their names, when the muster roll was called over soon afterwards. He permitted those who had attained the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, and desired not to keep their horse any longer, to have the privilege of giving it up. XXXIX. With the assistance of ten senators, he obliged each of the Roman knights to give an account of his life: in regard to those who fell under his displeasure, some were punished; others had a mark of infamy set against their names.

The plates used were of special design. The center was white, with the monogram in green letters, \"L. P. E., 1904,\" and a wide green border, with a gold band. The white and green furnished a most appropriate background for the varicolored fruit and the effect was most pleasing as the eye swept over the whole exhibit. A WORD OF COMMENDATION On the opening day of the Fair, April thirtieth, New York's exhibit of fruit was complete in every detail. In fact of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> States, Canada and Mexico represented, New York was the only State to have its exhibit installed and ready for exhibition when the doors of the Palace of Horticulture were thrown open to the public, which called forth a special word of commendation from the Chief of the Department of Horticulture, Honorable F. W. Taylor. Owing to the fact that at that time the other States were not prepared to make a display, it was deemed inadvisable to exhibit a large number of varieties,...", "...made up my mind to act, there was a stamping of feet outside and a knock at the door. When it was opened, another portion of the press-gang, headed by another officer, entered. I counted heads, and found that they mustered thirty hands--quite sufficient, as they were armed, to secure all my late companions. I therefore went up to the officer, and begged to speak with him aside. I then told him that I had just come from a crimp's house near Stonehouse, where I left in their beds <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> as fine men as ever walked a plank, and that, as I was pressed myself, I did not mind telling him where they were, and he could take them all. The officer curled up his lip, as if to say, \"You're a pretty scoundrel to betray your companions,\" but immediately resolved to act upon it. Without stating his intentions, he ordered all the men out, and putting me between two marines, so as to prevent my escaping, I was desired to lead on. I did so, and we proceeded in silence...", "...fact that men are every where alike ready to follow up their advantage. These people are well aware that the horses must be left behind at any rate, and therefore they will not bid for them. I must confess that I found the character of the Icelanders in every respect below the estimate I had previously formed of it, and still further below the standard given in books. In spite of their scanty food, the Icelandic horses have a marvellous power of endurance; they can often travel from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty miles per diem for several consecutive days. But the only difficulty is to keep the horse moving. The Icelanders have a habit of continually kicking their heels against the poor beast's sides; and the horse at last gets so accustomed to this mode of treatment, that it will hardly go if the stimulus be discontinued. In passing the bad pieces of road it is necessary to keep the bridle tight in hand, or the horse will stumble frequently. This and the continual...", "...similar to the former but was if possible still more urgent in his requests. A second hymn followed and, a quantity of water being sprinkled on the hot stones, the attendants were ordered to close the temple, which they did by very carefully covering it up with moose-skins. We had no means of ascertaining the temperature of the sweating-house; but before it was closed not only those within but also the spectators without were perspiring freely. They continued in the vapour bath for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes, during which time a third speech was made and a hymn was sung and water occasionally sprinkled on the stones which still retained much heat, as was evident from the hissing noise they made. The coverings were then thrown off and the poor half-stewed worshippers exposed freely to the air; but they kept their squatting postures until a fourth speech was made in which the deity was strongly reminded of the value of the gifts and exhorted to take an early opportunity...", "...a week previously. His outfit had been ready for several days, and he called at the hotel the evening of my arrival to go over the grub list and make definite plans. As there were only two of us, he reckoned that ten horses and two packers would be sufficient to see us through. The horses would cost us two dollars a day a head, and the packers five dollars apiece. The provisions he would buy himself and endeavour to board us at a dollar and a half apiece a man. This footed up to between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and forty dollars a day for the outfit, exclusive of the movie end. It seemed a bit stiff offhand, but was really very reasonable considering present costs of doing that kind of a thing and the thoroughly first-class service Nixon gave us from beginning to end.

It is about the size of a hen's egg, tapering towards both ends, green, nearly covered with thin russet, of inferior quality, but not as coarse as the _Endicott_. In 1836 it was a flourishing, lofty tree, producing an average of fifteen bushels of fruit.

The great question at present was which of many schools to select. Admiral Seldon had written to several for circulars and information, and had been nearly swamped with replies in every conceivable form.

The school now under most favorable consideration for Beverly was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles from Sprucy Branch, the town nearest Four Corners and Woodbine.

It was shown that while the average rate per ton per mile of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> neighboring roads was 2.85 cents, that of the Camden and Amboy Company was 4.54 cents. It was also shown that neither the stockholders nor the State had received the share of the company's revenues to which they were entitled.

The result was the largest wheat crop in American history except that of 1915, despite the killing cold of the winter of 1917 and the withering drought of the summer of 1918.

At the first glance Anna Akimovna perceived that he must be a foreman, who must be receiving at least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> roubles a month, and a stern, loud-voiced man who struck the workmen in the face; all this was evident from his manner of standing, from the attitude he involuntarily assumed at once on seeing a lady in his room, and most of all from the fact that he did not wear top-boots, that he had breast pockets, and a pointed, picturesquely clipped beard. Her father, Akim Ivanovitch, had been the brother of the factory owner, and yet he had been afraid of foremen like this lodger and...", "...Regiment rendezvoused on the west side of the river, clear of the town, before dusk. Here the men had food, and a start was made at 7 p.m. The going at first was fairly simple, but once the track was left the ground became rough, stony, and intersected with dongas.

Cortes replied to these remonstrances, That we had no cause as yet to complain of fortune, the deaths that had happened being the ordinary fate of war; that it was our own fault if we wanted provisions in a land of plenty; and that it would be disgraceful to quit the country without seeing more of it, which, with the...", "...Lescarbot; Champlain; De Monts. =Bienville, Jean Baptiste Le Moyne, sieur de= (1680-1768).

Opening the door without knocking, he found the unhappy man in the very act of applying a pistol to his head, his own hand being just in time to prevent the catastrophe.

In the time of St. Leo, the patriarch Proterius, who succeeded the deposed Dioscorus, was murdered by the Monophysite faction. A few years later the bishop of Constantinople used this heresy for the purpose of exalting his see against Rome, which had just been deprived of its emperor, and its government left in the hand of barbarians, who were also heretics. Thus supported by imperial power, Acacius brought about a schism which lasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. The resistance of seven Popes, the last of whom, Hormisdas, obtained the full result which his predecessors had sought for, frustrated this second century of Byzantine aggression upon the faith and government of the Church. Indeed, so striking and unquestionable was the submission of the Byzantine sovereign, and the recognition by the Byzantine bishop of the Papal authority, that from this time forth a somewhat new course was pursued by the eastern emperor and...", "...snow, which was of the wet kind that clings to every bush and tree, robing the woods in a pure and spotless white that inevitably suggests fairyland.

This animal was now lying down near the table, so tired and footsore from almost perpetual running that he thought it too much trouble to get up and eat. I read in his eye that he was in the habit of breathing every day of his life a canine curse on the business of cattle-dealing. His master seemed a good-natured man, but he had a fixed idea that was unfortunate for the dog. He considered that the beast ought to be able to run from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty miles a day, and that if he got sore paws it was his own fault. 'And do you never give him a lift?' 'Never!' roared the cattle-dealer, laughing like an ogre.

She absorbed the fact that Consols had gone up an eighth and that contangoes were in process of arrangement, without interest or understanding. She was thinking of something else. Miss Briggs coughed apologetically. Victoria looked up. Miss Briggs reflectively tied knots in her apron string. She was a tall, lantern-jawed woman of no particular age; old looking for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> perhaps or young looking for fifty. Her brown hair, plentifully sprinkled with grey, broke out in wisps over each ear and at the back of the neck. Her perfectly flat chest allowed big bags of coarse black serge to hang over her dirty white apron. Her hands played mechanically with the strings, while her water-coloured eye fixed upon the _Telegraph_. 'You shouldn't read that paper, mum,' she remarked. 'Why not?' asked Victoria, with a smile, 'isn't it a good one?'...", "...Urungu, the Nkommi, the Dongas or Ndiva, and the Mb\u00fasha, and 3. the Mpongwe and the tribes of the interior.

According to Dr. Fisk he is a better insurance risk if after <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> he is under the weight which is the average for those of his years. Reduction in weight reduces the basal requirement for food, and reduces the amount of fuel needed for moving the body in walking. The most extreme illustration of the effect of emaciation upon the food requirement is afforded by a woman who after losing nearly half of her body weight was found to need only 40 per cent. of the food-fuel formerly required.

The evening of Shrovetide, a favorite holiday in the Netherlands, afforded an occasion for arresting and carrying off a vast number of doomed individuals at a single swoop.

Mr. Fournier d'Albe tells us that the force with which electrons repel each other is a quadrillion times greater than the force of gravitation that brings atoms together; and that if two grammes of pure electrons could be placed one centimetre apart they would repel each other with...", "...lofty moods, which even in his younger times Mrs. Von Breuning used to call his \"_raptus_\"--rapture of song. In a technical point of view the handling of the themes becomes more masterly in Beethoven than even in Mozart--mainly perhaps because the symphonies of Beethoven represent a more mature point in his mental and artistic career than do those of Mozart. The third symphony of Beethoven was written in 1803, the composer being thirty-three years old; the fourth waited until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> or six. Mozart died at the age of thirty-five, and whatever we have from his lofty pen came to the young Mozart, not yet having reached middle life. Observe also the rapidity with which these great works followed one another from the pen of Beethoven, when once he had found his voice. The fifth symphony was written in 1808. In the same year he wrote also the sixth; four years later, in 1812, the next two symphonies, the seventh and eight. Then a long pause, filled up with...", "...all its own.

It consisted of nineteen tropical years, during which time there are exactly two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> new moons; so that, at the end of this period, the new moons will recur at seasons of the year corresponding exactly to those of the preceding cycle. If, for example, a new moon fell at the time of the vernal equinox, in one cycle, nineteen years afterwards it would occur again at the same equinox; or, if it had happened ten days after the equinox, in one cycle, it would also happen ten days after the equinox, nineteen years afterwards.

An excellent way to keep blooming bulbs through the winter is to pack them in crates, and pile these in a cellar without artificial heat, where the mercury ranges from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty degrees in cold weather. Small bulbs may be kept in the same way, but they should not be more than two or three inches deep in the crates. They settle into a more solid mass than large bulbs, and if too deep they are liable to start into growth. This should be carefully guarded against. Small quantities of bulbs may be stored in half-bushel baskets, from two to four inches deep, according to size, and hung up in the cellar.

Earl Sigvaldi rowed out of the battle with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> ships and left twenty-five behind him. Then did Earl Hakon bring his ship round to the other side of that of Bui, and short respite then had the men of Bui between the blows. Now there was an anvil with a sharp end standing on the forecastle of the ship that pertained to Bui, and the reason thereof was that some man had made use thereof when welding the hilt of his sword, and Vigfus the son of Vigaglums, who was a man of great strength, took up the anvil & throwing it...", "...was redeemed by an expression of wonderful innocence. \"Dom Cuthbert is expecting you in the Abbot's Parlour.\" Michael and Chator followed Brother Ambrose through a pleasant book-lined hall into the paternal haunt where the Lord Abbot of Clere sat writing at a roll-top desk.

He could scarcely have been over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years of age, but he moved with a languid awkwardness that made him seem older. His voice was very remote and melodious as he welcomed them.

In this eastern portion of Kansas, prior to the Civil War, was fought, often with bloodshed, the protracted border contest between the free-soil and pro-slavery parties for the possession of the State, that had so much to do with bringing on the greater conflict.

Consalvi had been dead a good many years, but as yet no one had thought it was time to say that his widow was no longer young and beautiful, as she had always been. Many rich widows remain young and beautiful as much as a quarter of a century, or even longer, and the Signora Consalvi was very rich indeed. As soon as she was married to Folco Corbario every one knew that she was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years old and he was barely twenty-six, and that such a difference of ages on the wrong side was ridiculous if it was not positively immoral. No well-regulated young man had a right to marry a rich widow nine years older than himself, and who had a son only eleven years younger than he. A few philosophers who said that if the widow was satisfied the matter was nobody's business were treated with the contempt they deserved. Those who, on the contrary, observed that young...", "...be Regular-Army officers, if possible, thus securing uniformity of drill and discipline.[K] The recent transformation of our array is almost as startling as the changes which followed the Revolution and the War of 1812.

Twelve months after the organization of the Post Office Banks the trustees of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> of the old Savings Banks had closed their banks. Up to the present period (March, 1866), sixty additional banks have followed the example thus set them; this making a total of--exclusive of Penny Banks--ninety-five banks which have transferred their business to the Post Office.

The most important bank on the list is Birmingham, originally established in...", "...lived, and in the people by which they were surrounded.

It may be that his specimens were raised from nuts procured in the warmer part of California, and, as with many other Pacific coast plants, proved to be tender, while later introductions of the same species collected in colder localities have proved hardy here. In my experience I have found a great difference in the hardiness of trees and...", "...on!

They are needed to determine methods of increasing our annual cut for pulp and paper. They are necessary so that we can increase our annual output of poles, pilings, cooperage and veneer. A forest experiment station is needed in the southern pine belt. The large pine forests of Dixieland have been shaved down from 130,000,000 acres to 23,500,000 acres.

A common price for sugar in a mining camp was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to fifty cents a pound. In the San Juan mining camps, as late as 1875, potatoes sold for twenty-five cents a pound. A mule or burro would earn its own cost in a single trip, for there were occasions under certain conditions, such as the packing from Florence into the more remote placer districts, when the pack-master charged as much as eighty cents a pound from the supply point to the camps.

I learnt from natives whom I met at Mr. Parnell's station, that the rivers Bolloon, Culgoa, and Biree were then flowing, some abundant rains having fallen about their sources. Also, from the stockman, that the Narran was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles distant, but that a native could be found to guide me to water only ten miles off. Water was also to be obtained at a distance of only seven miles beyond the Barwan there at the \"Morella Ridges,\" to which the natives were in the habit of resorting at certain seasons, by a path of their own, to gather a fruit of which they were very fond, named by them \"Moguile,\" and which I had previously ascertained to be that formerly discovered by me, and named by Dr. Lindley...", "...look for the victim, and that victim will be you.

T. B. Williams, who, under the direction of the U. S. Department of Labor, made a general survey of the conditions which gave rise to this Negro exodus. One cause of the migration which seemed to have been general was low wages. Small pay was indeed one of the leading grievances of the Negroes. Up to 1917 on Southern farms common laborers received from fifty cents to seventy-five cents, and rarely a dollar, a day. The wages for women and children were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and forty cents a day. It is true, in some instances, meals were given with these wages, but oftener this was not the case. The following examples are typical of the wages for common laborers in such industries as saw-mills and cotton oil mills: Newbern, N. C. $1.00 to $1.50.[67] Americus, Ga. 1.25 Jackson, Miss. 1.25 to 1.75. Laurel, Miss. 1.65 to 2.00. Hattiesburg, Miss. 1.40 to...", "...her fond of any kind of exertion.

The north end of the compass is always pointed ahead, while the needle, which of course indicates the magnetic north, gives the bearing of the line run toward that north. Now, magnetic north is not by any means the same thing as true north, in fact in very few localities on the earth's surface are they the same, and then never for long. In the extreme east of the United States the needle points some twenty degrees to the west of true north, and in Alaska it points <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> degrees to the eastward of it. There is therefore one meridian somewhere in the central valley where the true north corresponds with the magnetic north, but as the magnetic pole is always shifting this never remains true of the same meridian for long.

At half past five, we formed our encampment on a creek supposed to be Brown's Creek, having traveled seven and a quarter miles today. We are now five and a quarter miles from the mouth of this canyon making the whole distance of rough mountain road from the Weber River to the mouth of the canyon on this side a little less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles and decidedly the worst piece of road on the whole journey. At this place, the land is black and looks rich, sandy enough to make it good to work. The grass grows high and thick on the ground and is well mixed with nice green rushes. Feed here for our teams is very plentiful and good and the water is also good. There are many rattlesnakes of a large size in this valley and it is supposed they have dens in the mountains. The land looks dry and lacks rain, but the...", "...the old-fashioned 'bateau' the most characteristically Canadian. The modern 'bateau' is to be found only among keeled sailing craft. But the old 'bateau,' which Wolfe's local transport officers spelt _battoe_, was more of a rowboat. It was sharp at both ends, wall-sided, and fitted with oars, poles, and a square sail. The bottom had some sheer--that is, it was curved up at each end--but less than the top. Four men rowed, the fifth steered, and three tons of miscellaneous goods or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> barrels of flour made a fair cargo. Bateaux like this were the craft in which the United Empire Loyalists went up the St Lawrence to settle Upper Canada. Afterwards the size and crew were increased till the average cargo amounted to about four tons and a half. But the Durham boat, introduced by American traders from the Mohawk valley, soon became a successful rival, which was not itself supplanted till canals enabled still larger craft to pass from one open water to...", "...encouraging the garrison by promise of-relief, and of ascertaining the position of the enemy by personal observation. His presence as it always did, inspired the soldiers with enthusiasm, so that they could with difficulty be restrained from rushing forth to assault the besiegers. In regard to the enemy he found that Gibbet Hill was still occupied by Sir John Norris, \"the best soldier, in his opinion, that they had,\" who had entrenched himself very strongly, and was supposed to have <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> hundred men under his command. His position seemed quite impregnable. The rest of the English were on the other side of the river, and Alexander observed, with satisfaction, that they had abandoned a small redoubt, near the leper-house, outside the Loor-Gate, through which the reinforcements must enter the city. The Prince determined to profit by this mistake, and to seize the opportunity thus afforded of sending those much needed supplies. During the night the enemy...", "...force under Sir R. Napier, when the fort was captured on the 22nd August, a portion of the 8th being dismounted and taking part in the siege. Soon after this a squadron of the 8th, attached to Colonel Robertson's Flying Column, caught the rebels at Beejapore, near Goonah, September 5, 1858, and inflicted heavy loss upon them. Meantime, the left wing of the regiment, under Brigadier Honner, were following the rebels under Tantia Topee, and caught them at Kotarrhea, on the Bunnass river, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles north of Ooderpore, when, by a dashing charge, they completely broke up the infantry force, and drove the remainder, after a long pursuit, across the Chumbul. A troop of the 8th accompanied Brigadier Parke in his long-continued pursuit of the rebels, accomplishing at one time 251 miles in eleven days, and by so doing dispersed the rebel force at Ghota Ooderpore, December 1, 1858, and saved Baroda, to which place the ruffians were marching. Smith's brigade was sent...", "...since disappeared in the distance, and now the other automobiles proceeded on their way. The girls were very nervous, and the boys did all in their power to remove the strain. But the girls declared that they had had a narrow escape from a serious accident, and it put much of a damper on the trip. \"If ever I meet the driver of that car I'll give him a piece of my mind,\" said Dave. \"It's against the law to run at such high speed.\" The distance to Shady Glen Falls from Crumville was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles. The last half of the journey was over a winding dirt road, and the boys had calculated that it would take them two hours to reach the picnic grounds. \"We'll go by way of Darnell's Corners, and come back by way of Haslow,\" said Dave. \"That will give us a sort of round trip.\" And so it was decided. Darnell's Corners was but five miles from the Falls. It was only a small settlement, boasting of a tavern, a blacksmith shop, a church, and two stores. As they came in...", "...months later in the _Porvenir_, under the heading, 'Suicide of a Priest,' I read that one of these very canons of the Cathedral at Cordova had shot himself. A report was heard, said the journal, and the Civil Guard arriving, found the man prostrate with blood pouring from his ear, a revolver by his side. He was transported to the hospital, the sacrament administered, and he died. In his pockets they found a letter, a pawn-ticket, a woman's bracelet, and some peppermint lozenges. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years old. The newspaper moralised as follows: 'When even the illustrious order to which the defunct belonged is tainted with such a crime, it is well to ask whither tends the incredulity of society which finds an end to its sufferings in the barrel of a revolver.

Many other MSS. in this class of literature occur yearly in the accounts at this time. But the great acquisition of 1853 was the _Breviarium secundum regulam beati Ysidori, dictum Mozarabes_, printed _on vellum_ at Toledo, by command of Cardinal Ximenes, in 1502. L200 were given for this book, which is the only vellum copy known, and which is in most immaculate condition. It is of extreme rarity even on paper, as it is believed that only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> copies were printed. An imperfect copy of Caxton's _Chronicle_, 1480, was bought for L21; and a large gathering of Norfolk tracts was obtained at the sale of Mr. Dawson Turner's library. It was in this year that Dr. Constantine Simonides visited the Library in the hope of disposing of some of the products of his Eastern ingenuity, but failed here, as also at the British Museum, although successful in most other quarters. It is much to be lamented that the talent and...", "...whom they offered them laughed at their statements. One of these stones, fifteen inches in diameter, broke through the roof of a cottage, and killed a herdsman and a bullock. In 1810, a great stone fell at Shahabad, in India.

Of these, twenty-seven are previous to the Christian era; <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> from the beginning of the first to the end of the fourteenth century; eighty-nine from the beginning of the fifteenth to the beginning of the present century; from which time, since the attention of scientific men has been directed to the subject, above sixty cases have been recorded.

But if Napoleon devotes this army and that navy to such a formidable conquest as that of a country seven times as large as France, three thousand miles from her shores, it is not probable that he will soon be able to spare them for the invasion of Great Britain. Spain vainly struggled for years to conquer her revolted provinces in America. England failed to conquer her rebellious colonies, with a population not exceeding three millions. France lost an army of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand men, veterans of Moreau's, in the vain effort to subdue the negroes of St. Domingo. England could desire no better scheme for the destruction of the military strength of Napoleon than that of the attempted conquest of Mexico.

His clear-complexioned face was full of frankness and simplicity. His head was large and well-formed, and covered with bristling brown hair, cut short.

DEAR FATHER: Since my last to you there has been a mob to put down Abolitionism, in Alton, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles northwest of this place, in which two persons were killed and six or seven badly wounded. The immediate cause of the riot was the attempt by a Mr. Lovejoy to establish at Alton a religious newspaper in which the principles of slavery were sometimes discussed. Mr. Lovejoy was a Presbyterian minister and formerly edited a newspaper in St. Louis, but having published articles in his paper in relation to slavery which were offensive to...", "...per cent. of the cases are hereditary.\" Again, we find Doctor A. C. Rogers, superintendent of a school for feeble-minded in Minnesota, saying, \"We have no survey of mentality in this country except in very small areas, but probably about sixty-five per cent. of the feeble-minded children that we know of are feeble-minded from heredity; that is, they come from families in which there is much feeble-mindedness, usually associated with various neuroses or psychosis. There are about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> per cent. approximately that are acquired cases. These cases develop from various things. Full development may be prevented during gestation, or early childhood, or early adolescence, but these acquired cases are entirely distinct from the hereditary ones.\" In a recent paper Doctor Martin W.

We crossed the valley, and, guided by the frequent explosions, climbed the hills to the east, and, descending on the far side, came into a small valley full of sluggish, ill-smelling rills, among which we found the remarkable crater, which, as it has not been hitherto examined by any save hunters, I shall describe at some length. A gradual rising ground made up of soft sulphureous and calcareous earth was crowned by a more abrupt rise some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> feet high, composed of tough gray clay. This was pierced by a cone of regular form about thirty feet across at top and five feet at the bottom. On the west, about one-third of the circumference was wanting from a point six feet above the lowest level, thus enabling one to be at a distance or to stand close by, and yet see to the bottom of the pit. The ground all around and the shrubs and trees were dotted thick with flakes of dry mud, which gave, at a distance, a curious...", "...John Stewart, who built the residence, which was occupied for a number of years by the late Henry LeMesurier, Esq., and was finally destroyed by fire in 1866.

The grounds are beautifully wooded and descend by a series of natural terraces to the river, on the banks of which are the extensive timber coves and wharves known as Sillery Cove, with the workmen's cottages, offices, &c., fringing the side. There is also telegraphic communication between this cove and the city.

The cone is deeply covered with sand and cinders for about two hundred feet, and the sides are inclined at an angle of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> degrees.

In February, 1829, Fuzl Allee resigned the office of prime minister, and was protected by the Government of India, on the recommendation of the Resident, and saved, from the necessity of refunding to the State any of the wealth (some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> lacs of rupees) which he had acquired during his brief period of office.

Besides this extraneous circumstance, we would suggest another point of great influence.

In the year 1570, ten years after the accession of Titu Cusi to the Inca throne in Uiticos, a new Spanish viceroy came to Cuzco. Unfortunately for the Incas, Don Francisco de Toledo, an indefatigable soldier and administrator, was excessively bigoted, narrow-minded, cruel, and pitiless. Furthermore, Philip II and his Council of the Indies had decided that it would be worth while to make every effort to get the Inca out of Uiticos. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years the Spanish conquerors had occupied Cuzco and the major portion of Peru without having been able to secure the submission of the Indians who lived in the province of Uilcapampa. It would be a great feather in the cap of Toledo if he could induce Titu Cusi to come and live where he would always be accessible to Spanish authority. During the ensuing rainy season, after an unusually lively party, the Inca got soaked, had a chill, and was laid low. In the meantime the...", "...they were about to retreat a regiment of lancers was hurled upon their flank.

General Swayne gave me full explanations of his policy in Alabama. His death, a year after the interview, prevented him from verifying some details. His account, though given <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years after the occurrences, was correct so far as I could compare it with the printed matter available.

The river winds through narrow gorges with steep walls of limestone rock riddled with rock tombs. Here and there in the black gorges the high turreted rocks would be skirted below with bands of vegetation; little spurts of glistening water shooting over the rocky tops, as they dashed down to join the river, shot between masses of ferns or trickled through beds of green moss. It was months since we had seen anything green, and we feasted our...", "...In the first place, well do you know that there are many roads that want men, but refuse to employ C., B. & Q. strikers, until the strike is declared off. Furthermore, we have men working on all the roads in the country that will employ strikers. I am sorry that those men who are being expelled for non-payment, cannot see that it is to their benefit to sacrifice a few dollars per month, while we who are in the fight sacrifice on an average of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> ($35) dollars per month. I would to God that those men have their wages cut down one-half in the next twenty-four hours. In conclusion, I ask you your _candid opinion in regard to the boycott_.

At last it gave birth to a calf, but minus a tail, and the wrathful owner carried the calf, with his axe, to the back pasture. The Society was organized in 1811. New features were added from time to time; standing crops were inspected; women were interested to compete for premiums. The plowing match became a part of the Pittsfield show in 1818, when a quarter of an acre of green sward was plowed in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> minutes by the winner. Dr. Holmes, in 1849, Chairman of the committee, read his poem, \"The Ploughman.\" Many years before, William Cullen Bryant, then a lawyer in Great Barrington, wrote an ode for the cattle show. Improved agricultural implements and better methods of cultivation were some of the material benefits produced by the fairs. The fame and influence of the Society have reached all parts of the country. In 1855, exhibition grounds, thirty acres in extent, were...", "...suggested to the trapper that he and I make one fire as it should be and maybe they would follow suit--which would save half the fuel, with a better fire.

When I first came to Northern Pennsylvania, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, I found game fairly abundant; and, as I wanted to learn the country where deer most abounded, I naturally cottoned to the local hunters. Good fellows enough, and conceited, as all local hunters and anglers are apt to be. Strong, good hunters and axe-men, to the manner born and prone to look on any outsider as a tenderfoot. Their mode of building campfires was a constant vexation to me. They made it a point to always have a heavy sharp axe in camp, and toward...", "...attacks,\" he says, \"those it meets, and overpowers them with such force, that if it once coils itself round their necks, it strangles and kills them, unless it bursts itself by the violence of its own efforts.\" The same author states that he has seen Serpents as thick as a man's thigh, which had been taken when young by Indians and tamed. That this Boa attains an immense size is a well-established fact.

The name of Anaconda has become well known through Mr. Lewis's celebrated tale, so called, in which its predatory habits are displayed in such...", "...performance. To destroy the United States Bank was a different matter, for this institution had the full support of one of the two great parties in which the people of the country were now grouped; Jackson's own party was by no means a unit in opposing it; and the prestige and influence of the Bank were such as to enable it to make a powerful fight against any attempts to annihilate it. The second Bank of the United States was chartered in 1816 for twenty years, with a capital of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> million dollars, one-fifth of which had been subscribed by the Government. For some time it was not notably successful, partly because of bad management but mainly because of the disturbance of business which the panic of 1819 had produced. Furthermore, its power over local banks and over the currency system made it unpopular in the West and South, and certain States sought to cripple it by taxing out of existence the several branches which the board of directors voted to...", "...St. Louis, Hogan returned East, going to Oneida, N.

He reached that town dead broke; borrowed five dollars of Tyler, and struck out for Parker's Landing. When he reached that small but by no means unimportant settlement, our hero had just <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> cents in his pocket. His first entree, therefore, in Parker's--for by that name it is familiarly known--cannot be said to have been altogether encouraging. But if his capital in money was limited, Ben had any amount of pluck and energy, and these soon gave him a fair start. His first venture in Parker's was in the gymnasium line.

When the spirit bank became insolvent and the chief medium disappeared, the believers were out about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand dollars. No less a personage than a millionaire of Tacoma, Washington, is said to have contributed largely to this spirit fund.

This was successful; and the confederates of the medium signed...", "...remember that he'd sunk some money in the land company I mentioned and he thought he'd like to see the place where 'twas sunk.

It is curious how often a severe exacerbation of Bright's disease, which has been in existence for some time but has given no specific indication, is preceded by a series of neurotic symptoms thought to be due to nothing more than neurasthenia. Men of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> to forty-five, the favorite time for the occurrence of the severe forms of Bright's disease, begin to complain of tiredness, especially on waking in the morning, of inordinate fatigue in the evening, of some stomach symptoms and occasionally a tendency to diarrhea. All of these are ascribed to a neurasthenic condition. Early in these cases an examination of the urine should be made {558} as a routine practice, because if there is nothing in it the patient will be just that...", "...Zoologique' in 1832, I was altogether opposed to the doctrine that the animals and plants now living were the lineal descendants of distinct species, only known to us in a fossil state, and ... so far from exaggerating, I did not do justice to the arguments originally adduced by Lamarck and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, especially those founded on the occurrence of rudimentary organs. There is therefore no room for suspicion that my account of the Lamarckian hypothesis, written by me <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, derived any colouring from my own views tending to bring it more into harmony with the theory since propounded by Darwin.\"[334] So little difference did Sir Charles Lyell discover between the views of Lamarck and those of his successors.

Lamarck's great aim was to discover the cause...", "...He was also, by the terms of the treaty, at liberty to make war on the nations of the Upper Syrian coast, for we find him reducing the Tahai, who bordered on Cilicia, without any disturbance of his relations with Mautenar.

The third act was deferred for a space of some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, and fell into the reign of Ramesses II., Seti's son and successor. Before giving an account of it, we must briefly touch the other wars of Seti, to show how great a warrior he was, and mention one further fact in his warlike policy indicative of the commencement of Egypt's decline as a military power.

In 1864 he carried his disinterestedness so far as to offer to _give_ to the institution, as part of its permanent fund, the entire amount to which he said he was entitled for services rendered and expenses incurred. This amount was two hundred and thirty-two thousand dollars, which would certainly have been a handsome gift. When he was asked for the items of his account, he said he had charged for eighteen years' services in founding the institution, at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> hundred dollars a year, and the rest was travelling-expenses, clerk hire, and salaries paid to agents. The trustees were puzzled to know how a man who, at the beginning of the enterprise, had no visible property, could have expended so much out of his private resources, while exercising an unremunerated employment. Leaving that conundrum unsolved, they were able at length to conjecture the object of the donation. One of the articles of the charter provided that any person...", "...This was interpreted to Tristram, who found the argument fallacious, but fell on his knees and kissed M. de Lambertie's hand. \"Take him away,\" said the Grand Provost.

His enemies--for even such is the depravity of human nature, Mr. Asherill had enemies--said a considerable portion of the period must have been spent in obtaining a practical knowledge of the roguery, vice, falsehood, and trickery, which he denounced so unctuously; and it is quite certain that in whatever school he may have graduated, his information on...", "...it in order. This meeting continued in session from the 15th to the 29th of September, 1913. There were present thirty-nine delegates and the seven members of the Executive Board. Three national industrial unions were represented: the Textile Workers by two delegates having thirty-one votes; the Forest and Lumber Workers (formerly the Brotherhood of Timber Workers) by one delegate with thirteen votes; and the Marine Transport Workers by one delegate with forty-two votes. The other <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> delegates represented eighty-five local unions with one hundred and ninety-two votes.[605] Attention has been called to the rather tepid discussion of the problem of centralization at the 1912 convention.[606] During the intervening year this question had called forth such bitter factional animosity in the organization that we find it in 1913 divided into two hostile camps and threatened again with disruption. The issue is significantly comparable to the \"states' rights\"...", "...He had also a stock of night-caps, stockings, cloaks in the Eastern fashion, umbrellas, and sea biscuits, of which I was very fond; in those days I had thirty teeth, and it would have been difficult to find a finer set.

But the Spanish distaste for centralised administration shows itself in the reluctance to admit the facts, and of this the town of La Plata is an almost comic instance. When, in 1882, it was decided to make this place, which is distant about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> miles from Buenos Aires, the capital of the Province, the authorities spared no effort in planning and building a magnificent city which should be an effectual counterpoise to the federal capital and a standing protest against Unitarian theory.

Since that time I have spent in the European and Central Asian provinces, at different periods, nearly two years more; and in the intervals I have endeavoured to keep in touch with the progress of events. My observations thus extend over a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years. When I began, a few months ago, to prepare for publication the results of my more recent observations and researches, my intention was to write an entirely new work under the title of \"Russia in the Twentieth Century,\" but I soon perceived that it would be impossible to explain clearly the present state of things without referring constantly to events of the past, and that I should be obliged to embody in the new work a large portion of the old one. The portion to...", "...In the evening Napoleon returned to Jena with the conviction that he had destroyed the main body of the Prussian army. This was far from the truth; but notwithstanding his misapprehension as to his enemy, the moral results of what he had really done were most important. In the early morning of the fourteenth, Brunswick and the King had brought their troops as far as Auerstaedt, beyond which they hoped to cross the Saale and make a stand on its right bank to the eastward. They had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> thousand men, excluding the reserve of eighteen thousand. Bernadotte, according to Napoleon's orders, was marching from Gera to Dornburg in order to get in the rear of the deserted Prussian line; but he had not driven his troops, and was still in communication with Davout. Davout had received later orders, based upon Napoleon's conviction that Hohenlohe's was the main Prussian army, to turn in farther south for the same purpose, and march with his division of thirty-three...", "...initiative and a temperament, which made his propagation of ideas that were not new, as important a fact in social if not in intellectual history, as if he had been possessed of superlative gifts in speculation.

Whoever will take the trouble to turn over some of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> volumes of the Encyclopaedia, may easily see how that gigantic undertaking (1751-1765), in which Voltaire always took the most ardent and practical interest,[297] assisted the movement that Voltaire had commenced.

This is one of the fruits of abolition interference with slavery. I have remarked in Chapter 3, of this volume, that the abolition excitement in the North, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years ago, cut off discussion in the South on the subject of slavery; and that the legislatures of the slave States in self-defence, or otherwise, in obedience to the imperious demands of self-preservation, enacted stringent laws in reference to the slave population, &c.; and that among them will be found enactments making the education of slaves a penal offense.

'Oo are you goin' to 'ave,--Wilkins? I 'ad Wilkins. Better than Kedge, _I_ think: Kedge's mutes dresses rusty, an' their trousis is frayed.

They ain't sich a great expense, after all.\" SQUIRE NAPPER. I. Bill Napper was a heavy man of something between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> and forty. His moleskin trousers were strapped below the knees, and he wore his coat loose on his back, with the sleeves tied across his chest. The casual observer set him down a navvy, but Mrs. Napper punctiliously made it known that he was \"in the paving\"; which meant that he was a pavior. He lived in Canning Town, and was on a footpath job at West Ham (Allen was the contractor) when he won and began to wear the nickname \"Squire.\" Daily at the stroke of twelve from the...", "...Even Madame Clementine forgot when and how she left the island after she ceased to be an object of solicitude, for many comers and goers trample the memory as well as the island. Had his love followed him up the green tangled height and sunk so swiftly to her death that it was accomplished without noise or outcry? To this hour only a few inhabitants locate the treacherous spot. He could not hide, even at Madame Clementine's, from all the talk of a community. This unreasonable tryst of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years raised for the first time doubts of his sanity. A woman might have kept such a tryst; but a man consoles himself. Passers had been less frequent than usual, but again there was a crunch of approaching feet. Again he leaned forward, and the sparks in his eyes enlarged, and faded, as two fat women wobbled over the unsteady stones, exclaiming and balancing themselves, oblivious to the blue man and me. \"It is four o'clock,\" said one, pausing to look at her watch....", "...by faraway London. To-night the eeriness and dramatic intensity of a notable crime lay at the very doors of the village. So Tomlin was more portentous than usual; Hobbs, the butcher, more assertive, Elkin, the \"sporty\" breeder of polo ponies, more inclined to \"lay odds\" on any conceivable subject, and Siddle, the chemist, a reserved man at the best, even less disposed to voice a definite opinion. Elkin was about twenty-five years of age, Siddle looked younger than his probable <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years, while the others were on the stout and prosperous line of fifty. They were discussing the murder, of course, when Ingerman entered, and ordered a whiskey and soda. Instantly there was dead silence. Looks and furtive winks were exchanged. There had been talk of a detective being employed. Perhaps this was he. Mr. Tomlin knew the stranger's name, as he had taken a room, but that was the extent of the available information. \"A fine evenin', sir,\" said Tomlin,...", "...group is the Angel Raphael. The gateway of the palace--the Porta della Carta--was designed by Giovanni and Bartolommeo Bon, father and son, in the fourteen thirties and forties. Francesco Foscari (1423-1457) being then Doge, it is he who kneels to the lion on the relief above, and again on the balcony of the Piazzetta facade. At the summit of the portal is Justice once more, with two attendant lions, cherubs climbing to her, and live pigeons for ever nestling among them. I counted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> lions' heads in the border of the window and thirty-five in the border of the door, and these, with Foscari's one and Justice's two, and those on the shields on each side of the window, make seventy-five lions for this gateway alone. Then there are lions' heads between the circular upper arches all along each facade of the palace. It would be amusing to have an exact census of the lions of Venice, both winged and without wings. On the Grand Canal alone there must be a...", "...temper than Wilkinson, owned abundance of the offences he had been guilty of, and had designed, as he himself owned, to have robbed the Duke of Newcastle of his gaiter ornaments, as he returned from the instalment. Notwithstanding these confessions, he persisted, as well as Wilkinson, in utterly denying that he knew anything of the murder of the pensioner, and saying that he forgave William Lock who had sworn himself and them into it. Wilkinson was at the time of his execution about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-five</span> years old, and James Lincoln somewhat under. They died at the same time with the afore-mentioned malefactor, Wilson, at Tyburn. FOOTNOTES: [20] This was near Clerkenwell Green. It was a famous Bear Garden and the scene of various prize-fights to which public challenges were issued. Cunningham quotes a curious one for the year 1722:--\"I, Elizabeth Wilkinson, of Clerkenwell, having had some words with Hannah Hyfield, and requiring..."]
