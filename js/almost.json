In other industries such an emancipation was identical with the coming in of the \"trust,\" or a combination of competing manufacturers into a monopoly. As soon as the \"trust\" becomes practically the sole employer of labor in an industry, the relations between labor and capital are thrown <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invariably back into the state of affairs which characterized the merchant-capitalist system at its worst, but with one important difference. Whereas under the merchant-capitalist system the employer was _obliged_ to press down on wages and fight unionism to death owing to cut-throat competition, the \"trust,\" its strength supreme in both commodity and labor market, can do so and usually does so _of free choice_. The character of the labor struggle has been influenced by...", "...Taking the year 1913 as the base, or 100, wages in 1907 were 92 and the retail prices of food, 82, and in 1918 wages were 130 and food 168. That is, the price of food increased much more rapidly than the average union wage scale between 1907 and 1918.[9] As a result of these low earnings, the wife and children in many immigrant families have been forced into the industrial field and even then the resulting incomes have often been inadequate. The Immigration Commission found that <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> one third of the foreign-born families studied had a total family income of under five hundred dollars, and almost two thirds had incomes less than seven hundred and fifty dollars. Not only is the family income often inadequate and composite, but precarious and uncertain.

This corn is also the only provender for all their animals, be it horses, oxen, cows, hogs, or fowls, which generally run in the woods to get their food, but are fed a little of this, mornings and evenings during the winter when there is little to be had in the woods; though they are not fed too much, for the wretchedness, if not cruelty, of such living, affects both man and beast.

No indeed, she had certainly a beautiful face, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a faultless face, but how many have cursed the day when first they knew their own beauty! How many look back over pages and pages of awful crimes and shameful deeds, and the index page, the starting point, is their beautiful face. So do not be too hasty in envying the physical perfection or loveliness of others. Rejoice that you have it not; the want of it must be your salvation.

You shall be an officer in the ---- regiment, and not to lose time, go tomorrow to the fort of Belogorsk, where you will serve under Captain Mironoff, a brave and honest man. There you will see service and learn discipline. You have nothing to do here at Orenbourg, and amusements are dangerous to a young man. Today I invite you to dine with me.\" From bad to worse, thought I. What was the use of being a Sergeant in the Guards <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> from my mother's womb? To what has it led? To the regiment of ----, and an abandoned fortress on the frontier of the steppes! I dined at the General's in company with his old Aid-de-camp. Severe German economy reigned at table, and I think the fear of having an occasional guest the more had something to do with sending me to a distant garrison. The next day I took my leave of the General and set out for Belogorsk. III. THE FORTRESS. The fortress of Belogorsk is...", "...in the engine-tanks, causing endless stoppages; and of course the hot sun, pouring directly upon the roof of the cars, caused the boards thereof to curl up and twist about in such fantastic fashion, that they afforded no protection whatever to the passengers, who were obliged to resort to sunshades and umbrellas, or get under the seats. Added to this were the facts that the ice-water in the coolers scalded the mouth; the brass-work on the seats blistered the hands; and the empty stoves, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> red-hot from their exposure to the sun, superheated the cars to a degree that was maddening. Added to these was the fact that the intense heat expanded the rails until they were several miles longer than usual, and thus the passengers suffered the tortures of the transit for an increased length of time. When, at last, Mr. P. was conveyed, in a stifling hack, (the fare had risen, under the unusual circumstances, about one hundred and ten degrees,) to a stifling little room...", "...while the loss of even ten cents would be sensibly felt. His heart throbbed with excitement as he let the arrow speed on its mission. His unusual deliberation, and the fact that he was a stranger, excited strong interest, and all eyes followed the arrow with eager attentiveness. There was a sudden shout of irrepressible excitement. Carl's arrow had struck the bull's-eye and the prize was his. \"Christopher!\" exclaimed Edward Downie, \"you've beaten me, after all!\" \"I'm <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> sorry,\" said Carl, apologetically, but the light in his eyes hardly bore out the statement. \"Never mind. Everybody would have called it a fluke if I had won,\" said Edward. \"I expect to get the prize for the long jump. I am good at that.\" \"So am I, but I won't compete; I will leave it to you.\" \"No, no. I want to win fair.\" Carl accordingly entered his name. He made the second best jump, but Edward's exceeded his by a couple of inches, and the prize was adjudged to...", "...he cried warmly. But the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing and Mitya was driven off. Kalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his head, hid his face in his hands, and burst out crying. For a long while he sat like that, crying as though he were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty. Oh, he believed almost without doubt in Mitya's guilt. \"What are these people? What can men be after this?\" he exclaimed incoherently, in bitter despondency, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> despair. At that moment he had no desire to live. \"Is it worth it?

Some other trips have been planned for you, and you no doubt will spend many nights in the open air before you return to your homes this fall. I'll say no more on the subject at present.\" And Professor Zepplin steadfastly stuck to his word, leaving to their youthful imaginations the solution of the problem that he had presented. \"Get busy for firewood,\" called Lige. \"Why, it's <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> dark,\" exclaimed Ned. \"Where is that pack train? What are we going to do, Professor?\" \"Ask the guide. He knows everything.

We probably shall see nothing of Jose nor the pack train until some time to-morrow.\" \"Yes; but what are we going to do?\" demanded Walter. \"Here we are, without a thing to eat,...", "...same process been necessary at the outset of the Revolution, the colonies could scarcely have maintained the struggle. Had not Washington been at hand, accepted by the Congress and admired by the army, the virtual leader of both, the chances of success would have been slight. But he was Lincoln and Grant in one. Time and again, through the long years, it was Washington alone who brought victory from defeat. Without him the colonies might have won their independence as the result of an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> interminable guerilla warfare; but with him the fight was definite, decisive, glorious, and--for the infant republic--mercifully short. [Illustration: THE OLD NORTH BRIDGE (The Americans marched to the attack from the further side.)] [Illustration: THE MINUTE MAN By Daniel C.

His good conduct attracted the attention of the master (afterwards Captain Surridge), in whose watch he was; and upon his recommendation the captain rated him as midshipman. At this time his countenance was florid, and his appearance rather stout and athletic; but when he had been about eighteen months in India, he felt the effects of that climate, so perilous to European constitutions. The disease baffled all power of medicine; he was reduced <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to a skeleton; the use of his limbs was for some time entirely lost; and the only hope that remained was from a voyage home. Accordingly he was brought home by Captain Pigot, in the DOLPHIN; and had it not been for the attentive and careful kindness of that officer on the way, Nelson would never have lived to reach his native shores. He had formed an acquaintance with Sir Charles Pole, Sir Thomas Troubridge, and other distinguished officers, then, like himself, beginning their...", "...tapestry, which was cut to ribbons, and hanging in rags in places from sword-cuts, told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi's occupation was during his spare time. There were three family portraits on the walls a steel-clad knight, a cardinal and a judge, who were all smoking long porcelain pipes, which had been inserted into holes in the canvas, while a lady in a long, pointed waist proudly exhibited a pair of enormous mustaches, drawn with charcoal. The officers ate their breakfast <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in silence in that mutilated room, which looked dull in the rain and melancholy in its dilapidated condition, although its old oak floor had become as solid as the stone floor of an inn. When they had finished eating and were smoking and drinking, they began, as usual, to berate the dull life they were leading. The bottles of brandy and of liqueur passed from hand to hand, and all sat back in their chairs and took repeated sips from their glasses, scarcely removing from their...", "...of him in the knowledge of recent physiological discoveries. He had taken pains to become acquainted with agricultural chemistry; and the neighboring farmers owed him some useful hints about the management of their land. He renewed his old acquaintance with the classic authors. He loved to warm his pulses with Homer and calm them down with Horace. He received all manner of new books and periodicals, and gradually gained an interest in the events of the passing time. Yet he remained <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a hermit, not absolutely refusing to see his neighbors, nor even churlish towards them, but on the other hand not cultivating any intimate relations with them. He had retired from the world a young man, little more than a youth, indeed, with sentiments and aspirations all of them suddenly extinguished. The first had bequeathed him a single huge sorrow, the second a single trying duty. In due time the anguish had lost something of its poignancy, the light of earlier and...", "...means of those miracles which he had power to do._\" The greatest tribute that could have been given to the supernatural power exhibited by Apleon, was the awed silence, and the bowed heads of all who had witnessed his satanic miracle. Its effect upon Cohen and the rest of the Jews, was, if possible, greater than upon any of the Gentiles who had witnessed the wonder. Upon the awed silence there suddenly fell a deep growl of thunder. The startled people lifted their heads. With <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> an instantaneousness, the heavens darkened. It might well have been a moonless midnight, so dark did it suddenly become. The thunders roared and cannonaded, while fierce lightnings, like liquid fires, raced earthwards down the blackened heavens. No one, native of the land, or foreigner, had ever known thunder or lightning such as now broke upon them. For days afterwards men were as deaf as though born thus, stunned by the thunder; and scores lost their sight from the...", "...Omichund's garden, or of marching forward into the fort of Calcutta. Seeing that his men were fatigued, and worn out with six hours of labour and marching under the most difficult circumstances, he took the latter alternative, entered Calcutta, and then, following the stream, marched back to the camp he had left in the morning. His loss amounted to thirty-nine Europeans killed, and eighteen Sepoys; eighty-two Europeans wounded, and thirty-five Sepoys; the casualties being caused <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> entirely by the enemy's cannon. The expedition, from a military point of view, had been an entire failure. He had carried neither the battery nor Omichund's garden. Had it not been for the fog he might have succeeded in both these objects; but, upon the other hand, the enemy were as much disconcerted by the fog as he was, and were unable to use their forces with any effect. Military critics have decided that the whole operation was a mistake; but although a mistake and a...", "...could see the village of Hilton, strung upon the North Road, with its accreting suburbs; the sunset beyond, scarlet and orange, winking at him beneath brows of grey; the church; the plantations; and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms.

He tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching: how he could not leave his work, and yet did not like to go on with it; how he had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> slipped out of the tree, he was so upset; the rooks had cawed, and no wonder--it was as if rooks knew too. His mother claimed the prophetic power herself--she had seen a strange look about Mrs. Wilcox for some time. London had done the mischief, said others. She had been a kind lady; her grandmother had been kind, too--a plainer person, but very kind. Ah, the old sort was dying out! Mr. Wilcox, he was a kind gentleman. They advanced to the topic again and again, dully, but with...", "...The diplomatic difficulties which existed between the Government of the United States and that of Great Britain at the adjournment of the last Congress have been happily terminated by the appointment of a British minister to this country, who has been cordially received. Whilst it is greatly to the interest, as I am convinced it is the sincere desire, of the Governments and people of the two countries to be on terms of intimate friendship with each other, it has been our misfortune <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> always to have had some irritating, if not dangerous, outstanding question with Great Britain. Since the origin of the Government we have been employed in negotiating treaties with that power, and afterwards in discussing their true intent and meaning. In this respect the convention of April 19, 1850, commonly called the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, has been the most unfortunate of all, because the two Governments place directly opposite and contradictory constructions upon its...", "...of etiquette, let herself be lifted into these strange arms. The waltz made her little heart beat, her pale cheeks grew rosy, she pressed Entragues hand and in the boldness of pleasure let her bent and radiant head fall on his shoulder.

Towards two o'clock, he resisted Calixte Heliot who discreetly tried to draw him away. Later, he saw Moscowitch, after consulting his watch, disappear into the antechamber.

The effect on Morris was as it had been on Mrs. Brandon--the actual deed was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> lost sight of in the sudden light that it threw on his passion. From the very first the most appealing element of her attraction to him had been her loneliness, the neglect from which she suffered, the need she had of comfort. He saw her as a woman who, for twenty years, had had no love, although in her very nature she had hungered for it; and if she had not been treated with actual cruelty, at least she had been so basely neglected that cruelty was not far away. It was not...", "...durability. It has exceptional vitality and recuperative power. Its long life probably is due to the fact that it is almost immune from insect pests, the most deadly enemies of all other kinds of trees. Men, fire, and lightning are the worst enemies of the Big Tree. Most of the old ones have had their heads shattered by lightning again and again, but they still insist on living and will produce a new top even though the old one is entirely smashed off. These trees appear to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> immortal. Unless they starve or meet a violent death, they live on and on. John Muir says that the wood in the Big Trees has an endurance almost equal to that of granite, and gives the following illustration. He cut a piece of sound wood from the trunk of a fallen monarch that had been lying upon the earth several hundred years. In falling, the trunk of this Big Tree was cracked across in a number of places. Into these cracks fire ate its way each time a forest fire swept the...", "...upper part of New Orleans, the boys were disposed to gaze at the strangely beautiful city. It was greater in size than any city that they had ever seen; for none of them had visited Cincinnati, though they had lived all their lives within sixty or seventy miles of it. New Orleans was different in architecture, situation, and everything else from Louisville and Memphis, cities at which they had looked up from the river, while at New Orleans they found themselves looking down, and taking <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a bird's-eye view of the city. Then, too, the palm gardens, the evergreen trees, and glimpses every now and then of great parterres of flowers, growing gayly in the open air even in late autumn, filled them with the feeling that somehow they had come into a world quite different from any they had ever dreamed of before. Finally, there were the miles of levee, thickly bordered with steamships and sailing craft of every kind, all so new to them as to be a show in their eyes....", "...lips to sing their loveliness to others, and also with eyes and ears and lips just as keen to distinguish and just as hold to denounce the sights and sounds that are unlovely;--and this man, with his ringing laugh and his springing step, walks cheerily to and fro in his daily work, striking the rocks here and there by the way-side with his bright steel hammer, eliciting a shower of sparks from each, and then on to the next.

The fabric may be slightly ravelled at the...", "...'Then now is the time to return it,' he answered briskly, and as if that settled the matter. I could not refrain from laughing. 'Nay, but I have still an excuse,' I said. 'I am barely recovered from an illness, and am weak. Even so, I should be loth to decline a combat with some; but a better man than I may give the wall to M. de Crillon and suffer no disgrace.' 'Oh, if you put it that way--enough said,' he answered in a tone of disappointment. 'And, to be sure, the light is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> gone. That is a comfort. But you will not refuse to drink a cup of wine with me? Your voice I remember, though I cannot say who you are or what service I did you. For the future, however, count on me. I love a man who is brave as well as modest, and know no better friend than a stout swordsman.' I was answering him in fitting terms--while the fickle crowd, which a few minutes earlier had been ready to tear me, viewed us from a distance with respectful homage--when the masked...", "...rocks as if they had been so many wild cats.

Hungarian dogs, that's what you are!\" shouted Libor, \"and I am a KnA(C)z of his Highness, the Grand Khan Oktai, and I shall spit every man of you!\" So saying, he hurried away, and was lost in the throng. CHAPTER XII. DEFENDING THE CASTLE. A few moments later the small garrison of brave men were all on the walls, and so placed behind the breastwork as to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invisible from below. All stood motionless; not an arrow was discharged, not a stone hurled. The castle was to all appearance dead. All at once there was a terrific roar from the enemy, which awoke countless echoes among the rocks. But it was no battle-cry of the Tartars or Mongols, for they rush to the fray in silence, without uttering a sound. This was like the wild yell of all sorts of people, a mixture of howls and cries, almost more like those of wild animals than of...", "...love where it is better not to marry?\" thought he. \"Where, for instance, there is a difference of age perhaps, or where there has been some other and earlier attachment?\" \"I mean,\" said Amy, as if answering his thoughts, \"that there may sometimes be reasons why even lovers should not marry--reasons which every noble man and woman understand; and therefore I do not agree with you that it is always a pity for a girl not to be married.\" Lawrence Newt said nothing. Amy Waring's voice <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> trembled with emotion, for she knew that her companion might easily misunderstand what she said; and yet there was no way to help it. At any rate, thought she, he will see that I do not mean to drop into his arms. They walked silently on. The people in the street passed them like spectres. The great city hummed around them unheard. Lawrence Newt said to himself, half bitterly, \"So you have waked up at last, have you? You have found that because a beautiful young woman is kind...", "...was to pass on to the support of his van division; which, from the length of time they had been engaged, he judged might be in want of it. The casual position, however, of the rear ships of his van division prevented his executing this plan. The admiral, therefore, ordered the Excellent, the leading ship of his own division, to bear up; and, with the Victory, he himself passed to leeward of the enemy's rearmost and leewardmost ships; which, though <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> silenced in their fire, continued obstinately to resist the animated attack of all their opponents. \"Captain Collingwood, in the Excellent, in obedience to the admiral's orders, passed between the two rearmost ships of the enemy's line; giving to the one most to windward, a seventy-four, so effectual a broadside, in addition to what had been done before, that her captain was induced to submit. The Excellent, afterwards, bore down on the...", "...almost an hour later, he heard them both laughing long before he came into view, and on the way back up the hill the girl detailed for him much of her conversation with Fat Joe. \"Hereafter I shall be more dignified when in your presence,\" she informed him in as deep a bass as she could summon. \"I had no idea how great and important a man was escorting me when I came down this hill! But Mr. Morgan has enlightened me.\" With that she discovered that she could still tease him, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as easily as she had teased the sturdy small boy of the uncouth shoes and napping trousers. \"Joe is necessarily prejudiced in his opinion,\" he argued, \"and therefore shouldn't be taken too seriously.\" \"He told me that you had one regrettable characteristic, however,\" the girl went on. \"He lamented your strength at the ancient and honorable pastime of stud-poker! And he also bewails your taste in literature. Why, he tells me that you are indicted to Dickens and Dumas--he...", "...required to be delivered on the following day. My route lay over the Soutra Hill; and had the weather kept up, my task was easy of accomplishment--so I cheerily plodded on, counting my gains; but scarce had I reached the ascent, when the wind began to moan along the dreary waste, and thin flakes of snow to fall, while the blast, from the east, blew right in my face. I quickened my pace; but the storm increased before I reached the top, the drifting snow blinding me, and the fitful gusts <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> lifting me off my feet. Cold and biting as was the air, I was wet with perspiration, from my load and my struggles against the blast. I could not see two yards before me; I was truly alone in the howling waste, yet I yielded not to despondency, but struggled on for life. I had, it seemed, deviated from the road, for all was now a trackless waste, when suddenly I stumbled and fell on the edge of a declivity, and my pack, the whole of my wealth, bounded from me, in what direction...", "...here day after day, as an angel, to visit a suffering creature, and bring balm to a wretched sinner.\" The last word was unheard by Miles; he stood beside Minnie, whose face was covered by a deep blush. \"This,\" he said, \"has been a day of much surprise, if of sorrow too; I came, expecting every hand and heart against me--every hand cold, every heart stone; I have met two generous ones, or faces are sad traitors. Forgive me, Miss Dalzell, but in your home, the bitterest against me, the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> dwelling-place of Marmaduke Burton, my _worthy_ cousin, I scarcely expected to find a bosom with human blood in it; a thousand, and a thousand thanks for Mary's sake.\" \"Mr. Tremenhere has been intimate with my thoughts for some time,\" answered Minnie more calmly, \"and believe me as friend, not foe.\" \"Indeed!\" and a bright glowing look was fixed in her face, \"I never dreamed of a personal friend at Gatestone, even in thought. This is truly the prodigal's welcome home! May I...", "...and no one spoke until they leached the Palazzo Montevarchi. Explanations were impossible, and every one was too much absorbed by the danger of the situation to speak of anything else. When they were a few steps from the gate Corona stopped. \"You may leave us here,\" she said coldly, addressing Gouache. \"But, princess, I will see you home,\" protested the latter, somewhat surprised by her tone. \"No--I will take a servant back with me. Will you be good enough to leave us?\" she asked <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> haughtily, as Gouache still lingered. He had no choice but to obey her commands, though for some time he could not explain to himself the cause of the princess's behaviour. \"Goodnight, Madame. Good-night, Mademoiselle,\" he said, quietly. Then with a low bow he turned away and disappeared in the darkness. In five minutes he had reached the bridge, running at the top of his speed, and he regained his post without his absence having been observed. When the two women were...", "...by the fraudulent representations and acts of the Boer commander into surrendering the fort at Potchefstroom daring the armistice. One of the first acts of the Triumvirate was to despatch a large force from Heidelberg with orders to advance into Natal Territory, and seize the pass over the Drakensberg known as Lang's Nek, so as to dispute the advance of any relieving column. This movement was promptly executed, and strong Boer troops patrolled Natal country <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> up to Newcastle. The news of the outbreak, followed as it was by that of the Bronker's Spruit massacre, and Captain Elliot's murder, created a great excitement in Natal. All available soldiers were at once despatched up country, together with a naval brigade, who, on arrival at Newcastle, brought up the strength of the Imperial troops of all arms to about a thousand men. On the 10th January Sir George Colley left Maritzburg to join the force at Newcastle, but at this time...", "...the country and ranged on both sides of the street. Here the gardeners make lively sales, as the displays are often fine in themselves, and show to a special advantage in the flaring torchlight. The eager venders, who do all they can to call the attention of the crowd to their wares, make many good bargains. The purchase requires skill on both sides, for flower men are proverbial in their high charges, asking often five and ten times the real value of a plant, but coming down in price <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> immediately on remonstrance. You ask the price of a dwarf wistaria growing in a pot. The man answers at once, \"Two dollars.\" \"Two dollars!\" you answer in surprise, \"it is not worth more than thirty or forty cents.\" \"Seventy-five, then,\" he will respond; and thus the buyer and seller approach nearer in price, until the bargain is struck somewhere near the first price offered. Price another plant and there would be the same process to go over again; but as the evening passes,...", "...even for your own good.\" \"Never fear, Mary. Repaired. Carry six comfortably,\" reassured Williams in a tremendous mutter, like a bull. \"But why can't you give them one of the others, Owen? That big one there?\" \"Nonsense, Mary. Never see boat again. Wouldn't grudge it. Only Sebright is quite right. Didn't you hear what Sebright said? Very sensible. Ask Sebright. He will explain to you again.\" It was Sebright, with his asperity and his tact, with fits of brusqueness subdued by an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> affectionate contempt, who conducted all their affairs, as I have seen a trustworthy and experienced old nurse rule the infinite perplexities of a room full of children. His clear-sightedness and mental grip seemed independent of age and experience, like the ability of genius. He had an imaginative eye for detail, and, starting from a mere hint, would go scheming onwards with astonishing precision. His plan, to which we were committed--committed helplessly and without...", "...when a coach happened to be late. I grew so accustomed to the disappointment of seeing no familiar figure among the passengers alighting, that sometimes I felt as if Phil's letter were a delusion and he never would appear. But one evening as I stared as usual with the crowd in the coach yard, and had watched three portly strangers already emerge from the open door to the steps, and was prepared for the accustomed sinking of my heart, what did that heart do but give a great bound so as <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to choke me! There he was in the doorway, the same old Phil, with the same kindly face. I rushed forward. Before I reached him, he had turned around toward the inside of the coach, as if he would help some one out after him. \"Some decrepit fellow traveller,\" thought I, and looked up indifferently to see what sort of person it might be: and there, as I live, stepping out from the coach, and taking his offered hand, was Fanny!

When school was out he declined the invitation of the boys to walk with them, and settled himself in his chair as though he meant to prepare the lessons for the next day.

As he neared the spot where he had come on the girl, he <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> expected to find her propped against the rock as he had found her the afternoon before. He was conscious of a distinct shock of loneliness that she was not there. The woods had never appeared so empty; the soughing of the pines had never sounded so dreary. He threw himself down on the thick brown carpet. He had not felt so lonely in years. What was he! And what chance did he have! He was alone in the wilderness. He had been priding himself on being the superior of those...", "...the desired effect. The landlord became expansive in his slow way, and showed me all over the premises of his quaint and rambling dwelling. It was a wild and fantastic spot, an ancient haunt of smugglers and wreckers, I learnt. The back-yard opened straight into the short pneumatic turf above the cliffs, the brink of which was not more than two hundred yards away. Here the stream, which flowed past the inn, descended in a series of miniature cataracts to a tiny cove of deep-green water, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> enclosed by two towering precipices, crowned with jagged spires and pinnacles of rock.

So deep-seated is this conviction in the popular belief, that one is deemed chargeable with temerity, if not something worse, who would call its grounds in question.

The liability of papers to decay, in respect of the fibrous composition, is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in direct proportion to the severity of the chemical treatment necessary to convert the raw material into cellulose, and the extent of the deviation of the fibre from pure cellulose is a measure of the degradation which is to be expected.

Six months before this date a scene, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> similar in its mechanical parts, had been enacted at Hintock House. It was between a pair of persons most intimately connected in their lives with these. Outwardly like as it had been, it was yet infinite in spiritual difference, though a woman's devotion had been common to both. Grace rose from her attitude of affection, and, bracing her energies, saw that something practical must immediately be done. Much as she would have liked, in the emotion of the moment, to keep him...", "...a happy home!' CHAPTER X A considerable period of inaction followed among all concerned. Nothing tended to dissipate the obscurity which veiled the life of the Baron. The position he occupied in the minds of the country-folk around was one which combined the mysteriousness of a legendary character with the unobtrusive deeds of a modern gentleman. To this day whoever takes the trouble to go down to Silverthorn in Lower Wessex and make inquiries will find existing there <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a superstitious feeling for the moody melancholy stranger who resided in the Lodge some forty years ago. Whence he came, whither he was going, were alike unknown. It was said that his mother had been an English lady of noble family who had married a foreigner not unheard of in circles where men pile up 'the cankered heaps of strange-achieved gold'--that he had been born and educated in England, taken abroad, and so on. But the facts of a life in such cases are of little...", "...and make Emile's coming to Sicily a little festa. Don't think I imagine you are personally delighted at his coming, though I am sure you are delighted at his recovery. He is my old friend, not yours, and I am not such a fool as to suppose that you can care for him at all as I do, who have known him intimately and proved his loyalty and his nobility of nature. But I think, I am certain, Maurice, that you will make his coming a festa for my sake. He has suffered very much. He is as weak <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as a child still. There's something tremendously pathetic in the weakness of body of a man so brilliant in mind, so powerful of soul. It goes right to my heart as I think it would go to yours. Let us make his return to life beautiful and blessed. Sha'n't we? Put flowers in the rooms for me, won't you? Make them look homey. Put some books about. But I needn't tell you.

And, as she had told Kester, the necessity of giving the little girl a daily walk was very much lightened by the great love and affection which Jeremiah Foster now bore to the child. Ever since the day when the baby had come to his knee, allured by the temptation of his watch, he had apparently considered her as in some sort belonging to him; and now he had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> come to think that he had a right to claim her as his companion in his walk back from the Bank to his early dinner, where a high chair was always placed ready for the chance of her coming to share his meal. On these occasions he generally brought her back to the shop-door when he returned to his afternoon's work at the Bank. Sometimes, however, he would leave word that she was to be sent for from his house in the New Town, as his business at the Bank for that day was ended....", "...lad hugged certain plans for future worldwide travel to his heart, all of which, while extremely visionary at present, would be easily possible when his \"ship came home,\" and that rich copper deposit cropped up before his eager eyes. Few boys there be who fail to have a hobby of some sort--with some it is the pretty general craze for stamp collecting, others go in for coins, autographs, birds' eggs, specimens of birds, weapons of worldwide people, rabbits, pigeons--well, the list is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> inexhaustible, when you come to think of it. Cuthbert's weakness, as has already been seen, lay in the line of travel and exploration, and the chances were that as he grew older he would develop into a bona fide Livingstone or a Stanley, eager to see faraway lands where the feet of a white man had probably never before wandered, and the mystery of which he might be the very first to unearth. With Eli it was copper, morning, noon and night; he asked a thousand questions...", "...with closed ears, as heretofore, then we warn you that there is no rigor, nor cruelty, however great, which you are not to expect by laying waste, starvation, and the sword, in such manner that nowhere shall remain a relic of that which at present exists, but his Majesty will strip bare and utterly depopulate the land, and cause it to be inhabited again by strangers; since otherwise his Majesty could not believe that the will of God and of his Majesty had been accomplished.\" It is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> superfluous to add that this circular remained fruitless. The royal wrath, thus blasphemously identifying itself with divine vengeance, inspired no terror, the royal blandishments no affection. The next point of attack was the city of Alkmaar, situate quite at the termination of the Peninsula, among the lagunes and redeemed prairies of North Holland. The Prince of Orange had already provided it with a small garrison. The city had been summoned to surrender by the middle of...", "...highest natures moving towards this goal; I can imagine over what abysses and through what temptations this procession travels. Who would dare to be so bold as to join in it?\" At this point the philosopher's companion again turned to him and said: \"Don't be angry with me when I tell you that I too have a somewhat similar feeling, which I have not mentioned to you before. When talking to you I often felt drawn out of myself, as it were, and inspired with your ardour and hopes till I <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> forgot myself. Then a calmer moment arrives; a piercing wind of reality brings me back to earth--and then I see the wide gulf between us, over which you yourself, as in a dream, draw me back again. Then what you call 'culture' merely totters meaninglessly around me or lies heavily on my breast: it is like a shirt of mail that weighs me down, or a sword that I cannot wield.\" Our minds, as we thus argued with the philosopher, were unanimous, and, mutually encouraging and...", "...territory of Shendi. The cultivable land reaches generally to the distance of one or two miles from the river.

Berber also raises great numbers of horned cattle, sheep, goats, camels, asses, and very fine horses. It is very populous, the succession of villages being <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> continued along the road on both sides of the river.

McCoy looked at his watch. \"I must go,\" he said. \"It's <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> time to blow the whistle.

Up to the time of James the First, society amongst ourselves wore a picturesque and even a scenical exterior: but the inner life and its pulsations had not then been revealed. Great passions were required to stir the freezing waters; so that certain kinds of comedy, in which such passions are inappropriate, could not then exist. And partly to this case it was amongst the early Romans, united with the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> Asiatic seclusion from social meetings of female influence or in any virtual sense even of female presence, that we must ascribe the meagreness of the true social interest, and of the dialogue exhibited by Plautus.

But in this wilderness of rock-strewn barrens and thick forest it would take at least two. Leaving notice of his having occupied the cabin by marking a clean board with a charred ember, McTavish set forth again, and by the hardest kind of work covered fifty miles the first day. The second morning, finding caribou tracks, he delayed his departure until he...", "...[65] Les Allies et les Etats-Unis envisagent le ravitaillement de l'Allemagne, pendant l'armistice, dans la mesure reconnue necessaire. Even by the end of November it had become apparent to all intelligent observers on the ground and to many outside Germany that such provisioning was urgently necessary, and that if it did not come at once the result would be a spread of Bolshevism which would endanger all Europe. Allied journalists in Germany were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a unit in recognizing the dangers and demands of the situation, but they were greatly hampered in their efforts to picture the situation truthfully by the sentiments prevailing in their respective countries as a result of the passions engendered by the conflict so lately ended. This was in the highest degree true as to the Americans, which was especially regrettable and unfortunate in view of the fact that America was the only power possessing a surplus of immediately available...", "...it put his strength of mind to the test when he found himself courted and observed by the most distinguished and the most formidable personages of the day. Lady Holland listened to him with unwonted deference, and scolded him with a circumspection that was in itself a compliment.

He was treated with <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> fatherly kindness by the able and worthy man who is still remembered by the name of Conversation Sharp. Indeed, his deference for the feelings of all whom he liked and respected, which an experienced observer could detect beneath the eagerness of his manner and the volubility of his talk, made him a favourite among those of a generation above his own. He bore his honours quietly, and enjoyed them with the natural and hearty pleasure of a man who has a taste for society, but...", "...over the Ice Barrier. There was teeming life on the ice. Wherever we turned we saw great herds of seals -- Weddells and crab-eaters. The great sea-leopard, which we had seen occasionally on the floes, was not to be found here. During our whole stay in the Bay of Whales we did not see a single specimen of it. Nor did we ever see the Ross seal. Penguins had not shown themselves particularly often, only a few here and there; but we appreciated them all the more. The few we saw were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all Ad\u00e9lie penguins. While we were at work making the ship fast, a flock of them suddenly shot up out of the water and on to the ice. They looked about them in surprise for a moment: men and ships do not come their way every day. But it seemed as if their astonishment soon gave way to a desire to see what was happening. They positively sat and studied all our movements. Only now and then they grunted a little and took a turn over the ice.

They are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invariably difficult to use, for as the dressing-rooms are usually allotted by men, there is little consideration of women's comfort in this matter. It is a curious side-light on the intelligence of men that they almost universally seem to think that women, by a special Providence, are exempt from these natural laws; and almost all women are still too Early Victorian to insist upon some change. Many of the old theatres in London and the provinces suffer from want of proper...", "...should they prove victorious in any war that might ensue. Sir Edward Goschen proceeded to put a very pertinent question: I questioned his Excellency about the French colonies-- What are the French colonies?

Let me come to what, in my mind, personally, has always been the crucial and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the governing consideration, namely, the position of the small States: As regards Holland, however, his Excellency said that so long as Germany's adversaries respected the integrity and neutrality of the Netherlands, Germany was ready to give His Majesty's Government an assurance that she would do likewise. Then we come to Belgium: It depended upon the action of France what operations Germany might be forced to enter upon in Belgium, but, when the war...", "...The treaty required, with questionable wisdom, that a constitution should be established, and this was accordingly done; but its practical value was trifling. The constitution, voted by a constituent assembly in 1817 and applied in the following year, placed the administration in the hands of a senate of six members and a legislative assembly of forty members; but the real authority was vested in the high commissioner, who was able directly to prevent anything, and indirectly to effect <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> anything. Sir Thomas Maitland was not slow to exercise the control thus permitted him, though on the whole he did so for the benefit of the islands. The construction of roads, the abolition of direct taxes and of the system of farming the church lands, the securing of impartial administration of justice, and the establishment of educational institutions are among the services ascribed to his efforts.

The services at the church on the Sunday morning following the assassination were most solemn and impressive. The little edifice was crowded <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to suffication, and when the pastor was seen slowly ascending the pulpit, breathless silence prevailed. He was pale and haggard, and appeared to be suffering great mental agony. With bowed head and uplifted hands, and with a voice trembling with almost uncontrollable emotion, he delivered one of the most fervent and impressive invocations ever heard by the audience. Had the dead body of the president been placed in front of the altar, the solemnity of the occasion could not have...", "...Molly gave Kate a beaming look of gratitude. She then hurried off to the bathroom, had a good wash, and afterward dressed herself quickly. As she did so, she could not help rejoicing that Kate had taken her up. \"I begin to fall in love with her,\" thought Molly; \"it must be that Irish way of hers. She is so frank, and her eyes have such a delicious sparkle in them; then her voice--it has so many notes in it. It can be daring, and mischievous, and mirthful, and tender, and solemn <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in the same sentence. Yes, I am quite certain that I shall love Kate very dearly. If Cecil should not come--if anything prevents my father doing what I have begged of him to do, then, perhaps Kate will be my friend; but oh, of course, I can never put anyone before Cecil.\" Molly was dressed and had put her little room in order before the second gong, which was to summon the inmates of St. Dorothy's to breakfast, sounded through the house.

When Frank got to school he noticed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> at once that Mr. Collins seemed somewhat disturbed. He barely bade Frank good morning. When a teacher prides himself on the fact that his class bears the highest reputation in the school for deportment and application, of course he feels it keenly if one of his best boys is the subject of criticism and veiled accusations.

This pond had been planted around and through with silver-weed, thrumwort and sun-clew, water-lilies, arrow-head, and the rare double frog-bit, and other aquatic plants, some of them brought from a long distance. At one end there was a grotto, cased with fantastic porous stone, and inside it a small fountain played. But now the fountain was silent, and the pond shrunk <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to its centre. The silver eels which once had abounded here, finding their element likely to fail, made a migration, one dewy night, overland to the lake below. The fish, in vain envy of that great enterprise, huddled together in the small wet space which remained, with their back-fins here and there above water. When any one came near, they dashed away, as I have seen grey mullet do in the shallow sea-side pools. Several times I had water poured in for their benefit, but it...", "...He gulped down the rest of his coffee and glanced at his watch. It was shortly after one. He must stay down here another half-hour--stay around these streets where he had walked with her and where she had made him see straight--until he had just time to meet Frances. He went out and walked past the office of Carter, Rand & Seagraves, and then walked to the Elevated station where she took the train at night for home. The sight of the steps up which they had climbed together made him <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> homesick. He wished to Heaven that she had postponed her vacation another day. If only he could see her a few minutes right now, he would be absolutely sure of himself. It was after two when he reached the house, but Frances was not ready. She was never quite ready. \"I'll wait outside,\" he told the maid. The maid raised her brows a trifle, but answered civilly:-- \"Very well, sir.\" As he walked back and forth the Stuyvesant machine also drew up before the door and...", "...our boys lying in the bottom of the trench, evidently hit only a few minutes before. The poor chap was dead, but curiously enough we could only find one wound--that in his shoulder. He must have been killed by the shock of the explosion. The T.M. had burst about five feet from him. In my experience this has seldom happened, but I understand there are many authenticated cases. As in the infantry, the majority of our casualties occurred from day to day, from one to two or three and more <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> daily. At any rate it does not take long in every-day trench warfare to lose half of any company. At other times, when, for instance, troops are relieving other units in the trenches, or perhaps in large parties at crossroads coming up, the casualties from shelling are very large. One night in Flanders a party of our men were going up the communication-trench when a Boche five-point nine (5.9) burst on the parapet near them. Of this small party of thirty, only fifteen went on...", "...indicated, and carefully, almost fastidiously dressed, and he could not deny himself this last look into the mirror, even though he was now five minutes late with his appointment.

He searched for it frenziedly, cursing lowly, but none the less viciously. It was quite by accident that when his patience was strained <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the breaking point, he struck his hand against a board that formed part of the partition between his building and the courthouse next door, and tore a huge chunk of skin from the knuckles. He paid little attention to the injury, however, for the agitating of the board disclosed the glittering recreant, and he pounced upon it with the precision of a hawk upon its prey, snarling triumphantly. \"I'll nail that damned board up, some day!\" he threatened.

As soon as his apprenticeship had expired Hansard started for London with only a guinea in his pocket, and became a compositor in the office of John Hughs (1703-1771), printer to the House of Commons.

I knew that this must be the burial place of the elephants and they had brought me here to show me that I could get vast quantities of ivory without killing any more elephants. I went back to the city and told my master all that had happened. He was overjoyed at my escape from death and the riches which I had obtained for him. As a reward for my services he set me free and promised to send me home as soon as the trade winds...", "...breath. Even when she came out among the birches by Clinch's Dump she was breathing evenly and without distress. She ran to the kitchen door but did not enter.

But dawn was not very far away and there remained little time for the taking alive of a dangerous man. Where two enormous pines grew close together near a sapling, she knelt down, and, with both hands, scooped out a big hollow in the immemorial layers of pine needles. Here she placed her trap. It took all her strength and skill to set it; to fasten the chain around the base of the sapling pine. And now, working with only the faintest glimmer of her torch, she...", "...had crept up almost to the base of the rocks, and on another side there was--still worse--a camp of German prisoners, with armed sentries supervising their labours; yet even there, close above such scenes, were growing plants which might mark a memorable day in the annals of a flower-lover, notably the maiden pink and the milk-thistle--the \"holy\" thistle, as it is not inaptly called. The pinks, a lovely band, were sprinkled along the turf at the foot of the rocks; the thistles were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> at the top; between them on a stony ledge nestled a quantity of viper's bugloss, and with it some borage, two kindred plants which I had never before seen in company. Nearly all the members of the Borage group are interesting--lungwort, alkanet, forget-me-not, hound's-tongue, and bugloss--but the borage itself, a roadside weed in South Europe, and in this country merely an immigrant and \"casual,\" is to me the most precious of all.

Modern arms require open order, and they are at the same time of such terrible power that against them too often discipline is broken. What is the solution? Have your combatants opened out? Have them well acquainted with each other so as to have unity. Have reserves to threaten with, held with an iron hand. Modern weapons have a terrible effect and are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unbearable by the nervous system. Who can say that he has not been frightened in battle? Discipline in battle becomes the more necessary as the ranks become more open, and the material cohesion of the ranks not giving confidence, it must spring from a knowledge of comrades, and a trust in officers, who must always be present and seen.

The true aspect of the place, especially of the house there in which he had lived as a child, the fashion of its doors, its hearths, its windows, the very scent upon the air of it, was with him in sleep for a season; only, with tints more musically blent on wall [173] and floor, and some finer light and shadow running in and out along its curves and angles, and with all its little carvings daintier. He awoke with a sigh at the thought of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> thirty years which lay between him and that place, yet with a flutter of pleasure still within him at the fair light, as if it were a smile, upon it. And it happened that this accident of his dream was just the thing needed for the beginning of a certain design he then had in view, the noting, namely, of some things in the story of his spirit--in that process of brain-building by which we are, each one of us, what we are. With the image of the place so clear and favourable...", "...her. Then the bell tolled again, and the train slid slowly out of the station with its lights flashing upon the snow. Agatha turned away abruptly and walked a little apart from the rest. The thing, she felt, admitted of only one explanation. Sproatly's diplomacy had had a most unfortunate result, and she was sensible of an intolerable disgust. She had kept faith with Gregory, at least as far as it was possible, and he had utterly humiliated her. The affront he had put upon her was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unbearable. In the meanwhile, Mrs. Hastings walked up to Sproatly, who, feeling distinctly uncomfortable, had drawn back judiciously into the shadow. \"Now,\" she said, \"I understand. You, of course, anticipated this.\" \"I didn't,\" declared Sproatly with a decision which carried conviction with it. \"I certainly saw them at the hotel, but how could I imagine that they had anything of the kind in view?\" He broke off for a moment, and waved his hand. \"After all,\" he added,...", "...it would comprehend the white slaves as well as black, who were imported from all the goals of Europe; wretches, convicted of the most flagrant crimes, were brought in and sold without any duty whatever.

Mr. Tucker (of S.C.) thought it unfair to bring in such an important subject at the time when debate was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> precluded. The committee had gone through the impost bill, and the whole Union were impatiently expecting the result of their deliberations, the public must be disappointed and much revenue lost, or this question cannot undergo that full discussion which it deserves.

It is a swift clear river, fed in its upper reaches by numerous mountain streams.

I love him awfully; and he loves me.\" He was sorry he had said so much. He hadn't meant to say anything before his interview with Lassigny. But the idea that by a miracle Lassigny might prove himself worthy of her had faded; and her <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> indifference towards him had made it not painful, as it would have been the night before, to throw a shadow over her expectations. \"You're very young,\" he said. \"In any case I couldn't let you marry yet.\" \"I was afraid you'd say that,\" she said quietly. \"Rene said you wouldn't.

Certain that she was beautiful, he had scarcely allowed that to occupy him. His experience had led him to estimate people <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> wholly by their ability to be open-minded. In his struggle against blindness, he had concluded that open minds were rare indeed, and persons who limited his freedom of action or tended to baby him he had grown to dismiss with a shrug.

These were the text for all the subsequent doings of the Convention. The so-called New Jersey plan was brought forward on June 15th, the gist of it being a recurrence to the foolish idea of merely repairing the Confederation that then was.

It could only be one of two to dismay him so; there had been only two on the ferry whose rescue he had feared; only two who, living, he would have let lie upon this beach which he had chosen and set aside for his patrol, while he waited for him to die!

Mary, therefore, was the last of the exclusively Scottish line.

These rooms are called Queen Mary's rooms, and almost every body who visits Scotland goes to see them. The reason why the rooms which Mary occupied in the Palace of Holyrood were left as they were, and never occupied by any other person after Mary went away, was principally that a dreadful murder was committed there just before Mary quitted them. This, of course, connected very gloomy associations with the palace;...", "...the promontory, and immediately settled down again. The glimpse was sufficient however, and the good steamer was at once headed westward, for the mouth of the Peiho river, and bowled along fearlessly on her way. As the sun rose higher the mist was dispersed, and the bold rugged outline of the Shantung coast was unveiled before us. The clear blue water was alive with Chinese coasting craft, small and large, of most picturesque appearance. The heavy, unwieldy junks of northern China lay <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> motionless, their widespread sails hanging idly to the mast, for there was just wind enough to ripple the surface of the water in long patches, leaving large spaces of glassy smoothness untouched by the breeze. The crews of the northern junks are hardy stalwart fellows, inured to labour, and zealous in their work. Their vessels are built very low-sided, to enable them to be propelled by oars when the wind fails them. The crews work cheerily at their oars, both night and day,...", "...like an arrow. My desire to ride the flume died then and there, though even yet I couldn't help regretting that there wasn't a level stretch above the jump-off, where a man could check his headway and crawl out.

There was, it is true, a couple of hundred yards of perhaps five per cent. grade between the first steep pitch over the edge of the cliff, and a second one, even steeper, that seemed to run <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> directly upon the roaring, churning mass of cane-crushing machinery that began at the upper end of the big mill. Even there the water was lightning-swift, however, so that a man, once over the edge of the first pitch, looked to be less than a thousand-to-one shot in bringing up before going on into the second. And that would have been--how was it the manager put it?--more \"spoiled sugar\"--another \"jolly costly accident for the company.\" The bridle-path I had been following...", "...\"Pardon me,\" said he: \"I offer you marriage.\" And leaning back in his chair he replaced his cigar between his lips. I own I was confounded by an offer, not only so unprepared, but couched in terms so singular. But he knew very well how to obtain his purposes, for he was not only handsome in person, but his very coolness had a charm; and to make a long story short, a fortnight later I became the wife of the Honourable Henry Luxmore. For nearly twenty years I now led a life of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> perfect quiet. My Henry had his weaknesses; I was twice driven to flee from his roof, but not for long; for though he was easily over-excited, his nature was placable below the surface, and, with all his faults, I loved him tenderly. At last he was taken from me; and such is the power of self-deception, and so strange are the whims of the dying, he actually assured me, with his latest breath, that he forgave the violence of my temper!

I received two hundred dollars for my share, and the forgeries were not discovered until a long time had elapsed, and when it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> impossible to obtain any information concerning them. To this day I don't believe that any of the officers of the two banks have the slightest idea as to how the thing was done. Soon after this forgery, Johnson left Geneva and located at St. Louis, where he still resides.

After a few glasses, we had a great deal of conversation; I again brought the subject of marriage and love, divine love, upon the carpet, but Francis <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> immediately begged me to drop it; and on my having the delicacy to comply, he reverted to dog-fighting, on which he talked well and learnedly; amongst other things, he said that it was a princely sport of great antiquity, and quoted from Quintus Curtius to prove that the princes of India must have been of the fancy, they having, according to that author, treated Alexander to a fight between certain dogs and a lion.

One scheme alone suggested itself for the preservation of his authority: it was dangerous, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> desperate; but loss of power was more dreaded by Dudley than any degree of hazard to others or himself; and he resolved at all adventures to make the attempt. By means of the new honors which he had caused to be conferred on the marquis of Dorset, now duke of Suffolk, he engaged this weak and inconsiderate man to give his eldest daughter, the lady Jane Grey, in marriage to his fourth son Guildford Dudley. At the same time he procured an union between her sister, the lady...", "...long, but went home to bed in order to be up early the next day. We had no difficulty in finding work, and my third morning in New York found me at a table rolling cigars. I worked steadily for some weeks, at the same time spending my earnings between the \"crap\" game and the \"Club.\" Making cigars became more and more irksome to me; perhaps my more congenial work as a \"reader\" had unfitted me for work at the table. And, too, the late hours I was keeping made such a sedentary occupation <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> beyond the powers of will and endurance. I often found it hard to keep my eyes open and sometimes had to get up and move around to keep from falling asleep. I began to miss whole days from the factory, days on which I was compelled to stay at home and sleep.

Philip was lifted up, and the Man kissed him, which he had never done before, and said something which Philip did not understand, but which made Nanny cry. Philip cried, too, when he was taken back to the nursery, and Nanny endeavoured to comfort him by giving him an egg with his tea. But Philip would only eat the top.

If the rottenness of the bone demonstrates that the limb cannot be saved, which <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> always happens, if the patient has been improperly treated, we must amputate, if the strength of the patient be sufficient to support this dreadful expedient, and amputate on the sound parts. It is true, that amputation in this case is a doubtful remedy, but nevertheless as there is no other, and as there is no symptom in the patient that forbids its use, it is a remedy. If the patient be weak, the case is desperate, as he is not able to support the operation on the sound parts,...", "...upon the docile friend of man! We started for the unknown with a caravan of six sleighs in all, of which two were loaded down with food and baggage. The night of our departure, February 21st, was fine, and a crowd assembled in front of our host's house to bid us farewell. But although long and lingering cheers followed us out of the city, I fancy many of these well-wishers regarded us more in the light of harmless lunatics than as pioneers of a great railway which may one day <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> encircle the world. Just before our departure (which was preceded by a dinner-party), a picturesque but rather trying ceremony took place. Farewells having been said we retired to don our furs and were entering the sleds when our hostess recalled us from the frosty night air into the drawing-room, where the heat was that of a hothouse. \"You must not take your furs off,\" said our host, as I was divesting myself of a portion of my cumbersome costume, \"remain just as you are.\" And...", "...eyes smart, and dried up the skin like a blast from a furnace.

It is preceded by an interval of absolute deadness in matters artistic. Sixty years ago art in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every branch was a sealed book to the majority of even well-educated persons, and contentedly contemplated by them as such.

THE WHITE SLAVE.--\"A slaveholder, living in Virginia, owned a beautiful slave woman, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> white. She became the mother of a child, a little boy, in whose veins ran the blood of her master, and the closest observer could not detect in its appearance any trace of African descent. He grew to be two or three years of age, a most beautiful child and the idol of his mother's heart, when the master concluded, for family reasons, to send him away. He placed him in the care of a friend living in Guilford County, North Carolina, and made an agreement that he should receive a...", "...elegante; she has soft wavy black hair, and eyes and eyebrows d'un noir de jais, and a complexion d'une blancheur de lis, with just a point of carmine in the cheeks. She does not say much--she speaks French with difficulty; but she expresses with her smiling eyes so cordial and sincere a welcome that one feels glad to be in the same room with her, one feels it is a happy privilege, it does one good--one ceases to feel one may possibly be an intruder--one <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> feels one is wanted there. \"I am then presented to three or four other ladies; and it would seem that the greatest beauties of London have given each other rendezvous in Madame Josselin's salon--this London, where are to be found the most beautiful women in the world and the ugliest. \"First, I salute the Countess of Ironsides--ah, mon Dieu, la Diane chasseresse--la Sapho de Pradier!

They are exhaled in an hour or two, and lost; yet they are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> daily offered to the delighted contemplation of the real lover of nature, who is ever happy to witness the beneficence of the great Creator, not less displayed in trivial circumstances, than in the most wonderful of His works.

Madelon had a sharp little pang of grief as she thought of her father, and then a glad throb of joy as she thought of Monsieur Horace--and then she suddenly discovered that she was horribly hungry, and, jumping up, she began to walk towards the village.

I thought I was at home, in my attic bed, and that it was my mother awakening me to go to work in the factory. \"Ma,\" I said. \"Is that you, ma!\" A woman was bending over me, her breasts <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> falling from the low-cut red dress she wore. She was painted and powdered like the rest, and her face looked drawn and pale over her scarlet gown.

Old Ben carried the bag in one hand while young Ben held the other fast, looking a little shame-faced at his own emotion now, for there were marks of tears on his cheeks, but too glad to repress the delight he felt that he had really found Daddy this side heaven.

The anxiety for his freedom which would be felt if he took refuge in France, would be almost equally justified by his presence in Austria. A residence in an exclusively Catholic country, such as Spain, would be contrary to the whole spirit of this book, and to the moral which it inculcates, that the great significance of the crisis is in the state of German Protestantism.

Indeed, the Wachners were both very unlike their usual selves this evening. Madame Wachner had suddenly become very serious, her stout red face was set in rather grim, grave lines; and twice, as Sylvia was eating the little piece of galantine which had been placed on her plate by L'Ami Fritz, she looked up and caught her hostess's eyes fixed on her with a curious, alien scrutiny. When they had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> finished the meat, Madame Wachner suddenly exclaimed in French. \"Fritz! You have forgotten to mix the salad! Whatever made you forget such an important thing? You will find what is necessary in the drawer behind you.\" Monsieur Wachner made no answer. He got up and pulled the drawer of the buffet open. Taking out of it a wooden spoon and fork, he came back to the table and began silently mixing the salad.

Florine followed the countess, who sat down on a seat close at hand, to which the count, doubling on Nathan, returned <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> immediately to guard his wife. \"Explain yourself, my dear,\" said Florine, \"and don't think I shall stand this long.

During the time that elapsed before her execution she was partly buoyed up by the hope of a reprieve, and protested her innocence <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the very last. In spite of her hope, she could not shut out the terrible fear that the reprieve might not come, and the dread of death was so heavy upon her as to reduce her in three weeks to a haggard wreck of her former self.

Roads could then secure attention when such attention is most needed. If they are repaired only annually or semiannually they are seldom in good condition but when they are given daily or weekly care they are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> always in good condition, and, moreover, the second method costs far less than the first. A portion of all levy tax money raised for road purposes should be used in buying improved road machinery, and in constructing each year a few miles of improved stone or gravel roads.

He does not confine himself, as, born a decade or two earlier, certainly he would have done, to classic subject.

He paints historical pictures with a realism unknown before his day. He is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> equally famous in the higher class of _genre_ subjects. But throughout everything he does it is easy to perceive the academic point of view, the classic temperament.

He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> opposite her house.

Connor, notwithstanding his frequent draughts, felt rather queerish, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> began to repent his curiosity. It was certainly a solemn sight to behold the black coffin resting upon the white strand. His imagination gradually converted the deep moaning of old ocean into a mournful wail for the dead, and from the shadowy recesses of the rocks he imaged forth strange and visionary forms.

The wall of the chest had been indented by the violence of the blow. Death must have been practically instantaneous.

He had received nearly the entire charge of a gun which had been fired at him--as the close pattern showed--within a distance of a very few feet. It was only small shot, and no vital organ had been touched. The discharge had been in no way responsible for his death. Still, the pain must have been exquisite.

Instead of having an amount of twenty thousand dollars to cancel of the Terry & Barnum debts and accounts (which the Secretary foolishly agreed to do.) it eventually proved to be about seventy thousand; (this I have found out since the failure.) This great loss the Secretary kept to himself, and it involved the Company so deeply that he became <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> desperate; for knowing by this time that he had been greatly embarrassed, he was determined to raise money in any way that he could, honestly, and get out of the difficulty if possible. He had, as he thought, got to keep this an entire secret, because if known it would ruin the credit of the Company. When these extra drafts and notes of Terry & Barnum were added to the debts of the Company, he was obliged to resort to various expedients to raise money to pay them.

A straight staircase descends into it from the ground-level above. In several of the tombs the original flooring of wooden beams is still preserved. Den's is the most magnificent of all, for it has a floor of granite blocks; we know of no other instance of stone being used for building in this early age. Almost every tomb has been burnt at some period unknown. The brick walls are burnt red, and many of the alabaster vases are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> calcined. This was probably the work of some unknown enemy. The wide complicated tombs have around the main chamber a series of smaller rooms, which were used to store what was considered necessary for the use of the royal ghost.

Indeed, their rights and powers are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unlimited, but I may as well state here that the priests of the Sun are wise in their generation, and do not push things too far. It is but very seldom that they go to extremes against anybody, being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of mercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorous-minded people on whose neck they have set their yoke, lest it should rise and break it off altogether.

Yet he could not quite seize it. The girl who worked about his cot was without his bourne of knowledge; her voice reached him as if from an infinite distance, and her words penetrated only to the outer edges of his...", "...Black Rock, among the boats hauled up on the shore in the creek from which he and Maurice and Una had set out to fish on Rackle Roy. A dread seized him that these might be yeomen. Since he had come within reach of home, since he had seen and heard the sea, since he had breathed the familiar salt-laden air, his courage had left him. He felt a very coward, desperately anxious not to be caught and dragged back again to the horror of death. He wanted to live now that he was back at home and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> within reach of Una. He eyed the distant figures anxiously, and then crept back and lay trembling in his hollow among his ordered snail-shells and the flowers, already withered, which he had plucked and planted in the sand. At last the sun set. Neal waited for an hour while the June twilight slowly faded. He watched the sandhills round his lair turn from bright yellow to grey, watched them while they seemed in the fading light to grow loftier, and assume a weird majesty which...", "...would not consent to operation.

After marriage the breasts diminished, but she was unable to suckle either of her three children, the breasts becoming turgid but never lactescent.

Even thus reduced the breasts descended <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the navel. When the woman was not pregnant they were still less voluminous and seemed to consist of an immense mass of wrinkled, flaccid skin, traversed by enormous dilated and varicose blood-vessels, the mammary glands themselves being almost entirely absent. Diffuse hypertrophy of the breast is occasionally seen in the male subject. In one case reported from the Westminster Hospital in London, a man of sixty, after a violent fall on the chest, suffered enormous...", "...thought, fast asleep.

The women were not secluded, but came out to look at our party, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as freely as the men. All appeared good-humoured and well disposed, and offered us plenty of ducks, fowls, and pigs for sale. It was noticed that, even in this poor little fishing-village, people were seen reading or writing in almost every one of the little shops. As we left it again, the villagers amused themselves by letting off crackers in all directions--a Chinaman's delight. Numbers of the people followed us down to the boat again; and two or three rupees, distributed...", "...She laughed. \"Oh, very well,\" she said.

Of this poet, who has so much flame in him that we cannot distinctly see his features, it is said in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the next sentence, \"Even in his most brilliant passages there is nothing of _the heat of inspiration_, nothing of that _celestial fire_ which makes us feel that the author has, by intensifying the action of the mind, raised himself to communion with superior intelligences.(!)

Although the tale deals with the old theme of a woman who falls in love with her sister's husband, it is instinct with passion and original in treatment. Olga loved her sister Martha dearly, and had, indeed, brought about Martha's marriage with Robert Hellinger <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> by her own efforts, but in so doing had herself, though unconsciously, fallen in love with Robert. Martha, always frail and delicate, after the birth of her child, falls dangerously ill. Olga goes to her to nurse her, and love for her sick sister and passion for Robert struggle for mastery in her soul. Thus, into a character entirely good, noble, and self-sacrificing, steals the wish, \"if only she were to die!\" In the event Martha does die. Then Robert's eyes are opened; he...", "...the standard should be placed as high as the class can attain.

He may either take the entire period in a lecture, or talk, or he may only supplement now and then the answers or topical recitations of the pupils. This method is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> exclusively used in many universities and colleges, but is not suited for extensive use in more elementary schools. _a. How the lecture method is to be used._--While the lecture method should be employed sparingly in the elementary school, yet it is most valuable to supplement other methods. First, in introducing a class to a new subject or section of work, it is frequently desirable that the teacher should take a part or the whole of a recitation period to explain the nature...", "...seven feet of stalwart stature constituted a menace before which a solitary wayfarer did not hesitate to surrender his sword. One evening, Benkei observed an armed acolyte approaching the Gojo bridge in Kyoto. The acolyte was Yoshitsune, and the time, the eve of his departure for Mutsu. Benkei made light of disarming a lad of tender years and seemingly slender strength. But already in his acolyte days Yoshitsune had studied swordsmanship, and he supplemented his knowledge by activity <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> supernatural. The giant Benkei soon found himself praying for life and swearing allegiance to his boy conqueror, an oath which he kept so faithfully as to become the type of soldierly fidelity for all subsequent generations of his countrymen.

Moreover, the day was a Sunday. And on Sunday, in English ships, every one would certainly do himself a little extra well, with the aid of whisky and similar good things. Up here, too, that was especially to be expected. For the men on a remote outpost station like this, who were doubtless not relieved too frequently, in their monotonous but trying duty, that was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the only pleasure which they had a chance to enjoy. Moreover, in view of the overcast weather, it was pretty certain that by eight o'clock it would be already growing dark.

In the stone we have more important differences, and these in the case of the plum have been esteemed of specific value: in some apricots the stone is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> spherical, in others much flattened, being either sharp in front or blunt at both ends, sometimes channelled along the back, or with a sharp ridge along both margins. In the Moorpark, and generally in the Hemskirke, the stone presents a singular character in being perforated, with a bundle of fibres passing through the perforation from end to end.

As she took it from him he noticed that those thin, angular arms of hers seemed to close round the little swaddled body in an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> jealously possessive clasp. But there was none of the tender possessiveness of love about it. In some oddly repugnant way it reminded him of the motion of a bird of prey at last gripping triumphantly in its talons a victim that has hitherto eluded pursuit.

The Teffe is almost deserted, and near the sources of the Japur there remained but the fragments of the great nation of the Umauea. The Coari is forsaken.

You see, Prescott's John had grown wise in his generation. After that he felt reasonably secure.

He expected momentarily that his theft would be detected and that he would be thrown into prison, and the fear of the actual arrest, the moment of public ignominy, the shock and agony of his wife and family, were what drove him sleepless into the streets, and every evening to the theatres to try to forget what must inevitably come; but the fact that he had \"gone wrong,\" that he was a...", "...afternoon; it was raining like blazes still; very likely the ground would be again too wet for play to-morrow, and he would cut the walk and get his boots mended.

The genius of Albrecht Durer cannot be rightly estimated without taking into account the position which the arts of engraving on metal and on wood thus held in the culture of this time.

In it the fire is not tamed or diluted by indirect contact with water, but it is used direct; the fire, instead of being kept to the boiler room, is introduced direct into the motor cylinder of the engine. This at first sight looks very absurd and impracticable; difficulties at once become apparent of so overwhelming a nature that the problem seems <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> an impossible one; yet this is what has been successfully accomplished in the gas engine. Engineers accustomed to the construction of steam engines would not many years ago have considered any one proposing such a thing as having taken leave of his senses.

We were greeted at the gangway by the famous Captain Sigismund von Muenchhausen, a gruff but hearty old mariner, who immediately escorted me into his cabin and insisted on my enjoying a cigar and a glass of schnapps with him. Once again I was struck with that <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> Oriental charm of manner which seems to lift the German Higher Command above the plane occupied by the rest of the Occidental world. It was no doubt my impatience that caused me to interrupt the gallant Captain's delightful flow of racy anecdote to ask when we should start. My host smiled enigmatically. \"By now,\" he said, \"we should be somewhere over the Dogger Bank.\" It was true. So perfectly had all things been appointed that while I had been consuming a single glass of...", "...the summit ridge of which is especially well-marked, there is a large shallow depression. The floor contains scarcely any detail, except some ridges on the N. side and a few craterlets.

BAYER.--This object, 29 miles in diameter, with a terraced border rising on the W. to a height of 8000 feet above the floor, is so closely associated with Schiller, that it may <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> be regarded as forming part of it. A long lofty mountain arm, apparently connected with the W. wall of the latter, runs from the E. side of Bayer towards the N.W. There is a crater on the E. side of the interior. ROST.--An oblong-shaped ring-plain, 30 miles in diameter, on the S.W. of Schiller, with moderately high walls, and, according to Neison, a shallow depression within, nearly central.

I was most agreeably disappointed in this respect. I found Lord Byron in the highest degree courteous, and even kind. We met for an hour or two <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> daily, in Mr. Murray's drawing-room, and found a great deal to say to each other.[12] We also met frequently in parties and evening society, so that for about two months I had the advantage of a considerable intimacy with this distinguished individual. Our sentiments agreed a good deal, except upon the subjects of religion and politics, upon neither of which I was inclined to believe that Lord Byron entertained very fixed opinions. I remember saying to him, that I really thought...", "...every student they could lay their hands on. \"Let go!\" Badger shrieked, white with wrath, lunging with his hard right fist. It struck a student in the face and hurled him crashingly backward. But the next moment the fist and arm were caught and held. Then began a fierce struggle for the mastery. Time and again the Westerner, whose strength was great, hurled off the men who sought to hold him down. Twice he got on his feet, merely to be tripped and thrown again. Not until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> beaten and choked into insensibility were his assailants able to rip open his vest. Ordinarily, Badger wore a soft silk shirt which had no tab, but on this night he had on a white shirt, whose tab was amputated by a dexterous thrust as soon as the vest was pulled open. Then he was permitted to rise to his feet, reeling, sick, blind with rage and humiliation and a sense of baffled hate. But his chief thought still was of Donald Pike. \"Which way did he go?\" he panted, as...", "...Brown, Addison Daniels, Wm. Sanford, and Alexander Ely. The division of the property was made in 1849 as is shown elsewhere, and it is from that time that most of the real estate transfers were made. All the gentlemen made fortunes from their speculations. How these five gentlemen came to be possessed of all the land in the city of Cedar Rapids would make an interesting story, especially if the prices they paid for each lot could be secured. They doubtless bought up the claims for <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> nothing. We get some inkling of how the lots came into their possession by a curious old document which was deposited by Mr. C. G. Greene with the curator of the museum for the semi-centennial week. The property mentioned in it is the Grand Hotel corner, and this is a copy of it: \"Received, Cedar Rapids, Sept. 7, 1848, of John L.

I can kill every last man, and then you won't be able to die a warrior's death. _Or_ get to heaven!\" The chief tried to free himself with a mighty surge that <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> tore one of his arms free, but Fannia held on, pinning both arms behind his back. \"Very well,\" the chief said, tears springing into his eyes. \"A warrior must die by his own hand. You have won, alien.\" The crowd shouted curses as the Earthmen carried the chief and the cans of fuel back to the ship. They waved their knives and danced up and down in a frenzy of hate. \"Let's make it fast,\" Fannia said, after Donnaught had fueled the ship. He gave the chief a push and leaped...", "...the real culprit confessed his sin to the then aged poet, and obtained the asked for absolution. It was in 1641 that Vondel openly embraced the Catholic faith, though his tendency in that direction had been apparent in his poems many years before. We have already referred to the report that his love for a beautiful and wealthy widow, Tesselschade, had been the main instrument in drawing him from his Protestant moorings, and this was doubtless to some extent true. And yet it is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certain that Vondel would have embraced the cause of Rome even without the alluring wiles of this fair enchantress. Many of his relatives, including his brother William, belonged to that faith. Many of his dearest friends also were of that denomination. His daughter Anna, furthermore, had not only entered that church, but had also taken the veil. Moreover, he had long been drifting away from the creed of his early childhood, the Anabaptism of his parents. The severe pietism...", "...And in the end, she went away in precisely the same state of ignorance. On the day they drove to the station she did, indeed, give one fleeting glimpse over the edge of her narrow prison-house of self-centered interest. Surrounded by a great many strapped and buckled pieces of baggage, with Helene, fascinatingly ugly in her serf's uniform, holding the black leather bag containing Aunt Victoria's jewels, they passed along the street for the last time, under the great elms already <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> wintry with their bare boughs. Now that it was too late, Sylvia felt a momentary curiosity about the unseen humanity which had been so near her all the summer. She looked out curiously at the shabby vehicles (it seemed to her that there were more of them than in the height of the season), at the straight-standing, plainly dressed, briskly walking women and children (there seemed to be a new air of life and animation about the street now that most of the summer cottages were...", "...hypocrisy, and endure the most unhandsome treatment, he must still exchange greetings with his assassin, who, for that matter, claims the esteem and friendship of his victim.

But in those <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> forgotten days the same theatre could scarcely hold certain Royalist and Liberal journalists; the most malignant provocation was offered, glances were like pistol-shots, the least spark produced an explosion of quarrel.

Perhaps Athalia missed them; perhaps, under her spiritual passion, she was piqued that earthly passion was so readily silenced. But, if she was, she did not know it. She was entirely sincere and intensely happy in a new experience.

The first source from which the regular forces could be recruited was the Territorials. They had been formed before the war on the idea that they were required merely for home defence, and no one had yet thought of the equivocation that home defence included that of India, Egypt, Belgium, and France, or offence in Mesopotamia and the Dardanelles. There was no need for the Government to rely on that quibble, for the Territorials volunteered <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in mass for foreign service, and the difficulty was to impress Lord Kitchener with the value of a force with which his absence in the East had made him unfamiliar. As it was, some of the best of the regiments, like the London Scottish, put in an appearance at Ypres, while numbers were sent to Egypt and India to release for service in Europe the regular forces there. With them came native Indian regiments, Sikhs, Gurkhas, and Bhopals, whose voluntary service provided the most...", "...of the present lord. The noon had passed some hours before the delighted wanderers complained of fatigue, and by that time they found themselves in a pleasant green glade on the skirts of the forest of Nassau.

From a rocky cleft in these green mountains a torrent, dashing down with impetuous force, and whose fall was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> concealed by the cloud of spray which it excited, gave birth to a small and gentle river, whose banks were fringed with beautiful trees, which prevented the sun's darts from piercing its coldness, by bowing their fair heads over its waters.

Near the banks of this river, the servants, under the active direction of Essper George, had...", "...pleasing sensations excited by a residence at Parell, is the recollection of the distinguished persons who have inhabited the same chambers, and sat in the same halls. The Duke of Wellington is said frequently to have expressed a partiality for Parell, and to look back to the days of his sojourn within its walls with pleasure. Here he reposed after those battles in which he laid the foundation of his future glory, and to which, after long experience, and so many subsequent triumphs as <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to eclipse their splendour, he recurs with peculiar satisfaction. So far from underrating, as is the fashion with many of the military servants of the Crown, the merits of a successful campaign in India, the great captain of the age, than whom there can be no better judge, rates the laurels that he gathered in his earliest fields as highly as those wrested from the soldiers of France, glorying in the title given him by Napoleon, of \"the Sepoy General.\" Few things can be more...", "...on some bright summer's day that the most beautiful effects are those in which the distance is almost of a match to the sky. Distant hills, which when viewed close to are green or brown, when seen some five or ten miles away appear of a delicate and delicious, almost of a cobalt, blue color. Now, what is the cause of this change in color? It is simply that we have a sky formed between us and the distant ranges, the mere outline of which looms through it. The shadows are softened so as <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to leave no trace, and we have what artists call an atmospheric effect. If we go into another climate, such as Egypt or among the high Alps, we usually lose this effect. Distant mountains stand out crisp with black shadows, and the want of atmosphere is much felt.

In such climates as England there is always a certain amount of moisture present in the atmosphere, and this moisture may be present...", "...in which society finds itself placed, is to become of plain girls. Their mission is a subject which no philosopher as yet has adequately handled. If marriage is the object of all feminine endeavors and ambitions, it certainly seems rather hard that Providence should have condemned plain girls to start in the race at such an obvious disadvantage. Even under M. Comte's system, which provides for almost everything, and which, in its far-sightedness and thoughtfulness for our good, appears <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> more benevolent than Providence, it would seem as if hardly sufficient provision had been made for them. It must be difficult for any one except a really advanced Comtist to give himself up to the worship of a thoroughly plain girl.

It had been decided that the 154th Brigade should take over the front during the night 26-27th October; but the situation had fluctuated and remained so obscure that this relief was not carried out. Certain reliefs, however, did take place. The 4th Seaforth Highlanders took over from the 6th Black Watch, the front-line reliefs having to be carried out by the incomers and outgoers...", "...were intended to have no meaning. This was her first answer to herself. But in her second she accused herself as much as she had before accused him. She had been cold to him, unfriendly, and harsh. As her aunt had told her, she spoke sharp words to him, and repulsed the kindness which he offered her. What right had she to expect from him a declaration of love when she was studious to stop him at every avenue by which he might approach it? A little management on her side would, she <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> knew, make things right. But then the idea of any such management distressed her;--nay, more, disgusted her. The management, if any were necessary, must come from him. And it was manifest enough that if he had any strong wishes in this matter he was not a good manager. Her cousin, Will Belton, knew how to manage much better. On the next morning, however, all her thoughts respecting Captain Aylmer were dissipated by tidings which Martha brought to her bedside. Her aunt was...", "...Professor Munsterberg contends that it is unwise to give high-school teachers special professional education apart from knowledge of the subjects which they are to teach; that it is folly to replace a prescribed course of study by an elective system; that the salvation of our schools depends upon the scholarship of the teachers and the attitude of parents. As the reformers agree heartily with this last claim (unless it is made an exclusive aim), and as its meaning is so vague that <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> anything can be urged as a corrolary to it, it may be dismissed. The first two contentions are about concrete matters of educational practice which need to be thought over. If professional preparation is a waste of time, there is every reason why we should omit it; if a prescribed course of study is better for the boys and girls, we can conscientiously lessen the expense and labor of administration in many schools. The argument on the first point is, briefly, that Professor...", "...Kaffo, and passed the day there. We had in the canoe before we departed from Sansanding, a very large stock of provisions, salted and fresh of all kinds; which enabled us to go along without stopping at any place, for fear of accident. The canoe was large enough to contain with ease one hundred and twenty people. In the evening we started and came to before an island; we saw on shore a great quantity of hippopotami; on our approach they went into the water in such confusion, that they <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> upset our canoe. We passed the island and sailed. In the morning three canoes from Kaffo came after us, which we beat off. We came to near a small island, and saw some of the natives; I was sent on shore to buy some milk. When I got among them I saw two canoes go on board to sell fresh provisions, such as fowls, rice, &c. One of the natives wanted to kill me; at last he took hold of me, and said I was his prisoner. Mr. Park seeing what was passing on shore, suspected the truth....", "...temples hammered as the hot young blood mounted to his brain. A moment later Buck stood staring at the angle of the barn round which Joan had just vanished. He was half-dazed, and the only thing that seemed absolutely real to him was the gentle pressure of her hand as it had rested in his. He could feel it still; he could feel every pressure of the soft, warm flesh where it had lain on his hard palms. And all the time he stood there his whole body thrilled with an emotion that was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> painful. At last he stirred. He stooped and picked up the discarded fork. He had no definite purpose. He was scarcely aware of his action. He held it for a moment poised in the air. Then slowly he let the prongs of it rest on the ground, and, leaning his chin on his hands clasped about the haft, stared out at the hills and gave himself up to such a dream as never before had entered his life. The sun was dipping behind the snowcaps, and for half an hour the work he had...", "...land was still in sight on our port beam, and toward nightfall, we passed Cape Francois. Between midnight and dawn, on this same night, we had quite an alarm. A large ship-of-war came suddenly upon us, in the darkness! Like ourselves, she was running down the coast, but she was under both steam and sail, having her studding-sails set on both sides, whereas the _Alabama_ was entirely without steam, with her propeller triced up. If the stranger had been an enemy, we should have been <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> entirely at her mercy. The reader may imagine, therefore, how anxious I was for the next few minutes. She soon dispelled my fears, however, for she passed rapidly on, at no greater distance from us, than a hundred yards, her lights lighting up the countenances of my men, as they stood at their guns--for by this time I had gotten them to their quarters--quite distinctly. She did not take the least notice of us, or swerve a hair's-breadth from her course.

The men knew that a road branched to the south toward Lake Huleh, which was not far from the Lake of Galilee. John happened to look up at the cliff. \"Where does the water come from that runs down here?\" he asked curiously. Shrubs of all kinds clung to crannies in the damp rock wall. \"Perhaps there is an underground stream,\" replied James, hopefully. They were all thirsty. A moment later he saw a deep pool <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> hidden at the very foot of the cliff. \"There it is!\" he exclaimed. Several of the men started toward the spring. \"Wait!\" called Peter sharply. He pointed up at the face of the cliff. James looked up and saw that a deep hole had been carved in the rock. It was framed by two stone columns and a stone arch. Under the arch stood a statue of Pan, the pagan god of nature. \"Stop!\" cried Peter. \"That water is unholy!\" The other disciples caught sight of the idol and shrank back....", "...hurt, and then, too, she had read so many vilely printed Yiddish books and papers by the light of the tallow candle. What if she were going blind? What if, while she, Biela, was happy with Srul, Leah should be starving with Tsirrele? No, they must all remain together: and she clung to her sister, with tears. To Leah the prospect of witnessing her sister's happiness was so seductive that she tried to take the lowest estimate of her own chances of finding work in New York. Her savings, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> eaten up by the journey, could not last long, and it would be terrible to have to come upon Srul for help, a man with a wife and (if God were good) children, to say nothing of his old mother. No, she could not risk Tsirrele's bread. But the increased trouble with her eyes turned her in favour of going, though, curiously enough, for a side reason quite unlike Biela's.

They were left orphans, and were obliged to take care of themselves. Many of the articles of furniture left them had been disposed of to supply the calls of urgent want. In the room was an old four post bedstead, with curtains almost worn out, one mattress with two small pillows, a bolster that was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> flat, three old blankets and cotton sheets, of coarse description, three rush-bottom chairs, an old claw table, a chest of draws with a few battered band-boxes on the top of it, a miserable bit of carpet before the fire-place, a wooden box for coals, a little tin fender and an old poker.

Dragged by a Byzantine Court, backed by popular insistence and impelled by overpowering self-interest, the Church accepted the Virgin throned and crowned, seated by Christ, the Judge throned and crowned; but even this did not wholly satisfy the French of the thirteenth century who seemed bent on absorbing Christ in His Mother, and making the Mother the Church, and Christ the Symbol. The Church had crowned and enthroned her <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> from the beginning, and could not have dethroned her if it would. In all Christian art-- sculpture or mosaic, painting or poetry--the Virgin's rank was expressly asserted. Saint Bernard, like John Comnenus, and probably at the same time (1120-40), chanted hymns to the Virgin as Queen:-- O salutaris Virgo Stella Maris Generans prolem, Aequitatis solem, Lucis auctorem, Retinens pudorem, Suscipe laudem!

Only a very lively goodness, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a religion in a man, can do this. He has to have something in him very like the power of inventing people or of making people over.

In one important particular the consideration of the subject to-day is simpler than when it was debated on former occasions. Differences existed, then as now, in regard to the propriety of erecting a national memorial of Shakespeare in London; but <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all who interested themselves in the matter in the nineteenth century agreed that the public interest justified, if it did not require, the preservation from decay or demolition of the buildings at Stratford-on-Avon with which Shakespeare's life was associated.

But still more beautiful and wonderful seemed the vast mountain of ice on which we floated, as in every fantastic form it appeared, towering above us. The pinnacles and turrets of the summit were tinted with the glowing hues of the east; while, lower down, the columns and arches which supported them seemed formed of the purest alabaster of almost a cerulean tint; and a round us, on either side, appeared vast caverns and grottoes, carved, one might <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> suppose, by the hands of fairies, for their summer abode, out of Parian marble, their entrances fringed with dropping icicles, glittering brilliantly. It is not to be wondered at, if we did not admire the enchanting spectacle as much as it deserved, for we could not forget that we were floating on an iceberg, in the middle of the North Sea; but still the scene made an impression on my mind which I shall not forget. We had struck on the lowest and least precipitous side of the...", "...their hostility was due to a sense of their weakness before it, a realization of its disarming psychical pull. But the American of the new republic was of a different kidney. He was not so much hostile to beauty as devoid of any consciousness of it; he stood as unmoved before its phenomena as a savage before a table of logarithms. What he had set up on this continent, in brief, was a commonwealth of peasants and small traders, a paradise of the third-rate, and its national philosophy, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> wholly unchecked by the more sophisticated and civilized ideas of an aristocracy, was precisely the philosophy that one finds among peasants and small traders at all times and everywhere.

But her daughter was quite aware of this motive for the question, and replied quietly,--\"Not particularly, mamma.

They have about the same intelligence quotient that we have, and are physically <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> identical except for our induced modifications. As Your Excellency predicted they do not have these since they have not yet discovered the methods of inducing them. As a result, while they have the same muscular potential as we do, they are far weaker, and their life span is not more than 70 or 80 years by their calendar. They do not have heat sensors, so they stumble around in the dark and trip over things like children.

That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment: he might naturally have waked up an hour before. \"Getting out of bed, he goes <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unconsciously and with no definite motive towards the sound to see what's the matter.

There are archaic statues that are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as nobly beautiful as any work by Phidias and more beautiful than almost any work that has been done since his time. There are bits of Gothic sculpture that are more valuable expressions of human feeling than anything produced by the contemporaries of Buonarroti.

The difficulty of obtaining for experiment any one kind of bacteria by itself, unmixed with others (pure cultures), rendered advance almost impossible. So conflicting were the results that the whole subject soon came into almost hopeless confusion, and very few steps were taken upon any sure basis.

The terms were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> identical with those which had been rejected by the Porte two years before, after the conference at Bucharest. In view of the fact that the Ottoman armies had been everywhere defeated during the war, and that the Russians had obtained actual possession of the Crimea, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Bessarabia in Europe, and of Georgia and Mingrelia in the Caucasus, the terms were distinctly moderate. The Empress must have been very desirous of peace. There was a serious rebellion of...", "...royal favor, and thus they consign their daughters to a life oftentimes worse than exile for that purpose.

There is nothing like courting amongst the young folks, as we understand that term, unless it is done by stealth, which is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> impossible, from the fact that the mothers exercise the strictest vigilance over their unmarried daughters. In this respect American mothers might often profit by the example of these heathen. Girls become wives there at the early age of fourteen, and an old maid is quite a curiosity.

To my mind, the comparative silence of revelation in regard to it, counts for <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> nothing in our estimate of its probability--I might almost say of its necessity. There is one consideration of prime importance in this connection, which ought not to be overlooked. It is this: that in regard even to the future world of final blessedness, we have very meagre details. And there are good reasons why we have not more.

She was the eldest child, and only daughter of Emanuel Aguilar, one of those merchants descended from the Jews of Spain, who, almost within the memory of man, fled from persecution in that country, and sought and found an asylum in England. The delicate frame and feeble health observable in Grace Aguilar throughout her life, displayed itself from infancy; from the age of three years, she was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> constantly under the care of some physician, and, by their advice, annually spending the summer months by the sea, in the hope of rousing and strengthening a naturally fragile constitution. This want of physical energy was, however, in direct contrast to her mental powers, which developed early, and readily. She learned to read with scarcely any trouble, and when once that knowledge was gained, her answer when asked what she would like for a present, was invariably \"A book,\"...", "...when the sea is leaden-hued, there may, perhaps, appear one of those thin crimson lines that are the last efforts of the setting sun. This often appears just behind the grey and dim rock, and the crimson is reflected in a delicate tinge upon the glistening sands.

At times the farmyards seem to have taken the road into their own hands, for a stone well-head will appear <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in the roadway, and chickens, pigs, and a litter of straw have to be allowed for by those who ride or drive along this rural way. When the rock is still some distance off, the road seems to determine to take a short cut across the sands, but thinking better of it, it runs along the outer margin of the reclaimed land, and there is nothing to prevent the sea from flooding over the road at its own discretion. Once on the broad and solidly constructed causeway, the rock rapidly...", "...to see my husband have a fringed cloth hang on a pillar over his dead body, and if I hadn't been postmistress I never could have paid for such a thing.

Memories flashed before his eyes, in glowing visions before him and inside him and around him, until it was as though he were standing there, on the platform of the tram-car, in a blaze of recollections which the wind fanned rather than extinguished.... But the tram was passing his house; and he jumped down, wildly, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> stumbling over his sword, hampered by his military great-coat, which blew between his legs. He rattled with his latchkey against the door, like a drunken man, could not find the keyhole at once....

[Sidenote: THE CITIZEN] The visible life of Bryant lies <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> entirely outside the realm of poesie. He as fitted for Williams by country ministers, as was customary in that day; but poverty compelled him to leave college after two brief terms.

He had genius, feeling, fancy, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> everything except accurate knowledge of the laws of nature and art. His art was the best of its time, but it still lacked, nor did that of his immediate followers go much beyond it technically.

The mouth was hidden by the bronze-tinted moustache, and the eyes alone, were noticeable.

In fact, human life is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a drug in the market.

All these conflicting interests gave rise to <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as many private letters as there were official applications. Ladies and children would come and live in Bombay in the hope of securing a vacancy at the eleventh hour--a device which was often successful.

By unlacing one portion, the sail can quickly be reduced in size. The boatmen, unlike the natives of the places lately visited, were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as fair as Europeans. They wore, however, scarcely more clothing than their brethren in more southern regions.

Now this resource was cut off. The boat couldn't be used until it was repaired. He felt morally bound to get it repaired, though he was guiltless of the damage. But how could he even do this?

Here, too, boys went naked until the approach of puberty; the cocoanut palms, the dense banana groves, even the huge earthen water-jars before the houses recalled the charming isle of the Singhalese, and if the people were less kindly to the stranger they were much more joyful and full of laughter than the Mexican of the plateau. In this perhaps they had more in common with the Burmese. The men, often <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> white in color, wore few large hats, never one approaching those of the highlands.

It was the worst storm that Dick had experienced, and even Earle admitted that it far surpassed the worst that he had ever encountered, even in the interior of Africa. The wind blew with hurricane force, stripping the trees of their leaves and even of some of their branches, so that the air was full of flying debris, while the lightning flashed and the thunder roared and boomed and crashed in a continuous deafening medley of sound that might <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> have excused the belief that the foundations of the earth were being torn asunder. And all the time the rain came pounding down out of the storm-riven clouds in such a deluge that it was difficult to draw one's breath while exposed to it.

To-night they walked together in silence, or speaking seldom, like the other Legionnaires, and listening to the music. Suddenly the Spaniard stopped, muttering some word under his breath, and Max saw through the dusk that the olive face had gone ashy pale. \"What's the matter, Garcia? Are you ill?\" he asked. The other did not answer. He stood stock still, staring <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> stupidly straight before him. Max linked an arm in his. \"What's wrong? Garcia! What's wrong with you?\" he repeated. The Spaniard started. \"I beg your pardon,\" he stammered, dazed. \"I didn't realize you were--speaking--to me.\" Instantly Max guessed that \"Juan Garcia,\" the name appearing with the \"_numero matricule_\" over the bed of _le bleu_, was as new as his place in the Legion, and as fictitious as the alleged profession of _garcon d'hotel_ which accounted cleverly for...", "...McMeekin wouldn't let me look at champagne.

It did not really matter to me how things had gone, for I knew that I was going to die <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> at once. But even with that prospect before me I wanted to hear how Lalage's maiden speech had been received. \"Did Miss Beresford speak at the meeting?\" I asked. The nurse came over to my bed and insisted on slipping her thermometer under my arm. It was a useless and insulting thing to do, but I bore it in silence because I wanted to hear about Lalage's speech. Titherington did not answer at once, and when he did it was in an unsatisfactory way. \"Oh, she spoke all right,\"...", "...of the Abbe Klein,--these are of great value. But they are quite apart, quite different, from the popular impression of America in Europe, an impression which is, and perhaps to some extent must naturally be, based upon the observations of Americans _en voyage_, and which by some strange hypnotism sometimes imposes itself for a while upon the American travellers themselves. I call this the international postal-card view of America. It is often amusing, occasionally irritating, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> always confusing. It has flashes of truth in it. It renders certain details with the accuracy of a kodak. But, like a picture made by the kodak, it has a deficient perspective and no atmosphere. The details do not fit together. They are irrelevant. They are often contradictory. For example, you will hear statements made about America like the following:-- 'The Americans worship the Almighty Dollar more than the English revere the Ponderous Pound or the French adore...", "...the work at Castle Affey. After three months every man and woman in the village had passed in and out of Sir Tony's service, and everyone was drawing unemployment pay. The village became extremely prosperous. New hats, blouses, and entire costumes of the most fashionable kind were to be seen in the streets every Sunday. Large sums of money were lost and won at coursing matches. Nearly everyone had a bicycle, and old Malone bought, second hand, a rather dilapidated motor-car. Work of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every kind ceased entirely, except in the big house, and nobody got out of bed before ten o'clock. In mere gratitude, rents of houses were paid to Sir Tony which had not been paid for many years before. Lady Corless finally dismissed herself.

Never were two combatants more unequally opposed, than the young merchant and the desperate gambler--the one, probably, had never discharged a pistol in his life--the other, and within six months, had killed his man on the very spot the doomed youth was standing. Other and fouler circumstances went to render the result of the impending duel <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a certainty.

It appeared, however, that, in the literal though not in the idiomatic sense of the phrase, he had \"committed it to memory\" to some purpose, for as we, struck with amazement, took down our Horace and followed him, we found that he made not the slightest verbal error. This performance on his part was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> immediately followed by heavy comatose slumber. On afterward questioning him, it appeared that he remembered nothing either of the Satire or of his remarkable feat. Several analogous cases are cited by Dr. Anstie.[5] [5] _Stimulants and Narcotics_, pp. 174-178. This certainly looks like stimulation, but on comparing it with other instances of abnormal reminiscence differently caused, we shall find reason for believing that it is nothing of the kind.

And they immediately fitted up the roof with a cushioned shelter, and a bed of catnip, and a bench where the Queen might sit. There the cat was left; and the Queen went up three times a day to feed it, and twice as many times to visit it, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> two days that seemed the solution of the problem. Then the cat discovered that by making a spring to the limb of an overhanging oak tree, it could climb down the trunk and go where it liked.

Much to the amazement of the latter, the monarch leapt up screaming, and was moreover so upset, that the affairs of state had all to be postponed till the following day.

CHAPTER III THE EVE OF YPRES The plan of the Allied commanders, at once original and bold, was decided upon at that conference at the British head-quarters on the Aisne. From the first in this war the French Intelligence Service has shown itself excellent. The French Head-quarters Staff has not only been well and reliably informed of the enemy's preparations and movements, but promptly informed. In this instance the prospective movements were a matter of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certain inference. Given the motives of the German Government, and the military principles favoured by the German Staff, both quite well known, and what they would do and how they would try to do it, was a conclusion that a general much less sagacious than Joffre might safely draw. The exact extent and character, however, of the German preparations, and the degree to which those preparations had been advanced was definite information of a valuable kind. It is apposite here to...", "...said to Laura, hardly sane, and her incipient madness having originally resulted from jealousy, the latter naturally remained the ruling influence in her unsettled brain, and attained proportions hardly credible to those who have not followed the steps by which the human intelligence passes from sanity to madness.

It was not in her power to send for a lawyer and to bring an action at law against Pietro, without her husband's consent, and she knew how hard that would be to obtain. Francesco Savelli was by no means a cowardly man, and would, if necessary, have exposed his life in a duel with Ghisleri, not for his wife's sake, but for the sake of the family honour. But he had the...", "...two gleaming foreteeth under his moustache, in a smile so perpetual as to earn the reputation of a sneer.

At last, after the inward cravings after that fowl had torn me almost to pieces, and my desire to be polite and good had been <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> upset by the inclination to rush in and devour right and left, they carved up the turkey, and I had so many tidbits I did not know which to eat first, the head or the tail, for I had both of them. I did do justice to that dinner, and, like a child, as I did not know when to leave off, they had to take it from me. I then laid down and slept so sound that I had the nightmare.

Edward G. Porter and Miss Mary E. Fowle. After the business the meeting adjourned to the dining-room, where Mrs. Chamberlin had thoughtfully and kindly provided a delicious entertainment, which fitly ended the delightful afternoon. The Rev. Phillips Brooks acknowledged his kinship to the founder of Abbot, and in substance said: \"No institution so takes on personality as a school. I see the various colleges <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as if they had features, and we may have some such feeling regarding Abbot Academy. Then there is so much in the quality of an old institution, if it keeps abreast of the times. The period of the founding of Abbot was an interesting one. It was a time when old ideas were being left behind and a new thought was just taking the place of the old. Great processes, which have not yet begun to fulfil themselves, had just begun to appear. No one can think of the academy without feeling...", "...the national literature of Scotland. Like Scott he at first wrote imitations of the old ballads with their literary style and phrases. These, like all other imitations of ancient ballads, although full of strength and poetical power, had not the genuine naturalness of antiquity and the inimitable flavor of primitive art. Later, on his return to Portugal, Almeida Garrett set himself to work to collect the ancient Portuguese ballads, as Scott had done those of the Scottish border, and was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> equally successful. The backwardness of the Portuguese peasantry in education, and their comparative seclusion from the influences of modern civilization in their mountains and valleys, contributed very much to the preservation of their ancient ballads, and even to-day they are a part of the oral literature of the country. There were of course many ancient ballads, in written and printed forms, which were preserved in libraries and in the papers of old families, but the great...", "...and lasted for so long that when it finally ceased the mouth of the cave was entirely covered with snow. That seemed almost the last straw, for little or no light came into the cave, the cold was intense, and the boy was unable to go out. Hour by hour, day in and day out, he sat there, unable to read any more and without any appetite for the little food he could allow himself. Three weeks passed--one day over the time in which Phillips might have returned. The little fellow's mind <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> gave way from the strain that was put on him as he sat there with night following day, and no change--only expectancy. Twenty-eight days passed. He had but a day or so more of food. If help did not come within the next three days at the most, he would starve to death. To add to his misery, most of the wood that had been left was used up. So the boy sat on the twenty-ninth day, huddled over the little flame that he could spare himself, hardly realizing now the passage of...", "...arm. \"Go back to where they have taken her.

We need not be seen. No one will recognize us. Come! come!\" She took Hepworth's arm, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> forced him from the box. \"Which way? Come! come! I will go.\" Hepworth had been too often behind the scenes not to know how to gain admittance there on this occasion. He knew how resolute that young creature was, when a generous or daring idea possessed her, and, after waiting a moment for Lady Hope to speak, led Lady Clara away. Clara was bewildered and almost terrified by the black darkness of the passage, which was lighted only by fitful gleams from the stage; but...", "...was found to have been triumphantly vindicated. Instead of the work being effected, as challenged to be done, in half the time which had been expended by thrice the force in the number of men, it was found to have occupied but little more than a third part of that interval.

Philosophers express wonder that the divine laws should give to some young girl, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a child, the custody of an immortal soul. But what instruction the baby brings to the mother! She learns patience, self-control, endurance; her very arm grows strong, so that she can hold the dear burden longer than the father can. She learns to understand character, too, by dealing with it. \"In training my first children,\" said a wise mother to me, \"I thought that all were born just the same, and that I was wholly responsible for what they should become. I learned by degrees...", "...and the Duke of St. James immediately said that he would take the earliest opportunity of giving him that pleasure.

He, too, had been a minor, and had inherited an estate capable of supporting the becoming dignity of an ancient family. In appearance he was an Antinous. There was, however, an expression of firmness, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> of ferocity, about his mouth, which quite prevented his countenance from being effeminate, and broke the dreamy voluptuousness of the rest of his features. In mind he was a roue. Devoted to pleasure, he had racked the goblet at an early age; and before he was five-and-twenty procured for himself a reputation which made all women dread and some men shun him. In the very wildest moment of his career, when he was almost marked like Cain, he had met Lady Aphrodite Maltravers. She...", "...living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared. Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominent again.

She got them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter, who strutted up and down on deck, until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom.

Now the whole of this reasoning is founded on the assumption that the letter bore only the single date of the 4th. On the 21st, the supposed danger of a journey to London no longer existed. At that period, too, Garnett, instead of proceeding towards the metropolis, had not only removed in the opposite direction, from Goathurst, in Buckinghamshire, to Harrowden, the seat of Lord Vaux, in Northamptonshire, but was also...", "...from Scotland Yard, employed from the first by Sir Everard, appeared upon the scene with crushing news.

My initials are upon it.\" \"So I see,\" was the dry response. \"How comes it here? Where did you find it?\" The detective eyed him narrowly, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> amazed at his coolness. \"I found it in a very queer place, Sir Everard--lodged in the branches of an elm-tree, not far from the stone terrace. It's a miracle it was ever found. I think this little weapon did the deed. I'll go and have a look at the body.\" He went. Yes, there in the region of the heart was a gaping wound.

And for the first time the truth dawned on the stunned...", "...to know the spirit with which we were commanded were conscious of a gradual oozing out at the finger-ends of the determination to make a successful fight; and it was a sad night for us all when, at West Point, with our skirmish-line steadily engaging the Rebel outposts, an order came that we were to fall back before daybreak toward Okolona. The brigade commanders and their staffs had had severe duty in the scattered work of destruction, and even Max, tough though he was, had been <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> overworked with constant galloping to and fro, and with the frequent countermarching our varying orders had required. Still he was better than his comrades, and many a man was anxious for his mount, should our retreat be pressed.

Every mischance was as quickly repaired as aroused expedient could do the work. The marsh received first attention. There the restless snow drifted uneasily before the wind. Nearly every day the road had to be plowed, and the sprinklers followed the teams <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> constantly. Often it was bitter cold, but no one dared to suggest to the determined jobber that it might be better to remain indoors. The men knew as well as he that the heavy February snows would block traffic beyond hope of extrication. As it was, several times an especially heavy fall clogged the way. The snow-plow, even with extra teams, could hardly force its path through. Men with shovels helped. Often but a few loads a day, and they small, could be forced to the banks...", "...This contention was again upheld, in the form of a violent polemic against the papacy, by the Centuriators of Magdeburg (_Ecclesiastica historia_, Basel, 1559-1574); the attempt at refutation by the Jesuit Torres (_Adversus Centur. Magdeburg. libri quinque_, Florence, 1572) provoked a violent rejoinder from the Protestant minister David Blondel (_Pseudo-Isidorus et Turrianus rapulantes_, Geneva, 1620). Since then, the conclusion has been accepted, and all researches have been of an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> exclusively historical character. One by one the details are being precisely determined, and the question may now almost be said to be settled. Date. In the first place, an exact determination of the date of the collection has been arrived at. On the one hand, it cannot go back further than 847, the date of the False Capitularies, with which the author of the False Decretals was acquainted.[1] On the other hand, in a letter of Lupus, abbot of Ferrieres, written in 858,...", "...old man on the verge of the grave.\" \"Buchanan will be furious,\" said Benito. \"They say he's an old beau who wears a toupee and knee-breeches. All Washington that dares to do so will be laughing at him, especially the ladies.\" Benito returned from the office one foggy June evening with a copy of The Bulletin that contained a speech by Broderick. It was dusk and Alice had lighted the lamp to read the Washington dispatch as she always did with eager interest, when there came a light, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> stealthy knock at the door. Benito, rather startled, opened it. There stood a Chinese youth of about 18, wrapped in a huge disguising cloak. He bowed low several times, then held forth a letter addressed in brush-fashioned, India-ink letters to \"B. Windham Esquire.\" Curiously he opened it and read: \"The hand of the 'avenger' has smitten. I have not long to live. Will you, in your honorable kindness, protect my nephew, Po Lun? He will make a good and faithful servant,...", "...led to the wood. It was a brilliant moonlight night, and he walked on under the majestic beauty of the firmament with quieted spirit. Suddenly, as he had almost reached the wood, he heard rapid hoof-beats behind him and paused to listen, for it was a little-travelled road. Nearer and nearer they came, and then he could distinguish a white dress fluttering in the wind from the flying animal's back and knew the rider must be a woman. The speed of the horse began to slacken as she was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> upon him, and he saw that it was Gyp and Nancy! She also had recognized him, and the next instant she sprang from the pony and stood beside him. \"Oh, Steve,\" she panted, \"they will kill you!\" and stretched her shaking hands out to him. Her agitation was pitiable. Unconsciously he drew her instantly within his arms, while he said with equal unconsciousness: \"Why, Nancy, darling, what do you mean?\" For answer she dropped her head upon his breast and sobbed...", "...about this library. Our account of church libraries will appear inadequate if it is not borne in mind that we do not propose to go beyond the manuscript age. An excellent account of modern church libraries is given in English Church Furniture, in this series. Also see Clark, 257. Section II When gifts or bequests were received by a church or monastery, it was a beautiful custom to lay them, or something to represent them, upon the altar: \"a book, or turf, or, in fact, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> any portable object, was offered for property such as land; or a bough or twig of a tree, if the gift were a forest.\" King Offa's gift of churches to Worcester monastery in 780 was accompanied by a great book with golden clasps, with every probability a Bible.[1] A gift was made under similar circumstances in c. 1057, about the time Bishop Leofric was founding the library at Exeter, when Lady Godiva, the wife of another Leofric, restored some manors to Worcester, and with them...", "...that, as soon as possible after the close of the contest, their ships-of-war were dismantled, the topmasts and spars being formed into a double boom across the anchorage, so as to prevent approach.

On becoming acquainted with this fact, they bestowed upon me the not very complimentary title of 'El Diablo,' by which I was afterwards known amongst them.\" Two hundred and forty years before, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to a day, Sir Francis Drake--whom, of all English seamen, Lord Cochrane most resembled in chivalrous daring and in chivalrous hatred of oppression--had secretly led his little _Golden Hind_ into the harbour of Callao, and there despoiled a Spanish fleet of seventeen vessels; for which and for his other brave achievements he won the nickname of El Dracone. Drake the Dragon and Cochrane the Devil were kinsmen in noble hatred, and noble punishment, of Spanish wrong-doing....", "...to increase. Bob, however, beheld him dogging him still in the distance, for his pipe shed a wonderful red glow, which duskily illuminated his entire figure, like a lurid atmosphere of meteor. \"I wish the devil had his own, my boy,\" muttered the excited sexton, \"and I know well enough where you'd be.\" The next time he looked over his shoulder, to his dismay he observed the importunate stranger as close as ever upon his track. \"Confound you,\" cried the man of skulls and shovels, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> beside himself with rage and horror, \"what is it you want of me?\" The stranger appeared more confident, and kept wagging his head and extending both glass and bottle toward him as he drew near, and Bob Martin heard the horse snorting as it followed in the dark. \"Keep it to yourself, whatever it is, for there is neither grace nor luck about you,\" cried Bob Martin, freezing with terror; \"leave me alone, will you.\" And he fumbled in vain among the seething confusion of his...", "...and customs, in which we find ourselves enmeshed as soon as we begin to have any perception at all, and which, slight and almost invisible as it may seem, it is so hard to struggle with and so impossible to break through. It may be true, according to the poetical Platonism of Wordsworth, that \"heaven lies about us in our infancy\"; but we very soon leave it far behind us, and, as we approach manhood, sadly discover that we have grown up into a jurisdiction of a very different kind. In <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every region of the earth, indeed, it is literally true that \"shades of the prison-house begin to close upon the growing boy.\" As his faculties develope, he becomes more and more conscious of the deepening shadows, as well as of the grim walls that cast them on his soul, and his opening intelligence is earliest exercised in divining who built them first, and why they exist at all.

She made a feeble effort to withdraw it--and yielded. 'Will the day never come,' he pleaded, 'when the privilege of protecting you may be mine? when you will be the pride and joy of my life, as long as my life lasts?' He pressed her hand gently. She made no reply. The colour came and went on her face; her eyes were turned away from him. 'Have I been so unhappy as to offend you?' he asked. She answered that--she said, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in a whisper, 'No.' 'Have I distressed you?' 'You have made me think of the sad days that are gone.' She said no more; she only tried to withdraw her hand from his for the second time. He still held it; he lifted it to his lips. 'Can I never make you think of other days than those--of the happier days to come? Or, if you must think of the time that is passed, can you not look back to the time when I first loved you?' She sighed as he put the question. 'Spare me,...", "...in spite of himself. Spoil-sport, who appeared much astonished at these hesitations, barked two or three times without quitting his post, as if to protest against this humiliating retreat; but, being called by Dagobert, he hastened to rejoin the main body. It was now about five o'clock in the evening. A high wind swept thick masses of grayish, rainy cloud rapidly across the sky. The Boulevard de l'Hopital, which bordered on this portion of the convent-garden, was, as we before said, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> deserted. Dagobert, Agricola, and the serving girl could hold a private conference in this solitary place. The soldier did not disguise the extreme impatience that these delays occasioned in him. Hardly had they turned the corner of the street, when he said to Mother Bunch: \"Come, my child, explain yourself. I am upon hot coals.\" \"The house in which the daughters of Marshal Simon are confined is a convent, M.

It was almost dark before they reached the town, and the streets looked bright and cheerful, with their many gas lamps and electric lights shining out through the murky atmosphere. Everyone appeared to be busy with Christmas shopping, and the pavements were crowded with people gazing at the presents displayed in the windows: and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all seemed to be carrying a number of parcels. There was such a happy, cheery feeling in the air, in spite of the fog, that Patty felt inclined to smile at everybody she met, even the conductor who came to collect their fares, or the stout woman who sat next to her, and whose large basket was such an inconvenience.

He pondered the question for a week, and meanwhile the tins--to the secret disappointment of Mr. Evans--remained untouched in his yard. For the whole of the time he went about looking, as Mrs. Grummit expressed it, as though his dinner had disagreed with him. \"I've been talking to old Bill Smith,\" he said, suddenly, as he came in one night. Mrs. Grummit looked up, and noticed with wifely pleasure that he was looking <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> cheerful. \"He's given me a tip,\" said Mr. Grummit, with a faint smile; \"a copper mustn't come into a free-born Englishman's 'ouse unless he's invited.\" \"Wot of it?\" inquired his wife. \"You wasn't think of asking him in, was you?\" Mr. Grummit regarded her almost play-fully. \"If a copper comes in without being told to,\" he continued, \"he gets into trouble for it.

Mr. Grummit winked. \"Yes 'e will if...", "...details may be modified we can hardly suppose that the great features of the several specific areas, or their relations to each other {23} will be much affected; and these are what we have chiefly to consider as bearing on the questions here discussed. The first thing that strikes us on looking at the map, is, the small amount of overlapping of the several areas, and the isolation of many of the species; while the next most striking feature is the manner in which the Asiatic species <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> surround a vast area in which no jays are found. The only species with large areas, are the European _G. glandarius_ and the Asiatic _G. Brandti_. The former has three species overlapping it--in Algeria, in South-eastern and North-eastern Europe respectively. The Syrian jay (No. 4), is not known to occur anywhere with the black-headed jay (No. 3), and perhaps the two areas do not meet. The Persian jay (No. 5), is quite isolated.

Mrs. Ready was poor, and had already numbered thirty years, when she accepted the hand of her wealthy and despised partner. No wonder that Flora, who <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> adored her husband, and was a woman of simple habits and pretensions, should dislike Mrs. Ready: it would have been strange indeed if persons so differently constituted, could have met without antagonism. Mrs. Ready's harsh unfeminine voice and manners; her assumption of learning and superiority, without any real title to either, were very offensive to a proud sensitive mind, which rejected with disdain the patronage of such a woman.

The strain of poetry underlying the character of this strange, inscrutable man, his amazing love of Nature, his moments of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> womanish weakness and sentiment, astonished and mystified him. It was as if a hawk had acquired the utterly useless trick of fluting like a nightingale, and being himself wholly without imagination, he could not comprehend it in the smallest degree.

But that men can be found here in the free North, yea, more, in New England itself, to sympathize with them, to echo their degraded sentiments, and to wish to see the slave power supreme in the land, is what surpasses wonder, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> belief. Yet a portion of a large, old, and venerated party have come to be their miserable allies and claqueurs. The truth is, we may say and believe that slavery is a dire wrong, a foul injustice, done to a whole race, and therefore ought to die, but that does not tell one half of the damning story: the worst is this, that it gradually kills out the virtue, the manliness, the moral vitality of the nation that allows it; that it has done so in our own nation to an alarming...", "...had come to nothing, and he had been obliged to return to his native town. Ever since, Ellen and the old gentleman had lived in his memory as objects of the deepest spite;--the one for interfering, the other for having been the innocent cause; and he no sooner saw her in the post-office than he promised himself revenge, such revenge as only the meanest and most cowardly spirit could have taken pleasure in. His best way of distressing Ellen, he found, was through her horse; he had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> satisfied himself; but very naturally his feelings of spite had grown stronger and blunter with indulgence, and he meant to wind up with such a treatment of her pony, real or seeming, as he knew would give great pain to the pony's mistress. He was prevented.

They were at length, however, reinstated by the Thebans, who took their city from the Spartans, who had possessed it a long time, after having expelled all its inhabitants. Those who were dispersed in different regions of Greece, Italy, and Sicily, on the first notice given them, returned with incredible joy: animated by the love of their country, natural to all men, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as much by their hatred of the Spartans, which length of time had only increased. They built themselves a city, which, from the ancient name, was called Messene. After their return they fell out with the Achaians, and having worsted their celebrated general, Philopoemen, they had the meanness and atrocity to put him to death. His history is thus related by Rollin:-- \"Dinocrates, the Messenian, had drawn off Messene from the Achaian league; and was meditating how he might...", "...with the British army. With the full intention of placing his resignation in the hands of the Secretary of State for War, as well as to interview King Leopold, he left Palestine at the end of the year 1883. He was travelling on the last night of the old year, and he tells us that he spent that night in prayer in the railway carriage, of which he was the solitary occupant. As the new year was ushered in, the lonely traveller between Genoa and Brussels little thought that it was to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> his last,[11] and that soon he would be permitted to throw off the earthly tabernacle, and put on the crown of glory. His active brain was busily employed at this time in considering how best he could wage war with human cruelty. He was to have started on January 26, 1885, for the Congo, but a telegram reached him at his sister's house at Southampton, from Lord Wolseley, requesting his presence in London, as an outcry was being made by certain well-informed persons that the only...", "...was fortunate enough not to overhear this.

On the other side of the road is the sea, and this is the saving clause at Littlestone. It is not beautiful--very far from it--but we are right on the edge of the sea; we snuff it fresh and salt in our nostrils, and can <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> believe that one wave, just a little larger than the others, could overwhelm the road and the terrace and the very links themselves. Yet, though we are so near the sea, and there is as much sea and sand as anyone could wish, the course itself has just the suspicion of an inland look. The fairway is so beautifully flat and shaven and runs so straight and so precisely between two lines of thick tufty grass, which might at certain seasons be irreverently called hay. The soil...", "...spoke with affected raillery, though her own mind was in a seethe. \"At last we meet again! And how magnificent we are in our gorgeous uniform!

What a pity I didn't wait a little!\" Forbes was hurt at her flippancy. He smiled dismally, and she purred on: \"I assure you your title and your wealth are vastly becoming; <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as becoming as all these buttons and epaulettes and things.\" She walked around him, looking him over like an inspecting officer. \"Um-m! How very nice! Magnificent!\" \"Oh, I beg of you--\" Forbes protested, tortured with chagrin. But she went on, \"And a sword, too!\" She ventured even to pull the blade a little way from its scabbard. He would have killed a man for doing that, and he almost wanted to kill Persis as she tantalized him with a strange mixture of ridicule and...", "...the word \"spiritual\" is so stretched as to cover temporal possessions, not the possessions which are truly spiritual because of faith, but those which are in the second or external Church,[39] and such possessions are called \"spiritual\" or Church possessions.[40] Again, the possessions of the laity are called \"worldly,\" although the laymen who are in the first or spiritual Church[39] are much better than the worldly clergy and are truly spiritual. After this fashion it now goes with <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all the works and the government of the Church;[39] and the name \"spiritual possessions\" has been so exclusively applied to worldly possessions that now no one understands it to mean anything else, and this has gone so far that men regard neither the spiritual nor the external Church any more, and they squabble and quarrel about temporal possessions like the heathen, and say, they do it for the sake of the Church and of spiritual possessions.

In reality he has his special inclinations and dreads. 7. The majority of people are influenced mainly by the group with which they have cast their positions, the blame of others being relatively unimportant or arousing anger. For there is this great difference between our reactions to praise and blame: that while the praise of almost any one and for <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> any quality is welcome, the blame of only a few is taken \"well,\" and for the rest there is anger, contempt or defiance. The influence of blame varies with the respect, love and especially acknowledged superiority of the blamer. The \"boss\" has a right to blame and so has father or mother while we are children, but we resent bitterly the blame of a fellow employee; \"he has no right to blame,\" and we rebel against the blame of our parents when we grow up.

Unquestionably, a maiden aunt is the best possible promoter of that nice sense of the proprieties, those right feelings and carefully graduated moral sentiments which are indispensable to a homeless, penniless young woman scrambling for a living. But Perdita, in presenting her relative, had almost flippantly disregarded these considerations involving a sense of universal fitness. It was a far cry, really an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> revolutionary distance, one felt, from the silver-haired mother or rather acid maiden aunt to Eugene Gresham. Eugene Gresham! Fancy! For Eugene had returned to his native land with the recognition of Paris and London, even their acclaim--golden bay leaves and purple cloaks. Therefore was he thrice welcomed of New York. Therefore, the next presumption followed as naturally as the first. It was out of the question that Mrs. Hepworth, whose beauty was a matter of international...", "...was the only officer who remained with him. Neither of the vessels appeared to have observed the flag flying from the fort; at all events, they took no notice of it. Both were too far off for the guns to reach them, or Commander Olding would not have allowed the pirate to pass unquestioned. The wind, which had been blowing fresh in the morning, as the day advanced decreased, and by the time the two vessels were about three or four miles to the southward of the island it fell <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to a dead calm. They were still, however, at some distance from each other, but their guns could be heard as they exchanged shots; the headmost vessel firing her stern guns, and the other her bow-chasers, but, as far as could be seen at that distance, without inflicting much damage on the other. No sooner did the commander perceive the state of affairs than, calling his two lieutenants and the master, he proposed attacking the pirate with their three boats. \"If you will...", "...flowers, and lay wreaths of cedar round the plates.

She came dressed very smartly in red calico, with a blue bow at her throat. Her hair was remarkably glossy, and she told us, in a loud whisper, she had \"stuck it down with bear's grease and cologne.\" She brought her old tin pail, the very one she picked currants in, only it really had a cover on it now, and _that_ was what she called \"a covered dish.\" And guess what was in it? _Pumpkin sauce!_ The drollest looking mess.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a minute there was silence. Nobody moved in the big room, where the shadows wavered as the faint flickering lamplight rose and fell, and there was no sound but the doleful wail of the night wind from the prairie. It was broken by a dull crash that was repeated a moment later, and the men looked at one another. \"They've brought their axes along,\" said somebody. \"If there's any of the Michigan boys around they'll drive that door in.\" \"Watch it, two of you,\" said Torrance....", "...fact, the whole system was in such a state of congestion that it could not be tolerated any longer, and we had a small, but which might have been a very large revolution, in amending that state of things.

Whipping sixty Lipans was one thing; attacking them with a strong force of pale-face riflemen to help them was quite another. \"What Send Warning say do?\" \"Do?\" <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> sharply exclaimed Murray, with his eyes upon the retreating form of Mother Dolores. \"I'll tell you.

Better than Rosamond, better even than Charlie, was his mother as a confidante; and though she had been surprised into her affectionate acceptance of Eleonora, it was an indescribable delight to mother and son to find themselves once more in full sympathy; while he poured out all that had been pent up ever since his winter at Rockpier. She <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> made common cause with him in the question, what would Raymond say? And it proved to be news to her that her eldest son was to be immediately expected at home. Cecil had not come to see her, and had sent her no message; but ungracious inattention was not so uncommon as to excite much remark from one who never wished to take heed to it; and it was soon forgotten in the praise of Eleonora. Cecil meanwhile was receiving Raymond at the station. He was pleased to see her there...", "...On the contrary, it has been contended that the plants have shown unusual sturdiness, notwithstanding the amount of reserve material the bulbs must have expended before the leaves were able to reach the light. It is natural that bulbs that are left in beds and borders for a few years without lifting should be found at a greater depth than is generally recommended for the planting of new bulbs. In the course of time the soil is turned up more or less deeply, and any bulbs in it are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> sure to be buried deeper than they were before; or frequent top dressings of soil or manure may have been given, and thus place the bulbs still further from the light. It is possible, however, that bulbs get buried deeply owing to the downward pull of their own contractile roots referred to below. Although I am not going to recommend very deep planting, there is one great advantage in having bulbs in the open air well covered with soil, viz., that the temperature of the soil...", "...day something happened that stopped our playing _Robinson Crusoe_ or anything else for a long time. Mother had sent Billy on an errand a long way off, Kate Ames was sick, and Teddy had to stay at home to amuse her, and I was in the house, in the sitting-room with mother. The morning had been very pleasant and warm, and though I wished we were all together in the cellar at play, I was quite contented with a book called _Beechnut_, a Franconia story, and I was thinking that Beechnut was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> just like Billy. Mother laid down her sewing, and went out of the room, patting my cheek with her kind hand as she passed, to tell Biddy something about dinner.

It's so academic.\" \"It's so cheap,\" the other fellow amended; but Duncan did n't mind him and became <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> sentimental on the subject. Well, I felt sorry for Duncan. We had hardly begun on our turkey and cranberry sauce when two of the colored waiters got into the most dreadful fight and rushed at each other with drawn forks.

At the extreme end of Tacon, which, by the way, is sometimes as animated with carriages and pedestrians as the Champs ElyseA(C)s, are the Botanical Gardens, which are surprisingly fine. Imagine all the conservatories of Kew and the Crystal Palace without their glass roofs, and you may then form a vague notion of the glories of these gardens. There is an avenue of cocoa palms here which is of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unearthly beauty. I remember seeing these Gardens illuminated for a _fiesta_ with myriads of coloured lights, and surpassing in fairylike beauty any transformation scene ever devised at dear old Drury. The stems of the palm trees, \"all set in a stately row,\" seemed converted into pillars of gold, and, far above, a good hundred feet and more, scintillated clusters of tiny lamps, like jewels among their waving fronds.

The coal-black, fiery-eyed steed plunged and reared; its nostrils snorted steam; white frothy flakes fell from its mouth all over its breast; its long waving tail reached <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the ground. Kemeny swung himself into the saddle, drew his sword, and galloped to the front. Every one was amazed at his skilful horsemanship; he seemed to have been grafted on to his stallion, so perfectly did all his movements correspond with its gambols. On reaching the front, the stately charger fell into a mincing pace, sharply striking the ground behind it with its prancing hoofs, and nodding its head as if saluting the host, which broke with one accord into a loud...", "...of sandal. It consists of a simple oblong piece of thick leather, perforated at the sides and ends to allow of straps being drawn through, crosswise over the instep and round the ankle, and half way up the leg, to the knee, either in circular bands or crosswise, the foot and leg being encased in a more or less loose stocking or hose, in many instances the whole of the leg being cross gartered.

It consisted of a piece of raw cowhide, with a leather thong fastened at the heel, threaded along the upper edge, drawing the shoe like a purse over the foot.

For the brightest examples of this quality alone we must look to the small violins of Antonius and Hieronymus, and also of Nicholas Amati.

A great player can really sing on these with such a delightful effect as <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to compensate for the want of speech. The third point is purity of tone. We may be said to have touched upon this already in treating of the other two. But it is necessary to allude to this also, because it is possible to have purity of tone without sweetness or power. There are many instruments which from age and use have lost all harshness or roughness of tone, but are still of a thin piercing quality. These may be said to be pure in tone, but not possessing the other...", "...and he sank back on the sofa, overwhelmed with dismay. Just then his wife and sister entered and, thrusting the book into their hands, he eagerly demanded what they thought of it.

What was the chief cause of the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> universal failure to understand Browning? Many reasons are assigned. His themes were such as had never before been found in poetry, his allusions and illustrations so unfamiliar as to presuppose wide knowledge on the part of the reader; he had a very concise and abrupt way of stating things. Yet, after all, were these the chief causes? Was he not obscure because he had chosen a new or unusual dramatic form? Nearly every one of his poems is written in the form of a monologue,...", "...Temple. CHAPTER XXXV. CONCLUSION. SHORTLY after the interment of his daughter, Mr. Temple, with his dear little charge and her nurse, set forward for England. It would be impossible to do justice to the meeting scene between him, his Lucy, and her aged father. Every heart of sensibility can easily conceive their feelings. After the first tumult of grief was subsided, Mrs. Temple gave up the chief of her time to her grand-child, and as she grew up and improved, began to <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> fancy she again possessed her Charlotte. It was about ten years after these painful events, that Mr. and Mrs. Temple, having buried their father, were obliged to come to London on particular business, and brought the little Lucy with them. They had been walking one evening, when on their return they found a poor wretch sitting on the steps of the door. She attempted to rise as they approached, but from extreme weakness was unable, and after several fruitless efforts fell back...", "...the veil that circled the island shimmered and twisted as if it was about to collapse.

The history of the nation commences with the conquest of Brandenburg by the Saxon emperor Henry I., in 927. He founded the so-called _North Mark_, and set over it a margrave. The government was administered by margraves until 1411, when, after a century of anarchy, during which the Mark was struggled for by many aspiring dukes, it was delivered over by the emperor Sigismund, an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> worthless possession, to Frederick of Hohenzollern, burggrave of Nuremberg, with the title of elector. The house of Hohenzollern is still the reigning dynasty. In 1701, Frederick III., who became elector in 1688, secured from the emperor Leopold I. the title of King Frederick I.

It was a very large building, dating back from the commencement of the previous century, with a lofty lower story, to which led a double flight of broad steps, above which was a second story richly decorated with stucco ornaments--a style, however, that did not exactly harmonize with the peaked roof and irregular attic windows. From this central building a wing extended at right angles on the left <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the avenue of elms, while the right wing, which, as I afterward learned, had been destroyed by a great fire, was replaced by a clumsy square tower three stories high. Yet this tower bore above its four gables a gigantic cupola, garnished with pinnacles and battlements of all sorts, which gave it an air of chivalrous boldness. A servant in a light-green livery received me at the top of the steps, said that his master was expecting me, and ushered me into the house with...", "...distressed, Mr. Graham. There isn't the slightest chance for him. You see I repaired the lock, and, as soon as it was day, closed the room and went outside to look for signs. Since nightfall no one had come legitimately through the court except Doctor Groom and myself. Our footprints were all right--making a straight line along the path to the front door. In the soft earth by the fountain I found another and a smaller print, made by a very neat shoe, sir, and I said to myself: 'There is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certainly the footprint of the murderer.' \"There were plenty of others coming across the grass. He'd evidently avoided the path. And there was one directly under the open window where the body lies. It's still there. Perhaps you can see it. No matter. That's the last one I found. The prints ceased there. There wasn't a one going back, and I was fair up a stump. Then I saw a little undefined sign of pressure on the grass, and I got an idea. 'Suppose,' I says, 'my man took his...", "...\"What a lover!\" she said; and pride in him and in her own womanhood was in her voice. \"Look at that, Dede.\" He removed one encircling arm and swept it in a wide gesture over the valley and the mountains beyond. \"The Valley of the Moon--a good name, a good name. Do you know, when I look out over it all, and think of you and of all it means, it kind of makes me ache in the throat, and I have things in my heart I can't find the words to say, and I have a feeling that I can <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> understand Browning and those other high-flying poet-fellows. Look at Hood Mountain there, just where the sun's striking. It was down in that crease that we found the spring.\" \"And that was the night you didn't milk the cows till ten o'clock,\" she laughed. \"And if you keep me here much longer, supper won't be any earlier than it was that night.\" Both arose from the bench, and Daylight caught up the milk-pail from the nail by the door. He paused a moment longer to look...", "...of the villagers came to their doors and looked with an ox-like kind of wonder after us, but just then the first open growl of the tempest sounded, the premature blackness of the evening was split wide open by a sudden flash, and the rain began to fall as it can only fall in mountain countries and in the tropics, I suppose the inhabitants simply thought we were flying from the storm, and, anyway, at the first sign of it they slammed and fastened their doors, and we raced on, drenched <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the skin in the first minute. Brunow knew the inn, of course, and was recognized immediately on his arrival. The fat hostess, stolid as she looked, seemed glad to see him; and her pretty daughter, who looked in the characteristic costume of the country as if she had just stepped off the stage or was just ready to step on to it, received him with demure smiles and blushes. He was quite a lion among the ladies, was Brunow, and I had no doubt he had been doing some little...", "...that of writing upon a slate. In my case the illusion was perfect. During the examination of the message, the medium has ample opportunity to secrete the false pad and the clamp in his pocket. Instead of having a servant bring the slate to him and making the exchange described above, he may have the trick slate concealed about him before the seance begins, with the message written on it, and adroitly make the substitution while the sitter is engaged in lowering the light. Dr. Slade <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invariably adopted the first-mentioned exchange, because it enabled his confederate to write a lucid message to the sitter. An examination of the sitter's overcoat in the hall frequently yielded valuable information in the way of names and initials extracted from letters, sealed or unsealed. Sealed letters? Yes; it is an easy matter to steam a gummed envelope, open it, and seal it again. Another method is to wet the sealed envelope with a sponge dipped in alcohol.

And when either of us wants a bit to put on a gown,--like this, for example,--why, there it is, all ready.\" \"It seems wanton; it seems <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> criminal,\" said Mrs. Delansing, with energy, \"to keep valuable lace shut up in a mouldering country-house. I--it distresses me to think of it. I shall feel it a point of duty to write to your mother.\" Hildegarde wondered what her aunt would feel it her duty to say. It was hardly her mother's fault that the lace had been left to her; it seemed even doubtful whether she should be expected to mould her life upon the lines of lace; but this seemed an unsafe point to suggest....", "...o'clock on the following afternoon, and even as he entered the room, she was conscious of a slight disappointment because, in some perfectly indefinable way, he was different from what she had hoped that he would be. \"This is the first peaceful moment I have had for twenty-four hours,\" he remarked, as he flung himself into a chair before the small wood fire; \"a man I knew was inconsiderate enough to die and make me the guardian of his son, and I've had to overhaul the chap's property <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> before the funeral was over.\" A frown of nervous irritation wrinkled his forehead, but as he turned to her it faded quickly before the kindling animation in his look. \"By Jove, I've thought of you every single minute since I was here,\" he pursued. \"What a persistent way you have of interfering with a fellow's peace of mind. I've known nothing like it in my life.\" \"I hope at least I didn't damage the property,\" she observed, and almost with the words she wondered why she had...", "...Bienvenu's resistance, came forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning:-- \"Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor. He who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.\" The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized with a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a tear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down his livid cheek, and he said, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in a stammer, quite low, and to himself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:-- \"O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!\" The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock. After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:-- \"The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person would be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is God.\" The dying man had...", "...which had a name or even the initials to give them a clue.

Did you know of anyone by that name?\" \"I don't remember anyone by that name. The name is not an unusual one to begin with a V.\" The Professor did not recall anyone by that name. The box was handed around, and when John saw it, he started as though he had been struck. He reached for it and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> grasped it from the Professor's hand, and turned it over and over, and glanced at the initials, and then looked at the Professor, and then at the boys, and his eyes ceased their wanderings as he gazed at the chief. [Illustration: _Fig. 2. The match safe._] Could it be possible that his name was John L. V.? Was that his match safe? What a wonderful possibility lay in these two happenings which came so close together! The chief, too, looked at the match safe, and when the...", "...that attracted Jerry's attention. Lying on a cot in the room was a man whose head was done up in bandages, while holding the door open was another wounded man leaning on a crutch. The latter caught one view of Jerry, and then the door was slammed shut with a bang. At the same instant there sounded that loud cry that Jerry had heard once before. His blood was chilled as the echoes vibrated through the old barn. CHAPTER XXVII THE CAPTURE For one instant Jerry Hopkins was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> inclined to believe that what he had seen was part of a dream. Then as the nerve-racking yells continued to vibrate through the barn, he knew that they came from real men. And the faces of those men! It was like some vision of the night. He racked his brain for a remembrance. \"Where have I seen them before--those wounded men? I'm sure----\" He paused irresolutely. His musing was interrupted by the breathless entrance of Ned and Bob. \"Jerry!\" cried the stout lad. \"Are...", "...to drop down over the front of his flight helmet. Then he reached up and wedged the silvered portion against the lens. The camera would continue to operate, relaying back no malfunction signals, but it would be sending a picture of the ceiling.

Inside were the six taffy-colored bars of C-4 plastic explosive, each an inch square and six inches long, all wrapped in clear Cellophane. They <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> looked like candy, but they could blow this entire plane through the hangar's roof. The charge had to be set before the two Mino-gumi pilots were delivered by the Personnel Module. When they arrived, he'd simply pretend to be Yuri Androv and say they all had to go back down for a final check of their pressure-suit environmental systems. The moment they were clear, he'd activate the radio and detonate. Then the fun would begin. There. The two consoles on either side of the...", "...The Dobruja plateau in southwestern Romania is the country's least important farming area. Although soils are generally fertile, cultivation is limited by inadequate rainfall. Grain, sunflowers, and legumes are grown in this area. To combat the destructive effects of recurrent droughts, a large-scale program of irrigation was undertaken by the government. Execution of the program, however, has consistently lagged behind the plans. LAND USE In 1970 agricultural land comprised <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> 37 million acres (63 percent of the country), about two-thirds of which was arable. The balance was devoted to pastures, meadows, vineyards, and orchards. During the decade of the 1960s substantial additions to the agricultural area were made through various land improvement measures. At the same time, however, large acreages were diverted to industrial and residential uses, particularly of the more valuable arable land. The net result was an increase in the total farmland area,...", "...to it, for he went straight on: \"So I feel as if the blame for what's happened is most of it mine. I reckon I was too old to be thinking about getting married in the first place. And I wasn't very well off then either--not well enough off to have the money I should've had if I expected to make Luella contented. Still, all that part of it's got nothing to do with the matter as it stands--I'm just telling it to you, Judge, as a friend.\" \"I understand, Lysandy,\" said Judge Priest <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in the tone which he might have used to an unhappy child. \"This is all a strict confidence between us two and this is all the further it'll ever go, so fur ez I'm concerned, without you authorise me to speak of it.\" He waited for what would come next. It came in slow, steady sentences, with the regularity of a statement painfully rehearsed beforehand: \"Judge Priest, I've never been a believer in divorce as a general thing. It seemed to me there was too much of that sort of...", "...to supper, they consented. After supper, at which the guests drank rather freely, Murtagh said that, as he had not the least wish to win their money, he intended to give them their revenge; he would not play at cards with them, he added, but at a funny game of thimbles, at which they would be sure of winning back their own; then going out, he brought in a table, tall and narrow, on which placing certain thimbles and a pea, he proposed that they should stake whatever they pleased on the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certainty of finding the pea under the thimbles. The leaders, after some hesitation, consented, and were at first eminently successful, winning back the greater part of what they had lost; after some time, however, Fortune, or rather Murtagh, turned against them, and then instead of leaving off, they doubled and trebled their stakes, and continued doing so until they had lost nearly the whole of their funds. Quite furious, they now swore that Murtagh had cheated them, and...", "...Jesus by removing him from our human sympathies; they should not degrade his life and dialogues by insulation and peculiarity.

Hosea reproaches the Jews for believing in it: \"My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their _staff_ declareth it unto them.\" (IV. 12.) It was a custom in vogue among the Chaldeans, among <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every nation with any pretence to scientific knowledge, and also among the wilder or ruder races, as the Alani and the ancient Germans. Dr. Henry states that after the Saxons and Danes had embraced Christianity, the priests were commanded by their ecclesiastical superiors to preach very frequently against _diviners_, sorcerers, augurers, and \"all the filth of the wicked and the dotages of the Gentiles.\" The divining rod, _virgula divina_, or _baculus divinatorius_, was a forked...", "...always far from her, and who has already that sweet look of devotion which men have never been able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an object almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren.

But the pen <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> drops from her hand, and the high cold words have no meaning for her, and her true children are those others, among whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honour came to her, with that look of wistful inquiry on their irregular faces which you see in startled animals--gipsy children, such as those who, in Apennine villages, still hold out their long brown arms to beg of you, but on Sundays become enfants du choeur, with their thick black hair nicely combed, and fair white linen...", "...been discovered on the photosphere of the sun. Indeed, there are a few small stars which afford a spectrum of bright lines instead of dark ones, and this we know denotes a gaseous or vaporized state of things, from which it may be inferred that such orbs are in a different condition from most of their relations. And as, if for the very purpose of throwing light upon this interesting question, an event of the most striking character occurred in the heavens, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as soon as the spectroscopists were prepared to interpret it correctly. On the 12th of May, 1866, a great conflagration, infinitely larger than that of London or Moscow, was announced. To use the expression of a distinguished astronomer, a world was found to be on fire! A star, which till then had shone weakly and unobtrusively in the _corona borealis_, suddenly blazed up into a luminary of the second magnitude. In the course of three days from its...", "...not there, that the room was dark and very heavy, that some bell was ringing in his ear. . . . Then about him a thousand voices were murmuring: \"Tell her--tell her--tell her the truth.\" With a last effort he tried to cry \"I will not tell her.\" His lips broke on her name \"Margaret.\" Then, with a little sigh, tumbling forward, he fainted. CHAPTER XIII MRS. CRAVEN 1 Afterwards, lying in his easy chair before his fire, he was allowed a brief and beautiful respite. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as though he were already dead--as though, consciously, he might lie there, apart from the world, freed from the eternal pursuit, at last unharassed, and hold, with both hands, that glorious certainty--Margaret. He had a picture of her now. He was lying where he had tumbled, there on the floor with the silver trays and boxes, the odd tables, the gimcrack chairs all about him. Slowly he had opened his eyes and had gazed, instantly, as though the gates of heaven had rolled back...", "...with the water streaming from the platform and swishing through the machinery, and all on board drenched to the skin.

And the hind-sweepman, doing his part, responded, with all the weight of body and strength he possessed, to Bruce's low-voiced orders <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> before they had left his lips. Quick and tremendous action was imperative for there were places where a single instant's tardiness meant destruction. There was no time in that mad rush to rectify mistakes. A miscalculation, a stroke of the sweep too little or too much, would send the heavily loaded boat with that tremendous, terrifying force behind it, crashing and splintering on a rock like a flimsy-bottomed strawberry box. For all of seven miles Bruce never lifted his...", "...lives. And living or dead, the Ralas will pay soon for this and for all they've done upon this world in ages. Their time nears--yes.\" He led Norman, excited throngs of the green men about them, into the great building from which he had emerged. There were big rooms inside, workshops and laboratories that Norman but vaguely glimpsed in passing. The room to which the other led him was one with a long metal couch. Norman stretched protestingly upon it at the other's bidding, drifted off <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> at once into sleep. He woke to find the sunlight that had filled the room gone and replaced by the silvery Earth-light. From the window he saw that the silver-lit city outside now held tremendous activity, immense hordes of green men surging through it with masses of weapons and equipment, flying-boats pouring down out of the night from all directions. He turned as the door of the room clicked open behind him. It was his old friend Fellows. \"I thought you'd be awake by now,...", "...queer. For the matter of that, she don't mind a spree herself at times.\" And, emptying his glass, the libertine laughed at the remembrance of some past orgies. While he was thus, in his half-drunken mood, consoling himself for present perplexities by dwelling upon the bacchanalian joys of other days, a carriage drove up the street, and stopped before the door. Soon afterward, the hall bell was rung, and Philip, alarmed and astonished, started from his seat. \"Who's that?\" he asked, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in a whisper. \"Don't know,\" replied his companion. \"She couldn't have traced me here already--unless you have betrayed me, Bradshaw,\" he added suddenly, darting a suspicious glance upon his comrade. \"You're just drunk enough to be a fool,\" replied Bradshaw, rising from his seat, as a second summons, more violent than the first, echoed through the corridors. \"I'll go down and see what's the matter. Some one's mistaken the house, I suppose. That's all.\" \"Let no one in,...", "...member of the household. During the last two or three years various fanciers have been industriously endeavouring to improve the breed, and they have succeeded in producing the most beautiful specimens. The show mouse is larger than the common household specimen. The eye is much larger and fuller, and the coat would not disgrace a thoroughbred racer. But the chief points are colour and marking. These are simply wonderful. The self colours include not only black and white, but <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every shade between. The black specimens have rich silky coats. The white to be at all valuable must possess black eyes. The pink eye has been eliminated altogether. [Illustration: (1) MOUSE CHALLENGE CUP. (2) A MOUSE WITH TWO TAILS.

The primary causes of the rebellion are not to be found in their supineness or misconduct, but in the two great sins of the English government; in the penal laws as to religion which pressed on <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the whole people, and in the systematic iniquity which despoiled them of their possessions. They could not be expected to miss such an occasion of revolt; it was an hour of revolution, when liberty was won by arms, and ancient laws were set at nought; the very success of their worst enemies, the covenanters in Scotland, seemed the assurance of their own victory, as it was the reproach of their submission.[544] _Rebellion of 1641._--The rebellion broke out, as is well known, by...", "...before the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on February 22, 1908.

His childhood and youth were passed in the city of New York, as was a great part of his working life; and though his origin was foreign, lifelong associations had stamped him indelibly an American. The greater part of his work was done in America; <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all of it was done for America; and I do not think it is fancy that sees in his art the expression of a distinctively American spirit. Yet from his mixed French and Irish blood he may well have derived that mingling of the Latin sense of form with a Celtic depth of sentiment which was so markedly characteristic of his genius. His father, Bernard Paul Ernest Saint-Gaudens, was a shoemaker from the little town of Aspet in Haute-Garonne, only a few miles from the town of...", "...the battlefield began to present grand and inspiring effects. The troops were debouching rapidly from the woods, their bayonets gleaming here and there through the dust raised by their hurrying feet, and burning in serried lines when they were ranged under the cloudless sun. In every movement made by every soldier the metal points in his accoutrements flashed and scintillated. Again there was something very spirited in the appearance of a battery rushed into position at a gallop--the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> instantaneous unlimbering, the caissons moving to the rear, and the guns at the same moment thundering their defiance, while the smoke, lifting slowly on the heavy air, rises and blends with that of the other side, and hangs like a pall to leeward of the field. The grandest thing of all, however, was the change in the men. The uncouth, coarsely jesting, blackberry-picking fellows that lagged and straggled to the battle became soldiers in their instincts and rising excitement and...", "...The increasing crowd stimulated one another to ferocity and barbarity. Insults, oaths, and imprecations incessantly fell upon the ears of the captives. The queen probably endured as much of mental agony that night as the human mind is capable of enduring. The conflict of indignation, terror, and despair was so dreadful, that her hair, which the night previous had been auburn, was in the morning white as snow. This extraordinary fact is well attested, and indicates an enormity of woe <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> incomprehensible. There was no knowledge in Paris of the king's departure until seven o'clock in the morning, when the servants of the palace entered the apartments of the king and queen, and found the beds undisturbed and the rooms deserted. The alarm spread like wildfire through the palace and through the city. The alarm bells were rung, cannon were fired, and the cry resounded through the streets, \"The king has fled! the king has fled!\" The terrified populace were expecting...", "...we commenced the ascent of Mangerton, a mountain some 2,550 feet high. We were now all mounted on ponies, who were very sagacious and sure-footed, and climbed the rocky, narrow path like goats. We were followed every step of the way by a host of lads and girls, carrying jugs and cups of milk and whisky, which they offered to us at almost every moment. The greatest curiosity upon this mountain is a little lake, near the summit, called, \"The Devil's Punch-Bowl.\" It is surrounded by <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> perpendicular rocks; the water is very dark, and is said to be unfathomable. Though so completely shut in, it is never calm, and though icy cold in summer, it never freezes in winter. From the summit, we had a vast, magnificent view, which, however, I must confess, I enjoyed less than the wild, frolicking ride which I took soon after, down the mountain, following closely upon the steps of one of my friends, who, for mischief, went far out of the path, and took his way over...", "...in addition to other advantages the Contra-Remonstrants had now got a good cry--an inestimable privilege in party contests. \"There are two factions in the land,\" said Maurice, \"that of Orange and that of Spain, and the two chiefs of the Spanish faction are those political and priestly Arminians, Uytenbogaert and Oldenbarneveld.\" Orange and Spain! the one name associated with all that was most venerated and beloved throughout the country, for William the Silent since his death was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a god; the other ineradicably entwined at that moment with, everything execrated throughout the land. The Prince of Orange's claim to be head of the Orange faction could hardly be disputed, but it was a master stroke of political malice to fix the stigma of Spanish partisanship on the Advocate.

There was actually Duchess, his old polo pony whom he had not seen since he sold her three years ago, looking as spry as ever. John craned his neck to see the last of the bob-tail of his old favourite whisk round the corner. A moment later Mrs. Courtenay and Di, erect and fair beside her, spun past in the opposite direction. Before he had time to realize that he had seen her, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> before he had recognized her, the momentary glimpse struck him like a blow. His head swam, his heart, so languid the moment before, leapt up and struggled like a maddened caged animal. She had passed some time before he was conscious of anything but the one fact that he had seen her. He stumbled to his feet and walked unsteadily across the room, clutching at the furniture. He seemed to have left his legs behind. \"What am I doing?\" he said to himself half aloud, holding on to...", "...possible in the shade of the shrubberies, she gained the lodge, then the outer gates, a quarter of a mile further off, finding herself finally on the high road to Coombe.

She knew too what she meant to do, so she walked on without hesitating. \"I have nearly three pounds in my purse,\" she reflected. \"That will do. But I must get on as fast as I can. I don't suppose Madelene will miss me till about five o'clock; it must be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> that now, and if they sent along the road they might overtake me.\" She hastened her steps; there was a short cut to Coombe through the lanes, which she knew, and by walking very fast, she reached her destination without risk of being overtaken.

He was, however, obliged to listen to him, and he soon entertained quite different sentiments: he appeared <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> petrified with astonishment, while the earl was relating to him circumstances of such an extravagant indiscretion, as seemed to him quite incredible, notwithstanding the particulars of the fact. \"You have reason to be surprised at it,\" said my lord, concluding his story; \"but if you doubt the truth of what I tell you, it will be easy for you to find evidence that will convince you; for the scene of their tender familiarities was no less public than the room where the queen plays...", "...repeated here.--[See Mark Twain: A Biography, by the same author; Chapter XL.] \"Mark Twain\" was first signed to a Carson letter, February 2, 1863, and from that time was attached to all of Samuel Clemens's work.

I thought of the bitter sorrow she would suffer when she heard how he had died. Had he been killed in action with the enemies of his country, she would have mourned his loss long and deeply; for time, I knew, would soften such sorrow; but to hear that, weakly yielding to an abominable custom, he had died infringing the laws of God and man, would prove to a person with a mind and opinions such as hers <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unsupportable. \"It will kill her, it will kill her!\" I kept exclaiming to myself, and I could scarcely help wringing my hands and giving way to tears. I have often since thought, that if boys and men did but reflect more than they are apt to do of the sorrow and suffering which their acts may cause to those they leave at home, whom they love dearly, and on whom they would be really unwilling to inflict the slightest pain, they would often pause before they plunged into sin...", "...of every day. Even Bertie found himself breathing this strange, stagnant air. He wondered greatly what could have occurred. How simply, how easily, things had worked themselves out! He? No, he had done nothing; he could have done nothing. Events had merely followed each other. What had come about was the inevitable. And the possibility of a life free from care again lay before him; an eternity of comfort and wealth with Westhove, for whom he felt his old affection revive with the glow <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> of a passion, now that Frank, severed from Eva, though blaming himself indeed, needed consolation and sympathy. And Bertie's low, unctuous tones were full of sympathy. Oh, the dark melancholy of the first few days, the terrible grief of wondering, when now, his indignation cold, Frank asked himself, as Eva had asked herself, Why? Why, had this happened? What had he done? What had brought it about? And he could not see, could not understand; it was like a book out of which leaves...", "...that heralded the journey's end. The words acted as a signal. Like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madly towards some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug, and struggled frantically into his dishevelled garments.

A murderous conflict took place, on the 23d of August, at Gross-Beeren between the Prussian division under General von Bulow and the French. The Swedes, a troop of horse artillery alone excepted, were not brought into action, and the Prussians, unaided, repulsed the greatly superior forces of the French. The <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> untrained peasantry comprising the _Landwehr_ of the Mark and of Pomerania rushed upon the enemy, and, unhabituated to the use of the bayonet and firelock, beat down entire battalions of the French with the butt-end of their muskets. After a frightful massacre, the French were utterly routed and fled in wild disorder, but the gallant Prussians vainly expected the Swedes to aid in the pursuit. The crown prince, partly from a desire to spare his troops and partly from a feeling of...", "...quitting any scene in which deep feelings have been displayed, and in which our own have been not slightly interested, it is painful to feel called upon to make any comment on what has passed; we feel ashamed to do so in the strain and tone which would betray our own emotion, and we have not the heart to do so carelessly or indifferently. I should have felt this, even had I been sure that Ormiston's feelings towards Mary Russell had been nothing more than my own; whereas, in fact, I was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> sure of the contrary; in which case it was possible that, in his eyes, my own _locus standi_ in that quarter, surprised as I had been in an apparently very confidential interview, might seem to require some explanation which would be indelicate to ask for directly, and which it might not mend matters if I were to give indirectly without being asked. So we proceeded some paces up the little quiet street, gravely and silently, neither of us speaking a word. At last Ormiston asked...", "...from that smaller antagonism against Florentine enemies into which he continually fell in the unchecked excitement of the pulpit, and presented himself simply as appealing to the Christian world against a vicious exercise of ecclesiastical power.

We feel no doubt then what is the highest prize the soul can win; we <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> believe in our own power to attain it. By a new current of such enthusiasm Romola was helped through these difficult summer days. She had ventured on no words to Tito that would apprise him of her late interview with Baldassarre, and the revelation he had made to her. What would such agitating, difficult words win from him? No admission of the truth; nothing, probably, but a cool sarcasm about her sympathy with his assassin. Baldassarre was evidently helpless: the thing to...", "...sideways into me, almost upsetting us both. \"What on earth is the matter?\" I asked. \"Did you think the car was starting?\" He turned toward me a face upon which was imprinted the sheer, blank terror of a child. It passed in an instant however, and he laughed. \"I really didn't know. Everything has been so quiet always, out here in the country--and that horrible racket coming so suddenly--\" Laughing with him, I took his arm and we turned to enter the archway. As we did so we <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> ran into a tall man who was coming out, evidently intending to speak to one of the drivers. The stranger stepped back with a word of apology, and I took note of him for a fellow-countryman, and a worldly buck of fashion indeed, almost as cap-a-pie the automobilist as my mysterious spiller of cider had been the pedestrian. But this was no game-chicken; on the contrary (so far as a glance in the dusk of the archway revealed him), much the picture for framing in a club window of...", "...play at the same game, that is evident,\" cried Tyler, undismayed by their narrow escape. \"I will give them another shot or two, and then I fancy that it will be time for us to get ashore, for a well-aimed ball from the prahu might damage us severely and spoil our plans.\" For the third time he trained the six-pounder upon the enemy, and, waiting for a moment till the muzzle of the gun covered the prahu, he sent a shot screeching in her direction. Crash! Even at that distance he could <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> hear the missile strike upon her deck, and a keen glance showed him that the utmost confusion had resulted, for Malays could be seen rushing towards the spot, while a burly figure standing beside the tiller shook a fist furiously in the air. But whatever the damage done, it did not retard the course of the prahu.

The two faces would not be alike; and yet, as she looked again, was there not something similar about the foreheads and the lower line of the faces? Hastily pushing back her hair with one hand, she saw with joy that, excepting the eyebrows, there really was a likeness: the line where the hair began was certainly <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the same on both faces. \"Dear, dear old Donald! Why, we are just alike there! I'll show Uncle to-morrow. It's wonderful.\" Dorry laughed a happy little laugh, all by herself. \"Besides,\" she thought, as she laid the mirror away, \"we are alike, in our natures, and in our ways and in loving each other, and I don't care a bit what anybody says to the contrary.\" Thus braced, she drew her chair closer to the table and began a letter to Donald. A vague consciousness that by...", "...he is glad, therefore, to tread in the footsteps of some one else. Accordingly, the more deficient he is in either of these qualities, the more is he open to the influence of example; and we find, in fact, that most men's guiding star is the example of others; that their whole course of life, in great things and in small, comes in the end to be mere imitation; and that not even in the pettiest matters do they act according to their own judgment. Imitation and custom are the spring of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all human action. The cause of it is that men fight shy of all and any sort of reflection, and very properly mistrust their own discernment. At the same time this remarkably strong imitative instinct in man is a proof of his kinship with apes. But the kind of effect which example exercises depends upon a man's character, and thus it is that the same example may possibly seduce one man and deter another. An easy opportunity of observing this is afforded in the case of certain...", "...biographical portraits, is also a gem of Russian prose, exact in its observation, picturesque and perfectly balanced in its diction.

We see every hour of the day of his life in the country; we hear all the details of the family life, the marriage of his son, the domestic troubles of his sister.

Born in that moment of unreasoning terror, her free soul went with her. The streets were flooded with hot summer sunshine, the sky almost white.

It was Rodney Parker who gave her her money; the original seventeen dollars and fifty cents had swelled to <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> twenty-two dollars now. Martie hardly saw the gallant youth who congratulated her upon her becoming gipsy hat; mechanically she slipped her money into a pocket, mechanically started for the road to Pittsville.

One of these was very striking. It rose out of a wind-raked hollow to a height of fifty feet; just the shape of an ancient Athenian helmet. McLean took a photograph. As at Horn Bluff, the ice became thinner and freer of snow as we drew near the Point. The rocky wall under which the tent was raised proved to be three hundred feet high, jutting out from beneath the slopes of ice. From here the coast ran <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> south on one side and north-west on the other. On either hand there were dark faces corniced with snow. The next day was devoted to exploration. Adelie penguins waddled about the tide-crack over which we crossed to examine the rock, which was of coarse-grained granite, presenting great, vertical faces. Hundreds of snow petrels flew about and some stray skua gulls were seen. Near the camp, on thick ice, were several large blocks of granite which had floated out from the shore...", "...unfolded to me, and the better I became acquainted with the ship and my companions.

Was it an actuality that I saw all these things with my own eyes; or, was I dreaming? Was it really I, Allan Graham, standing there on the deck of the good ship Silver Queen, or somebody else?

Carlsen shrugged his shoulders. \"If you had your eyesight,\" he said <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> brutally, \"you could soon see that the skipper was in no condition to discuss matters, much less be present.\" \"Here's my eyesight,\" countered Lund. \"Mr. Rainey here.

The breeze was blowing in the same direction, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as strongly, as on the night before, but no moaning met their ears. Arriving at the cottage, they heard the characteristic whistle and hiss of wind playing about the eaves, but not the tuneful, mellow note that had reminded Pratt of an organ pipe.

In that small select and intellectual city the expenditures in direct aid of \"the poor,\" not counting work which was _made_ for them, was in dollars, $80,000, and that does not count a large sum besides given in private charity. This help was given to some 5,400 persons; stating it simply, in the words of political economy, one person in seven or eight of that cultivated and select community was a pauper.

Had the water been smooth it would have been easy for Jack to swim across the tide to the spar before he was swept below it, but he found at once that it was impossible to swim fast, so buffeted and tossed was he by the sea, while he was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> smothered by the spray carried by the wind to the top of the waves. He trod water for a moment with his back to the wind, took a deep breath, and then dived again. When he came up he was delighted to see that he was as near as possible in the line of the spar, which was towing but a few yards from him.

During the first half-hour the cold had caused her the most painful suffering. To this torture succeeded a sort of numbness at first very distressing; then soon followed a state of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> complete insensibility, an invincible torpor, which in such circumstances often proves a transition to death. Marie, brave as ever, preserved her presence of mind a long time and tried to divert her thoughts from the danger that she was running, saying to herself that at three o'clock in the morning there must necessarily be some stir in the house caused by the departure of M.

When Lilian was placed in the school he quickly discovered the possibilities of her mind, and for three years gave her a rigorous training. He then advised her father to send her to college. Mr. Coles was not blind to some of the advantages shrewdly presented by the little instructor. He laid the matter before a committee of elders of the society, and consent was finally given. Before her departure, Lilian was called into the presence of the elders, and her...", "...the whole the animal world preys upon the vegetable world, and is in a way parasitic upon it.

On the 21st of January 1903 Cardinal Richard publicly condemned the book, as not furnished with an _imprimatur_, and as calculated gravely to trouble the faith of the faithful in the fundamental Catholic dogmas.

The enemy tried hard that night to re-take the pits, but it was no go; they were met with a fire that mowed them down by wholesale; they then got the bayonet.

The people of whom Moses had on one occasion said, \"They be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> ready to stone me,\" when they now learned that their leader Moses was to die at the end of this war, tried to evade it, saying that they preferred to forego impending victory rather than to lose their leader, and each one hid himself, so as not to be picked out for this war.

The instant they reached the rocks where they found shelter Bucks drew back out of sight, and none too soon, for as he pulled himself away from the ledge, a rifle cracked viciously from below and the slug threw a chunk of granite <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> up into his face; the fat man was evidently having his innings. Bucks, out of immediate danger, lay perfectly still for a few moments casting up the strange situation he found himself in. Why the men should have acted as they had, was all a mystery, but thieves or outlaws they evidently were, and outlaws in this country he already well knew were men who would stop at nothing.

Gifted with passionate energy, with a boldness that was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> military in requiring good as well as evil actions from those about him, and justifying such demands on the theory of personal interest, he despised men too much, believing them all corruptible, he was too unscrupulous in the choice of means, thinking all equally good, he was too thoroughly convinced that the success of money was the absolution of all moral mechanism, not to attain his ends sooner or later.

He may be right; but the evil of it will be, the work, if exhaustive, will be exhausting. Especially will it be so in these busy times, when yesterday's biographies become stale to a public forgetful of the past, caring only for the present, oblivious of the morrow. It is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> an impertinence to speak of the many claims Mr. Gladstone has on a people whom he has served so long.

The church of St Mark has a nave with double aisles, and massive late Norman pillars and arches. The tower, which fell in 1628, was perhaps rebuilt by Inigo Jones.

In the 10th century Calne (_Canna_, _Kalne_) was the site of a palace of the West-Saxon kings. Calne was the scene of the synod of 978 when, during the discussion of the question of celibacy, the floor suddenly gave way beneath the councillors, leaving Archbishop Dunstan alone standing upon a beam. Here also a witenagemot was summoned in 997. In the Domesday Survey Calne appears as a royal borough; it...", "...She translated several exclamations of the ladies and gentlemen in German: they were entirely to the same effect.

I had always laughed at sculptured figures on horseback. This one overawed me. The Marshal was acknowledging the salute of his army after a famous victory over the infidel Turks. He sat upright, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> imperceptibly but effectively bending his head in harmony with the curve of his horse's neck, and his baton swept the air low in proud submission to the honours cast on him by his acclaiming soldiery. His three-cornered lace hat, curled wig, heavy-trimmed surcoat, and high boots, reminded me of Prince Eugene. No Prince Eugene--nay, nor Marlborough, had such a martial figure, such an animated high old warrior's visage. The bronze features reeked of battle.

It is first of all a slight story--not so slight as some of the later work, but nevertheless a mere episode expanded into a novelette; furthermore, it was written not so much for the displaying of movement of incident as for the analysis of movements of feeling and the growth of elements of character: \"I have to chronicle,\" he says at one point, \"another silent transition.\" Then too its ending suggests the French school: \"No, no, no,\" she <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> shrieked, turning about in the path. \"I forbid you to follow me.\" But for all that he went in. We stand uncertain, startled, piqued--then the suggestion comes surging over us: Perhaps the author means that she married him after all! Could she do it? Did she do it? And then we find with a thrill of surprise that he has given us the full answer in his previous analysis of her character.

Such an expanse of undiscovered land, believed to be rich in gold, awakened the resolution of Pedro Fernandez de Queiros, who had been a pilot in the Mendafia voyage of 1606.

Milly gathered from the struggle how much there was of the pity, and how therefore it was both in her tenderness and in her conscience that Mrs. Stringham suffered. Wonderful and beautiful it was that this impression instantly steadied the girl. Ruefully asking herself on what basis of ease, with the drop of their barrier, they were to find themselves together, she felt the question met with a relief that was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> joy. The basis, the inevitable basis, was that she was going to be sorry for Susie, who, to all appearance, had been condemned in so much more uncomfortable a manner to be sorry for _her_. Mrs. Stringham's sorrow would hurt Mrs. Stringham, but how could her own ever hurt? She had, the poor girl, at all events, on the spot, five minutes of exaltation in which she turned the tables on her friend with a pass of the hand, a gesture of an energy that made a wind in the air. \"Kate...", "...knowing the Sands as well as they do, they hope to be able to get clear of them and get the brig into deep water; but it is very difficult work, for with her rudder gone there is no power of steering her, and the weight of the lugger is scarcely sufficient to keep her head straight: they make a little progress, however, the tide being somewhat in their favour, but the tide is on the turn, and they will soon be driven back into their old position, if not in worse, and the men begin <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to despair of saving the vessel, when to their great satisfaction they see the Ramsgate steamboat and life-boat making their way round the North Foreland. The coastguard officer at Margate, when he saw that the Margate life-boat could not reach the brig, and knowing that if any sea got up where the vessel was, that the luggers could be of no use, telegraphed to Ramsgate that a vessel was on the Knock Sands. The steamer and life-boat get under weigh at once, and proceed as...", "...and this time she was certain she caught a slight sound. Could it be possible that a burglar was concealed under her bed? The idea was too dreadful, and a cold shiver ran through her. What was she to do? She did not dare to call to Linda; she felt as if her tongue would refuse to utter a cry, and perhaps if she did the man would at once crawl out. The room was not quite dark, as a fitful moon shone in through the blind between the storm clouds, and to poor Sylvia it made the horror <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> worse to know that she would be able to see somebody rise up suddenly by her bedside. \"I'd give him anything and everything he wants to steal,\" she thought, \"if only he wouldn't frighten me so.

When however they met the next morning, all trace of the storm had vanished. The surface of the wave, that had so lately been agitated <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to fury, was again calmly bright, if not transparent. Augustus could almost have believed the scene of the night before was but a vision of his distempered fancy, had it not been for the silent and almost imperceptible pressure of his hand, which accompanied his uncle's first salutation.

He did cheerfully the work of a farmer, though he liked best to hunt and fish and explore. He had a strong boat made by burning out the heart of a large cypress log. In this he often glided swiftly and noiselessly down some stream where the salmon trout lived. He held in his right hand a tough spear, made of a charred reed with a barbed end. When he saw a fish <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as large as himself close at hand he hurled his harpoon at it with all his force. And the fish darted off, leaving a trail of crimson in the clear water and dragging the boat behind it; for the boy clung to the end of the spear and soused the wounded fish in the water until its strength was exhausted. Then with the help of a friend he dragged it into the boat, and began to watch for another fish. Osceola was so energetic that he enjoyed work for its own sake.

The salary, however, was increased from year to year, up to the time of the exposure, when it stood at the respectable figure of 200_l._ Originally a \"hoyman,\" the actuary of course, and necessarily, engaged in other pursuits than those connected with the bank; and this circumstance, in the same way that it occurred in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every other fraud of the kind, led to the malappropriation of the money of the bank. It was another case of partial service and partial pay, and an almost unlimited command of money, when among many other business engagements it was always possible that money might be urgently needed.

In the thirty years ending 1886 the immigration was over a million. From 1886 to 1889 it was from 100,000 a year to 200,000 a year. In 1890, owing to the financial crisis of that year, it fell away <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to nothing. Since 1890 it has gradually increased until now it is about 100,000 a year again. In 1869 the population was only 1,837,000. Now it is over 4,000,000. Similarly the capital city, Buenos Ayres, has made an increase not easily paralleled. In 1869 its population was only 187,126. In 1887 it was 423,996. By the census of 1895 it was 663,854. To-day it is said to be 750,000. Of this number about one half are foreigners.

She had heard of Mrs. Holland, whom she was glad to meet at last, and of whom she now hoped to see something more. Ruth observed that they had the rectory only till September; she was sorry her time was so short.

Stopping for some time to gaze at the ample bay beneath us, the tall-masted frigates floating so majestically on its glassy surface--it was a scene of tranquil and picturesque beauty with which it would have been <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> impossible to associate the idea of war and invasion. In the lazy bunting that hung listlessly from peak and mast-head--in the cheerful voices of the sailors, heard afar off in the stillness--in the measured plash of the sea itself, and the fearless daring of the sea-gulls, as they soared slowly above our heads--there seemed something so suggestive of peace and tranquillity, that it struck us as profanation to disturb it.

It was not exactly a hat, and not exactly a cap, but something between the two, and it was so minute as to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invisible and wholly absurd. Yet there was every indication that its wearer believed that it suited him, for he moved both with confidence and self-satisfaction. And as I watched him, and after he had passed, swinging his stick and surveying the world with the calm assurance of a connoisseur of most of the branches of life I began to entertain some very serious and disturbing doubts.

For an instant, Hudson saw it all as if it were a single scene, motionless, one frame snatched from a fantastic movie epic--the charging mastodon, with the tiger lifted and the sound track one great blast of bloodthirsty bedlam. Then the scene dissolved in a blur of motion. He felt his rifle thud against his shoulder, knowing he had fired, but not hearing the explosion. And the mastodon was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> on top of him, bearing down like some mighty and remorseless engine of blind destruction. He flung himself to one side and the giant brushed past him. Out of the tail of his eye, he saw the thrown saber-tooth crash to Earth within the circle of the watchfires.

His first conscious sensation was of thirst, which grew almost to the proportions of suffering with full returning consciousness; but a moment later it was forgotten in the joy of two <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> simultaneous discoveries. The first was a mass of wreckage floating beside the derelict in the midst of which, bottom up, rose and fell an overturned lifeboat; the other was the faint, dim line of a far-distant shore showing on the horizon in the east.

They imported rum from the West Indies and, too, imported the molasses and made the rum themselves. \"The making of rum aided and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> supported the slave-trade in this country.

This was brought to New England, distilled into rum, and sent off to Africa.

Nurse <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> immediately after exclaimed, 'Baby is writing!' in a still more excited voice, which drew Mrs. Jencken's attention, and she rushed into the parlor to the nurse and baby, and this roused me, when I got up and walked to the nurse, and looking over Mrs. Jencken's shoulder, I saw the pencil in the child's hand and the paper under it with the writing as photographed. \"I may add that 'Susan' was the name of my departed wife, who was remarkably fond of children, and her Spirit (as is...", "...influences towards the unification of the Anglo-Saxon people. No nobler topic can occupy the attention of the pulpit. VIII.--INTERMARRIAGES Following the growth of other influences is intermarriage. Every day it becomes more frequent. It is not difficult for the individuals of the one country to become members of the homes of the other, and, as the Atlantic now only affords {139} the opportunity of a pleasant excursion, whatever there was of physical isolation in the past has <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> disappeared. Female influence is here seen performing its salutary work to the best advantage in removing prejudice and harmonising opinions and manners. Such all-important instrumentalities act with a sort of geometrical aggregation, and constitute one of the surest means of making us all members of one great household.

Howell had seen them, as a boy, locking and dowelling the great blocks of masonry, shaped each like an intricate Chinese puzzle; and in thirty odd years the Light seemed to have become <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as much part of the headland as the ancient Dinas itself. That seemed to be the way with building. Even Edward Garden's house seemed a settled thing now. So, in another year or two, would the \"Montgomery,\" the \"Cardigan,\" Ham-and-Egg Terrace.

And presently--when you are free--I will come to you.\" For a moment the current stopped. \"No, no!\" she cried, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> in terror. The first fatalist must have been a woman, and the vision of rent prison bars drove her mad. \"No, we could never be happy.\" \"We can--we will be happy,\" he said, with a conviction that was unshaken. \"Do you hear me? I will not debase what I have to say by resorting to comparisons. But--others I know have been happy are happy, though their happiness cannot be spoken of with ours. Listen.

Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate certain maxims founded on that noble one that it is more blessed to give than to receive. But of giving in its true sense: the giving that which we want for ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built on the rock of self-sacrifice, she knew nothing. Her sweet and spontaneous nature, which gave its love and sympathy so readily, was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a bar to education: it blinded the eyes that would have otherwise seen any defect that wanted altering, any evil trait that needed repression, any lagging virtue that required encouragement--or the spur.

Thirty miles is not a great distance for railway travel; but it is a long drive.

She heard the clock on the mantelpiece across the room ticking; far off, the rattle of a taxicab. The air coming through the open window bore the damp, stirring smell of early grass. \"Madame De Rochefort and Mr. Pollen!\" announced a voice. Mrs. Ennis had once said that her young friend, Mimi de Rochefort, responded to night more brilliantly than <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> any other woman she knew. The description was apt. Possibly by day there was a pallor too lifeless, a nose a trifle too short and arrogant, lips, possibly, too full; but by night these discrepancies blended into something very near perfection, and back of them as well was a delicate illumination as of lanterns hung in trees beneath stars; an illumination due to youth, and to very large dark eyes, and to dark, soft hair and red lips. Nor with this beauty went any of the coolness...", "...look out; I'm not going over the water for nothing.\" CHAPTER VI. A DEPARTURE. There was but little sleep for Nina that night. She was sick at heart to think that in return for the unceasing kindness Lionel had shown her since her arrival in England, she should be the means of drawing him into this foolish embroilment. She saw the situation of affairs clearly enough. Miss Burgoyne was an exacting, irritable, jealous woman, who had resented Nina's presence in the theatre <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> from the beginning, and who had been driven into a sudden fury by the sight of Lionel (he taking no notice of her either) driving past with this interloping foreigner. Moreover, Miss Burgoyne was inordinately vain: to have the popular young baritone fight a duel on her account--to have their names coupled together in common talk--what greater triumph could she desire than that? But while Miss Burgoyne might be the ostensible cause of the quarrel, Nina knew who was the real cause...", "...designs in relation to Mrs. Chump, they kept in the background. It was enough for them that she was to be a visitor, and would thus destroy the great circle they had projected. To accept her in the circle, they felt, was out of the question. Wilfrid's plain-speaking broke up the air-bubble, which they had so carefully blown, and in which they had embarked all their young hopes. They had as much as given one another a pledge that their home likewise should be broken up. \"Are you not <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> too severe a student?\" Mr. Barrett happened to say to Cornelia, the day after Wilfrid had worried her. \"Do I show the signs?\" she replied. \"By no means. But last night, was it not your light that was not extinguished till morning?\" \"We soon have morning now,\" said Cornelia; and her face was pale as the first hour of the dawn. \"Are you not a late foot-farer, I may ask in return?\" \"Mere restlessness. I have no appetite for study. I took the liberty to cross the park from...", "...Ivy, in a dry tone. \"The wisdom of the innocents! Wish I had tackled Alene instead of you,\" deplored Mat. At that moment he was hailed by Hugh: \"Come along, Mat! We boys are going to pick some wild strawberries for dessert. I noticed some vines up there over the hill as we came along.\" \"That will be lovely; run along, little boy,\" said Ivy, and Mat, with a last despairing glance at the feast, was gone, leaving her free to resume her task. Although there was quite a crowd, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a dozen young people to feed, the baskets seemed to disgorge enough for twenty. But then they were Happy-Go-Lucky baskets! \"Leagues and Clubs someway have a selfish sound--as though everyone outside didn't count for anything,\" Ivy said one day. \"We mustn't let ourselves get narrow that way,\" and they did not, for as Laura remarked later, \"When it came to picnics and good times generally, the Happy-Go-Luckys was very 'stretchible'--it took in all the kids!\" While the girls...", "...his brother by Lucilla's side. \"She has eyes in the tips of her fingers,\" he said. \"Sit down, Nugent, and let her pass her hand over your face.\" Nugent obeyed him in silence. Now that the first impression of surprise had passed away, I observed that a marked change was beginning to assert itself in his manner. Little by little, an unnatural constraint got possession of him. His fluent tongue found nothing to talk about. His easy movements altered in the strangest way, until they <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> became the movements of a slow awkward man. He was more like his brother than ever, as he sat down in the chair to submit himself to Lucilla's investigation. She had produced, at first sight--as well as I could judge--some impression on him for which he had not been prepared; causing some mental disturbance in him which he was for the moment quite unable to control.

Many people had been surprised to see a man of his genius and learning stooping to every drudgery, and denying himself <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every comfort, for the purpose of supplying a silly, affected old woman with superfluities, which she accepted with but little gratitude. But all his affection had been concentrated on her. He had neither brother nor sister, neither son nor daughter.

His arm tightened round her possessively. \"I don't know,\" he said slowly. \"I might--if I couldn't manage you any other way.\" \"Roger!\" There was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a note of fear in her quick, astonished exclamation. With his arm gripped round her she recognised how utterly powerless she would be against his immense strength, and something flint-like and merciless in the expression of those piercing eyes which were blazing down at her made her feel, with a sudden catch at her heart, as though he might actually do the thing he said. \"I hope it won't come to beating you,\" he resumed in a lighter tone of voice. \"But\"--grimly--\"not even...", "...http://www.gutenberg.org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

If he must give up Buddy there would be some compensation in telling Briggles of this poor child, who deserved far more the attention of his Society. All this passed through his mind in an instant, but before he could turn back to his bowl of soup Buddy uttered a cry of joy and, scrambling from his chair, ran across the floor toward the weeping girl. \"Oh! Susie! Susie! My Susie!\" he shouted and threw himself upon her. The impetus of his coming <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> threw the child off her feet, and she staggered back, but the next instant she had clasped her arms around the boy, and was hugging him in a close, youthful embrace of joy. \"My Buddy! My Buddy!\" she kept repeating over and over, as if all other words failed her, as they will in an excess of sudden surprise. \"My Buddy!

He kept, as he always did in travelling, a diary, recording not so much his observations on things seen, as his moods and moralisings on them. In May of the following year, as he was returning home, he received the news of the bankruptcy of the Dantzig house in which <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the entire means of his mother and his sister were invested. He himself had a far smaller amount at stake. The business arrangements connected with the winding-up of the firm, which his mother accepted, were not to Schopenhauer's taste, and the estrangement between himself and his relatives now became permanent. He showed his usual promptness to suspect evil, and his angry accusations were so bitter, that a silence of eleven years fell between himself and his mother and...", "...the name we gave him,\" his mother would say. \"Perhaps he is only living up to his name.\" For there are certain native hunters in India that are known, far and wide, as the Shikaris; and possibly she meant in her tolerance that her little son was merely a born huntsman. But in reality Little Shikara was not named for these men at all. Rather it was for a certain fleet-winged little hawk, a hunter of sparrows, that is one of the most free spirits in all the jungle. And it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> like taking part in some great hunt himself--to be waiting at the gate for the return of Warwick Sahib. Even now, the elephant came striding out of the shadows; and Little Shikara could see the trophy. The hunt had indeed been successful, and the boy's glowing eyes beheld--even in the shadows--the largest, most beautiful tiger-skin he had ever seen. It was the great Nahar, the royal tiger, who had killed one hundred cattle from near-by fields. Warwick Sahib rode in his...", "...and boys, all dressed in half-mourning, except one little lady of about ten years old, whose form was enveloped in black bombazine and crape, and whose face, what could be seen of it, was drowned in tears.

His great, broad forehead and wasted cheeks gave his face almost a triangular...", "...himself before his succession to the throne. The new king offered the best of securities for a sound administration in his thorough and versatile knowledge, wide experience in public affairs, and rich and harmonious endowment. Oscar II. still did not find it easy to gain the love and admiration of the Swedish people, of which he is so eminently worthy. He was the successor of one of the most popular of rulers that the country ever saw, but King Oscar has lived to see his own popularity <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> outrival that of his predecessor. King Oscar is, at seventy, a handsome, spirited gentleman, with that dignity which age, rare attainments, high intelligence and a noble soul grant their common possessor.

In addition to the driver, who was none other than Valmeras, there were three young men, who occupied themselves in the manufacture of wicker-work chairs: Beautrelet and two of his Janson friends.

Contrived between two buttresses placed very close together, it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> merged, behind the screen of brambles that concealed it, in the pattern formed by the stones of the wall. At last, on the fourth evening, the sky was covered with heavy black clouds and Valmeras decided that they should go reconnoitring, at the risk of having to return again, should circumstances prove unfavorable. All four crossed the little wood. Then Beautrelet crept through the heather, scratched his hands at the bramble-hedge and, half raising himself, slowly, with...", "...or with a distorted vision.

Accordingly he constructed in =Philos and Licia= a world in which all goes well provided one follows the rules, and where one of the key rules is that Hymen's rites must precede love's consummation. One of Licia's chief responsibilities, in addition to summing up all feminine perfections, is to enforce this rule. Philos, though severely tempted to violate it, soon yields to Licia's virtuous admonitions, for he is, let it be known, a pliant youth, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as devoted to Licia's will as the knight in Chaucer's Wife of Bath's tale to the Loathly Lady's. The poem ends happily, with the gods attending the lovers' nuptials. The result of this too easily ordered union of souls and bodies, unhappily for this otherwise charming poem, is an insufficiency of conflict.

It had free access to all the seas and all the lands. But with that \"new course\" and from it there also came a new god, a false and evil god.

From this point they had ready and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unobserved communication by navigable bayous with New Orleans and the marts beyond. They formed a sequestered colony on the shores of Barataria, and among the bold followers of Lafitte there were nearly one hundred men skilled in navigation, expert in the use of artillery, and familiar with every bay and inlet within one hundred miles of the Crescent City. Their services, if attainable, might be made invaluable in the invasion and investment of New Orleans contemplated by the...", "...years ago on Long Island, or south, or in New York city; folks look'd for spirit and mettle in a nag, not tame speed merely.) Well, I, a boy of perhaps 13 or 14, stopp'd and gazed long at the spectacle of that fur-swathed old man, surrounded by friends and servants, and the careful seating of him in the sleigh. I remember the spirited, champing horses, the driver with his whip, and a fellow-driver by his side, for extra prudence. The old man, the subject of so much attention, I can <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> see now. It was John Jacob Astor. The years 1846, '47, and there along, see me still in New York City, working as writer and printer, having my usual good health, and a good time generally. OMNIBUS JAUNTS AND DRIVERS One phase of those days must by no means go unrecorded--namely, the Broadway omnibuses, with their drivers.

I want them for my Museum in America.\" \"No money would buy these priceless relics of a bygone age,\" replied the porter, leering. \"Never mind,\" exclaimed the showman; \"I'll have them duplicated for my Museum, so that Americans can see them without coming here, and in that way I'll burst up your...", "...by Custer in Hampton's rear compelled him to turn Rosser's brigade in that direction, and while it attacked Custer on one side, Fitzhugh Lee's division, which had followed Custer toward Trevillian, attacked him on the other. There then ensued a desperate struggle for the possession of the captured property, resulting finally in its being retaken by the enemy. Indeed, the great number of horses and vehicles could not be kept on the limited space within Custer's line, which now formed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a complete circle; and while he was endeavoring to remove them to a secure place they, together with Custer's headquarters wagon and four of his caissons, fell into the hands of their original owners.

Hence, in order to get rid of these insects from a locality, it will suffice to empty out or drain away, or treat with certain chemicals, the small collections of water in which their larvae must pass their existence. But the practicability of this will depend on circumstances--especially, I think, on the species of mosquito with which we wish to deal. In my experience, different species select different habitations for their larvae. Thus the common \"brindled mosquitoes\" breed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> entirely in pots and tubs of water; the common \"gray mosquitoes\" only in cisterns, ditches, and drains; while the rarer \"spotted-winged mosquitoes\" seem to choose only shallow rain-water puddles and ponds too large to dry up under a week or more, and too small or too foul and stagnant for minnows. Hence the larvae of the first two varieties are found in large numbers round almost all human dwellings in India; and, because their breeding grounds--namely, vessels of water,...", "...had met with but two kinds of people,--men and women. I begin to think that one sex will never be thoroughly comprehended by the other, notwithstanding the desperate efforts the novelists are making now-a-days. They all go upon the same plan. They take some favorite woman, watch her habits keenly, dissect her, analyze her very blood and marrow,--then patch her up again, and set her in motion by galvanism. She stalks through three volumes and--drops dead. I have seen Kate laugh herself <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> into convulsions over the knowing remarks upon the sex in Thackeray, Reade, and others. And I must confess that the women I know resemble those of no writer but Shakspeare. We take our revenge for this irritating incapacity by saying that neither can women create ideal men at all resembling reality.

The young doctors and lawyers, and some old ones, too, who were going out to try life on the frontiers, occupied places in between these exalted folk and the rest of us. There were preachers among our passengers, but most of them were going west. On <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every voyage there would be a minister or missionary who would ask to have the privilege of holding prayer on the boat; and Captain Sproule always permitted it. The ministers, too, were among those who hunted up the singers in the crowds and organized the song services from the _Carmina Sacra_. 4 I was getting used to the life and liked it, and gradually I found my resolve to go west getting less and less strong; when late in the summer of 1854 something happened which...", "...and arrows, and of later years with firearms.

THE PRAIRIE INDIANS. To the south of the tribes already mentioned, are the large family of the Dakotahs, who number among them the Sioux, Assiniboines, and Blackfeet, and are the hereditary enemies of the Chippeways, especially of their nearer neighbours, the Crees and Ojibbeways.

He did not delay subjecting her to the wretched, petty, tiresome, and absurd etiquette of that Gothic Court. Mademoiselle submitted to all these nothings, seeing she had been able to submit to separation from France. She condemned herself to the most fastidious observances and the most sore privations, which did not much ameliorate her lot. A young Castilian lord, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> mad himself, thought fit to find this Queen pretty, and publicly testify his love for her. The jealousy of the religious King flared up like a funeral torch. He conceived a hatred of his wife, reserved and innocent though she was. She died cruelly by poison.

Grant also came forward, and a moment later Harrison was saying: \"General, let me present Mr. Clemens, a man <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as great as yourself.\" They shook hands; there was a pause of a moment, then Grant said, looking at him gravely: \"Mr. Clemens, I am not embarrassed, are you?\" So he remembered that first, long-ago meeting.

She felt <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as if the balmy sunlight were some joy-giving fluid to be drunk like wine. Her step was buoyant. She told herself that a veritable miracle had happened. She could not explain it, but it had happened. Her unspoken prayer constantly framed in heart-sinking desire had been answered. She didn't want aid to come from Albert Frazier, and it had not. This thought reminded her that she must try to see him before he had put himself to the trouble of getting the money at the bank. So...", "...nor the constant changing of scene, nor the duties of an active campaign, had been able to eradicate from his bosom.

One of the assassins was at no great distance from him, and yet he could scarcely restrain himself from yielding to the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> irresistible desire of galloping direct to Oajaca, where he supposed Gertrudis to be, and then, flinging himself at her feet, confessing that, without her, he could no longer live. It was to steel his soul against this temptation, and enable him to keep the oath he had sworn, that Don Rafael now repaired to his father's grave. CHAPTER SEVENTY ONE. THE CAPTURE OF SAN CARLOS. A few minutes sufficed for the performance of his sacred duty; and Don Rafael, returning to...", "...was this that these animals had visited so often as to make a deep trail on the mountain-side.

One of the sheep, a yearling, began to jump up and down, bouncing like a rubber ball in its sportive antics, which <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> made John laugh as he watched it. Turning to look at this, the smaller ram paced off to the right, followed now by the larger ram. Both creatures now, as if they had some sense of danger, stood with their majestic heads raised, looking steadily about and apparently scanning the air to catch the taint of danger. Thus they offered a good mark to the riflemen. \"Shoot!\" whispered Alex, quickly; and almost as he spoke two reports rang out. At the report of Rob's rifle the lesser...", "...Buena, stood looking out over the bay to the eastern mountains: dark, almost formless, wrapped in the intense and menacing mystery of that last hour before dawn. \"Senor!\" called a low cautious voice.

This time the direction was unmistakable, and he went to the edge of the plateau facing the south and looked over. Halfway down a shallow and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> perpendicular gully, he saw a girl forcing a mustang up the harsh, loose path. The girl's white and oval face looked from the folds of a black reboso like the moon emerging from clouds, and its young beauty was out of place in that wild and forbidding setting. She reined in her horse as she caught his eye and beckoned superfluously; then guided her mustang to a little ledge where he could plant his feet firmly, permitting her to reassume her usual pride of carriage and...", "...inches of his.

CHAPTER XXI ARNOLD SPEAKS OUT Ruth was still alone, and her welcome was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> pathetic. She stretched out her arms--long, thin arms they seemed in the tight black sleeves of her worn gown. She had discarded her carefully mended gloves and her hands were bare. \"Arnold,\" she murmured, \"how long you have been away!\" He threw himself on the grass by her side. \"Silly little woman!\" he answered. \"Don't tell me that you are not enjoying it?\" \"It is all wonderful,\" she whispered, \"but can't you see that I am out of place?

It is in such parlors that the instrument best answers the end of its creation. There is many a piano in the back room of a little store, or in the uncarpeted sitting-room of a farm-house, that yields a larger revenue of delight than the splendid grand of a splendid drawing-room. In these humble abodes of refined intelligence, the piano is a dear and honored member of...", "...left the house.

Even George, who, engrossed by his business and his own family, cared <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as little as any man for the concerns of others, felt so ashamed of his father's conduct, that, on the Sunday after the funeral, he went to pay a visit of condolence to his mother, and to join his exhortations to hers, in the hope that something might be done. But Walter was inexorable. 'If my father,' said he, 'did sic a wicked thing to Charlie as ye a' say, what for would ye hae me to do as ill and as wrang to my bairn?

She looked long and curiously into her own eyes, \"dear wonderful eyes,\" as Faircloth, her brother, so deliciously called them. And with that her mouth curved into a smile, sight of which brought recognition, new and very moving, of her own by no means inconsiderable beauty.

The little girl ran to join her mother; the father drove to the barn. Two Negroes--perhaps more--met him there and beat his brains out with a stone and a buggy brace. Hearing the noise, Mrs. Hodges ran out with a lamp and set it on the gate-post. The Negroes crept up--as nearly as can be gathered from the contradictory stories and confessions--and murdered her there in her doorway with peculiar brutality. Many of the crimes committed by Negroes are marked with <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> animal-like ferocity. Once aroused to murderous rage, the Negro does not stop with mere killing; he bruises and batters his victim out of all semblance to humanity. For the moment, under stress of passion, he seems to revert wholly to savagery. The Negroes went into the house and ransacked it for money.

Her eyes were large, and protruding, not with the fire of passion which is often associated with large eyes, but dully, set in a puffy face, a trifle florid. Her hands seemed, when she moved them, to shake with an involuntary tremor, and in spite of the fact that one <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> could feel that her heart and lungs were speeding with energy, she had lost weight and no longer had the full, rounded figure of health.

An hour or two later Cosme's thin, dark hand shot across the table and gripped the fellow's wrist. \"Caught you that time, you tin-horn,\" he said quietly. Instantly, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> before the speech was out, the giant in the apron had hurled himself across the room and gripped the cheat, who stood, a hand arrested on its way to his pocket, snarling helplessly.

Somewhat curiously, Christina's mother, Queen Maria, cared little for the child, and, in fact, came at last to detest her <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as much as the king loved her. It is hard to explain this dislike. Perhaps she had a morbid desire for a son and begrudged the honors given to a daughter. Perhaps she was a little jealous of her own child, who took so much of the king's attention. Afterward, in writing of her mother, Christina excuses her, and says quite frankly: She could not bear to see me, because I was a girl, and an ugly girl at that. And she was right enough, for I was as tawny as a little Turk.

For the third time, the aged Ormond, now arrived at the period usually allotted to the life of man, returned to Ireland, with the rank of Viceroy. During the ensuing seven years, he clung to power with all the tenacity of his youth, and all the policy of his prime; they were seven years of extraordinary sectarian panic and excitement--the years of the Cabal, the Popish plot, and the Exclusion Bill, in England--and of fanatical conspiracies and explosions <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as dangerous in Ireland. The Popish plot mania held possession of the English people much longer than any other moral epidemic of equal virulence. In the month of October, 1678, its alleged existence in Ireland was communicated to Ormond; in July, 1681, its most illustrious victim, Archbishop Plunkett, perished on the scaffold at Tyburn. Within these two points of time what a chronicle of madness, folly, perjury, and cruelty, might be written?

They were talking at the further end of it, close to the window, and though Chauvelin had mostly spoken in a whisper, Collot had ofttimes shouted, and the ex-ambassador was wondering how much Marguerite had heard. Now at Collot's anxious query he gave a quick furtive glance in the direction of the further room wherein she sat, so silent and so still, that it seemed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as if she must be sleeping. \"You don't think that the Englishman will refuse to write the letter?\" insisted Collot with angry impatience. \"No!\" replied Chauvelin quietly. \"But if he does?\" persisted the other. \"If he does, I send the woman to Paris to-night and have him hanged as a spy in this prison yard without further formality or trial...\" replied Chauvelin firmly; \"so either way, you see, Citizen,\" he added in a whisper, \"the Scarlet Pimpernel is done for....

The present Cabinet really takes its place. In like manner, it is possible to find British and colonial precedent, tried and proved, for almost every provision of the National Government.

The Dutch in New York and the Germans of Pennsylvania took <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> no part in the Philadelphia Convention. It is as useless to deny an English parentage for the American Constitution as to deny that there were English colonies in America.

The air was sharp and frosty, but we cared naught for the cold, now at freezing-point, as we were between seven and eight thousand feet above the level of the plains.

She ended with a line or two of congratulations, and casually asked when she was to see him again. These closing sentences were skimmed over <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unnoticed by Hartley. One hundred and ten dollars! Never before had he been paid so handsomely. He looked at the check again, and wondered just where he could get it cashed. And still again he held it up to the light and looked at it, and a great content stole over him. It was the beginning.

The silence around him was the same as before, but a violent agitation and excitement disturbed his mind, and an overpowering apprehension of some approaching existence, inimical to himself, aroused his faculties to an acute perception, and braced his nerves to a supreme effort.

The platforms and the big freight shed were alive with the bustle of the freight handlers, loading and unloading cars, trundling boxes and bales from one part of the platform to another and in and out of the big shed; and unnoticed, Jack discovered where the wires from the pole passed in under the roof. Entering the shed, he proceeded carefully to follow their course along the beams toward the telegraph room. He had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> reached the partition, and was beginning to think his conclusion perhaps too hastily drawn, when a few feet from the wall, where the light from an opposite window struck the roof, he caught two unmistakable gleams of copper.

Nor do they stop short at the Norman Conquest. Most of them continue half through the reign of William, and then cease; while one manuscript goes on uninterruptedly till the reign of Stephen, and breaks off abruptly in the year 1154 with an unfinished sentence. With it, native prose literature dies down altogether until the reign of Edward III. As a whole, however, the Conquest struck the death-blow of Anglo-Saxon literature <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> at once. During the reigns of AElfred's descendants Wessex had produced a rich crop of native works on all subjects, but especially religious. In this literature the greatest name was that of AElfric, whose Homilies are models of the classical West Saxon prose. But after the Conquest our native literature died out wholly, and a new literature, founded on Romance models, took its place. The Anglo-Saxon style lingered on among the people, but it was gradually killed down by the...", "...heaven; the gentle breezes, the opening flowers, the first faint buds of spring on tree and hedge-row seemed all to give a foretaste of summer.

The most important of these is to ascertain if the valve head or seat is badly scored or pitted. If such is found to...", "...ears.

It was not for a chief who wished to win not one victory, but a hundred to show undue elation. But he turned and for a few moments gazed directly into the sun with unwinking eyes, and when he shifted his gaze away, a great tide of life leaped in his veins. Then he gave silent thanks. Like all the other Indians in North America the Mohawks personified and worshipped the sun, which to them was the mighty Dweller in Heaven, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the same as Manitou, a great spirit to whom sacrifices and thanksgivings were to be made. The sun, an immortal being, had risen that morning and from his seat in the highest of the high heavens he had looked down with his invincible eye which no man could face more than a few seconds, upon his favorite children, the Mohawks, to whom he had given the victory.

I was a witness of this development of a new character, right from the beginning, and saw that Bill was not in any way to blame; but that the ignorance of his associates shoved him, in spite of his modesty, shoulder-high above themselves.

There were English, American, Russian and German observers in Egypt; English and French in Algeria and Tunisia; English in Majorca; observers of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all nationalities in Spain; and English and American in Labrador. In Egypt the weather was bright, though the sun was low; in Majorca and Spain there were local clouds. Consequently many observations, in addition to those in Labrador, were lost, notably the special spectroscopic observations undertaken by Evershed on the northern limit of totality, and the observations of radiation undertaken by H.L. Callendar. A search for intra-Mercurial planets was conducted on an elaborate...", "...love. No ritualistic rite or priestly interposition is necessary for the purpose, it being a purely social institution, originating in the love that sweetens life. After interchanging salutations, the sister who has every thing ready thrice invokes a blessing upon the brother in a Bengali verse, and marks his forehead thrice with sandal paste by the tip of her little finger. She then serves him with the provisions provided for the festive occasion. Here genuine love and true affection <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> spontaneously gush forth from the heart of the sister towards one who is united to her by the nearest tie of consanguinity and tenderest remembrances. If the brother be not inclined to relish or taste a particular dish, how affectionately does she cajole him to try it, adding at the same time that it has been prepared by her own hand with the greatest care. Any little dislike evinced by the brother instantly bathes her eyes in tears, and disposes her to exclaim somewhat in the...", "...their own interests. There are two senses, however, in which a nation may be disinterested in its foreign policy. Either it may possess no interest or its separate interest may be so small in relation to its larger interests elsewhere that it is willing to make a sacrifice. If, for example, the present war ended in a deadlock and the two groups of powers, unwilling to trust each other, were to confide Constantinople and the straits to the keeping of the United States, it would be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unthinkable that we should be false to the trust. We should have no interest in favouring one group of nations as against the other; we should have no political axe to grind and no economic or territorial gains to make. We should be fair and disinterested because we had no interest. {202} Our recent attitude toward Cuba, the Philippines and Mexico has been relatively disinterested in the second sense. We might have made money by exploiting these countries. We could have...", "...had he done so than Greenoak, hearing the sound, came up. Too late. The fugitive had disappeared. \"Oh, I'll soon bring him back,\" cried Dick, after the first dozen words of explanation, and leaping to his feet, regardless of expostulation, and at imminent risk of being shot by the sentries, he plunged into the mist. In hard training, he was able in a moment to bear the clink of stones as the fugitive ran. A spurt, and he came up with him. The Kafir seeing only one, and he <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certainly unarmed, drew a sheath knife, and stood waiting. And just then, as ill-luck would have it, his pursuer stumbled and fell headlong. With an evil snarl the Kafir leapt forward. Where was the pleasant-faced, soft-mannered, civilised native now? A sheer savage this, about to shed blood, and that unnecessarily. But out of the mist leapt two figures, and down went Snyman under the mighty fist of the Police corporal who was with Harley Greenoak.

That was close,\" gasped Grant, his lips ashen with terror. \"He's getting desperate,\" said Fred. \"He knows that unless he can get John before he comes much closer to shore his chance is gone.\" \"Hurry, Sam!\" shouted Grant with all his strength. \"Keep it up, John!\" he called. \"You'll be all right in a minute!\" \"He will not,\" said Fred in a low voice. \"He'll be gone in a minute.\" \"No he won't,\" cried Grant. \"Sam is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> there.\" \"Forty yards is a lot.\" \"Hurry, Sam! Hurry!\" begged Grant. \"You must hurry!\" \"Look!\" cried Fred. \"The shark must have seen him. He's going away.\" \"Not 'away,'\" Grant corrected. \"He's just backing up a little.\" Sure enough the shark moved out a little toward the ocean and the fin stood almost still as if it might be debating what should be done next. Evidently the arrival of a second foe had puzzled him. Sharks are not known especially for their bravery. Rather...", "...interesting. As for the end, no two persons seem quite agreed what _is_ the end. Sainte-Beuve speaks of it as an attempted suicide of the hero--the most justifiable of all his actions, if he had succeeded. Prevost himself, in the Preface to the _Doyen de Killerine_, repeats an earlier disavowal (which he says he had previously made in Holland) of a fifth volume, and says that his own work ended with the murder of Cleveland by one of the characters. Again, this is a comprehensible and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> excusable action, and might have followed, though it could not have preceded, the other. But if it was the end, the other was not. A certain kind of critic may say that it is my duty to search and argue this out. But, for my part, I say as a reader to _Cleveland_, \"No more _in_ thee my steps shall be, For ever and for ever.\"[341] [Sidenote: _Le Doyen de Killerine._] _Le Doyen de Killerine_ is not perhaps so utterly to be excommunicated as _Cleveland_, and, as has been said...", "...necessary, it being sufficient if they so terminate that the transition from one to another is made naturally, and without effort, by the imagination.

Our first impression from Claude is that of perfect _unity_, and this we have even before we are conscious of a single image; as if, circumscribing his scenes by a magic...", "...a long ridge rising out of the level country around, like a whale's back out of a calm sea, with the head and tail beneath the surface. Along its base ran a green and seldom-trodden lane, with which I was very familiar in my boyhood; and there was a little brook, which I remember to have dammed up till its overflow made a mimic ocean. When I last looked for this tiny streamlet, which was still rippling freshly through my memory, I found it strangely shrunken; a mere ditch indeed, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a dry one. But the green lane was still there, precisely as I remembered it; two wheel-tracks, and the beaten path of the horses' feet, and grassy strips between; the whole overshadowed by tall locust-trees, and the prevalent barberry-bushes, which are rooted so fondly into the recollections of every Essex man. From this lane there is a steep ascent up the side of the hill, the ridge of which affords two views of very wide extent and variety.

They were certainly no beauties, but there was a charm in their light, soft step, in the swaying of their hips, in the dainty poise of their slim ankles and feet, and the softness and harmony of all their movements. And the light playing on their dark, velvety, shining bodies increased this charm, until one <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> forgot the many defects, the dirt, the sores, the disease.

He has manufactured spirit photographs very cleverly; they were wonderfully well done, and only a professional eye would detect the trick. He proceeded by double exposure.

In fact, what had I to discuss with a Regent who was no longer one, not even over himself, still less over a realm plunged in disorder? Cardinal Dubois, when he met me, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> courted me. He knew not how to catch me. The bonds which united me to M. le Duc d'Orleans had always been so strong that the prime minister, who knew their strength, did not dare to flatter himself he could break them.

Such a philosopher, detained on an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> barren island, resembles a whale left upon the strand.

The day after the funeral she rented the place to Simeon Blair but as his family was small, they had only a child, a girl of seven, there was room for Jeannette; so she kept her room and paid four dollars a week board. The Blairs bought her cows and chickens, but refused the mule as a gift; so she paid Simeon five dollars a month for looking after old Silas.

I'd have given a hundred dollars then to be able to stand up there on one foot and lean as easily as the skipper against the stay with the vessel going along as she was. I made up my mind to practise it when next I went aloft. I went to the mast-head myself by and by, and, seeing half a dozen schools <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> at once, I became so excited that I could hardly speak. The skipper was excited, too, but he didn't show it, only by his eyes and talking more jerkily than usual. He paid no attention to two or three schools that made me just crazy just to look at, but at last, when he thought it was time, he began to move.

By the time we were wanted, Bracewell, thanks to the dominie's medical skill, had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> entirely recovered. He was able to identify the two men as among the party who had attacked him, we also having found in their possession some of his property which they had taken. The other two were still at large, but the police entertained no doubt that they should catch them before long.

A train left shortly for Jaffa, and he was bound directly home, to Myrtle Forge, anxious to steep himself in the echo of the trip hammer mingled with the poignant harmony of spring sounds drifting from the farm and woods.

The disagreeable weather may have been more or less responsible for the ruffling of Chase's temper during those long, dreary hours of waiting. Be that as it may, he was sorely tried by the feeling of loneliness that attached itself to him. He had seen the Princess but once, and then she was walking briskly, wrapped in a rain coat, followed by her shivering dogs, and her two Rapp-Thorberg soldiers! Somehow she failed to see Chase as he sauntered hungrily, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> imploringly across the upper terrace, in plain view. Perhaps, after all, it was not the weather. Rasula's messenger came to the gates and announced that he had a letter for Mr. Chase. He was admitted to the grounds and conducted to the sick chamber of \"the commandant.\" Hollingsworth Chase read the carefully worded, diplomatic letter from the native lawyer, his listeners paying the strictest attention. After the most courteous introductory, Rasula had this to say: \"We have...", "...or three nights after his memorable conversation with Robert Beaufort, as Lord Lilburne was undressing, he said to his valet: \"Dykeman, I am getting well.\" \"Indeed, my lord, I never saw your lordship look better.\" \"There you lie.

There was an elegance and fascination indescribable about the stranger. Nancy recognized her instantly as the lady in the garden. Miss Campbell knew her as Mme. Fontaine, newspaper correspondent. The others in the party imagined her to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> anything romantic and interesting; perhaps a foreign princess; a great actress; something remarkable, surely. In a beautiful, cultured voice, far reaching in spite of its soft tones, she harangued the multitude which little by little fell back. The group of fierce young men put away their weapons and disappeared in the mob. The little boy, the cause of all the trouble, was now standing on his feet blinking his eyes at Miss Campbell. How the picture was stamped on their minds...", "...tears, \"I know not what to do,\" says she, \"for your husband is in a deep study, and when I told him you desired him to dine with you in the parlour as usual, he only said, 'Mrs. Amy, go to your lady, tell her to dine when and where she pleases, and pray obey her as your lady; but let her know from me that she has lost the tenderness I had for her as a wife, by the little thought she had of her children.'\" Nothing could have shocked me more than the delivery of this message by Amy. I, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> bathed in tears, went to him myself; found him in a melancholy posture reading in Milton's \"Paradise Regained.\" He looked at me very sternly when I entered his study, told me he had nothing to say to me at that time, and if I had a mind not to disturb him, I must leave him for the present. \"My lord,\" said I, \"supposing all that has been said by this girl was truth, what reason have you to be in this unforgiving humour?

But the apathetic, listless look was on her face when she came down in the morning, and she appeared as if passively yielding to a dreaded necessity.

Like other people who have always been idle, he did not consider his idleness a vice. He rather plumed himself upon it, for the man who has done nothing all his life naturally looks down upon people who have done or are doing something. In Europe he had not all the advantage of this superiority which such a man has here; he was often thrown with other idle people, who had been useless for so many generations that they had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> ceased to have any consciousness of it. In their presence Pasmer felt that his uselessness had not that passive elegance which only ancestral uselessness can give; that it was positive, and to that degree vulgar.

Habit--the instinct of custom--showed me that my pocket had always been to the left; my right hand sought the spot with an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> mechanical impulse, whereas my left wandered about like a man in search of his newly-taken lodging. As I came to this puzzling fact, my fingers, deeply immersed in the pocket, came in contact with a small leather case. I drew it forth; it was not mine,--I had never seen it before! I opened it; there was nothing within but a small piece of card, with the words, \"Full Share Ticket,\" on top, and, underneath, the figures, '\"38.\" From the card, my eyes reverted to the coat itself;...", "...From this ledge rises a six-sided tower some hundred and fifty feet high.

Four years later, in 1851, Arnold was appointed an inspector of schools, a position which he held <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the end of his life and in which he labored very hard and faithfully, partly at the expense of his creative work. His life was marked by few striking outward events. His marriage and home were happy. Up to 1867 his literary production consisted chiefly of poetry, very carefully composed and very limited in amount, and for two five-year terms, from 1857 to 1867, he held the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford.

The window was wide open, and the blaze of sunlight that streamed in fell upon Carrie as she took up a letter from the little table before her. \"Only a line or two to say the casket has been sent,\" she said, with a half-suppressed sigh. \"One could <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> fancy they did not care what had become of me at Barrock-holme.

Then the old man groaned dismally, shaking his side-whiskers with a negative expression that might have conveyed worlds of meaning to one able to interpret it.

It forbade the departure of all ships for foreign ports, except vessels under the immediate direction of the President and vessels in ballast or already loaded with goods.

One of the duties imposed on Yamato-dake by his imperial father (A.D. 71-130) was to chastise and subdue the Yemishi. This is the name by which the barbarous peoples of the north and east were known among the Japanese. According to Chamberlain(16) in his translation of _Kojiki_, the Chinese characters with which the Yemishi is written mean Prawn Barbarians, in allusion to the long beards which make their faces resemble a prawn's head. The hairy people now known as Ainos are <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certainly referred to. The origin of the term Aino is unknown. By the Japanese it is believed to be derived from _inu_, meaning a dog, and to have been bestowed on them in contempt. The name is not used by the Ainos themselves.

One wonders that some foolish so-called progressives should now be wishing to drop those literatures from the curriculum of students, though perhaps their work is done.

Roses nodded from every bush, but the pupils of Oakdale's two High Schools were far too busy to think about the beauty of the weather. Golf, tennis, baseball and other outdoor sports were sternly put aside, and the usual season of \"cramming\" set in. Young faces wore an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> tragic expression, and back lessons were reviewed with desperate zeal.

Merrit, with the courage which <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> ennobled him, snatched a musket from the hands of one of his men and, standing in the middle of the road, took deliberate aim at Ethan Allen and fired.

About the same period as when the party of Dutch sailors were left at Jan Mayen, a similar experiment was tried in Spitzbergen.

And a most furious quarrel followed between Slyne and him. Sallie, too, learned then, for the first time, of the vast inheritance which would be hers, of Slyne's cunning plan to buy Captain Dove out for a mere pittance, and how he himself expected to profit through marrying her. But she was not overwhelmed with surprise by that belated discovery. She had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> anticipated the final disclosure of some such latent motive behind all Slyne's professions to her. The only difference it might make would be to Captain Dove. Slyne and he were still snarling at each other when Mr. Jobling walked jauntily in again.

They usually represent not the collective wisdom of the whole community, but the wisdom of the majority after it has been checked, modified, and perhaps nullified by the opposing wisdom of an almost equal minority. Take as an example the history of the Irish Question. How difficult it is to put one's finger on any moment in that tangled story and say that then and there the collective wisdom of the community knew what it wanted to do and did it! So with <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> everything else. Now if there be such a thing as the collective wisdom of the State I suppose that the moment when we are most likely to find it in action is the moment when one State has dealings with another State.

She was descended from one of the most illustrious houses of France; had married at sixteen a man of equal birth, but old, dull, and pompous--a caricature rather than a portrait of that great French _noblesse_, now <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> if not wholly extinct. But her virtue was without a blemish--some said from pride, some said from coldness. Her wit was keen and court-like--lively, yet subdued; for her French high breeding was very different from the lethargic and taciturn imperturbability of the English.

It seems <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> incredible that such wealth and power could be concentrated in the hands of one woman; and only when we consider the grinding poverty of the masses of the population through the extortions of the rich and the oppressions of the governing classes can we account for the resources which permitted the lavish luxuries of the aristocrats.

Then, through the aperture at the back of the door, he had a view of the narrow cabin to its very end. Sufficient light entered through the several windows of clouded glass to show him that there was nobody in sight. Not even the private who had brought his lunch had lingered here. Rising swiftly and with the pistol ready in his hand, the young American stepped out of the closet in which he had been confined. There was a small German clock screwed to the wall. It was now <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> noon. Crouching, ready to leap or run as the case might need, Tom approached the other end of the cabin. There he could see through the dim pane of the door, gaining a view of the afterdeck. The mystery of the absence of all life forward was instantly explained. More than a dozen of the crew and officers were gathered on the afterdeck. They stood in a row along the deck, their heads bared, while the _ober-leutnant_ read from a book. Tom realized almost at once what the...", "...and as he rode into the court-yard of the palace a Highland soldier handed him a pistol, saying, 'This is your pistol, sir; but I thought you were carried away mortally wounded a short time ago?'

I was really rejoiced that we were moving away from the people who made the wagon that had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> ended my life, and it did not occur to me that I alone was to blame. I could not be persuaded to ride in that wagon again and was glad when we finally left it beside the Missouri river.

Once or twice we were in doubt whether we should camp for the night, or still try to reach the road. We had a consultation about our position, and where we ought to ride to reach the road. After some discussion, we discovered the real cause of our failure, and therefore rode more to the right than we had before done. At length, we crossed a road, and my companion at once said we were all right, and proposed cantering on. I was not quite so certain about being right, but was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> overruled; so I dismounted, and, kneeling down on the ground, examined for spoor. Knowing that a gun and waggon horsed, with about half a dozen other waggons with each a span of oxen, could not pass without leaving sign, I crawled along for some distance, but could not trace more than two fresh waggon-wheels. I therefore determined that this was the wrong road, and that we must ride yet farther to hit the one that our people had followed.

But the American jack tar is a generous fellow, and nothing appeals so strongly to his compassion as a fellow-seaman in distress, and on this occasion the people of the _Lively_ extended every assistance to their enemies and brought them safely into port.\" Really, they would have been no better than pirates if they had left them there.

Still, the 'farthing candle' of Malthus's fame as a political philosopher must soon go out.

The excellent Malthus indeed becomes the 'hard-hearted' <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as Hooker was the 'judicious.' This sufficiently represents the view of the sentimental Tory. Malthus, transformed into a monster, deserves the 'execrations' noticed by Chalmers. There is a thorough coincidence between this view and that of the sentimental Radicals. Southey observes that Malthus (as interpreted by him) does not really answer Godwin. Malthus argues that 'perfectibility' gives an impossible end because equality would lead to vice and misery.

In fact, it only figured on four of the hundreds of samplers which composed the Exhibition, and in three of these cases it was in conjunction with a crown.

It was at this time that they began to play that favorite game of Greenbank, which seems to be unknown <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> everywhere else. It is called \"king's base,\" and is full of all manner of complex happenings, sudden surprises, and amusing results. Each of the boys selected a base or goal. A row of sidewalk trees were favorite bases. There were just as many bases as boys. Some boy would venture out from his base. Then another would pursue him; a third would chase the two, and so it would go, the one who left his base latest having the right to catch. Just as Johnny Meline was about to...", "...\"No more running about to-night,\" he answered almost sternly.

The distance between \"upper\" and \"lower\" Astoria, the rapid growth of the town during the seventies, made the division of the district <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a necessity.

The steamer was entirely submerged in the sea at one time, and had she not been very well built she would never have come to the surface again. It looked like a precarious time, but I felt an assurance that the vessel...", "...the words. \"'How pleasant it is to have money, heigh-ho!--How pleasant it is to have money,'\" said Mrs. Verrier, quoting, with a laugh. \"Yes, I dare say, you'd be very reasonable, Daphne, about that kind of thing.

This knowledge <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> maddened him as he brooded over it by night and by day. When he had been set free from the French prison to which his knavery had consigned him, Banker gave himself up body and soul to the consideration of the treasure which Captain Horn had brought to France from Peru.

Sometimes the trees were so thickly clustered together that it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> impossible to get our sleds through them. At times we were testing our agility by climbing over fallen trees, and then on our hands and knees had to crawl under reclining ones. Our faces were often bleeding, and our feet bruised.

There was a small terraced hill of piled-up packing-boxes near her, possession of which had been taken by a company of raggamuffinish boys, and she found herself standing on the highest box and sharing the summit with these questionable youths, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> without noting her action in mounting thither, so strained was the concentration of her attention upon the figure high up in the rose-glow against the warehouse wall. The man, surely, surely, was not going to trust himself to that bit of wooden web hanging from the roof! Where was Miss Bareaud that she permitted it?

Nothing could be more gloomy than Bonaparte's entrance into Paris. He arrived at night in the midst of a thick fog. The streets were almost deserted, and a vague feeling of terror prevailed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> generally in the capital. At nine o'clock on the same evening, the very hour of Bonaparte's arrival at the Tuileries, a lady, a friend, of my family, and whose son served in the Young Guard, called and requested to see Madame de Bourrienne. She refused to enter the house lest she should be seen, and my sister-in-law went down to the garden to speak to her without a light. This lady's brother had been on the preceding night to Fontainebleau to see Bonaparte, and he had...", "...which was known only to a few of the band whom father thought he could trust. But his confidence was abused.

He was always silent and morose; could not bear to have you look him in the eye; in short, he was just the man that I would have picked out from among a hundred as a traitor. Father seemed to repose entire confidence in him, and always asked his advice in times of danger; but, as much as I respected his judgment, I could not conquer the feeling with...", "...his voice falling to a confidential tone, \"especially when I heard of your loss.\" I remained quiet.

Evidently I was plumb ruined. But I said nothing and remained under cover, waiting to draw his fire. \"Yes,\" the man went on, \"death is always sad.\" Death! Oh, that was it, was it?

He is especially what our time is fond of calling \"an all-round man.\" But he differs from most men who are thus praised, because he is the acknowledged leader of the thought of the first half of the century. He does equally well all that he does. If in the year 1850 anyone had asked who was the first poet of the preceding half century, Goethe would have been named by <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all who answered. If you had asked who was the first man of letters, he would have been named by all. It was certain that his philosophy of human life affected the thought of the students and scholarly people of Europe and America more than that of any other author of his time.

In April the angler or the sketcher is chilled by the east wind, whirling showers of hail, and even when the riverbanks are sweet with primroses, the bluff tops of the border hills are often bleak with late snow. This state of things is less unpropitious to angling than might be expected. A hardy race of trout will sometimes rise freely to the artificial fly when the natural fly is destroyed, and the angler is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> blinded with dusty snowflakes. All through midsummer the Scotch rivers lose their chief attractions. The bracken has not yet changed its green for the fairy gold, the hue of its decay; the woods wear a uniform and sombre green; the waters are low and shrunken, and angling is almost impossible.

Yet it is significant of the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> insuperable lack of personality characteristic of the demon, that even these counter-gods of darkness and evil are wanting in _one trait_ which is indispensable for a completely developed personality--namely, changes in motives and the capacity to determine at will the nature of these changes.

It needs all these gifts to dominate and lead toward Christ eight hundred born thieves. I know of no more self-sacrificing and Christlike work than that which brother Bawden is doing.

The invention of the _da capo_ is generally attributed to Scarlatti, wrongly, as has already been shown, since it appears in Cesti's opera 'La Dori,' which was performed in 1663. But it seems almost certain that Scarlatti was the first to use accompanied recitative, a powerful means of dramatic expression in the hands of all who followed him, while his genius advanced the science of instrumentation to a point hitherto unknown. Nevertheless, Scarlatti's efforts were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> exclusively addressed to the development of the musical rather than the dramatic side of opera, and he is largely responsible for the strait-jacket of convention in which opera was confined during the greater part of the eighteenth century, in fact until it was released by the genius of Gluck.

When Mr. Davis entered the field, under all the disadvantages to which we have alluded, the election of Foote was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> universally conceded. Had the canvass lasted a few weeks, however, the result, in all probability, would have been different.

The third passed through the fleshy part of his shoulder and buried itself in the stake behind him.

His disease was typhoid fever, and during much of his sickness he was unconscious.

But to find a suitable wife was, he found, a matter of some difficulty; for he would marry none who was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth. The dwarfish daughter of Lord Bemboro he refused on the ground that besides being a pigmy she was hunchbacked; while another young lady, an orphan belonging to a very good family in Hampshire, was rejected by him because her face, like that of so many dwarfs, was wizened and repulsive. Finally, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> despairing of success, he heard from a reliable source that Count Titimalo, a Venetian nobleman, possessed a daughter of exquisite beauty and great accomplishments, who was by three feet in height.

Her chagrin was all the keener at losing this last aspirant to her hand in that she had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> persuaded herself that she was as fond of him as she was likely to be of anybody, and that, on the whole, she had better marry him and save his life and reason.

The explanation is perfectly easy; Lawrence and Broke were probably exactly equal in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every thing that goes to make up a first-class commander, but one had trained his crew for seven years, and the other was new to the ship, to the officers, and to the men, and the last to each other.

At this period, it may require a small portion of light animal food, of which, how to select the most nutritious, to regulate the quantity, and to administer it, after proper intervals, must depend on the experience of the nurse. Experience is often superseded by convenience: if the child cries, the nurse attributes it to a want of food, and, by her agency, it is fed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every hour, both night and day. It is seldom that a child cries from abstinence, if it be healthy and free from pain.

Mr Sadler seems to us to have fallen into a somewhat similar error. He should remember that, though Locke may have been laughed at, so has Sir Claudius Hunter; and that it takes something more than the laughter of all the world to make a Locke. The body of this pamphlet by no means justifies the parallel so modestly insinuated on the title-page. Yet we must own that, though Mr Sadler has not risen to the level of Locke, he has done what was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as difficult, if not as honourable--he has fallen below his own. He is at best a bad writer. His arrangement is an elaborate confusion. His style has been constructed, with great care, in such a manner as to produce the least possible effect by means of the greatest possible number of words. Aspiring to the exalted character of a Christian philosopher, he can never preserve through a single paragraph either the calmness of a philosopher or the meekness of a Christian. His...", "...The removal of one of the testicles does not deprive the rig of reproducing its species, and it is thus a source of continual trouble when herded with a lot of sow pigs now that the general custom is to allow the female pigs of a litter to remain unspayed. It is, therefore, necessary to fatten a rig either alone, or with male pigs which have been operated upon. In addition to this extra trouble, the flesh of a rig pig if it be kept fattening after it is some five or six months old is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certain to be strong in flavour, like unto that of a boar. It is, therefore, advisable to fatten a rig quite early in life and convert it into a porket or porker carcase of pork. It may appear strange to some readers to specially mention the teats of the boar, but it is equally as necessary to avoid boars having small teats, teats unevenly placed, and commencing any distance from the fore legs, and blind teats, as it is in the case of the sow, since any weaknesses of the kind...", "...they have any luck, they must begin to brag of it.

He loved her--had loved her all these years! He belonged to her--and his future lay in her hands. His future! The thought fell upon her new-found happiness with the suddenness of a blow.

He calls Hamlet \"the meditative son\" of a strong-willed father, and adds, \"he has slipped on into years of full manhood still a haunter of the university, a student of philosophies, an amateur in art, a ponderer on the things of life and death who has never formed a resolution or executed a deed.

The long stillness was broken by the report of the gun. Instantly every one of the boats on the line started forward.

It was while in this frame of mind, and when Madame de Stael, in her ardor, had endeavored <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to force him to pay her a compliment, that Napoleon responded to her at least somewhat indiscreet question: \"Who is in your eyes the greatest woman?\" with the sarcastic reply, \"She who bears the most children to the state.\" Madame de Stael had come with a heart full of enthusiasm; in her address to Napoleon, she had called him a \"god descended to earth;\" she had come an enthusiastic poetess; she departed an offended woman. Her wounded vanity never forgave the answer which...", "...river, which was now becoming strongly populated by the enemy. Through the darkness could be heard the sound of shuffling, hobnailed boots, and even above the crack of the guns there came the weird swish of the grey coats as they pushed forward in mass formations. The little party of thirteen Americans dismantled their guns and, with each man carrying his allotted piece, they began working their way along the river bank toward the main bridge, where they discovered that the enemy was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> upon them. They immediately went into position behind the stone parapet on the very brink of the river, and, although in constant danger from the American fire that poured out from the south bank, they poured streams of lead point-blank into the advancing German ranks. The Americans on the south bank were not aware of the plight of the little party on the north bank. In spite of their losses, the Germans continued their grewsome rushes toward the approaches of the iron bridge...", "...tetraptera</i>, Aiton, <i>N.O. Leguminosae</i>).

The land was rather more elevated and undulating; the many swamp plants with their long and broad leaves were wanting, and there was less underwood, although the trees were wider apart. Through this wilderness the road continued for seven or eight miles. The same unbroken forest extends all the way to Maranham and in other directions, as we were told, a distance of about 300 miles southward and eastward of Para. In <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every hollow part the road was crossed by a brook, whose cold, dark, leaf-stained waters were bridged over by tree trunks. The ground was carpeted, as usual, by Lycopodiums, but it was also encumbered with masses of vegetable debris and a thick coating of dead leaves. Fruits of many kinds were scattered about, amongst which were many sorts of beans, some of the pods a foot long, flat and leathery in texture, others hard as stone. In one place there was a quantity of large empty...", "...Here he paused as the voice of the twins reached and held him. They were still playing in the sun, banking up the sand and stones in their futile attempt at castle building. He breathed hard, as though summoning up all his decision. Then he spoke. \"Say, kiddies,\" he said firmly. \"I'll be right back at supper.\" And he moved out without another look in their direction, and walked off in the direction of Minky's store. CHAPTER IV SCIPIO BORROWS A HORSE Scipio found an <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> deserted camp after floundering his way over the intricate paths amongst the refuse-heaps. The miners had departed to their claims with a punctuality that suggested Trades Union principles. Such was their existence. They ate to live; they lived to work, ever tracking the elusive metal to the earth's most secret places. The camp claimed them only when their day's work was done; for the rest, it supported only their most urgent needs. Sunny Oak, lounging on a rough bench in...", "...from the ghastly monotony of their existence; the holes of muddy water where the dead things lay, to which they crept out in the night to wash a little of the filth from their clammy bodies and their stinking clothes; the holes dug out of the mud in which they ate and slept and lived year after year: till brain and heart and soul seemed to have died out of them, and they remembered with an effort that they once were men. * * * * * After a time, the care of the convalescents passed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> entirely into Joan's hands, Madame Lelanne being told off to assist her. By dint of much persistence she had succeeded in getting the leaky roof repaired, and in place of the smoky stove that had long been her despair she had one night procured a fine calorifere by the simple process of stealing it. Madame Lelanne had heard about it from the gossips. It had been brought to a lonely house at the end of the village by a major of engineers. He had returned to the trenches the...", "...the masterpiece of some great poet,--and then the Greek drama, the most splendid creation of human genius, was complete. THE THREE GREAT TRAGIC POETS.--There are three great names in Greek tragedy,--AEschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. These dramatists all wrote during the splendid period which followed the victories of the Persian war, when the intellectual life of all Hellas, and especially that of Athens, was strung to the highest tension. This lent nervous power and intensity to <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all they wrote, particularly to the tragedies of AEschylus and Sophocles. Of the two hundred and more dramas produced by these poets, only thirty-two have escaped the accidents of time. AEschylus (525-456 B.C.) knew how to touch the hearts of the generation that had won the victories of the Persian war; for he had fought with honor both at Marathon and at Salamis. But it was on a very different arena that he was destined to win his most enduring fame. Eleven times did he carry...", "...suit. But I would prefer to have you wear your own clothes today.\" \"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\" \"I'll tell you why. I telegraphed on to my advance man all about you last night, and what you did yesterday will be spread all over town here today. It will be a rattling good advertisement. You and the tiger are my best drawing cards today,\" smiled Mr. Sparling. \"Glad I have proved of some use to you, sir.\" \"Use? Use?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Don't be a fool!\" exploded the showman, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> brutally. Phil's countenance fell. \"Don't you understand, yet, that you already have been worth several thousand dollars to me?\" \"I--I--\" \"Well, don't get a swelled head about it, for--\" \"There is no danger of that, sir.\" \"And you don't have to potter around the cook tent working, either. That is, not unless you want to.\" \"But, I do, Mr. Sparling. I want to learn everything there is to be learned about the show business,\" protested Phil. Mr. Sparling...", "...dance. Mein Gott, dot's der greadest sight I effer haff see me.\" This was the strange and awful spectacle Mrs. Schmitz tumbled upon, returning from a week's stay at Rattletrap. Her screams brought the red-headed stable boy to the rescue. Two minutes later, while Mrs. Schmitz was assuring one section of Rabbit township that her poor, miserable husband had sold his soul to hell, and was at that moment dancing fiendish dances with the devil himself in her kitchen, a red-headed youth, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> beside himself with horror, was stirring up the other section with the tale of Dutchy Schmitz howling mad in the hotel, while a great, hairy, hideous jim-jam capered on the floor before him. Rabbit was stirred at last. Professor Thunder was made unpleasantly aware of the fact when he discovered a crowd of patriots surrounding Schmitz's, preparing to burn out the devils that possessed it, having peeped timidly at the windows; and assured themselves of the unearthly nature of...", "...to whom Augusta, pitying his condition--for he was shivering dreadfully--had given the other blanket, keeping nothing for herself except the woollen shawl. At last, however, there came a faint glow in the east, and the daylight began to break over the stormy sea. Augusta turned her head and stared through the mist. \"What is that?\" she said, in a voice trembling with excitement, to the sailor Bill, who was taking his turn at the tiller; and she pointed to a dark mass that loomed up <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> over them. The man looked, and then looked again; and then hallowed out joyfully, \"Land--land ahead!\" Up struggled Mr. Meeson on to his knees--his legs were so stiff that he could not stand--and began to stare wildly about him. \"Thank God!\" he cried. \"Where is it? Is it New Zealand? If ever I get there, I'll stop there. I'll never get on a ship again!\" \"New Zealand!\" growled the sailor. \"Are you a fool? It's Kerguelen Land, that's what it is--where it rains all day, and...", "...for although, since the prior had called his attention to his son's condition, he had, when not at work, done all in his power to make the boy happy, and had even given up two hours every evening to him, at all other times he was absorbed in his work to the exclusion of aught else. \"You have been down into the town?\" he asked Edgar, as they seated themselves at the table. \"Yes, father; and whatever may happen afterwards, there is no fear of any trouble at present. The speeches of <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all the men were quiet and reasonable. They urged that serfdom should be abolished, free right of markets given, the price of good land to be not over four pennies an acre, that all past offences should be pardoned; beyond this they did not go. Indeed, they declared that everything must be done peacefully and in order, and that any man caught plundering should be hung forthwith. By the applause that followed, these are evidently the sentiments of the great mass of the peasants,...", "...similar to that of the sailor. They lie listening in their corners till they have ascertained which principle has most advocates; then presently they make their appearance on the deck of the world with their book; if truth has been victorious, then has truth their hurrah! but if truth is pinioned against the mast, then is their fist thrust against the nose of truth, and their gibe and their insult spirted in her face. The strongest party had the sailor, and the strongest party has <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invariably the writer of the present day. CHAPTER IX--PSEUDO-CRITICS A certain set of individuals calling themselves critics have attacked 'Lavengro' with much virulence and malice. If what they call criticism had been founded on truth, the author would have had nothing to say. The book contains plenty of blemishes, some of them, by-the-by, wilful ones, as the writer will presently show; not one of these, however, has been detected and pointed out; but the best...", "...poem--_illustrated_--mind the word, Nelly--that is to be stuck as fou o' the like o' that, as ever turkey was larded wi' dabs o' bacon.\" Thus furnished with her credentials, and acting the part of a herald betwixt two hostile countries, honest Nelly switched her little fish-cart downwards to St. Ronan's Well. In watering-places, as in other congregated assemblies of the human species, various kinds of government have been dictated, by chance, caprice, or convenience; but in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all of them, some sort of direction has been adopted, to prevent the consequences of anarchy. Sometimes the sole power has been vested in a Master of Ceremonies; but this, like other despotisms, has been of late unfashionable, and the powers of this great officer have been much limited even at Bath, where Nash once ruled with undisputed supremacy. Committees of management, chosen from among the most steady guests, have been in general resorted to, as a more liberal mode of sway,...", "...pleasant. It has as much cloudy weather as almost any part of the world; and yet it has a pleasant climate. Its summers are not hot, its winters not cold. To the worker of any sort this pleasant climate of much unpleasant weather is very pleasing, for in it, as in the climate of London, one can get much work out of himself. [Illustration VIEW IN GORDON PARK.] Cleveland is a singular creation of contraries. It is an inland town, but it builds more vessels and owns more vessels than <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> any other in the United States. About a quarter of all the steel vessels, rated in tonnage, built in the United States in the last fiscal year of the Government were constructed in Cleveland, the order of precedence being Cleveland, Newport News, Chicago, and Detroit; and almost three quarters of the modern steel ships in service on the Great Lakes are owned or operated by Cleveland vesselmen.

Keep off the road, girls. Here come the rest of the picnickers. One accident is enough for today. She was speeding. That's why she was so far ahead of the others. I shall hail this first car and make 'em take Katherine up to the Hall.\" Jerry did not need to hail the car. In the fading daylight the girl at the wheel, who happened to be Margaret Wayne, brought her automobile to a stop <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> even with the roadside group. \"What has happened?\" she called out sharply. \"Your friend Miss Cairns just ran down Miss Langly,\" returned Jerry grimly. \"She isn't dead, but we don't know how badly she may be hurt. May we have the use of your car to take her to the Hall?\" \"Certainly,\" came the response in frightened tones. Next instant the seven occupants of the car had piled out of it and gathered around the still unconscious girl. A swift patter of raindrops struck the...", "...He therefore left his friend Roger and Mr. Veriquear to assist the old man, at the same time instructing them very carefully to secure him if he should attempt to escape from them; while he himself went in search of the cavern, or whatever else it might be, where Mr. Woodruff was confined. As the best guide to this, he demanded in a loud voice, \"Mr. Woodruff!--where are you?--where are you?\" There was no reply. Again he repeated those words, but in a state of feeling which left him <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unconscious of all he said or did. \"Here--here I am!\" at length was answered in a melancholy tone, from an inner place far backhand apparently beyond a door of very small dimensions, securely fastened into the rock, and bound with heavy iron. Colin flew to the spot whence the sound proceeded. The door was as fast as the rock it was built in. He madly strove to burst it, but with as little effect as the rain might beat against a precipice of adamant. Almost in a frenzy of...", "...charge of the attack. His company was the first over the parapets. \"Come on, Irish. Show them what we can do!\" he cried in his impetuous way as he thrust forward his head menacingly towards the German lines. When the men were out of the trenches, a sergeant of the company exclaimed, \"It's sure death, boys, but remember we are Irish.\" He was immediately blown to bits. The Germans, seeing the movement, met it by scourging the advancing lines with shell fire. Lord Wolseley has said that <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every officer who has led a storming party across the open in full view of the enemy would acknowledge that his one anxiety from first to last was, \"Will my men follow me?\" Captain Finegan had no misgiving of the kind. He did not need to look over his shoulder to see if his men had rallied to his cry. They pressed round him as he ran across the open, these Liverpool Irish, most of whom had never seen Ireland, and yet were as eager to maintain her reputation for valour as the...", "...of her attention. Was she in any way relieved? She tried not to think of it. No one referred to the marriage, except now and then some of the slaves, who counted up all the bad signs in an awesome fashion. Dolly had enjoyed everything to the uttermost, and was delighted with her new home and her new relatives. Communication between even the most important cities was tardy at that time, and often sent by private messenger. Yet the political interest of the States was kept up keenly, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to rivalry. New England, whose commerce had been injured the most, complained loudly. The States were between two fires. England was bringing all her power to bear upon the Emperor Napoleon. Neither country paid any attention to the rights of neutrals. There was the old romantic remembrance of France coming to our assistance in our mighty struggle with the mother country; but there were a hundred relationships with England where there was one with France, and Napoleon's...", "...river empties itself. The admiralty now decided to take no further steps to determine the exact fate of the expedition, and granted to Dr Rae the reward of L10,000 which had been offered in 1849 to whosoever should first succeed in obtaining authentic news of the missing men. It was therefore reserved for the latest effort of Lady Franklin to develop, not only the fate of her husband's expedition but also the steps of its progress up to the very verge of success, mingled indeed with <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unprecedented disaster. With all her available means, and aided, as she had been before, by the subscriptions of sympathizing friends, she purchased and fitted out the little yacht \"Fox,\" which sailed from Aberdeen in July 1857. The command was accepted by Captain (afterwards Sir) Leopold M'Clintock, whose high reputation had been won in three of the government expeditions sent out in search of Franklin.

Heaven have mercy upon the poor people!\" and lifting the cross of his sword to his lips, he kissed it, and muttered a prayer. At the same moment a number of men, some evidently of inferior rank, and some in garbs which betokened higher station, ran out of the mill; and Woodville could then perceive that, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> close to the door, between the building and the bridge, the water had risen over the low shore of the islet, so as to be up to the knees of those who came forth. He fancied at first that they were about to make their escape over the bridge; but he saw that several of them were armed with long poles; and turning to the man-at arms, who seemed well acquainted with the country, he inquired what they were about to do. \"To draw the broken cottage-roof to the shore, sir knight, I...", "...but at length the mourners rose; and Marie, taking the hand of the boy-King, drew him towards her, and murmured in his ear a few hurried words which were inaudible to all save himself. As she ceased speaking, Louis glanced up into her face for an instant; and then, extending his right hand towards the corpse, he said in a clear and steady voice-- \"Mother, I swear to do so.\" Even at that awful moment a strange light flashed from the eyes of the Queen, and a smile, which was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> one of triumph, played about her lips as she glanced at the assembled nobles; but the emotion, by whatever cause produced, was only momentary; and after having cast another long and agonized look upon the face of the dead monarch, and aspersed the body with holy water, she bent her head reverentially to the King, and withdrew, followed by her ladies. When the whole of the royal party had paid this last mark of respect to the remains of the deceased sovereign, the coffin was...", "...it was known that this uproar was caused, not by the moans of a lost world falling down through inconceivable spaces to Gehenna, but by the million tin horns which the people of New York deemed a fitting tribute to the New Year. It was a fan-fare _in excelsis_, defying criticism and distance. It was the apotheosis of Manhattan, a sky-scraper of dizzy sound. It was, moreover, the expression of a primal and singularly innocent joy, the joy of a young nation on beholding a New Year. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as though, in the cataclysm of hideous and unlooked-for calamities, in the vanishing of cities and kingdoms, in the irruption of mountains and the sinking of titanic ships beneath the waves, even the recurrence of the seasons had become an adventure and a matter of supreme wonder. A million tin horns! I suppose it was our preoccupation with the solemnity of the hour and the stupendous accompaniment of it that prevented our seeing at first a strange and disquieting signal....", "...this day.

Coffee at the _hacienda_ was a perfect achievement.

Bedient drank with a relish <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> forgotten, but instantly followed that crippling pang--that it was not for Beth; that she could not breathe the warm fragrant winds.... Bedient sprang up. Some hard, brain-filling, body-straining task was the cry of his mind. This was its first defensive activity against the tearing down of bitter loneliness. Until this moment, he had endured passively. Bedient determined to go to _The Pleiad_.

To all such representations I always replied by asserting with the most implicit confidence that I was certain to go to gaol, and that my sentence would be two months. When, however, on November, 10th, 1885, I stood in the dock to receive sentence, and received from the judge a sentence of three months, I was very considerably taken aback. I remember distinctly that I had to remember where I was in order to restrain the <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> irresistible impulse to interrupt the judge and say, \"I beg your pardon, my lord, you have made a mistake, the sentence ought to have been _two_ months.\" But mark what followed. When I had been duly confined in Coldbath-on-the-Fields Prison, I looked at the little card which is fastened on the door of every cell giving the name of the prisoner, his offence, and the duration of his sentence.

Lester's only available capital was his seventy-five thousand dollars. Did he want to begin in a picayune, obscure way? It took money to get a foothold in the carriage business as things were now. The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless, narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a necessary element in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every great business success.

Besides, tracks would disappear when the snow melted. Hair clinging to the sycamore's bark would not. Old Joe went happily on. Though he had eaten nothing in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> seven weeks, he was not especially hungry, and hunger alone never would have driven him from the den tree.

This design was to sail to India by taking a western direction. By the accounts of travellers who had visited that part of Asia, it seemed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> without limits on the east; and by attending to the spherical figure of the earth Columbus drew the natural conclusion, that the Atlantic ocean must be bounded on the west either by India itself, or by some continent not far distant from it.

When it was necessary to remove some surface soil before there was water enough for the dredges to float, it was done by the natives of Lake Menzaleh, a hardy and peculiar race, quite at home in digging canals or building embankments. The following account shows their mode of proceeding:--\"They place themselves in files across the channel. The men in the middle of the file have their feet and the lower part of their legs in the water. These men...", "...respect and thankfulness. The king leaned over to the countess' ear and whispered a word. \"Sire, I am your majesty's most obedient servant.\" Her reverence was accompanied by a most bewitching smile. The king waved his hand and retired to his own rooms. Scarcely had he crossed the threshold before the countess turned more frightened than ever to the singular man who had so monopolized her. Like the others, he had bowed as the monarch withdrew, but his brow had worn a haughty, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> menacing aspect. As soon as Louis had disappeared, he came and paused within a step or two of Lady Dubarry. Urged by invincible curiosity, she took a step toward him, so that he could say in a low voice as he bent to her: \"Am I recognized, lady?\" \"Yes, as my prophet of Louis XV. Square.\" \"Well,\" queried the man with the clear, steady gaze, \"Did I lie when I told you of becoming the Queen of France?\" \"No; your prophecy is all but accomplished. Hence, I am ready to...", "...abundant. Even if not collecting, it is well to carry a small tin pail to the beach and float out pieces of the algae in order to observe carefully, if but for a moment, the beautiful forms they have in their natural state.

Most of the various species mentioned above are common along the whole shore, and may be looked for at <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> any point where the water is free from contamination. At the sand-beach are found species which do not inhabit the rocky shore, as the sand-dollar (/Echinarachnius parma/), /Polynices/ (/Lunatia/) /heros/, /Mya arenaria/, and others. After a storm various deep-water forms are washed upon this beach. /Laminaria digitata/, six feet long, is found here sometimes under these circumstances. /Chordaria flagelliformis/, resembling long switches of hair, floats from the rocks near...", "...grin. \"I'll give it to you that you is leaving my house as clean as you found it, and that's something I can't say of most tenants.\" \"Cleaner!\" muttered Blanche, but if Mrs. Rand heard, she pretended not to. Dee's grande dame manner had had its effect and she now treated us with great cordiality, shaking hands and expressing a wish to see all of us again at the beach and complimenting us again and again on the neatness of the cottage. She sent messages to \"that so-called paw\" and was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> genial as she bade us good-bye.

There is no denying it. About the middle of this century, what struck every cultivated foreigner who set up his residence in England, was, what he was then bound to consider the religious bigotry and stupidity of the English respectable middle-class. We, at that time, were all materialists, or, at least, very advanced freethinkers, and to us it appeared inconceivable that <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all educated people in England should believe in all sorts of impossible miracles, and that even geologists like Buckland and Mantell should contort the facts of their science so as not to clash too much with the myths of the book of Genesis; while, in order to find people who dared to use their own intellectual faculties with regard to religious matters, you had to go amongst the uneducated, the \"great unwashed,\" as they were then called, the working people, especially the...", "...the presence of an unknown being in the dark passage put him into a state of fearful apprehension, and recalled those images of horror to his imagination, which he felt himself least able to combat. \"Is he now dead above there?--is it his maniac spirit which persecutes thee?\" he whispered to himself; and the form of the frantic murderer appeared to his imagination far more terrific than when he beheld it actually stretched on the corpse-bench; \"or is it thou, old Palle!\" he exclaimed, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> with an outcry of terror. The scene of the murder in Finnerup barn, which had haunted him in his childhood, and the image of the aged and insane regicide he had himself slain on the body of the murdered king, were again vividly present to his imagination.

It also forms a highly ornamental tree when growing, and is planted in large numbers near the temples. No one can fail to admire its broad white flowers, which are marvelously fragrant, and the rich, polished green of its foliage. It has another striking beauty common to several species of tropical trees, namely, the young leaves and shoots are so red as to clothe the tree at times with a rich mantle of crimson, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> rivaling in effect the magnolia-like blossoms. Hereabouts, but particularly to the northward on the Jaffna peninsula, the palmyra palm is found in profusion, with its black straight stem crowned by a thick sheaf of pinnate leaves. This tree is said to live three hundred years. Of all the varieties of the palm, the palmyra, with the exception of the date, has the widest geographical distribution. The Tamils have a proverb to the effect that \"The palmyra lives for a lac of years...", "...barrels. Each raft was composed of heavy timbers, bound together in bunches of three, the spaces between being connected by ships' masts and lighter spar-work, and with a tooth-like projection along the whole outer edge, formed of strong rafters, pointed and armed with sharp prongs and hooks of iron. Thus a serried phalanx, as it were, of spears stood ever on guard to protect the precious inner structure. Vessels coming from Zeeland or Antwerp, and the floating ice-masses, which were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as formidable, were obliged to make their first attack upon these dangerous outer defences. Each raft; floating in the middle of the stream, extended twelve hundred, and fifty- two feet across, thus protecting the whole of the bridge of boats and a portion of that resting upon piles.

War had been the main business of the country for eight years, and trade, manufactures, and agriculture, had been neglected. Villages had been burned, ships destroyed, and crops laid waste. The British held Charleston over a year, and Savannah and New York about two years after the surrender at Yorktown. George III was obstinate, and war might be resumed. Yet the American army was in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> open rebellion. The soldiers, afraid they should be disbanded and sent home without pay, petitioned Congress, but received no satisfaction. The treasury was empty.

'The snake, seeing them approach <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> within range of his hideous maw, gathered himself into a coil, and prepared to strike. His eyes scintillated like sparks of fire, and seemed to fascinate the birds; for instead of retiring, they each moment drew nearer and nearer, now alighting on the ground, then flapping back to the branches, and anon darting to the ground again--as though they were under some spell from those fiery eyes, and were unable to take themselves away. Their motions appeared to grow less energetic,...", "...to the various points she had raised, I was somewhat confused. About the Honourable George, for example: He was, to be sure, no mental giant. But one occupying his position is not required to be. Indeed, in the class to which he was born one well knows that a mental giant would be quite as distressingly bizarre as any other freak. I regretted not having retorted this to her, for it now occurred to me that she had gone it rather strong with her \"poor old Judge.\" I mean to say, it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> quite a little bit raw for a native American to adopt this patronizing tone toward one of us. And yet I found that my esteem for the Mixer had increased rather than diminished by reason of her plucky defence of the Klondike woman.

That Kenneby might be made to say <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> anything was taken for granted. With him there would be very great scope for that peculiar skill with which Mr. Chaffanbrass was so wonderfully gifted. In the hands of Mr. Chaffanbrass it was not improbable that Kenneby might be made to swear that he had signed two, three, four--any number of documents on that fourteenth of July, although he had before sworn that he had only signed one. Mr. Chaffanbrass indeed might probably make him say anything that he pleased.

The simple fact that the quarrels between the factions of the chariot races for a long period eclipsed all political, intellectual, and even religious differences, filled the streets again and again with bloodshed, and more than once determined great revolutions in the State, is sufficient to show the extent of the decadence. Patriotism and courage had <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> disappeared, and, notwithstanding the rise of a Belisarius or a Narses, the level of public men was extremely depressed. The luxury of the court, the servility of the courtiers, and the prevailing splendour of dress and of ornament, had attained an extravagant height. The world grew accustomed to a dangerous alternation of extreme asceticism and gross vice, and sometimes, as in the case of Antioch,(339) the most vicious and luxurious cities produced the most numerous anchorites....", "...was also arrested by a person who was arrayed in a hunting suit of buck-skin, curiously wrought with strips of dyed porcupine-quill, and who wore an otter-skin cap and Indian moccasins.

I subsequently donned one myself, and found it an admirable adjunct to easy travelling. During my stay at New York, I found the heat <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> overpowering, the Indian summer (as the period between autumn and winter is there termed) having set in. An umbrella was quite a necessary appendage at times, to avoid its effects, which are often fatal to Europeans at the time of the summer solstice.

Subscribers were sought with painful endeavor, one at a time, and all the points at issue were discussed in letters which seemed sometimes to travel by chance.

There are several causes from which this originality may arise, particularly in a young community less gregarious than those of the civilized countries of the Old World. The commonest of these causes in a society like that of the United States is, perhaps, the absence of influences to which <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> all other persons are subject. The common pressure being absent in some one direction, the being grows out in that direction, and the mind and character exhibit more or less deformity to the eyes of all but the individual most concerned.

Such a thing, occurring at <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> eleven o'clock, promised a series of stirring experiences; and an American lady, long resident in England, encouragingly said, on hearing of the outrage, \"Ah, that's _London!_\" as if I might look to be often mishandled by bandits of the sort; but nothing like it ever befell me again.

Bribery of dyers was carried on <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> universally on a large scale. . . . So extensive was this corruption that I came across only one American consumer that had escaped its ill effects.\" Such were hardly the methods of decent commercial competition, although it appears that the strong patriotic sense of the German was able to justify, in his own eyes, what might be regarded as reprehensible methods.

He pointed his hearers to the long line of holy men who had been condemned by unjust judges. In <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every generation have been those who, while seeking to elevate the people of their time, have been reproached and cast out, but who in later times have been shown to be deserving of honor. Christ Himself was condemned as a malefactor at an unrighteous tribunal.

She made evident attempts to cover her ignorance with regard to table formalities by much gay talk. She laughed incessantly, and told many jokes at her brother's expense. She said: \"him and me,\" and \"her and I,\" and \"you folks,\" and a dozen other provincialisms. When they returned to Mrs. Burnham's parlor, it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> worse--for then Mamie sang; and it was hard for her hostess to determine of which she was most ashamed, the bad taste of the girl's selections or the less than mediocre execution. Still, the music was by no means the worst feature of that memorable hour.

Women have broken many of their old chains, but they are still enmeshed in a formidable network of man-made taboos and sentimentalities, and it will take them another generation, at least, to get genuine freedom. That this is true is shown by the deep unrest that yet marks the sex, despite its recent progress toward social, political and economic equality. It is almost impossible to find a man who honestly wishes that he were a woman, but <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every woman, at some time or other in her life, is gnawed by a regret that she is not a man. Two of the hardest things that women have to bear are (a) the stupid masculine disinclination to admit their intellectual superiority, or even their equality, or even their possession of a normal human equipment for thought, and (b) the equally stupid masculine doctrine that they constitute a special and ineffable species of vertebrate, without the natural instincts and appetites of...", "...you are rather surprised to see me, aren't you?\" Molly looked up.

The idea of the ever-constant sympathy of the divine Mother appeals perhaps even more strongly to the man, carrying with it his worship of perfect womanhood, and awakening the natural chivalry of his nature.

The enemy, seeing little chance of escape, fought like a tiger at bay, but both Seymour and Wheaton pressed him vigorously, gaining ground at all points except just to the right of the road, where Seymour's left was checked. Here the Confederates burst back on us in a counter-charge, surging down <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the creek, but the artillery, supported by Getty, who in the mean time had come on the ground, opened on them so terribly that this audacious and furious onset was completely broken, though the gallant fellows fell back to their original line doggedly, and not until after they had almost gained the creek. Ewell was now hemmed in on every side, and all those under his immediate command were captured.

Par was a fugitive. He had been on the run for more than two years from the frigging Secret Service, for Christ's sake. There was no way--NO WAY--he was going to walk out of that courtroom scot-free. The court asked Par to prove his birthday. A quick driver's licence search at the department of motor vehicles showed Par and his lawyer were telling the truth. So Par walked free. When he stepped outside the courthouse, Par turned his face toward the sun.

Just wandering down the street made him happy. However, Par never really got over being on the run.

Though it was soon over, he was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> stunned by the pelting water, and emerged breathless and wet to the skin. Pausing for a moment to recover breath, he crept down the watercourse. The channel was shallow; he had very little cover; but he could not waste time in careful scouting.

It was their cavalry charging under cover of their fire. I could not see the fight, for it was at the other end of the division, but their heavy guns swept us off by dozens as we...", "...was costly in the extreme, and a mummification of an elaborate kind cost about L700 in modern currency. When the relations of the deceased consulted the professional embalmers they were shown models of mummies, one of which they selected. The corpse was then placed in the hands of the embalmers. First of all they injected a corrosive into the brain cavity, after which its softened contents were removed through the nostrils by hooked instruments. A mummifier, whose office rendered him <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a pariah, so sacred was the human body considered, made an incision in the corpse with a flint knife, a time-honoured instrument that seems eloquent of prehistoric practice. The intestines and the principal organs were then removed, washed, and steeped in palm wine. The body then underwent a drying process, and, according to the period, was stripped of its flesh, only the skin remaining, or was stuffed with sawdust, skilfully introduced through incisions, so that the natural...", "...low at last.

They were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> out of reach of the Cretan shores, when Talus came into view, and, perceiving that his master's prisoners were about to escape, leaned forward to catch the vessel by its rigging. Theseus, seeing this, sprang forward, and dealt the giant such a blow, that he lost his balance and fell into the deep sea, where he was drowned, and where thermal springs still bear witness to the heat of his brazen body.

Starting largely as a movement to keep whiskey from the negro and, to a somewhat less extent, from the white laborer, prohibition has become popular. On the whole it has worked well in the South though \"moonshining\" is undoubtedly increasing. The enormous price eagerly paid for whiskey in the \"bone-dry\" States has led to a revival of the illicit distillery, which had been <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> stamped out. CHAPTER IV THE FARMER AND THE LAND The end of Reconstruction found the tenant system and the \"crop lien\" firmly fastened upon the South. The plantation system had broken down since the owner no longer had slaves to work his land, capital to pay wages, or credit on which to borrow the necessary funds. Many of the great plantations had already been broken up and sold, while others, divided into tracts of convenient size, had been rented to white or...", "...in spite of my patriotism. I know that if any of my fellow-countrywomen come to read me they will be very angry; but I shall be beyond the reach of all anger. To return to our theatricals. As I could not make my actresses get their parts letter perfect, I became their prompter, and found out by experience all the ungratefulness of the position. The actors never acknowledged their debt to the prompter, and put down to his account all the mistakes they make. A Spanish doctor is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as badly off; if his patient recovers, the cure is set down to the credit of one saint or another; but if he dies, the physician is blamed for his unskilful treatment. A handsome negress, who served the prettiest of my actresses to whom I shewed great attentions, said to me one day,-- \"I can't make out how you can be so much in love with my mistress, who is as white as the devil.\" \"Have you never loved a white man?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" said she, \"but only because I had no...", "...a storm as even the oldest fisherman, who had lived in the same little fishing village on the North American shore all his life, never remembered to have seen before. For days sulky, smoke-like clouds had been gathering in the sky, while the sea grew darker and darker in hue, until its darkness was accentuated into an inky appearance by the white-capped waves, which grew bigger and fiercer as each hour drew on. And at last the storm had burst after a deadly silence that could <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> be felt--burst with such vindictive fury that houses and buildings, which had stood steadfast for years, toppled and fell down like a house of cards, while the stately vessels which had braved many a storm were tossed about and wrecked upon the rocks. Even the fish in the sea were surprised, and after a little consultation decided to swim nearer the shore and keep quiet until the storm had spent itself. The fish were not the only ones that came to the conclusion that the...", "...in haste; many of them were corrupt, and encouraged the misconduct of the labourers. In many cases the relief committees, unable to prevent maladministration, yielded to the torrent of corruption, and individual members only sought to benefit their own dependants. The people everywhere flocked to the public works; labourers, cottiers, artisans, fishermen, farmers, men, women, and children--all, whether destitute or not, sought for a share of the public money. In such a crowd, it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> impossible to discriminate properly. They congregated in masses on the roads, idling under the name of work, the really destitute often unheeded and unrelieved because they had no friend to recommend them. All the ordinary employments were neglected; there was no fishing, no gathering of sea-weed, no collecting of manure. The men who had employment feared to lose it by absenting themselves for any other object; those unemployed spent their time in seeking to obtain it. The...", "...STREET, LINCOLN'S INN FIELDS. A CANADIAN HEROINE. CHAPTER I. Mrs. Costello had felt it a kind of reprieve when she heard from Mr. Strafford that they might delay their journey safely for a month. The sober middle age which had come upon her before its time, as her life rolled on out of the anguish and tumult of the past, made home and quietness the most desirable things on earth to her, and her health and spirits, neither yet absolutely broken, but both strained <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to the extent of their endurance, unfitted her for the changes and excitements of long travel. So she clung to the idea of delay with an unacknowledged hope that some cause might deliver them from their present terrors, and yet suffer them to remain at Cacouna. In the meantime all went on outwardly as usual. The duties and courtesies of every-day life had to be kept up,--the more carefully because it was not desirable to attract attention. Besides, Mrs. Costello felt that an...", "...of $3.1 billion (FY93 est.)

The young males which our fallow deer do bring forth are commonly named according to their several ages: for the first year it is a fawn, the second a pricket, the third a sorel, the fourth a soare, the fifth a buck of the first head, not bearing the name of a buck till he be five years old: and from henceforth his age is commonly known by his head or horns.

The first stanza is praised by Professor Lowell, in his Study Windows, p. 208, where he says--'What a sweep of vision is here!'

He did reprove him now, though unintentionally. For David was delighted at having such good news from him; and the uneasiness which he had felt, but never quite expressed, was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> swept away in the conclusion, that it was unreasonable to expect the young man to give his time to them both absent and present, especially when he had been occupied to such good purpose as this letter signified. So he was nearly at peace about him--though not quite.

Suddenly with a hoarse screech, the lynx sprang, hoping to land with all his weight on the humped-up black back, and then bring into play his ripping curved claws, while he sank his teeth deep into his opponent's spine. It was at once evident that lynx tactics have not yet been adapted to blackcat service. Without a sound, the pekan swerved like a shadow to one side, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> before the lynx had touched the ground, the fisher's fierce cutting teeth had severed the tendon of a hind leg, while its curved claws slashed deep into the soft inner flank. The great cat screeched with rage and pain and sheer astonishment. As he landed, the crippled leg bent under him. Even yet he had one advantage which no amount of courage or speed on the part of the pekan could have overcome.

The same relation subsists between beauty and utility in architecture as between truth and imagination in poetry. Utility is not to be obviously sacrificed to beauty, in the one case; truth and probability are not to be outraged for the cause of fiction and fancy, in the other. In the severer styles of architecture, beauty and utility approach so as to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> identical. Where utility is more especially the main design, the proportions which produce it raise the sense or feeling of beauty, by a sort of reflection or deduction of the mind.

Leon Gambetta was the true type of the southern Frenchman--what his countrymen call a meridional. The Frenchman of the south is different from the Frenchman of the north, for the latter has in his veins a touch of the viking blood, so that he is very apt to be fair-haired and blue-eyed, temperate in speech, and self-controlled. He is different, again, from the Frenchman of central France, who is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> purely Celtic. The meridional has a marked vein of the Italian in him, derived from the conquerors of ancient Gaul. He is impulsive, ardent, fiery in speech, hot-tempered, and vivacious to an extraordinary degree. Gambetta, who was born at Cahors, was French only on his mother's side, since his father was of Italian birth. It is said also that somewhere in his ancestry there was a touch of the Oriental. At any rate, he was one of the most southern of the sons of southern...", "...probably without the aid of the \"Levanter\" should I have succeeded in doing so, the suction of the water along the sides was so powerful.

Harvey backed it out and retraced his wheel-tracks to the edge of the main road. \"Now where?\" \"Anywhere,\" said Madden, waving grandly. \"Out into the world.\" He hoisted himself up to the back again: Gin followed suit in the front seat, and the three balancing figures jogged and reeled as Harvey drove on toward Taos.

He did not speak to either Emily or Thankful, but, dragging one foot after the other, crossed the room and sat down in a chair by the window. Thankful spoke to him. \"Are you sick, Solomon?\" she asked. Mr. Cobb shook his head. \"Eh?\" he grunted. \"No, no, I ain't sick.

Then look at the beginnings of the paragraphs to see whether you have made it easy for your readers to know what each one is about.

Shrimping day!\" Directly after Harry...", "...was made to float vertically, by means of a weight attached to its inferior extremity; a line of one hundred and seventy-eight feet in length was run out by this arrangement, during the following intervals of time, in four experiments, viz. 1' 21\"--1' 21\"--1' 19\"--1' 21\", of which the mean is 1' 20-1/2\", which would seem to indicate a current of the velocity of 1 mile 893 yards 1 foot per hour. Thus the average velocity of ten feet in depth of the current of the Missouri, is greater by <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> 452 yards in a single hour, than {173} that of a superficial stratum of about six inches depth, during the ice-bound state of the river. During these experiments the atmosphere was nearly calm. 25th.

The Duke of St. James was unhappy, he was discontented, he was dissatisfied with himself. He did not love this lady, if love were the passion which he entertained for Miss Dacre, but she loved him. He knew that she was beautiful, and he was convinced that she was excellent. The world is malicious, but the world had agreed that Lady Aphrodite was an unblemished pearl: yet this jewel was reserved for him! Intense gratitude <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> amounted to love. In short, he had no idea at this moment that feelings are not in our power. His were captive, even if entrapped. It was a great responsibility to desert this creature, the only one from whom he had experienced devotion. To conclude: a season of extraordinary dissipation, to use no harsher phrase, had somewhat exhausted the nervous powers of our hero; his energies were deserting him; he had not heart or heartlessness enough to extricate himself from this...", "...their guns and warlike material to Acre, and mounted his thirty-four captured pieces on the batteries of the town. Thus the disgusted French saw the very guns which were intended to batter down the defences of Acre--and which were glorious with the memories of a dozen victories in Italy--frowning at them, loaded with English powder and shot, and manned by English sailors. It is needless to say that a siege directed by Napoleon--the siege of what he looked upon as a contemptible and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> defenceless town, the single barrier betwixt his ambition and its goal--was urged with amazing fire and vehemence. The wall was battered day and night, a breach fifty feet wide made, and more than twelve assaults delivered, with all the fire and daring of which French soldiers, gallantly led, are capable. So sustained was the fighting, that on one occasion the combat raged in the ditch and on the breach for _twenty-five_ successive hours. So close and fierce was it that one...", "...or younger, were still contemporaries. Irving's _Knickerbocker's History of New York_, 1809, was published within the recollection of some yet living, and the venerable poet Richard H. Dana--Irving's junior by only four years--survived to 1879, when the youngest of the generation of writers that now occupy public attention had already won their spurs. Bryant, whose _Thanatopsis_ was printed in 1816, lived down to 1878. He saw the beginnings of our national literature, and he saw <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as much of the latest phase of it as we see to-day in this year 1891. Still, even within the limits of a single life-time, there have been progress and change. And so, while it will happen that the consideration of writers, a part of whose work falls between the dates at the head of this chapter, may be postponed to subsequent chapters, we may in a general way follow the sequence of time. The period between the close of the second war with England, in 1815, and the great...", "...Flower was more or less uncivilized; there was a good deal of the wild and of the untamed about her; and now that the baby was alive, and likely to do well, overwhelming contrition for the deed she had done no longer oppressed her. She stepped along as quickly as her uncomfortable boots would admit. The moonlight fell full on her slender figure, and cast a cold radiance over her uncovered head. Her long, yellow hair floated down over her shoulders; she looked wonderfully ethereal, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unearthly, and had any of the villagers been abroad, they might well have taken her for one of the ghosts of the moor. Flower had a natural instinct for finding her way, and, aided by Maggie's directions, she steered in a straight course for the village. Not a soul was abroad; she was alone, in a great solitude. The feeling gave her a certain sense of exhilaration. From the depths of her despair her easily influenced spirits sprang again to hope and confidence. After all,...", "...Englishman when he was a man. They had not time to go very deep into the Revolution again--and indeed Lord Fauntleroy felt some delicacy about returning to the subject--before dinner was announced. Cedric left his chair and went to his noble kinsman. He looked down at his gouty foot. \"Would you like me to help you?\" he said politely. \"You could lean on me, you know. Once when Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato-barrel rolling on it, he used to lean on me.\" The big footman <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> periled his reputation and his situation by smiling. He was an aristocratic footman who had always lived in the best of noble families, and he had never smiled; indeed, he would have felt himself a disgraced and vulgar footman if he had allowed himself to be led by any circumstance whatever into such an indiscretion as a smile. But he had a very narrow escape. He only just saved himself by staring straight over the Earl's head at a very ugly picture. The Earl looked his...", "...to every right thinking man, woman and child within it. For out of all the military and diplomatic turmoil, out of all the propaganda, and counter-propaganda of the present conflicts, there are two facts which stand out, and which the whole world acknowledges. The first is that never before has the Government of the United States of America done so much as in our recent past to establish and maintain the policy of the Good Neighbor with its sister nations. The second is that in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every nation in the world today there is a true public belief that the United States has been, and will continue to be, a potent and active factor in seeking the reestablishment of world peace. In these recent years we have had a clean record of peace and good-will. It is an open book that cannot be twisted or defamed. It is a record that must be continued and enlarged. So I hope that Americans everywhere will work out for themselves the several alternatives which lie...", "...crowns to keep up a state almost princely in our days, his yearly revenue, \"all told,\" as the saying is, was a bare nine thousand francs. With this and his salary, the President's income amounted to about twenty thousand francs; but though to all appearance a wealthy man, especially as one-half of his father's property would one day revert to him as the only child of the first marriage, he was obliged to live in Paris as befitted his official position, and M. and Mme. de Marville spent <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> the whole of their incomes. Indeed, before the year 1834 they felt pinched. This family schedule sufficiently explains why Mlle. de Marville, aged three-and-twenty, was still unwed, in spite of a hundred thousand francs of dowry and tempting prospects, frequently, skilfully, but so far vainly, held out. For the past five years Pons had listened to Mme. la Presidente's lamentations as she beheld one young lawyer after another led to the altar, while all the newly appointed...", "...I made an excursion through the Roman gateway, along a pleasant and level road bordered with dwellings of various character. One or two were houses of gentility, with delightful and shadowy lawns before them; many had those high, red-tiled roofs, ascending into acutely pointed gables, which seem to belong to the same epoch as some of the edifices in our own earlier towns; and there were pleasant-looking cottages, very sylvan and rural, with hedges so dense and high, fencing them in, as <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> to hide them up to the eaves of their thatched roofs. In front of one of these I saw various images, crosses, and relics of antiquity, among which were fragments of old Catholic tombstones, disposed by way of ornament. We now went home to the Saracen's Head; and as the weather was very unpropitious, and it sprinkled a little now and then, I would gladly have felt myself released from further thraldom to the Cathedral.

None the less the wave struggled on, until artillery was added to machine guns, field guns from Monchy enfiladed No Man's Land, every German battery sent its shells into the carrying parties, and the attack was stopped. The two leading Staffordshire Battalions, except for a few who reached the enemy's lines, were held up on his wire or near the Sucrerie, where many fell. The two leading Sherwood Foresters had crossed No Man's Land <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unscathed, had entered the German lines complete, and were never seen again. Commanding Officers, Battalion Headquarters and their Companies were lost. The other four Battalions, after losing their leading wave, remained in our front trenches and sent back messages for more smoke, while here and there gallant efforts were made by platoons and sections to take help into the wood. Meanwhile, Capt. Ward Jackson with his Company Serjeant Major--J.R. Hill--and two platoons...", "...I tried.\" The trail of the loose excelsior led around the base of the cliff and to a much larger opening than the first they had discovered. Jack was in advance, and of a sudden he put up his hand as a warning. \"What is it?\" asked his chums, in a whisper. \"The two crazy men--in a cave. I think they are sleeping.\" With extreme caution the cadets moved forward, so all could look into the cave beyond. The young major was right, there on the ground, near a small campfire which was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> burnt out, lay Bart Callax and Paul Shaff. Both were sound asleep in spite of the fierce thunderstorm that was raging. \"They must prowl around so much in the night that they have to sleep in the daytime,\" said Pepper, and guessed the truth. The boys looked behind the sleepers and saw a number of bags piled in a corner of the cave. On a rock lay the green masks and hoods and also a butcher knife, a hatchet, and several other things. \"Can we capture them?\" questioned...", "...said Count Victor, as the man fell limp behind him upon his unconscious confederate. The third in front turned like a viper when Count Victor's clutch came on his waist, and drove out with his feet. The act was his own undoing. It met with no resistance, and the impetus of his kick carried him off the balance and threw him on the top of his confederates below. \"_Trois!_\" said Montaiglon. \"Pulling corks is the most excellent training for such a warfare,\" and he set himself <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> cheerfully to number four. But number four was not in the neck of the bottle: this ferment behind him propelled him out upon the stairhead, and Montaiglon, who had thrown himself upon him, fell with him on the floor. Both men recovered their feet at a spring. A moment's pause was noisy with the cries of the domestic in her room, then the Frenchman felt a hand pass rapidly over his habiliments and seek hurriedly for his throat, as on a sudden inspiration. What that precluded...", "...and the king still reigned and was in possession of great resources, yet another coating, so to speak, was put on to the pyramid, and so on till colossal structures like the First and Second Pyramid of Giza, which, we know, belonged to kings who were unusually long-lived, were completed. And finally the aged monarch died, and was buried in the huge tomb which his long life and his great power had enabled him to erect. This view appeared eminently reasonable at the time, and it seemed <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as though we ought to be able to tell whether a king had reigned long or not by the size of his pyramid, and even to obtain a rough idea of the length of his reign by counting the successive coats or accretions which it had received, much as we tell the age of a tree by the rings in its bole. A pyramid seemed to have been constructed something after the manner of an onion or a Chinese puzzle-box.

She complied, and in the same instant she met his look. \"Max,\" she said rather breathlessly, \"I--don't quite like it.\" \"All right,\" he said imperturbably. \"Don't do it!\" She paused, looking at him <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> imploringly. \"You're sure it won't mean anything?\" \"It can mean as much or as little as you like,\" said Max. \"I didn't mean--quite that,\" faltered Olga. \"But--it won't be--it never could be--like a real engagement; could it?\" \"Like, yet unlike,\" said Max. \"It will be a sort of elastic and invisible bond, made to stretch to the utmost limit, never breaking of itself, though capable of being severed by either party at a moment's notice.\" Olga drew a breath of relief. \"If...", "...in a few minutes after he had left her. \"Madame,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders, \"I am sorry, but your wish cannot be fulfilled.

Here, in sight of the protecting ramparts of the city, this decimated people lived for a time secure. But the Iroquois were set upon nothing less than their annihilation, and in 1656 they made a descent upon the quiet island and carried off many captives. The terrified Hurons were then removed to the city itself and lodged in a square enclosure <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> adjoining Fort St. Louis. A map of 1660 places the \"Fort des Sauvages\" on the site of the present _Place d'Armes_. Here they dwelt for about ten years in the same uncertain security enjoyed by Quebec itself.

Several of the older men of the party gave out, and we were forced to leave them with half our baggage and what water was left: there was a spring, they told us, near the summit. The scramble down the one side of the canon, and up the other, was a hard hour's work.

Theodore mourned for several days the death of his faithful follower, in whom he lost more than a brave chief and a hardy soldier: I may <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> say he lost his kingdom, for none dared honestly to advise and fearlessly to counsel him as Bell had done, and none ever enjoyed that confidence which rendered Bell's advice so acceptable.

The public demands quantity, not quality; and it is ready, for a time at any rate, to pay for its quantity with <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> unheard of returns, both, as the homely old phrase goes, in praise and in pudding.

As the two new houses could not shelter all the refugees, it is probable that some of them were sheltered in bank tunnels, while room for others may have been found in the old houses.

Midway up the pyramid, cut in the marble, is an inscription in large Roman letters, still <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as legible as when first wrought. I did not return through the Paolo gateway, but kept onward, round the exterior of the wall, till I came to the gate of San Sebastiano. It was a hot and not a very interesting walk, with only a high bare wall of brick, broken by frequent square towers, on one side of the road, and a bank and hedge or a garden wall on the other. Roman roads are most inhospitable, offering no shade, and no seat, and no pleasant views of rustic domiciles;...", "...hand. The door was opened, and I was thrown in with violence, and left alone, the door being immediately closed and bolted on the outside. The bare ground was under me, cold and hard as if it had been beaten down even. I lay still, in the position in which I had fallen, as it would have been difficult for me to move, confined as I was, and exhausted by my exertions; and the shock of my fall, and my wretched state of desperation and fear, disinclined me from any further attempt. I was in <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> total darkness, there being nothing perceptible except a slight glimmer of light which came in through the little window far above me. How long I remained in that condition I can only conjecture. It seemed to me a long time, and must have been two or three hours. I did not move, expecting to die there, and in a state of distress which I cannot describe, from the tight bandage about my hands, and the gag holding my jaws apart at their greatest extension. I am confident I must...", "...Jean approached Bettina, took her in his arms, and pressed upon her brow the first kiss. Bettina gently freed herself, and addressing the Abbe, said: \"And now, Monsieur l'Abbe, I have still one thing to ask you. I wish-- I wish--\" \"You wish?\" \"Pray, Monsieur le Cure, embrace me, too.\" The old priest kissed her paternally on both cheeks, and then Bettina continued: \"You have often told me, Monsieur le Cure, that Jean was almost like your own son, and I shall be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> like your own daughter, shall I not? So you will have two children, that is all.\" ........................... A month after, on the 12th of September, at mid-day, Bettina, in the simplest of wedding-gowns, entered the church of Longueval, while, placed behind the altar, the trumpets of the 9th Artillery rang joyously through the arches of the old church.

'They fear Totrasmek, as all in Zamboula fear him, even Jungir Khan and Nafertari. Come! Come quickly, before my courage flows from me like water!' The girl's fear was evident, but she did not falter. Conan drew his sword and strode ahead of her as they advanced through the open gateway. He knew the hideous habits of the priests of the East, and was aware that an invader of Hanuman's shrine might expect to encounter <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> any sort of nightmare horror. He knew there was a good chance that neither he nor the girl would ever leave the shrine alive, but he had risked his life too many times before to devote much thought to that consideration.

Heron had stepped briskly in, closely followed by de Batz. The man Dupont with a mutter of satisfaction put down his lanthorn and curled himself up in a corner of the antechamber. His interest in the spectacle so favoured by citizen Heron had apparently been exhausted by constant repetition. De Batz looked round him with keen curiosity with which disgust was ready enough to mingle. The room itself might have been a large one; it was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> impossible to judge of its size, so crammed was it with heavy and light furniture of every conceivable shape and type. There was a monumental wooden bedstead in one corner, a huge sofa covered in black horsehair in another. A large table stood in the centre of the room, and there were at least four capacious armchairs round it. There were wardrobes and cabinets, a diminutive washstand and a huge pier-glass, there were innumerable boxes and packing-cases, cane-bottomed chairs and...", "...the finished life-pictures of George Eliot, the powerful imagination of Victor Hugo, and the masterly delineations of Thackeray; to hang over the absorbing biographies of Dr. Franklin, Walter Scott and Dr. Johnson; to peruse with fresh delight the masterpieces of Irving and Goldsmith, and the best essays of Hazlitt, De Quincey, Charles Lamb, and Montaigne; to feel the inspiration of the great poets of all ages, from Homer down to Tennyson; to read Shakespeare--a book that is in itself <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a university:--is not all this satisfaction enough for human appetite, however craving, solace enough for trouble, however bitter, occupation enough for life, however long?

To-day she looked not unlike a splendid Amazon who could have been a splendid nun had she entered into religion. As she stood there by Androvsky, simply dressed for the wild journey that was before her, the slight hint in her personality of a Spartan youth, that stamped her with a very definite originality, was blended with, even transfigured by, a womanliness so intense as to be <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> fierce, a womanliness that had the fervour, the glowing vigour of a glory that had suddenly become fully aware of itself, and of all the deeds that it could not only conceive, but do. She was triumph embodied in the flesh, not the triumph that is a school-bully, but that spreads wings, conscious at last that the human being has kinship with the angels, and need not, should not, wait for death to seek bravely their comradeship. She was love triumphant, woman utterly fearless...", "...her figure, the delight of the brown curls clustering about her neck, and he again felt that sense of the scholar confronted by the hieroglyphic. He could not have expressed his emotion, but he wondered whether he would ever find the key, and something told him that before she could speak to him his own lips must be unclosed. She had gone into the house by the back kitchen door, leaving it open, and he heard her speaking to the girl about the water being 'really boiling.' He was amazed, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> indignant with himself; but the sound of the words came to his ears as strange, heart-piercing music, tones from another, wonderful sphere. And yet he was her husband, and they had been married nearly a year; and yet, whenever she spoke, he had to listen to the sense of what she said, constraining himself, lest he should believe she was a magic creature, knowing the secrets of immeasurable delight. He looked out through the leaves of the mulberry tree. Mr. Sayce had...", "...wholly feigned. \"It would be flying in the face of Providence to stand out of a campaign planned on such masterly lines.

Towards the lower end of the hill the private residences yielded pride of place to a little main street of more commercial aspect, which terminated in an unpretentious esplanade backed by a row of lodging-houses fronting the beach.

Eastward of the esplanade,...", "...foxes and crept near enough their burrow to see them huddled in the sand before it, waiting eagerly for their foraging mother and the breakfast she would bring. When the trail crossed a clear brook she paused upon the crude, low bridge and watched the trout dart to and fro beneath it; where it debouched upon a hill-side of commanding view she stopped there, breathing hard from sheer enjoyment of the glory of the prospect spread before her in the valley. She was very happy, as she <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> always was of summer mornings. The mountain air, circulating in her young and sturdy lungs, was almost as intoxicating as strong wine and made the blood leap through her arteries, thrill through her veins. The worries of the night before seemed, for a time, to have been groundless. She ceased to fear her meeting with the bluegrass gentlefolk and looked forward to it with real confidence and pleasure. Her confidence in Layson was abounding, and she assured herself till the...", "...I've always had the longing. And now I can go.

Theirs is an anxious, a responsible, and <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a sleepless duty. The pay for it, when I last heard, was two guineas a week, and--pleasant survival from an older mode of employment--the prudent hop-grower gives his dryers a pound at Christmas as a sort of retaining-fee. It is to be observed that failure of the crop is too frequent an occurrence. In years when there are no hops, the people feel the want of their extra money all the following winter.

His margins were <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> exhausted, and his resources as well. He had put up forty thousand dollars, and if wheat fell three cents more, it would be all swept away. Then he executed a second mortgage at high interest and waited. It was the last shot in his locker, and all that stood between him and ruin; but wheat advanced two cents and he began to hope. He had absolutely ignored business for two weeks that had been one long stretch of misery, and now he went to work again. To collect the little due him...", "...but I can't.

Fate had certainly favored him upon the one hand, if it had dashed his hopes upon the other. He was the same Ralston that had jumped into the same cab just around the corner some seven hours before, but in that short passage of time the current of his existence had gone swirling off in an entirely unexpected...", "...and then she's there, watching to get a look at him.'

However, when we got off the Dogger Bank we ran amongst a fleet of Hull trawlers; and I forsook the Swede for a British fishing-boat, which landed me at Hull, \"stone-broke,\" in more ways than one.

He recognized this lover, and had sided with him: was going to shut the pair up, in a country house, together. It was too much.

In England, the transition lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> through the sixteenth century. As the century went on, a most picturesque and telling style, the earlier phases of which are known as Tudor and the later as Elizabethan, sprang up in England.

Half a dozen strokes of the ax opened a hole large enough for him to pass through. With his rifle, and a piece of venison which hung near, he literally fell through the hole, where he lay choking, <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> fainting. After a time he crawled across the floor to a door. Outside was a dense laurel thicket, into which he crawled. The crackling and roaring of the fire grew louder.

He would miss his mother for a long time. But he would never miss her again as he had missed her yesterday and the day before. That afternoon Baree took a long nap close to his cache.

That of course, is <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> a definition of the word 'proletarian'. We no longer have a true proletariat. For that reason, we are no longer Marxist--although the name 'communist' has survived with its meaning changed.\" The conference ended after setting the time for another meeting. John Smith XVI felt that he had been groping in the dark, because of the information-vacuum that kept him from even making a reasonable guess as to Ivan's real aims. He kept feeling vaguely that Ivan was just playing along,...", "...rolls or biscuit can be used if thought necessary, and these can be used for refreshments later. If the children are tired of \"driving to church\" in an imaginary carriage, let them drive in an imaginary sleigh, with imaginary bells, amid winter scenes. MY LITTLE FRIENDS: I am sure that every boy and girl in this room knows what it is to be hungry. It is a part of our childhood experience to feel hungry <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> every day. While the body is growing there is almost a constant demand for nourishment and food.

This was too much. Beset and pressed on every hand by accusations, in which gross falsehoods were blended with such circumstances of truth as could not fail to procure them credit,--alone, unfriended, and in a strange land, Waverley <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> gave up his life and honour for lost, and, leaning his head upon his hand, resolutely refused to answer any further questions, since the fair and candid statement he had already made had only served to furnish arms against him. Without expressing either surprise or displeasure at the change in Waverley's manner, Major Melville proceeded composedly to put several other queries to him.

It seemed as if it would come away in his grasp. He dared not try to pull himself up by that. But he held on by it, panting, exhausting, faint.

And he even thrust his finger into the ragged hole just back of the fore leg of the dead animal, as though wondering how so small a bullet could ever make such a big opening.

This, then, I felt sure was the work of an owl. But which owl? There were two, maybe three kinds in that valley. I wished to know exactly and, looking for further evidence, I found on a sapling near by a big soft, downy, owlish feather (m) with three brown bars across it; which told me plainly that a Barred Owl or Hoot Owl had been there recently, and that he was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> certainly the killer of the Cottontail. This may sound like a story of Sherlock Holmes among the animals--a flimsy tale of circumstantial evidence. But while I was making my notes, what should come flying through the woods but the Owl himself, back to make another meal, no doubt.

She thought that there was very great objection to Lucy Robarts, regarding her as the possible future Lady Lufton. She could hardly have stated all her reasons, but they were very cogent. Lucy Robarts had, in her eyes, neither beauty, nor style, nor manner, nor even the education which was desirable. Lady Lufton was not herself a worldly woman. She was <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> as far removed from being so as a woman could be in her position. But, nevertheless, there were certain worldly attributes which she regarded as essential to the character of any young lady who might be considered fit to take the place which she herself had so long filled. It was her desire in looking for a wife for her son to combine these with certain moral excellences which she regarded as equally essential. Lucy Robarts might have the moral excellences, or she might not; but...", "...Willie--Bob had never before beheld so gentle, ingenuous and lovable a personality. Undoubtedly the little inventor had genius. What a pity he had been cheated of the opportunity for cultivating it! There was something pathetic in the way he reached out for the knowledge life had denied him; it reminded one of a patient child who asks for water to slake his thirst. If, for some inscrutable reason, fortune had granted him, Robert Morton, the chance denied this groping soul, was it not <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> an obligation that, in so far as he was able, he should place at the other's disposal the fruits of the education that had been his? Presumably this motor-boat idea would not amount to much, for if such an invention were plausible and of value, doubtless a score of nautical authorities would have seized upon it long before now. But to work at the plan would give the gentle dreamer in the silver-gray cottage happiness, and after all happiness was not to be despised.

This little concert so enraptured our musician, that, to use his own words, he forgot his mortality, \"et crut etre deja parmi les anges, jouissant des contentemens des bienheureux.\" It is no wonder that the charms and talents which exalted this prosaic Frenchman <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> into a poet, should turn the heads of poets themselves. The verses addressed to Leonora were collected into a volume, and published under the title of \"Applausi poetici alle glorie della Signora Leonora Baroni.\"--\"Poetical eulogies to the glory of Signora Leonora Baroni.\" A similar homage had been paid to her mother, Adriana, who reckoned Tasso among her panegyrists.

Now a government snag-boat may be defined as a boat maintained by the government for the sole purpose of sailing the river _and dodging snags_. This particular snag-boat, I learned afterward in the course of a long cruise behind her, holds the snag-boat record. I consider her pilot a truly remarkable man. He seemed to have dodged them all.

This message was reported by Don Diego, but it only made Francesco laugh. The next morning I saw Ascanio working at some trifles in wire at his master\u0092s side. As I was passing he bowed to me, and his master <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> laughed me in the face. He sent again to ask through Don Diego whether I would not give Ascanio back the clothes he had received from me; but if not, he did not mind, and Ascanio should not want for clothes. When I heard this, I turned to Don Diego and said: \u0093Don Diego, sir, in all your dealings you are the most liberal and worthy man I ever knew, but that Francesco is quite the opposite of you; he is nothing better than a worthless and dishonoured renegade.

Particularly old Butler. The years pass and he must be killed and put away, but not many readers of the book, I take it, will...", "...rough. The fruit is large, of a dark purple, very wholesome, and agreeable to the palate.

It is now rarely propagated by seeds, which seldom ripen in this country. No tree, perhaps, receives more benefit...", "...would sit up all night at his books.

He thanked me and curtly declined. The man, I may <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> say, is my pensioner. Well, he calls himself a Patterne, he is undoubtedly a man of courage, he has elements of our blood, and the name.

At the same time she addressed the baron, whom she had...", "...explanations of this are given. One is that the deer running in a straighter line than the fox, the fastest hound gets in front and stays there, others say that it is easier to get through the heather in a string, and again some hold that the scent of a deer being very sweet, hounds run one behind another to get it all. When they do carry a head, the sight of the big hounds, none under twenty-four-and-a-half inches and all unrounded, racing over the heather, is a very fine one. Deer <span class=\"clocktext\">almost</span> invariably die in the water, either in one of the numerous streams or rivers, or going to sea. In the last case they have to be followed by boatmen, and are brought to shore and killed. This is the greatest drawback to stag hunting, but it is no good being sentimental about it. The deer do an immense amount of damage to the farmer's crops, and if they were not killed in the chase they would very soon be shot, and stag hunting would be no more, so that my advice to those who cry..."]
