It is not contained as a whole in any of the above-mentioned works. I ought to say, however, that Mr. Hastie's translation is excellent in style; but after the first <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pages it also becomes an analysis. Nor is it wholly free from serious mistakes. I have hoped that the present volume may be of interest to many who, without being students of philosophy, are intelligent lovers of art. I have therefore done my best to _interpret_ philosophical expressions, instead of merely furnishing their technical equivalents. I have also added a few short notes, either to explain literary allusions, or to complete the interpretation of technical terms....", "...of little use. He would not give up his hobby. He went on rhyming, and in order to write down his verses he bought new pens and a new bottle of ink. Perhaps he felt the germs of poetic thought moving within him. His wife resented his conduct. Why could he not attend to the shaving and hair-dressing, which brought in money, instead of wasting his time in scribbling verses on his curl-papers? M. Charles Nodier, member of the French Academy, paid a visit to Agen in 1832. Jasmin was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old. He had been married fourteen years, but his name was quite unknown, save to the people of Agen. It was well known in the town that he had a talent for versification, for he was accustomed to recite and chaunt his verses to his customers. One quiet morning M. Nodier was taking a leisurely walk along the promenade of the Gravier, when he was attracted by a loud altercation going on between a man and a woman in the barber's shop. The woman was declaiming with the...", "...a wicked aspect. Its owner slashed his handkerchief at her to frighten her out of the way, but the Cat, undismayed, sprang at the hand, and held it with so ferocious a gripe, that it was impossible to make it open its jaws, and the creature's body had actually to be cut from the head, and the jaws afterwards to be severed, before the mangled hand could be extricated. The man died from the injuries.\" The jaws of a Cat are comparatively strong, and worked by powerful muscles; it has <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> teeth, but they are for the most part very tiny teeth, like pin's points. What, I wonder, were the dimensions of this ferocious animal with the iron jaws; and how many courageous souls were engaged in its destruction. If this story is, however, rather hard to swallow, the next is not less so. Says our authoress:-- \"I also know an Irish gentleman, who being an only son without any playmates, was allowed, when he was a child, to have a whole family of Cats sleeping in the...", "...its inner portal. It sometimes appeared that in addressing inferior courts he went too much into detail, instead of resting his case on its great points; but it is probable that Mr. Tazewell had taken the true gauge of the judge's mind, and was right after all; and it is certain that in important cases, in which appeals would probably be taken, he reserved his strong points for the higher tribunal. Those who heard even his latest speeches at the bar have almost all passed away. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years ago that I heard him for the first time in public. At a meeting of the citizens of Norfolk, held in the Town Hall, to give expression to their feelings on the occasion of the death of Jefferson, which occurred on the Fourth of July, 1826, he was called to the chair, and, before taking it, addressed the large assembly for twenty-five or thirty minutes, on the character of the great man whose death they had met to commemorate. He was at that time a senator of the United...", "...from their sickness, and were as well and strong again as ever. And, incidentally, the python which George had slain at the Blue Basin had been most scientifically skinned and the skin cured, stuffed with dry grass, stitched up, and the head joined to it again by an Indian whose services the young captain had contrived to secure; and when the _Nonsuch_ sailed out of the Gulf of Paria on the eventful Saturday which saw the actual beginning of her great adventure, the skin--measuring <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet eight and a half inches from snout to tail--gracefully, if somewhat gruesomely, adorned the forward bulkhead of her state cabin. CHAPTER FIVE. HOW THEY CAPTURED THE \"SANTA MARIA\" AT MARGARITA. By the advice of Dyer, the pilot, George kept the mainland aboard upon issuing from the Gulf of Paria; for the island of Margarita was at no great distance to the westward. And not only was Margarita the spot where the Spaniards had established a vastly profitable...", "...the work go on, a part of this vast sea will yet be converted into a continent; and, who knows but a railroad may yet run across that portion of our globe, connecting America with the old world? I see that Captain Beechy, in his voyage, speaks of a wreck that occurred in 1792, on a _reef_, where, in 1826, he found an island near three leagues long, bearing tall trees. It would be a curious calculation to ascertain, if one family of insects can make an island three leagues long, in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, how many families it would take to make the grading of the railroad I have mentioned. Ten years since, I would not have ventured a hint of this nature, for it might have set speculation in motion, and been the instrument of robbing more widows and orphans of their straitened means; but, Heaven be praised! we have at length reached a period in the history of the country, when a man may venture on a speculation in the theory of geography without incurring the risk of...", "...to his credit; Eddie Rickenbacker the American ace is responsible for twenty-four enemy victims, and Edward Parsons, another American flyer is credited with eight official victories and seven more unconfirmed.

QUENTIN ROOSEVELT LOSES HIS LIFE On Sunday July 14th, 1918, a violent encounter took place between German battleplanes and American Air forces trying to break through the German defense over the Marne. In this engagement Lieut, Quentin Roosevelt was brought down and killed near Chambry, then...", "...The cool retreats, the jutting promontories, the moss-covered rocks against which the waves softly break,--if these had tongues, they would, like Tennyson's Brook, \"go on forever,\" for surely they would never have done telling the tender tales they have heard. Nor would it be possible to find a more fitting spot for the cultivation of love and sentiment than this charming lake affords; for Nature seems to have created Lake George in one of her happiest moments. This lake is about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles long, and varies in width from one to four miles. Its greatest depth is about the same as that of Champlain. It possesses (like all the American lakes when used as fashionable watering-places) the usual three hundred and sixty-five islands. When I left the Mayeta I followed a narrow footpath to a rough mountain road, which in turn led me through the forests towards Lake George. In an isolated dell I found the home of one Levi Smith, who piloted me through the woods...", "...bringing Meyerbeer to Paris; that the two composers were always excellent friends; and that one of Rossini's last productions, probably the very last composition he ever put to paper, was a pianoforte fantasia it pleased him to write on motives from \"L'Africaine,\" after attending the last rehearsal of that work. As to the laziness with which Rossini is so often charged, it is curious to remark that this habit of mind or body, or both, was somehow compatible with the production of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> operas which Rossini wrote between the years 1810 and 1823. After he had settled in Paris, from 1824 to 1829, he still worked with prodigious activity, and did not produce less than one opera every year,--\"Il Viaggio a Reims\" in 1825, \"Le Siege de Corinthe\" in 1826, \"Moise\" in 1827, \"Le Comte Ory\" in 1828, and \"Guillaume Tell\" in 1829.

The two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> students, after reciting their prayers, went out as ignorant as when they went in, but breathing more freely, as if a great weight had been lifted from them.

He only died in 1654, having devoted himself to these good works for nearly half a century. The church by which he endeavoured to bring under observation and imitation the distinguishing qualities of St. Charles, was erected on a spot famous in the Middle Ages as a bandit's den; the building occupied <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, and was consecrated but a short time before his death. Baron Karl von Fieger, from whom he bought the site, a few years later added to it the Servite monastery, which, though it exhibits all the vices of the architecture of its date, yet bears tokens that its imperfections are not due to any stint of means. Its three cupolas and other structural arrangements are designed in commemoration of the Holy Trinity--a mystery which is held in very special honour throughout...", "...very few minutes after the explosion.

The outside bottom plating is bent into a reversed V-shape, the after-wing of which, about fifteen feet broad and thirty-two feet in length (from frame 17 to frame 25), is doubled back upon itself against the continuation of the same plating extending forward. At frame 18 the vertical keel is broken in two and the flat keel bent into an angle similar to the angle formed by...", "...check in her white, thin hand. \"Very well,\" said the old lady. \"Since you wish it, I'll give the hundred dollars to the Red Cross; and very glad I am to do it, Mr. Bobbsey.

That was their own spending money, I presume.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Bobbsey, \"it was. And I don't mind if you give that back.\" So Nan and Bert did not really lose anything, and soon the disappointed feeling about not getting the reward wore off. They were glad it was to go to the Red Cross. And the next morning, when they awakened to find the ground a foot deep in snow, their joy knew no bounds. They forgot all about rewards, china...", "...allow, by the winds then blowing between north and east.

Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary in the 15th century, had a library of nearly 50,000 volumes. Duke Frederick of Urbino in Italy had one nearly as large. Duke Frederick had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> copyists regularly employed in his library. It is interesting to note that this library contained perfect copies of practically every book known to be in existence at that time. This fact throws an interesting light on the extent of the world's literature so recently as 500 years ago. Among the earliest of the libraries formed outside of monasteries were those collected by the Arabs of North Africa and Spain. Although some of the early Mohammedan conquerors were ignorant...", "...refuge.

On the 19th of June the Austrian archduke paid for a fleeting glory with his life. Thus failed the second attempt at erecting an empire in Mexico. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years diplomatic relations between that country and Austria-Hungary were severed. The clerical-military combination had been overthrown, and the Mexican people had rearmed their independence. As Juarez declared: \"Peace means respect for the rights of others.\" Even if foreign dreams of empire in Mexico had vanished so abruptly, it could hardly be expected that a land torn for many years by convulsions could become suddenly tranquil. With Diaz and other aspirants to...", "...some hold on Issoudun--said to Max, as the wine was beginning to unloose all tongues,-- \"You are threatened in your stronghold.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" asked Max. \"Why, my grandmother has had a letter from Madame Bridau, who is her goddaughter, saying that she and her son are coming here. My grandmother has been getting two rooms ready for them.\" \"What's that to me?\" said Max, taking up his glass and swallowing the contents at a gulp with a comic gesture. Max was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old. A candle standing near him threw a gleam upon his soldierly face, lit up his brow, and brought out admirably his clear skin, his ardent eyes, his black and slightly curling hair, which had the brilliancy of jet. The hair grew vigorously upward from the forehead and temples, sharply defining those five black tongues which our ancestors used to call the \"five points.\" Notwithstanding this abrupt contrast of black and white, Max's face was very sweet, owing its...", "...and a pear-tree for a girl, and the people think that the child will flourish or dwindle with the tree.(874) In Mecklenburg the after-birth is thrown out at the foot of a young tree, and the child is then believed to grow with the tree.(875) In England persons are sometimes passed through a cleft tree as a cure for rupture, and thenceforward a sympathetic connection is believed to exist between them and the tree. \"Thomas Chillingworth, son of the owner of an adjoining farm, now about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age, was, when an infant of a year old, passed through a similar tree, now perfectly sound, which he preserves with so much care that he will not suffer a single branch to be touched, for it is believed that the life of the patient depends on the life of the tree; and the moment that it is cut down, be the patient ever so distant, the rupture returns, and a mortification ensues.\"(876) When Lord Byron first visited his ancestral estate of Newstead \"he planted, it...", "...of the error in the date was suggested by Mr. Munro in the Journal of Philology. He supposes that Jerome in copying the words of Suetonius referring to the death and funeral of Lucilius substituted the 'anno aetatis xlvi. for lxiv. or lxvi., and then adapted the year of birth to the annus Abrahae which would correspond to this false reading.' Mr. Munro adds, 'Everything would now run smooth. Lucilius when he went with Scipio to Spain would be in the prime of manhood, thirty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age. Soon after that time he would be writing and publishing his earliest Books, xxvi.-xxix., and then xxx. Some of these at all events would be published before the death of Scipio, when the poet would be thirty-seven or thirty-nine[8].' It may be added against the supposition that Lucilius was born in the year 180 B.C., that, in that case, we should have expected to have found in his numerous fragments allusions to events even earlier than the Censorship of P....", "...powder which had been taken out of the magazines.

It was a peripteral octostyle, of the Doric order, with seventeen columns on the sides, each six feet two inches in diameter at the base, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet in height, elevated on three steps. Its height, from the base of the pediments, was sixty-five feet, and the dimensions of the area two hundred and thirty-three feet, by one hundred and two. The eastern pediment was adorned with two groups of statues, one of which represented the birth of Minerva, the other the contest of Minerva with Neptune for the government of Athens. On the metopes was sculptured the battle of the Centaurs with the Lapithae; and the frieze...", "...and obey God in all things, all would be well.

Since my first healing, I have had a few attacks of sickness but God has healed me every time.

In 1870, however, a School Board had been created in addition, and this body carried out much good work during its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of existence.

I said farewell to Kroonstad at ten o'clock that night, and was carried to Rhenosterriviersbrug, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles from Kroonstad, by the last train that left the town. But before I departed, I took care that the bridge over the Valsch River should be destroyed by dynamite. In the meantime, those portions of the Heilbron and Kroonstad commandos which had gone into Natal at the beginning of the war, received orders to leave the Drakensberg.

A year later he was made chief justice of the Supreme Court--an appointment little less than inspired in its wisdom. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, John Marshall occupied that exalted position, interpreting to the new country its organic law, and the decisions handed down by him remain the standard authority on constitutional questions.

His service to his country was of incalculable value, for he built for the national government a firm, foundation which has stood unshaken through the years. * *...", "...ideas are not clear. This was inevitable, owing to the tendency to identify various divinities. Especially noticeable is the identification of new or local gods with others better accredited, Rudra and Agni, etc. Rudra is the god of cattle, and when the other gods went to heaven by means of sacrifice he remained on earth; his local names are Carva, Bhava, 'Beast-lord,' Rudra, Agni (_Cat. Br_. i. 7. 3. 8; M[=a]it. S. i. 6. 6). Indra is the Vasu of the gods. The gods are occasionally <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> in number, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve [=A]dityas, heaven and earth, and Praj[=a]pati as the thirty-fourth; but this Praj[=a]pati is the All and Everything (_Cat. Br_. i. 6. 4. 2; iv. 5. 7. 2 ff.). Of these gods, who at first were all alike and good, three became superior, Agni, Indra, and S[=u]rya.

Moreover, the Sun is now Indra; the Manes are the seasons, and Varuna, too, is the seasons, as being the...", "...only 67,000,000 for the next census, that of 1890.\" \"True,\" returned the Secretary. \"That was above the exact figure; if I remember correctly, it was only 64,987,504. But even that population was a trifle more than twenty-five per cent. increase upon the census of 1880. The ratio of increase since we were a nation of only 3,000,000, averaged about thirty per cent. until the year 1900. In 1910 it fell to twenty-two per cent., but the next census, that of 1920, showed an increase of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> per cent. The reason for this great increase is found in the fact that in 1915 the United States acquired Mexico and all Central America, with its population of over 20,000,000 souls, and in 1917, after the conquest, the whole of British America, with 10,000,000 more. Our population was, by the census of 1920--counting in 30,000,000 people acquired--137,000,000. The increase since 1890 has averaged only 18.5 per cent, every ten years, or less than two per cent. a year.\"...", "...suggested to him the possibility of giving effect to the atmospheric pressure by creating a vacuum in this manner. He thought that if, instead of exhausting the barrel of a pump by the usual laborious method of a piston and sucker, it was exhausted by first filling it with steam, and then condensing the same steam, the atmospheric pressure would force the water from the well into the pump-barrel, and into any vessel connected with it, provided that vessel were not more than about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet above the elevation of the water in the well. He perceived also, that, having lifted the water to this height, he might use the elastic force of steam in the manner described by the Marquis of Worcester to raise the same water to a still greater elevation, and that the same steam which accomplished this mechanical effect would serve, by its subsequent condensation, to reproduce the vacuum, and draw up more water. It was on this principle that Savery constructed the...", "...old man, at the sight of the Southern Cross, warns them that it is time to separate.

The treatment consisted of the application of belladonna and cantharides plasters, bismuth, and lime-water, camphor, and salts of white hellebore inhaled through the nose in finest powder. Two other cases are mentioned by the same author. Gapper describes the case of a young man who was seized with loud and distressing hiccough that never ceased for a minute during eighty hours. Two...", "...were snapped up in the neighbourhood of the capital. Lord Roberts gave orders accordingly that Hutton and Mahon should sweep the Boers back upon his right, and push them as far as Bronkhorst Spruit. This was done on July 6th and 7th, the British advance meeting with considerable resistance from artillery as well as rifles. By this movement the pressure upon the right was relieved, which might have created a dangerous unrest in Johannesburg, and it was done at the moderate cost of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> killed and wounded, half of whom belonged to the Imperial Light Horse. This famous corps, which had come across with Mahon from the relief of Mafeking, had, a few days before, ridden with mixed feelings through the streets of Johannesburg and past, in many instances, the deserted houses which had once been their homes. Many weary months were to pass before the survivors might occupy them. On July 9th the Boers again attacked, but were again pushed back to the eastward....", "...but was finally, about 1829, beaten by Edward D. White. At the succeeding session of the Legislature, however, he was elected a senator to Congress in the place of Henry Johnson. From the Senate he was sent as Minister to France, and was afterward Secretary of State during the administration of General Jackson. It was in his case that Jackson exercised the extraordinary power of directing the Treasurer of the United States to receipt Mr. Livingston for the sum of his defalcation <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years before. At the time this was done, Tobias Watkins was in prison in Washington for a defalcation of only a few hundreds to the Government. These two events gave rise to the ludicrous caricature, which caused much amusement at the time, of General Jackson's walking with his arm in Livingston's by the jail, when Watkins, looking from the window, points to Livingston, saying to the General: \"You should turn me out, or put him in.\" Immediately upon this receipt being...", "...have paid what I could by selling all my furniture.\" Charlevoix's account of the siege has been followed by most writers, both French and English; but it is extremely incorrect. It was answered by one De Gannes, apparently an officer under Subercase, in a paper called _Observations sur les Erreurs de la Relation du Siege du Port Royal ... faittes sur de faux memoires par le reverend Pere Charlevoix_, whom De Gannes often contradicts flatly. Thus Charlevoix puts the besieging force at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred men, besides officers and sailors, while De Gannes puts it at fourteen hundred; and while Charlevoix says that the garrison were famishing, his critic says that they were provisioned for three months.

Land and Indians were granted him, and he acquired some wealth from agriculture and mining, maintaining good relations with the Governor, Velasquez.

Some data of this type are already available. On May 19-20, at Urbana, Illinois, while stationed twenty feet apart making parallax studies with two telescopes to determine the height above the earth of the migratory birds, Carpenter and Stebbins (_loci cit._) saw seventy-eight birds in two and one-half hours. Eleven were seen by both observers, thirty-three by Stebbins only, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> by Carpenter only. On October 10, 1905, at the same place, in two hours, fifty-seven birds were counted, eleven being visible through both telescopes. Of the remainder, Stebbins saw seventeen and Carpenter, twenty-nine. On September 12, 1945, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in an interval of one hour and forty minutes, two independent observers each counted six birds.

One night soon after the birthday festival the little girl said off the verses, \"almost for the first time without any stumbling, in her sleep.\" From this we see how much more quickly in regard to articulation and independent use of words both these girls (the first of whom weighed only six pounds at birth) learned to speak than did Sigismund's boy, my own boy, and others.

Perhaps such an apology is more necessary now than it was then; but the warm reception given to the book on all sides--by literary critics, as well as by ethnologists and students of folk-lore, in this country and in Europe--has led the author to believe that a volume embodying everything, or nearly everything, of importance in the oral literature...", "...from among the leaders of their own party, and therefore that the _Accoppiatori_, or persons selected for the imborsation of the new Squittini, with the Signory who had to retire from office, should make the new appointments.

Thus, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pairs of oars and five hundred and seventy-four rowers. Between the half rooms, and also along the bulwarks, there were wide gangways, running fore and aft. There was a large forecastle in which the warriors slept and took their meals, and abaft the main mast there was another cabin called the \"fore-room\", in which King Olaf had his high seat, or throne. Here he held his councils. Here, too, he had his armour chests. Thirty men lived in the fore-room. King Olaf's own...", "...it is impossible that they should receive adequate discussion.' Mr. Gladstone was absent through illness and Lord Hartington undertook to reply to these reproaches. He read out to the House some figures, which had been prepared, of the activities of the Fourth Party during the four months since the dissolution. From this it appeared that Mr. Gorst had spoken one hundred and five times, and had asked eighteen questions; that Sir Henry Wolff had made sixty-eight speeches and had asked <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> questions; and that Lord Randolph Churchill had made seventy-four speeches and had asked twenty-one questions. This statement caused much amusement; and after Sir Stafford Northcote had defended the Conservatives at length from the general charge of obstruction which had been urged on behalf of the Government, Lord Randolph rose to vindicate the honour of the Fourth Party. He had prepared himself for this not unexpected duty by a careful study of an article written by Mr....", "...charged with the government of Macedonia. Talaat Bey, the Minister of the Interior, had previously held an inferior position. He was one of the leading representatives of the Young Turk Party and was believed to be the one mainly responsible for the terrible slaughter and martyrdom of Armenians during the World War. After that war he fled to Berlin, where, in 1920, he was assassinated by a young Armenian. Djavid Bey, Minister of Finance, was a remarkably brilliant young man, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old, from Salonica. It was said he was a Donmeh; that is, a member of a sect of apostate Jews also known as Sabbatians from the name of its Messiah or prophet, Sabbatai Zevi, who gave the sect its romantic origin in the middle of the seventeenth century.

In a word, the standing or falling of his power appeared to have been committed to the keeping of the army.

THE STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE ARMY George Brinton McClellan, when at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> he was raised suddenly to a dizzying height of fame and power, was generally looked upon as a prodigy. Though he was not that, he had a real claim to distinction. Had destiny been considerate, permitting him to rise gradually and to mature as he rose, he might have earned a stable reputation high among those who are not quite great. He had done well at West Point, and as a very young officer in the Mexican War; he had represented his country as a military observer with the...", "...drove into the neighboring country, and made a single excursion,--to Tewkesbury. There are few places better worth seeing than this fine old town, full of historical associations and monumental relics. The magnificent old abbey church is the central object of interest.

The arch of the west entrance is sixteen feet high and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet wide. The fourteen columns of the nave are each six feet and three inches in diameter and thirty feet in height. I did not take these measurements from the fabric itself, but from the guidebook, and I give them here instead of saying that the columns were huge, enormous, colossal, as they did most assuredly seem to me. The old houses of Tewkesbury compare well with the finest of those in Chester.

Meanwhile the volunteers assembled in the square, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> in all; men of half a dozen nationalities. One giant Russian loomed above them, a Goliath on a great roan horse. And near him, to accentuate the contrast, an elderly moustached, imperialed Frenchman on a mare as under-sized and spirited as himself.

It was a year since she had seen any, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years past she had only seen them in company with the Squire or with her daughters, none of whom cared much for shops.

Anciently, the Malays used a writing of their own, but it is not yet clearly settled what it was. There are now <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> characters employed, each varying in form, according as it is isolated, final, medial, or initial. Naturally, the Arabic influence over the language has been a marked one; the priest who dictates in the religion of a people is a molder and shaper of language. We have only to recall the Catholic Church and the influence of the Latin tongue in the mouths of her priests to know that this is so. Many Arabic words and phrases have been adopted, but more in the language of...", "...at that time slavery was prohibited in Georgia, and any negroes who ran away from Carolina were at once returned to their masters.

It is not so old as some, but is in itself a memorial of some vandalism, as it occupies the site of the old Market Cross, a thing of rare beauty, beautifully carved and erected in Mary's reign, but ruthlessly destroyed by Waller and his troopers during the Civil War period. Upon the ground on which it stood <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years later--in 1677--the Abingdon folk reared their fine town hall; its style resembles that of Inigo Jones, and it has an open undercroft--a kindly shelter from the weather for market women.

Of the many fair scenes of Yedo, none is better worth visiting than the temple of Zojoji, one of the two great burial-places of the Shoguns; indeed, if you wish to see the most beautiful spots of any Oriental city, ask for the cemeteries: the homes of the dead are ever the loveliest places.

All timber-line trees are undersized. Most of their ranks are less than eight feet high. One autumn a grizzly that I was following dug up a number of dwarfed trees at timber-line. I carried these home for careful examination. One of them was a black birch with a trunk nine tenths of an inch in diameter, a height of fifteen inches, and a limb-spread of twenty-two inches. It had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> annual rings. Another was truly a veteran pine, though his trunk was but six tenths of an inch in diameter, his height twenty-three inches, and his limb-spread thirty-one inches. His age was sixty-seven years.

The combined fleets, forty-nine ships of the line, lay at Algeciras, and ten floating batteries were constructed which, it was believed, could neither be sunk nor burned. The garrison consisted of 7,000 men fit for duty. Lord Howe, who on the change of ministry was appointed to command the channel fleet, sailed to its relief on the 11th with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> ships of the line and many store-ships and transports. On the 8th, when the enemy's works were not completed, Eliott opened fire upon them and did them much damage by using red-hot balls. During the next four days the enemy replied by a terrific bombardment from their heavy ordnance and gunboats.

Doubtless something of their fragmentariness is due to the abbreviation of the prophetic annals by the historians.

The city reminds one strongly of some of the rural towns in New England. The houses are unpretentious, wooden, either white or of light colors, and uniformly surrounded by pleasant grounds, in which trees, shrubs, and flowers grow freely, without any attempt at formal or decorative culture.

He was perpetually haunted by the fear that his poetry was not original, and the only word of satisfaction which Spedding ever heard him use of any of his sonnets was with regard to one which owed its origin to a period of deep affliction, of which the poet said that he thought it was good because he _knew_ it to be true. Whatever the cause, however, during these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years Charles Turner published nothing and, indeed, hardly even wrote anything. Spedding, in his Introduction, has collected a few fragments which were gathered from the poet's notebooks, and show that his mind still occasionally noted a stray simile or description, doubtless intended to be subsequently worked up into a poem. A few of these are in his happiest manner.

The yield of this commodity in 1909 amounted roughly to one hundred and seventy thousand tons, while that of wheat fell just below two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> thousand tons. Generally speaking, it may be said that the districts where wheat is grown are suitable for the cultivation of maize, and thus in Uruguay the two are wont to flourish to a large extent side by side.

In 1850, '60 and '70 the periodicals of the Union numbered, respectively, 2526, 4051 and 5871, with an average circulation, at the three periods, of twenty-one hundred, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred and thirty-six hundred copies each. The circulation thus outgrew the numbers in the proportion of nearly two to one. And both are largely in excess of the increase of the population, that being in the twenty years but 65 percent. The number of daily papers (254 in 1850 and 574 in 1870) must now be equal to the entire number of periodicals in France outside of Paris (796 in 1875), with an average issue less than half that of ours. The proportion of readers to the...", "...and bushy variety of Tagetes signata growing in the midst of the common varieties by which it was probably crossed; for most of the seedlings raised from this plant were intermediate in character, only two perfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved from these two plants reproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly any selection has since been necessary. Flowers transmit their colour truly, or most capriciously. Many annuals come true: thus I purchased German seeds of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> named sub-varieties of one RACE of ten-week stocks (Matthiola annua), and raised a hundred and forty plants, all of which, with the exception of a single plant, came true. In saying this, however, it must be understood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the thirty-four named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower always correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that they came true, because in each of the thirty- six short rows every...", "...audience in the South of England.

I will let you into the secret. There was fifty-two pounds in the house, and my share was two-thirds of the gross receipts, that is about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pounds. My relative heard the sum. As we drove along in his dog-cart he nudged me and said: \"Did you make thirty-four pounds this afternoon?\" \"Oh, did you hear?\" I said. \"Yes, that was my part of the takings. For a small town I am quite satisfied.\" \"I should think you were!\" he replied. \"If you had made thirty-four shillings you would have been well paid for your work!\" Nothing is more true to life than the want of appreciation the successful man encounters from...", "...triumph decreed him by an unanimous vote of the senate.

A dragon-ship, to begin with, because all the long-ships had a dragon for a figure-head, except the smallest of them, which were called cutters, and only carried ten or twenty rowers on a side. The \"Long Serpent\" had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> rowers' benches on a side, and she was one hundred and eleven feet long. Over the sides were hung the shining red and white shields of the vikings, the gilded dragon's head towered high at the prow, and at the stern a gilded tail went curling off over the head of the steersman.

Poland is in general a very level country, (if we except the Carpathian mountains,) fertile in corn, having long furnished Sweden and Holland; its horses are some of the finest in Europe, and its salt-works are very productive; the towns collectively are built of wood; the appearance of the villages very mean.

Several unsigned cuts in _Der beschlossen gart des rosenkrantz Marie_ (Pinder, 1505), and thirty out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> large cuts in a _Speculum Passionis_ (Pinder, 1507), are ascribed to Schaufelein, his associate in each book being Hans Baldung. About 1510 Schaufelein removed to Augsburg, and, despite his return to his paternal home at Nordlingen where he took up his citizenship in 1515, he worked for the chief Augsburg publishers for the rest of his life, though between 1523 and 1531 nothing is known as to what he was doing.

In modern times the geography of Palestine was chiefly known through the works of Dr. Robinson, Burckhart, and Vande Velde; but in 1864 a society sprang up in England for the purpose of a more systematic exploration. Successive expeditions were sent there for that purpose. In 1868 the Moabite Stone was discovered by the Rev. F. Klein.

He was looking to the latest date of the claims when he said thirty-four years, which surely was enough; but Washington's decision in his proclamation of neutrality was seven years before that time; and the claims themselves have the year 1800 for their period of limitation--not of commencement, which was many years before. This doctrine of governmental liability when abandoning the claims of citizens...", "...Uncle Larry; \"because my state-room was the most for'ard in the boat, and the donkey-engine that let down the anchor was right over my head.\" \"So you got up and saw the sunrise over the bay,\" said Dear Jones, \"with the electric lights of the city twinkling in the distance, and the first faint flush of the dawn in the east just over Fort Lafayette, and the rosy tinge which spread softly upward, and----\" \"Did you both come back together?\" asked the Duchess. \"Because he has crossed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> times you must not suppose that he has a monopoly in sunrises,\" retorted Dear Jones. \"No, this was my own sunrise; and a mighty pretty one it was, too.\" \"I'm not matching sunrises with you,\" remarked Uncle Larry, calmly; \"but I'm willing to back a merry jest called forth by my sunrise against any two merry jests called forth by yours.\" \"I confess reluctantly that my sunrise evoked no merry jest at all.\" Dear Jones was an honest man, and would scorn to invent a merry...", "...forth \"the moral\" of the work, \"Punch,\"--suggestive of that \"graver puppetry,\" the \"visual and oral cheats,\" \"by which mankind are cajoled.\" Punch, the exemplar of boldness and philosophic self-control, is the quaint embodiment of the intention to pursue a higher object than the amusement of thoughtless crowds,--an intention which has been adhered to with remarkable fidelity.

It was not, however, built in a day. It knew a rickety infancy and hours of peril, and owes its rescue from neglect and starvation, its subsequent and constantly increasing prosperity, to the enterprising publishers,--Bradbury and Evans,--who nursed and resuscitated it at the critical moment.

Sir Fletcher and his friends replied, that his health was now re-established, and that Lord George Germaine's condolence was a mockery of the house; and Dunning moved that he should be continued speaker. The house was divided on his re-election, but opposition were left in a minority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> to two hundred and three: Mr. Cornwall was therefore elected speaker. His majesty delivered his opening speech on the following day.

They made it sing that same tune thirty-three times, and still they had not had enough. They would have made it sing the tune <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> times, but the Emperor said, \"I should like to hear the real Nightingale sing, now.\" But when they looked about for the real little Nightingale, they could not find her anywhere! She had taken the chance, while everybody was listening to the waltz tunes, to fly away through the window to her own greenwood. \"What a very ungrateful bird!\" said the lords and ladies. \"But it does not matter; the new nightingale is just as good.\" So the artificial nightingale was given...", "...shore.

For three hours this lasted, ten white men being killed as well as a poor little child, while <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> of the natives were shot dead. The Maoris were preparing to retreat when, by some accident, the whole of the powder that the white men possessed was exploded. Then they had to save themselves.

Owing to the lack of school opportunities for the Negro in the rural districts of the South, there is danger that ignorance and idleness may increase to the extent of giving the Negro race a reputation for crime, and that immorality may eat its way into the fibre of the race so as to retard its progress for many years. In judging the Negro we must not be too harsh. We must remember that it has been only within the last <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years that the black father and mother have had the responsibility, and consequently the experience, of training their own children. That perfection has not been reached in one generation, with the obstacles that the parents have been compelled to overcome, is not to be wondered at. Sixth. Finally, I would mention my fear that some of the white people of the South may be led to feel that the way to settle the race problem is to repress the aspirations of the Negro by...", "...sky, tender as a faded eighteenth-century silk, only the blue was a young blue like that of a newly opened flower; and it seemed to me that I could detect in the clouds going by, great designs for groups and single figures, and I compared this aerial sculpture with the sculpture on the roofs.

Ancient Rome had sixty thousand statues--a statue for every thirty-three or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> inhabitants; in Paris the proportion of statues to the people is not so great, still there are a great many; no city has had so many since antiquity; and that is why Paris always reminds me of those great days of Greece and Rome when this world was the only world.

The consequence was, that a tremendous torrent of water rushed down the sides of the mountain, carrying with it vast quantities of sand, volcanic cinders and blocks of lava, with which it overspread the flanks of the mountain and the plains beneath, which it devastated in its course. The volume of water was estimated at 16,000,000 cubic feet, it forming a channel two miles broad and in some places <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet deep, and flowing at the rate of two-thirds of a mile in a minute. All the winter's snow on the mountain could not have yielded such a flood, and Lyell considered that it melted older layers of ice which had been preserved under a covering of volcanic dust.

Near the point whence the highest stream of lava issued in 1811, there were opened three large mouths, which, with...", "...the following March.

There was only matter enough in it for poetry, Mr. Massey concludes after having upset the whole order of the Sonnets to prove its reality. Now, as to the story of Lady Rich's having been the mistress of Herbert, for whom Mr. Massey says that twenty-four of the Sonnets were written. William Herbert, afterward earl of Pembroke, was born in 1580. He came up to London in 1598, being then eighteen years of age, and made the acquaintance of Shakespeare, who was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old. Lady Rich, at that time, according to Mr. Massey's own statement, was \"getting on for forty.\" The fact is that she was just thirty-five, having been born, as he tells us, in 1563. According to the obvious meaning of the Sonnets, the lady spoken of is much younger than Shakespeare, instead of a year older, and, according to Mr. Massey, Lady Rich was at that time (1597) in the midst of her love-affair with Mountjoy. The lady of the Sonnets, if we take them...", "...offered by Rev.

Another, offered by Mr. Sunderland--\"that, while rejecting all creeds and creed limitations, the Conference hereby expresses its purpose as a body to be the promotion of a religion of love to God and love to man\"--was also rejected. That presented by William C. Gannett was carried by a majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> to ten, and declared that the Western Unitarian Conference conditions its fellowship on no dogmatic tests, but welcomes all who wish to join it to establish truth, righteousness, and love in the world.

In these provinces the Spanish administration was still vested solely in the alcalde mayor, who until after 1886 was both governor or executive officer and the judge or court for the trial of provincial cases and crimes.

This period, with the spiritual crisis which it involves, is likely to occur between the thirtieth and the fortieth meridian. Ibsen was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old (1862) when in \"The Comedy of Love\" he broke with the romanticism of his youth, and began to wrestle with the problems of contemporary life. Goethe was thirty-seven when, in 1786, he turned his back upon the Storm and Stress, and in Italy sought and gained a new and saner vision of the world. This renewal of the sources which water the roots of his spiritual being becomes an imperative necessity to a man when he has exhausted the sources which tradition supplies....", "...of the island, this fortress on the point midway between the two harbors was a place round which the tide of battle often swirled, when Paynim and Christian fought for the mastery of the island.

She had, moreover, acquired the character of being a flirt; and I fear that the stories which were told of her, though doubtless more than half false, had in them sufficient of truth to justify the character. Now this was very sad, seeing that Arabella Vavasor had no fortune, and that she had offended her father and brothers by declining to comply with their advice at certain periods of her career. There was, indeed, considerable trouble in the...", "...which had occupied Lieutenant Stairs twenty-five days, at the average of six and one-third miles per day, but he had reached Ipoto within seven days, and Jephson and Uledi had accomplished the distance in the same time, that is, at an average rate of travel of a little over eleven miles per day. Now, as Ugarrowwa was 104 miles beyond Ipoto, or 183 miles from Fort Bodo, it was estimated that the journey of 366 miles which Stairs was now about to undertake might be performed within <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> days, or at the rate of ten and three quarter miles per day. This would be magnificent travelling, especially in the forest, but as various circumstances might protract the period, it was agreed that if we moved towards the Nyanza on the 25th March, and as the carriage of the boat would necessitate short stages, we should travel slowly, that he might have the opportunity of overtaking us. On the morning of the 16th February, at muster, it was proclaimed that twenty...", "...of small size, but great thickness, like our heart, it is in reality a long tube, called the _dorsal-vessel_, running along the abdomen and thorax of the insect, into which the blood is poured by the veins, and out of which it is forced on towards the head by the regular contractions of its side. This causes the beating movement which we saw in the caterpillar. Perhaps there may be some curiosity to know whether an _insect's pulse_ beats faster or slower than ours. John Hunter counted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> beats in a minute in a silk-worm. Another observer counted thirty a minute in a caterpillar of the pine-moth. But in the imago state the pulse appears to move much quicker: and it is easy to make an insect's beat extremely fast, by exciting or provoking it. Mr. Newport having done so to a bee, counted as many as 142 beats a minute. In a middle-aged man the pulse beats about seventy times in a minute; in a child seven years old about eighty-five times; and at the age of...", "...all the bodies of the bishops of Canterbury are buried.

This was what those on board the Sylph had expected, and the little scout cruiser, making a slight detour, to avoid, as far as possible, shells from the three German cruisers, started in pursuit, full speed ahead. The German vessels, however, had considerable of a start, and it was plain that the Sylph would not overhaul them for hours. In the meantime the battle was raging fiercely. From the first the British concentrated their fire on the German flagship. The huge <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> centimeter guns of the British fleet, as against the twenty-one centimeter guns of the enemy, made the outcome of the engagement certain from the first. All that remained was to see how well the Germans could fight, and what damage they could inflict on Admiral Sturdee's fleet before being sent to the bottom. A huge shell from the British flagship dropped squarely aboard the Scharnhorst and exploded with a deafening detonation. Metal and bodies flew high in the air,...", "...1580 Lord Lumley lost his father-in-law, who by a deed, dated March 14th, 1566, had conveyed a great part of his estates to Lord Lumley and Jane his eldest daughter, Lord Lumley's wife; and after her decease, Lord Arundel confirmed the same to Lord Lumley by his will, which he made a few months before his death. Among the estates bequeathed were the palace and park of Nonsuch, which in 1590 Lord Lumley conveyed to the Queen in exchange for lands of the yearly value of five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pounds. Lord Lumley died on the 11th of April 1609 at his residence on Tower Hill, in the parish of St. Olave, Hart Street, and was buried in Cheam church, in the county of Surrey, where a monument was erected to his memory in the Lumley aisle, which he had built.

Objections to the authenticity of Colossians have been {171} steadily growing fainter. It was denied by Mayerhoff in 1838, and by the whole Tuebingen school, in spite of very strong external evidence.

(2) There are a large number of words which St. Paul uses nowhere else, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> being found in no other part of the New Testament; but several of these words are called forth by the special error which St. Paul rebukes, and the Epistle does contain eleven Pauline words used by no other New Testament writer.

This objection rests entirely on the hypothesis that Jesus Christ was not God, but was gradually deified by successive...", "...at if Charles Green, though reviving and re-modelling the art of ballooning in our own country, even after an exceptionally long and successful career, left that pursuit to which he had given new birth virtually still in its infancy.

We find him writing enthusiastically of the raptures he experienced when sailing over London in night hours, of lofty ascents and extremely low temperatures, of speeding twenty-eight miles in twenty minutes, of grapnel ropes breaking, and of a cross-country race of four miles through woods and hedges. Such was Mr. Spencer the elder, and if further evidence were needed of his...", "...British fleet was to be brought within gun-shot of the enemy's centre, in two divisions of sixteen sail each, and a division of observation consisting of the remaining eight. 'The lee division was by signal to make a rapid attack under all possible sail on the twelve rear ships of the enemy. The ships were to break through the enemy's line; and such ships as were thrown out of their stations were to assist their friends that were hard pressed. The remainder of the enemy's fleet, of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> sail, were to be left to the management of the commander-in-chief.'

In the case of the 10,000 naturalized citizens of Rhode Island, and that of Susan B. Anthony and other women of New York and elsewhere, who try to vote, there is one great dissimilarity. The suffrage of the 10,000 is only regulated. As soon as each one secures real estate to the small value of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> dollars, he votes; but there women can never vote, simply because they are _women_. Property amounts to nothing; education amounts to nothing; even native-born citizenship amounts to nothing; the ballot for them is not regulated but prohibited because they were born women instead of men. Congress would quickly waken up to an appreciation of its power over the ballot, if under pretense of \"regulating\" suffrage, all the male citizens of a...", "...The doctrine of State Sovereignty detracts from this authority by lessening the power which upholds it. Thirty-four-States, each claiming exclusive authority to act independently on any given subject, have only one thirty-fourth part of the strength that they would have, were they all acting under and controlled by one central head. That central head in our Union is the Federal Government, formed by and growing out of the Constitution, and it must exist for the protection of each of its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> members, as well as for itself, the connecting power. Its acts must not be disputed by any one of the States or by any number of them acting in concert. If one or more States may defy the central authority or attempt to withdraw from its government, any other States may do likewise, to the ruin of the political fabric erected at so much cost, and in its place would spring up scores of weak and unprotected communities.

Greenhow was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> when he took out his preemption papers and planted his first acre of vines. For reasons best known to the gods, the deer kept well away from that side of the San Jacinto that year.

Schenck was an invaluable addition to the House. He had been serving in the field since the outbreak of the war, but had been induced to contest the return of Vallandigham to Congress. His canvass was so able and spirited that though in other parts of the State the Democrats captured eight Republican districts, he defeated Vallandigham in a Democratic district. Mr. Schenck had originally entered Congress in 1843 at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age, and after a distinguished service of eight years was sent by President Fillmore as Minister-Plenipotentiary to Brazil. After his return he had taken no part in political affairs until now. His re-appearance in Congress was therefore significant.

From the palace of Dastagerd, he pursued his march within a few miles of Modain or Ctesiphon, till he was stopped, on the banks of the Arba, by the difficulty of the passage, the rigor of the season, and perhaps the fame of an impregnable capital. The return of the emperor is marked by the modern name of the city of Sherhzour: he fortunately passed Mount Zara, before the snow, which fell incessantly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> days; and the citizens of Gandzca, or Tauris, were compelled to entertain the soldiers and their horses with a hospitable reception. When the ambition of Chosroes was reduced to the defence of his hereditary kingdom, the love of glory, or even the sense of shame, should have urged him to meet his rival in the field.

A Mr. Marshall with L8,000 per annum was as far as Corfu, and turned back on hearing of Byron's death.... The greatest man in the world has resigned his mortality in favour of this sublime cause; for had he remained in Italy he had lived!' Such was Trelawny's opinion of Byron in April, 1824. From all that the present writer has been able to gather, both from Trelawny's lips and from his 'Recollections,' published <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years after Byron's death, such was his real opinion to the last. Mrs. Julian Marshall, having called attention[24] to the fact that, four months after Byron's death, Trelawny, in a letter to Mary Shelley, spoke in contemptuous terms of Byron, we feel bound to refer to it here. It must be remembered that the letter in question was of a strictly private nature. In making it public, Mrs. Marshall _unintentionally_ dealt a severe blow at Trelawny, which, in justice to his...", "...she finished her life's work by taking care of all the poor and unfortunate of the county.

THE SHOWER OF NOVEMBER 14, 1866. The fact that all great displays of the November meteors have taken place at intervals of thirty-three or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, or some multiple of that period, had led to a general expectation of a brilliant shower in 1866. In this country, however, the public curiosity was much disappointed. The numbers seen were greater than on ordinary nights, but not such as would have attracted any special attention. The greatest number recorded at any one station was seen at New Haven, by Prof. Newton.

In saying this, however, it must be understood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower always correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that they came true, because in each of the thirty-six short rows every plant was absolutely alike, with the one single exception.

He was not born (in 1500) until Donatello had been dead <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, Mino da Fiesole sixteen years, Desiderio da Settignano thirty-six years, and Verrocchio twelve years.

Now see what happens. Pressed upon heavily by the air in every other part and place, like a mouse hunted by a cat, who finds at last a hole through which to escape, the poor water darts at this and ascends the tube close after the piston. So far so good; but if the tube is very long, and the piston rises rather high;--at thirty-three or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet above the level of the water it has to continue its ascent alone. The water parts company, stopping quietly behind, half-way up the tube. \"What is the meaning of this?\" you will ask. It means that the force which presses on the well-water all round the tube, and thus drives it up, has done all it can, and that our little air-imps refuse to supply any more. The water which rises in the tube has a weight of its own of course, and with this weight it presses, as it...", "...I believe, with the quest of favours--permission, money, and so forth; but doubtless affection played a part in them.

Considered by itself, it was quiet and uneventful, and had little to excite general interest; but when viewed in its relation to the practice of his art, it is found to be full of eloquent suggestions to all who, like him, have been appointed to win success through suffering. The narrative of his experience comprises two great periods--the preparation, which covered <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, and the achievement, to the enjoyment of which less than eight years were permitted. The first period is subdivided into two, of which one embraces eighteen years, from the time when, at the age of twenty, he entered upon the study of his art, to his retirement from the world to the exile of his Deerfield farm; the other including sixteen years of seclusion, until, at the age of fifty-four, he came forth again to proclaim a new revelation.

I suppose about two-thirds of it are thus occupied, while the residue is thrown open at certain hours to the public. I spent two hours in wandering through this portion, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> rooms, mainly attractive by reason of the Paintings and other works of Art displayed on their walls. As a whole, the collection is by no means good, the best having been gradually abstracted to adorn those Palaces which Royalty still condescends to inhabit, while worse and worst are removed from those and deposited here; yet it was interesting to me to gaze at undoubted originals by Raphael, Titian, Poussin, Rembrandt, Teniers, Albert Durer, Leonardo da Vinci, Tintoretto,...", "...their teaching. One of these prophets, or preachers, however, had a short career.

At first the Arabs were inclined to receive the Portuguese without a struggle; but, taking courage from the presence of a large army of Bedouin in the vicinity, they soon showed treacherous intentions towards the invaders, so that the Portuguese admiral determined to attack the town and destroy it, and the commentator states that 'within were burned many provisions, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> ships in all, large and small, many fishing barks, and an arsenal full of every requisite for ship-building.' After effecting a landing, the Portuguese ordered 'three gunners with axes to cut the supports of the mosque, which was a large and very beautiful edifice, the greater part being built of timber finely carved, and the upper part of stucco,' and it was accounted a propitious miracle by the Portuguese that the men who performed this deed were not killed by the...", "...high column stands near a shorter one the architrave over the latter reposes upon a projecting bracket worked into the shaft of the higher one.

The barracks having been set on fire by the shells, the garrison worn out, suffocated, and half-blinded, were forced to capitulate.

On the 16th of October 1690 <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> English ships, some of them only fishing craft, appeared in its basin and demanded the surrender of the town. When Frontenac answered defiantly, Phips attacked the place; but he was repulsed and in the end sailed away unsuccessful.

Not a house was in sight-it was as barren and desolate a spot as the sun ever \"viewed in...", "...still visible, while the rest lies crumbled and broken. It is difficult to realize the grand appearance of the thirty rows of stone columns standing within the wall. Some of them that are still perfect, are capped with enormous monolith capitals, and it is said that one hundred men could stand on one of them without crowding. The hall itself is four hundred and twenty-two feet long by one hundred and sixty-five feet broad. The stones of the ceiling are supported by one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> columns, which are still standing, and of which the largest measures ten feet in diameter, and more than seventy-two feet in height. They are covered with carvings and paintings whose colors are still bright, even after a lapse of forty centuries.

Moreover, it founded missions to the Jews and Mohammedans.

We need not underrate the risks of the raids, but we need not make ourselves ridiculous about them. So far as the average individual life is concerned they are almost negligible.

But the Germans do not drop two hundred bombs a month, nor twenty bombs, probably not ten bombs. Let us assume, however, that they get up to an average of twenty bombs. It will be over three hundred years before we have all come within the range of peril. I do not suggest that this reflection justifies us in going out into the streets when a raid is on.

A pretty stream of water, the river Glyme, with a lake, winds through a valley in front of the palace, and is crossed by a stately stone bridge with a centre arch of one hundred feet span. Not far from this bridge was Fair Rosamond's Bower, now marked by a wall; beyond the bridge, standing on the lawn, is the Marlborough Column, a fluted Corinthian pillar one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet high, surmounted by the hero in Roman dress and triumphal attitude.

No serious affair, however, occurred for some hours. Meade, as stated, was forming his lines on the right of the position he afterward occupied. The Fifth Corps, which came up about 1 P.M., was posted, as a reserve, south of the Twelfth Corps, with a view to the attack which has already been referred to. About 3 P.M. the Sixth Corps began to arrive from its long and toilsome march of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles, and its tired troops were placed on the Taneytown road in the rear of Round Top, to reinforce the other corps in case our troops made an attack on the left.

One of our shells fell on the De Beers magazine, transformed into an ammunition factory, and caused an explosion and a fire. The English, despairing of silencing our _Long Tom_ with their _Long Cecil_, replied to every shot at the town by a shell into our laager. The accuracy of their fire with this gun at a range of about 7,000 metres was remarkable. We were indeed a capital target: a green rectangle of 200 metres in the midst of a yellow, arid plain. The shell arrived in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> seconds, but did no great damage, for a watchman gave the alarm, 'Skit!' each time when he saw the smoke, and we retreated into shelter. The telegraphists of the staff, who were working in a little house, were placed in communication with the watchman by means of a bell, and, warned half a minute before the arrival, they had time to take refuge in a neighbouring trench.

The _ketchudas_ said that they could not guarantee my safety that night with less than ten men, and I saw in the whole affair a design on my very slender purse. A monetary panic set in before I reached Hamadan: the sovereign had fallen from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> to twenty-eight _krans_, the Jews would not take English paper at any price, I could not cash my circular notes, and it was only through the kindness of the American missionaries that I had any money at all, and I had only enough for ordinary expenses as far as Urmi.

The two English captains, Mackra and Reily, were about to sink and destroy these castaways, when England's two vessels, of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> and thirty-eight guns, stood in to the bay. In spite of all promises of aid, the _Ostender_ and _Kirby_ deserted Mackra, a breeze admitting of their escape, while the pirate's black and bloody flags were still flaunting the air. Mackra, undaunted by their desertion, fought desperately for three hours, beating off one of the pirates, striking her between wind and water, and shooting away their oars, when they put out their sweeps and tried to board. Mackra being wounded in...", "...often smoking enormous cigarettes: merry and careless, but always well, and often charmingly, dressed.

The steamer to Calcutta was unusually crowded, but I was again fortunate enough to secure the use of the pilot's cabin all to myself. The Hugli River was familiar even after <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years' absence, and in Calcutta I noticed little change. The hotels, including the Grand and Continental, are quite unworthy of the city, only the very old and well-known Great Eastern approaching the first-class character. Calcutta was getting hot, so I at once went on to Darjeeling, hoping to get a view of what my eyes had ever longed to see--the glorious high peaks of the Himalayas, and the roof of the world. After a few hours' run through the celebrated Terai jungle,...", "...the list dated Dec. 1, 1893, and in the three next lists, it is again announced as in the press, and the number to be printed is given as 150. Meanwhile the printing of the Chaucer had been begun, and as it was not feasible to carry on two folios at the same time, the Froissart again comes under the heading 'in preparation' in the lists from Dec. 1, 1894, to June 1, 1896. In the prospectus of the Shepheardes Calender, dated Nov. 12, 1896, it is announced as abandoned. At that time about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pages were in type, but no sheet had been printed. Before the type was broken up, on Dec. 24, 1896, 32 copies of sixteen of these pages were printed and given as a memento to personal friends of the poet and printer whose death now made the completion of the book impossible. This suggested the idea of printing two pages for wider distribution. The half-border had been engraved in April, 1894, by W. Spielmeyer, but the large border only existed as a drawing. It was engraved...", "...The early passage tombs of Japan are, according to Borlase, (W. C.), literally counterparts in plan and construction of those giant-graves or passage-tombs which are prevalent in Cornwall, and, speaking of the inhabitants of Cornwall and Wales, Dr. Beddoe says: \"I think some reason can be shown for suspecting the existence of traces of some Mongoloid race in the modern population of Wales and the West of England. The most notable indication is the oblique or Chinese eye. I have noted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> persons with oblique eyes. Their heads include a wide range of relative breadth. In other points the type stands out distinctly. The cheek bones are almost always broad: the brows oblique, in the same direction as the eyes; the chin as a rule narrow and angular; the nose often concave and flat, seldom arched; and the mouth rather inclined to be prominent.... The iris is usually hazel or brown, and the hair straight, dark-brown, black, or reddish.\" \"It is,\" he adds,...", "...was little honour or prize-money to be gained, and the vessel had been for some time incessantly engaged in hunting for foes that were never found. Not the least pleased was Will. He had left England a friendless ship's-boy; he returned home a midshipman, with a most creditable record, and with a fortune that, when he left the service, would enable him to live in more than comfort. On arriving at Portsmouth the crew were at once paid off, and Will was appointed to the _Tartar_, a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> gun frigate. On hearing the name of the ship, Dimchurch and Tom Stevens at once volunteered. They were given a fortnight's leave; so Will, with Tom Stevens, determined to take a run up to Scarcombe, and the same day took coach to London. Dimchurch said he should spend his time in Portsmouth, as there was no one up in the north he cared to see, especially as it would take eight days out of his fortnight's leave to go to his native place and back. On the fourth day after...", "...the Duke's palace upon which Beethoven had played. It was a funny little instrument of about five octaves, but it was so wheezy with age that there wasn't much tone to be got out of it. After we had finished looking at the palace, we went over to see the ducal library. Here I saw a superb bust of Goethe as a young man. It was so handsome that it spurns description. He must have been a perfect Apollo. I also saw a likeness of him painted upon a cup by some great artist, for which he sat <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> times! The old librarian, who had known Goethe, said that it was _exactly_ like him, and the miniature painting was so wonderful that when you looked at it with a magnifying glass it was only finer and _more_ accurate instead of less so! There was also a most noble bust of the composer Glueck. The face was all scarred with small-pox, so that the cast must have been moulded from his features after death, but I never saw such a living, animated, likeness in marble. It looked...", "...partner, formed a favorable opinion of Stephenson's plans, and agreed to supply him with the funds necessary to build a locomotive. With his support Stephenson went to work to choose his tools and workmen. He had to devise and make many of the tools he needed, and to train his men specially for this business. He built his first engine in the workshops at the West Moor Mine. It followed to some extent the model of Blenkinsop's engine. It had a cylindrical boiler, eight feet long and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> inches in diameter, with an internal flue tube passing through it. The engine had two vertical cylinders and worked the propelling gear with cross-heads and connecting-rods. The power of the two cylinders was carried by means of spur-wheels, which continued the motive power to the wheels that supported the engine on the rails. The engine was simply mounted on a wooden frame that was supported on four wheels. These wheels were smooth, as Stephenson was convinced that smooth...", "...historical event could have been commemorated in the everlasting record supplied by clay.

Some went to the British Museum, some elsewhere; Mr. Huth's share cost him L500!

We were up at 4 a.m. and left the place a few hours later, with the result that the day's march brought us <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles nearer Framheim. With our present arrangement, we had these long-day marches every other day.

He had tried to be a good man, and though his attack on France was really wrong, and caused great misery, he had meant to do right. So he was not afraid to face death, and he died when only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old, while he was listening to the 51st Psalm. Everybody grieved for him-- even the French--and nobody had ever been so good and dutiful to poor old King Charles, who sat in a corner lamenting for his good son Henry, and wasting away till he died, only three weeks later, so that he was buried the same day, at St. Denys Abbey, near Paris, as Henry was buried at Westminster Abbey, near London.

They were indicted and brought to trial. John Adams, afterwards President of the United States, then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age, was counsel for the accused. Jonathan Ames turned King's evidence against his mother. It was midnight before the counsel began their arguments and two of the three judges were explicit in summing up the evidence, that there was \"a violent presumption\" of guilt, but at nine o'clock in the morning the jury came in and rendered a verdict of \"not guilty.\" May the result be attributed to John Adams's eloquence and logic or to the vagaries of our jury system?...", "...that some more of the pages from the Epistles of S.

In giving this information to the Abbe Bignon, Mr. Bentley entreated him not to mention the source of his information. M. de Boze thereupon resolved to visit England and endeavour to recover the MSS. But he was detained by various causes. In 1729, Earl Middleton offered, on the part of Lord Harley, to return the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> leaves of the Epistles in his possession, asking only in return an acknowledgment sealed with the grand seal. Cardinal Fleury, finding that the Royal signature could hardly be employed for such a purpose, wrote in the King's name a letter to the Earl of Oxford of a flattering nature, and the lost MSS. were restored in September, 1729.

The first was composed of noblemen, gentlemen, and merchants, in and about London, who had an exclusive right to occupy regions from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> to thirty-eight degrees of north latitude. The other company, composed of gentlemen and merchants in the west of England, had assigned to them the territory between forty-one and forty-five degrees. But only the first company succeeded.

There were also _snekars_, with twenty banks or forty rowers. The largest had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> banks of rowers. The incursions of the Danes, who had long before ascended the Seine and Loire, lead us to infer that the greater part of these vessels were very small.

The young and ardent members of the house of representatives, who had elected Henry Clay, then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age, speaker, determined that indecision should no longer mark the councils of the nation. The committee on foreign relations, of which Peter B. Porter was chairman, intensified that feeling by an energetic report submitted on the 29th of November, in which, in glowing sentences, the British government was arraigned on charges of injustice, cruelty, and wrong. They said: \"To sum up, in a word, the great cause of complaint against Great Britain, your committee...", "...home in Cooperstown, he had become the most widely read of American authors. No other American writer, in fact, during the nineteenth century, enjoyed so wide a contemporary popularity. His works appeared simultaneously in America, England, and France.

A candle standing near him threw a gleam upon his soldierly face, lit up his brow, and brought out admirably his clear skin, his ardent eyes, his black and slightly curling hair, which had the brilliancy of jet. The hair grew vigorously upward from the forehead and temples, sharply defining those five black tongues which our ancestors used to call the \"five points.\" Notwithstanding this abrupt contrast of black and white, Max's face was very sweet, owing its...", "...then there was a funny little postscript, which made her smile through her tears: \"You will think this letter all my--'I.' But that doesn't really matter now, as you and I are one!\" Rose soon learnt her first love-letter by heart. She made a little silk envelope for it, and wore it on her heart. It was like a bit of Jervis himself--direct, simple, telling her all she wanted to know, yet leaving much unsaid. Rose had once been shown a love-letter in which the word \"kiss\" occurred <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> times. She was glad that there was nothing of that sort in Jervis's letter, and yet she longed with a piteous, aching longing to feel once more his arms clasping her close, his lips trembling on hers....

The torpedo-boat destroyer, contrary to general belief, does not carry any heavy guns, but depends on its great speed and its ability to cripple a torpedo-boat with its 6-pounders while keeping out of range of the enemy's tubes. All torpedo-boat destroyers carry torpedo tubes themselves, so that they can be used against the enemy's battle-ships or cruisers if the occasion offers. The fastest boat in the United States navy is the destroyer _Bailey_, which can steam <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles an hour. In a naval battle the success or failure of a fleet may depend on keeping open communication between the different vessels of the squadron engaged. Owing to the fact that the surface of the sea would often be obscured by the smoke of battle, the difficulty of this is apparent, and naval experts have been kept busy devising some method by which the flag-ship can communicate with the other vessels of the squadron at all times and under all conditions.

By reference to the table of occupations of persons admitted last year it appears that more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> per cent. were of persons, the larger portion of whom had never been educated in any regular method of obtaining a living. Some of them had been accustomed to depend upon the precarious results attending common labor, and some upon domestic labor, while others were without any regular occupation. Probably some of these persons may have had a measure of education in some occupation in early life, but if so, this does not appear in the statistics. The second is the report...", "...to cruise before the entrance, in case the now angered Venetians should attack.

Never have we received before such insults. On! On! to Chioggia.\" So, silent and vengeful, the Venetian fleet stole out to sea on the evening of December twenty-first. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> galleys, sixty smaller armed vessels, and hundreds of flat-bottomed boats. Pisani was in the rear, towing two heavy, old hulks, laden with stones, to sink in the entrance of the harbor and bottle up the fleet, even as the Americans were to sink the _Merrimac_ in the Harbor of Santiago, many years afterwards. The Genoese were unready. The cruisers, on duty as sentinels, were not where they should have been, and so the gallant Pisani scuttled the hulks across the harbor...", "...of Jesus and his successors holding the place of God), Perpetual Poverty, Chastity and Obedience; and according to it a peculiar care in the education of boys, according to the manner expressed in the Apostolic Letter and Constitutions of the said Society.\" The lay brothers leave out the clause concerning education.

Only when he is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> or thirty-six can he be ordained a priest and enter on the grade of a spiritual coadjutor. A lay brother, before he can become a temporal coadjutor for the discharge of domestic duties, must pass ten years before he is admitted to vows. Sometimes after ordination the priest, in the midst of his work, is again called away to a third year's novitiate, called the tertianship, as a preparation for his solemn profession of the three vows.

With reference to those who assign such an extent of duration, it may be remarked, as was done in considering the question of age, that they...", "...had, Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait, On purpose laid to make the taker mad.\" Now, this is not the ordinary man's experience of passion and its effects. \"Past reason hunted,\" such an one might say, but he would certainly not go on \"No sooner had, Past reason hated.\" He is not moved to hate by enjoyment, but to tenderness; it is your weakling who is physically exhausted by enjoyment who is moved to hatred. This sonnet was written by Shakespeare in the prime of manhood at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> or thirty-five at latest. Shakespeare was probably healthy as a young man, but intensely sensitive and highly strung; too finely constituted ever to have been strong. One notices that he takes no pleasure in fighting; his heroes are, of course, all \"valiant,\" but he shows no loving interest in the game of fighting as a game. In fact, we have already seen that he found no wonderful phrase for any of the manly virtues; he was a neuropath and a lover, and not a fighter,...", "...to learn the advantages of a single life. In Maryland so many took this view, that we find the old statutes imposing a tax on bachelors over twenty-five years of age, of five shillings, for estates under three hundred pounds sterling, or twenty shillings when over; a tax which seems to have been more successful as a means of raising money than of promoting matrimony; for we find the record of its payment by a surprising number of bachelors, St. Ann's parish vestry-books alone showing <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> such derelicts. Perhaps, however, this celibacy did not indicate so much aversion to marriage, as inability to meet the growing demands for luxury. The obstinate bachelors may have felt with regard to matrimony as Alsop did with regard to liberty, that \"without money it is like a man opprest with the gout--every step he takes forward puts him to pain.\" The Abbe Robin at a later day says of Annapolis: \"Female luxury here exceeds what is known in the provinces of France.

About, thirty policemen were drawn up in front of the office, awaiting the appearance of the inspector, who was examining the books in which were recorded the names of the tax-paying miners, checking those who had refused to pay at the end of the previous month, and placing a cross against the names of miners who had worked out their taxes on the road, on the ground that they had not made enough out of their claims to allow government the large sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> shillings per month. The tax applied to all, and there was no chance to evade it. The fortunate and unfortunate were alike liable to the officers of the crown, knowing no distinction, so they said; but I found before the close of the day that that assertion was a fallacy, and that there was a favorite class at Ballarat, and that they were rarely troubled by the inspector's visits, and if short of money were seldom required to pay taxes. \"I am glad that you have come,\"...", "...for the Book, and it was probably her satisfaction at the fame which it brought her that caused her to relent towards Propertius.

At the age of twenty-eight he was a leader in the New York legislature, and was chairman of the most important committees, always with the people, against the aristocracy--an unpardonable mistake in those times. At <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> he was attorney-general of the state, and his great decisions were accepted by all other states. At thirty-four he established the Manhattan bank of New York city.

This wall was constructed in the year 1585, when the Duque de la Plata was viceroy. It is the work of a Fleming, named Pedro Ramon. This wall is between eighteen and twenty feet high. Its breadth at the base is from ten to twelve feet, and at the top nine feet. It does not therefore afford sufficient space for mounting large guns. Along the whole extent of the wall there are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> bastions. In the year 1807, this wall, which had fallen into a very ruinous condition, was repaired by order of the viceroy Abascal, and put into a condition to be mounted with artillery.

The paths, which are obstructed by rubbish, are almost impassable, and the powder magazines are destroyed. The...", "...Africa.

This was the policy that he followed from the first moment of his victory until he drew his last breath. During all the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of his reign he followed this line of policy, cold and heartless as fate, and entailing the most terrible consequences.

On the 21st of the month the combined enemy's fleet, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> sail of the line, four frigates, and two brigs, were seen by us. At five minutes after twelve afternoon we broke their line and engaged them. Captain Tyler gallantly placed the _Tonnant_, and I hope we as gallantly defended her. We have lost twenty-six brave fellows and fifty wounded in our ship only. We have captured sixteen sail of the line, French and Spanish, and sunk one of the line and one blew up. We are now going for Gibraltar to refit, as we are decently maul'd. We...", "...pilgrims. The authorities, lay and clerical, paid little attention to him at first. Some princes and some cities (Nuernberg, for example) prohibited their subjects from going to Niklashausen; but the prophet was left untouched. He came to believe that his words ought to be translated into actions. One Sunday he asked his followers to meet him on the next Sunday, bringing their swords and leaving their wives and children at home. The Bishop of Wuerzburg, hearing this, sent a troop of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> horsemen, who seized the prophet, flung him on a horse, and carried him away to the bishop's fortress of Frauenberg near Wuerzburg. His followers had permitted his capture, and seemed dazed by it. In a day or two they recovered their courage, and, exhorted by an old peasant who had received a vision, and headed by four Franconian knights, they marched against Frauenberg and surrounded it. They expected its walls to fall like those of Jericho; and when they were disappointed...", "...has his breathing-place and remains with them.

The Bow River, an affluent of the Saskatchewan, is followed up to Calgary, the centre of the ranching district of Alberta, a town at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred feet elevation, having high mountains overhanging its western verge. Here are branch railways north and south, leading along the eastern foothills of the Rockies, which are filled with herds of cattle and horses, the roads going up to Edmonton and down into the United States.

The Pacific route follows the...", "...stormy days, and sometimes \"the clouds return after the rain.\" It is a blessed experience to recognize the silver lining on the darkest storm cloud, and, better still, to be sure of the shining of God's light behind a sky that seems wholly and hopelessly overcast. The year 1870 was made forever pathetically memorable by the decease of Mrs. Muller, who lived just long enough to see the last of the New Orphan Houses opened. From the outset of the work in November, 1835, for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, this beloved, devoted wife had been also a sympathetic helper. This wedded life had approached very near to the ideal of connubial bliss, by reason of mutual fitness, common faith in God and love for His work, and long association in prayer and service. In their case, the days of courtship were never passed; indeed the tender and delicate mutual attentions of those early days rather increased than decreased as the years went on; and the great maxim was both proven...", "...to postpone the establishment of the seminary and the college until after a settlement should be formed. The hospital, however, might, they thought, be begun at once; for blood and blows would be the assured portion of the first settlers. At least, a discreet woman ought to embark with the first colonists as their nurse and housekeeper. Scarcely was the need recognized when it was supplied. Mademoiselle Jeanne Mance was born of an honorable family of Nogent-le-Roi, and in 1640 was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age. These Canadian heroines began their religious experiences early. Of Marie de l'Incarnation we read, that at the age of seven Christ appeared to her in a vision; and the biographer of Mademoiselle Mance assures us, with admiring gravity, that, at the same tender age, she bound herself to God by a vow of perpetual chastity. This singular infant in due time became a woman, of a delicate constitution, and manners graceful, yet dignified.

Sometimes they cast him for a 'speaking part,' but not an elaborate one. He could be trusted to go and say, 'My lord, the carriage waits,' but if they ventured to add a sentence or two to this, his memory felt the strain and he was likely to miss fire.

The first regular light seems to have been placed at the entrance to the Hellespont; but of greater notoriety was the large tower on the island of Pharos, off Alexandria, which was so ingeniously constructed that it has been a model for many a modern lighthouse. Some incredible stories are told about this light, which, it is said, could be seen over the sea for a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles! Edrisi thus describes it:--\"This pharos has not its like in the world for skill of construction and solidity.

They contained an historical account from the creation down to the Tower of Babel, and from that time down until they were destroyed, comprising a period of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred, or thirty-five hundred years. They also contained many prophecies, great and marvellous, reaching forward to the final end and consummation of all things, and the creation of the new heaven and new earth.

It is doubtful if even he himself realized how transient such a state must be to a nature whose hidden springs were moved so easily by the mere action of change--by the effect of any alteration in the objects that surrounded him.

By Census Table 34, there were in 1860, 1,642 banks, incorporated by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> States, with no uniformity of organization, issues, or security.

So that the total investments represent a sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> milliards, all highly profitable capital, despite--or rather because of--the fact that it belongs to no one particular owner; for this very absence of private proprietorship of the total productive capital is the reason why any labour power can avail itself of those means of production by the use of which the highest possible profit can be realised.

In form it is an enormous rotunda, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet in circumference, lighted by a shaft in the centre of its immense cupola. The porch by which one enters this rather pagan-looking structure is simple, and by far the most gracious feature of the edifice.

Even at this day you can hardly discover a substantial departure from the original in the numerous manuscript copies extant. Kennicott, an English Biblical scholar, brought together five hundred and eighty Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible which, after careful study and comparison, revealed scarcely any differences of the text. An Italian, Prof. de Rossi, who died in 1831, had collected seven hundred and ten manuscripts, and had seen in various libraries one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> more, all of which he examined critically without finding any notable differences. I am speaking, remember, of such differences as would affect the historical identity of these manuscript copies with their original.

Thirty years after he died the empire was divided into three parts, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years later it was all broken up in the foolish reign of his own great-grandson, who was called Charles also, but instead of Charles the Great became known as Charles the Fat.

The Medes had, it is probable, been for some time growing in strength, owing to the recent arrival in their country of fresh immigrants from the far East. Discarding the old system of separate government and village autonomy, they had joined together and placed themselves under a single monarch; and about the year B.C. 634, when Asshur-bani-pal had been king for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, they felt themselves sufficiently strong to undertake an expedition against Nineveh. Their first attack, however, failed utterly. Phraortes, or whoever may have been the real leader of the invading army, was completely defeated by the Assyrians; his forces were cut to pieces, and he himself was among the slain. Still, the very fact that the Medes could now take the offensive and attack Assyria was novel and alarming; it showed a new condition of things in these...", "...world's coveted pleasures.

In 1836 the anti-slavery movement, destined to grow to such vast proportions, began to show itself in the Senate. The first contest came on the reception of petitions for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. Mr. Calhoun moved that these petitions should not be received, but his motion was rejected by a large majority. The question then came on the petitions themselves, and, by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> to six, their prayer was rejected, Mr. Webster voting with the minority because he disapproved this method of disposing of the matter. Soon after, Mr. Webster presented three similar petitions, two from Massachusetts and one from Michigan, and moved their reference to a committee of inquiry. He stated that, while the government had no power whatever over slavery in the States, it had complete control over slavery in the District, which was a totally distinct affair.

He was, at the time, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age. Mary was about twenty-two. Sir James Melville was received with many marks of attention and honor by Queen Elizabeth. His first interview with her was in a garden near the palace.

Then, too, the world was waking up commercially and it was becoming imperative to find better ways for transporting the ever increasing supplies of merchandise.

He remembered when he brought her first to Worsted Skeynes <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years ago, \"That timid, and like a rose, but a lady every hinch, the love!\" as his old nurse had said. He remembered her when George was born, like wax for whiteness and transparency, with eyes that were all pupils, and a hovering smile. So many other times he remembered her throughout those years, but never as a woman faded, old; never as a woman of the past.

Taking into account, then, the probable amount of money that has been drawn from the South and invested in the North within the last six years, and adding it to the grand balance above--the net profits of the North up to 1850--it may be safely assumed that, in the present year of grace, 1857, _the free States are worth at least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred million of dollars more than the slave States_! Let him who dares, gainsay these remarks and calculations; no truthful tongue will deny them; no honorable pen can controvert them. One more word now as to the valuation of negroes.

In the Irish counties it ran from one in fifty-eight in Carlow, to one in two hundred and sixty-one in Tyrone; and in the boroughs from one in nine in Carrickfergus and Waterford, to one in fifty-three in Tralee. The proportion of members of Parliament to population was far more uneven still. As reformers at a later date were constantly pointing out, one half of the borough population of England was contained in sixteen boroughs, and elected only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> members; the other half, numbering less than two and a half millions, still returning two hundred and ninety-three members; while the counties with eight millions of people returned one hundred and forty-four members.

The situation before the People of the Temple was that for a long time now, the only children to be born had been girls.

There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> boys in Outwood's, of whom about fourteen were much the same size and build as Mike. The suddenness, however, of the call caused Mike to lose his head. He made the strategic error of sliding rapidly down the pipe, and running. There were two gates to Mr. Outwood's front garden. The drive ran in a semicircle, of which the house was the center.

Nine-tenths of the parents voluntarily make the payment rather than be considered too poor or too indifferent to do so.

On the thirty-fifth ballot Garfield had three hundred and ninety-nine votes, twenty-one majority over all. Blaine by telegraph had outgeneralled Conkling, present and commanding in person.

In the course of his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years on the Bench, the Court handed down opinions in over 1100 cases, which is probably about four times the number of opinions now handed down at a single term; and of this number Marshall spoke for the Court in about half the cases.

The machine must have gone at the rate of seven-twenty-fourths of a mile per minute and the wind travelled five-twenty-fourths of a mile per minute. Thus, going, the wind would help, and the machine would do twelve-twenty-fourths, or half a mile a minute, and returning only two-twenty-fourths, or one-twelfth of a mile per minute, the wind being against it. The machine without any wind could therefore do the ten miles in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> and two-sevenths minutes, since it could do seven miles in twenty-four minutes. 73.--DONKEY RIDING.

The certificates and the votes of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> of the States are undisputed.

This enables all work to be done with straight unstrained back. Where the forearm muscle is involved, however, it becomes a far more delicate question.

Leroy Beaulieu, who presided over this international jury, has written several articles, and a most scathing letter to M. Combes, on the subject of his malicious official calumnies. He, Brunetiere, Paul Bourget, and many other distinguished Frenchmen have countersigned a Defence, presented by the Salesian Fathers, in which not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> misstatements made by M.

The Chambers were supposed by the law of 1901 to decide what Congregations were to be granted authorization. They really were allowed no voice in the matter. M. Combes presented only the names of four or five, Les freres de St. Jean de Dieu and some others, who are to be spared for the present.

Books first--then guns--then fishing poles--so ran the list of material possessions dear to my heart as a lad. That night was moonlight, cold, starry, with a silver sheen on the spectral spruces. During the night there came a change; it rained--first a drizzle, then a heavy downpour, and at five-thirty a roar of hail on the tent. This music did not last long. At seven o'clock the thermometer registered <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> degrees, but there was no frost. The morning was somewhat cloudy or foggy, with promise of clearing. We took the hounds over to See Canyon, and while Edd and Nielsen went down with them, the rest of us waited above for developments.

To such a degree had their vain hopes corrupted them, and with such a senseless confidence they took to the field! When Pompey had got at a little distance from the camp, he quitted his horse. He had very few people about him; and, as he saw he was not pursued, he went softly on, wrapped up in such thoughts as we may suppose a man to have, who had been used for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years to conquer and carry all before him, and now in his old age first came to know what it was to be defeated and to fly. We may easily conjecture what his thoughts must be, when in one short hour he had lost the glory and the power which had been growing up amidst so many wars and conflicts; and he who was lately guarded with such armies of horse and foot, and such great and powerful fleets, was reduced to so mean and contemptible an equipage, that his enemies, who were...", "...time. The ten acres of the home lot were to be planted with three hundred Yellow Transparent, three hundred Duchess of Oldenburg, and one hundred mixed varieties for home use.

The next day there came an alarm: a shot was fired over the bows of the 'Maria Crowther' from one of two Portuguese men of war becalmed close by; but drifting within hail one of the Portuguese captains explained that there were supposed to be privateers in those waters and that he only wanted to learn whether the Englishman had sighted any such. On October 21, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> days out from London, the 'Maria Crowther' reached Naples harbour and was promptly put in quarantine. In that predicament her passengers sweltered and fumed for ten full days, their number having been increased by the addition of a lieutenant and six seamen, who were despatched from an English man-of-war in the harbour to enquire as to the vessel's name and status, and having thoughtlessly gone on board her were forbidden by the port authorities to go off again.

The governor is usually so adjusted as to make thirty-six revolutions per minute, when in uniform motion; but if the motion is increased to the rate of thirty-nine revolutions, the balls will fly to the utmost extent allowed them, being the limitation of the grooves in which their rods move; and if, on the other hand, the speed be diminished to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> revolutions per minute, they will collapse to the lowest extent of their play. The duty of the governor, therefore, is to correct smaller casual derangements of the velocity; but if any permanent change to a considerable extent be made either in the load driven by the machine or in the moving power supplied to it from the boiler, then a permanent change is necessary to be made in the connection between the governor and the throttle-valve, so as to render the governor...", "...to say of him that his presence on the field made a difference of forty thousand men.\" Of more interest even than the enrolment of the Volunteers were the measurers taken for local defence and for the protection of the civil population and property--the women and children and livestock.

Accounts of Stephenson's great invention crept into print, and people began to have faith in the locomotive. In 1822, a company began to build a line of railway between two towns named Stockton and Darlington. Stephenson was employed to construct the road-bed and build the engines. It was completed three years later, and was the subject of great popular curiosity. Great crowds came to see the line opened. Stephenson himself drove the first engine. The train consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> cars. The signal was given and the train started. Great was the sensation as it moved off, and still greater was the admiration of the people at Stockton when the train arrived there after a safe journey. Thus, in 1825, was opened the first railway ever made for public use. Stephenson was soon engaged in constructing a railway between Manchester and Liverpool. But now a storm of opposition broke out.

CHAPTER XIII THE TREND OF DIPLOMACY After the international issues arising from the Civil War were settled, and before foreign relations began to become more important late in the nineties, our diplomatic history showed the same lack of definiteness and continuity that stamped the history of politics during the same years. Eleven different men held the post of Secretary of State during the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years from 1865 to 1898, one of them, Blaine, serving at two separate times. The political situation in Washington changed frequently, few men of outstanding capacity as diplomatists were in the cabinets, and most of the problems which arose were not such as would excite the interest of great international minds. That any degree of unity in our foreign relations was attained is due in part to the continuous service of such men as A.A. Adee, who was connected with the state...", "...were ready to make peace.

He was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old when he came to the throne. He had been general-in-chief of the armies, as was usual with the heir-apparent to the throne, and when he was elected king he was fulfilling the office of high-priest, which was unusual.

The diplomatic documents, which are not all documents of political wisdom, demonstrate the anxiety of the Italian Government to realize its Adriatic programme and to gain secure frontiers against Austria-Hungary and its successors. But this was not the _cause_ of the War; it was rather a means of explaining to the people the necessity for the War. Italy had been for nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years ally of Austria-Hungary, and the aspirations of Italy's Adriatic policy had never disturbed the relations between the two countries. The real cause of Italy's war was a sentimental movement, a form of extraordinary agitation of the spirits, brought about by the invasion of Belgium and the danger of France. The intellectual movement especially, the world of culture, partook largely in fomenting the state of exaltation which determined the War.

A list of those present in 1472 gives but fourteen bishops and abbots, twenty-two earls and barons, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> lairds or lesser tenants in capite, and eight deputies of boroughs.[428] The royal boroughs entitled to be represented in parliament were above thirty; but it was a common usage to choose the deputies of other towns as their proxies.[429] The great object with them, as well as with the lesser barons, was to save the cost and trouble of attendance. It appears indeed that they formed rather an insignificant portion of the legislative body. They are not named as consenting...", "...Pastorals of Pope in polish and versification, the Pastorals of Philips are, on the whole, superior in their substance. The trial of skill between the musician and the nightingale, which forms the subject of the fifth Pastoral, is narrated with singular sweetness, and may still be read with pleasure. In true poetic feeling it is much beyond anything in the Pastorals of his scoffing critic. Philips owed his advantage to his maturer years, and not to the brilliancy of his talents; he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> when Tonson's Miscellany appeared, and Pope was but twenty-one. The powers of Philips remained stationary, and he ranks low among the minor poets. Pope quickly ripened into genius, and reigned without a competitor. The exaggerated panegyrics of the Guardian could not confer a reputation upon Philips he did not deserve, and Pope derived none of his celebrity from the gross expedient of exalting himself, and decrying his antagonist.

Natural and proper as this may be on the wilder hills and poorer soils, it is easy to see how unnatural and intolerable it appears in fertile and accessible districts.

Among the twenty-seven sermons in this volume are included some specially addressed to the younger boys at the outset of their career. It is believed that schoolmasters and parents alike will find the...", "...a number of disconnected stories familiar to us from _The Arabian Nights_, Boccaccio's _Decamerone_, Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_, or even _Pickwick_, is directly traceable to the plan of making Buddha the central figure of India folk-literature.

Asvagosha, the earlier Boccaccio, died when he had completed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> of the Birth-Tales. But other collections were made, and at last a corpus of the JATAKAS, or Birth-Tales of the Buddha, was carried over to Ceylon, possibly as early as the first introduction of Buddhism, 241 B.C.

It consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> cars weighing, all told, ninety tons. The train was pulled by Stephenson's engine, operated by Stephenson himself, with a signalman riding on horseback in advance. The train moved off at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour, and on certain parts of the road it reached a speed of fifteen miles per hour. The trial was a complete success.

The only money he had was a dollar, a three-cent piece, and a two-cent piece. The tradesman had only a half-dollar and a quarter-dollar. But another customer happened to be present, and when asked to help produced two dimes, a five-cent piece, a two-cent piece, and a one-cent piece. How did the tradesman manage to give change? For the benefit of those readers who are not familiar with the American coinage, it is only necessary to say that a dollar is a hundred cents...", "...party you inquire about, I fear that you suppose I build marriages in the air very much at random.

All the information was gathered by Mr. Boone by sending circulars to every postmaster on the routes. Upon that information John W. Dorsey, John M. Peck, and John R.

After it got to that point Mr. Dorsey started for New Mexico. At Saint Louis he met John R.

Baron Dieskau with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred men had been sent to Crown Point. He now moved southward with a part of his force to a point almost east of the English camp. In the first engagement Dieskau scored a success. He then rashly attacked the English camp, but his forces suffered heavily, were finally routed, and the commander captured.

That is the monstrous star Arcturus, probably the biggest and swiftest star we can ever see with the naked eye in the northern hemisphere. He is several times as big as our sun, and his diameter is supposed to be several million miles. He is called a \"runaway sun,\" because he is rushing through space at the rate of between two hundred and three hundred miles a second. That means between seventeen and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> million miles a day! He is coming toward us, too! At such a rate you might think that Arcturus would have smashed the earth to pieces long ago. But he is still very far away, and there is no danger. Some people say that if Job were to come to life, the sky would seem just the same to him as it did 3,400 years ago. The only difference he might notice would be in Arcturus. That would seem to him out of place by a distance about three times the apparent diameter of the...", "...corporations in those places as well as in any other town of three thousand inhabitants, in which there might be a number of persons occupying premises at not less than L4 per annum, sufficient to make up a constituency.

He is of a cheerful disposition, having long ago resolved to look his misfortune steadily in the face and make the best of it. In books, where are treasures stored up by the scholars of all past time, he finds a never-ending pleasure.

This name has, even now, scarcely grown familiar to the eye and ear, but it proves to have been the real name of Emile Nolly, whose romances of modern life in the Extreme East had been widely read just before the war. Nolly's earliest books, \"Hien le Maboul\" and \"La Barque Annamite\" (but particularly the latter), gave promise of a new Pierre Loti or a new Rudyard Kipling, but totally distinct in manner from both. Detanger was just <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> when the war broke out, and he was one of its early victims, dying at Blainville-sur-l'Eau on September 5. He greatly distinguished himself by his personal bravery, and the cross of the Legion of Honour was pinned to his blood-stained uniform on his last battle-field. The tribute of a fellow-officer to this devoted man of letters may be quoted here. It is an example of the sudden and complete transformation which turned artists into soldiers at the first sound of the...", "...from group to group. At this cry some withdrew into their houses and shut their doors and darkened their windows, as if it were a day of public mourning, while others opened them wide, as if to let joy enter. In a few moments the uproar and confusion evoked by the news was succeeded by the deep silence of breathless curiosity. Then, through the silence, a figure advanced, carrying a branch of laurel in one hand as a token of triumph. It was that of a young man of from thirty-two to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age, with a graceful and well-knit frame, an aristocratic air and faultlessly beautiful features of a somewhat haughty expression. Although he had walked three leagues to reach the town, the ecclesiastical garb which he wore was not only elegant but of dainty freshness. His eyes turned to heaven, and singing in a sweet voice praise to the Lord, he passed through the streets leading to the church in the market-place with a slow and solemn gait, without vouchsafing a...", "...of questions affecting Indian finance and trade. The naval expedition which had been prepared in the last days of Pitt's administration sailed for Copenhagen on March 12, 1801, under Sir Hyde Parker, with Nelson as second in command. The admiral in chief was of a cautious temper, but was wise enough to allow himself to be guided by Nelson's judgment when planning an engagement, though not as to the general course of the expedition. The fleet consisted of sixteen ships of the line and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> smaller vessels; all these with the exception of one ship of the line reached the Skaw on the 18th. A frigate was sent in advance with instructions to Vansittart, the British envoy at Copenhagen, to present an ultimatum to the Danish government,[1] demanding a favourable answer to the British demands within forty-eight hours. For three days Parker waited at anchor eighteen miles from Elsinore, and it was only when Vansittart brought an unfavourable reply on the 23rd that he...", "...remarking that no stomachs have been examined, thinks that water insects are more probably its prey.

In his work of investigation he received most valuable assistance from Mr. H.J.

The side chambers, five in number, were considerably smaller than those behind the great hall, the largest not exceeding <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet by thirteen. It seems probable that this palace was without any second story.

Herod by this time had nine wives and many children and grandchildren. The latter he brought up with much care.

The king now altered his testament, dividing the territory among several of his sons. He died on the fifth day after the execution of Antipater, having reigned <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years after procuring the death of Antigonus. Archelaus, his son, was appointed by Caesar, in confirmation of Herod's will, governor of one-half of the country; but accusation of enemies led to his banishment to Vienna, in Gaul.

But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the Romans, extended the victory of the former, and the defeat of the latter, far beyond the limits of a single day.

In some of the recent States, more than a moiety of the whole domain had never been brought into this condition. At the date of these official returns it continued still unconscious of the surveyor's chain. Thus, in Wisconsin, out of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> millions of acres, only a little more than thirteen millions were proclaimed for sale; and in Iowa, the very State whose interests are now particularly in question, out of more than thirty-two millions of acres, only a little more than twelve millions were proclaimed for sale.

Even Mrs. Shelley, a lifelong friend and correspondent, to whom he had often poured out his...", "...[Sidenote: Capital of the Company.] It was never known in the seventeenth century what actually constituted the original capital of the Adventurers. So small was it that when, in the course of the Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry in 1749, nearly eighty years after the Company had received its charter, the figures were divulged, the pettiness of the sum occasioned universal surprise. Each adventurer was apparently required to pay L300, sterling; and the gross sum was divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> equal shares. Besides Prince Rupert's \"sundry charges\" (the euphemism employed to describe the sum paid him for his interest in obtaining the charter), his Highness was offered a share amounting to one equal share. \"He having graciously signified his acceptance thereof,\" says the secretary in the minute-book, \"credit given him for three hundred pounds.\" The capital thus stood at L10,500.

She was fluent of speech, and gave many reasons why it would be wrong of her to let the rent run on.

Cicero, as a young man, was well acquainted with him, and used to listen to his stories of his own early years. The shortness of the life of Roman tragedy, and the rapidity with which Roman literature developed, may be seen by observing that Cicero, the great master of Latin prose, knew Accius, whose birth took place only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years after the death of Livius Andronicus. Of the plays of Accius somewhat more than 700 lines are preserved, and about fifty titles are known. The fragments are for the most part detached lines, but some are long enough to let us see that the poet had a vigorous and graceful style, and a vivid imagination.

The earliest Italian workers took a solid block of wood, chiselled out a sunken design, and then filled in the depression with other woods. The only enemy to such work was dampness, which might loosen the glue, or cause the small thin bits to swell or warp. The glue was applied always when the surfaces were perfectly clean, and the whole was pressed, being screwed down on heated metal plates, that all might dry evenly. In 1478 there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> workshops of intarsia makers in Florence. The personal history of several of the Italian workers in inlay is still available, and, as it makes a craft seem much more vital when the names of the craftsmen are known to us, it will be interesting to glance at a few names of prominent artists in this branch of work.

This did not mean that Federalist principles had decayed or been overborne; the real reason for the extinction of that party was that it lived in the ranks of the Republican party. When Jefferson in 1801 said, \"We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists,\" he expressed what had come to be true in 1815. The great principles for which the Federalists had striven were the right of the federal government to exercise adequate powers, and...", "...frightened in the storm, and was comforted by our Saviour.

Between the marriage and the elopement Robert Browning did not call at the Barrett house on Wimpole Street. One of his biographers says that this absence was due to an inability of Browning to ask the maid at the door for Miss Barrett when there no longer was a Miss Barrett whom he wished to see. In passing judgment upon the elopement of this remarkable couple one must remember that they were no longer giddy and rash youth. Browning was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> and the romantic Juliet was three years older. Again it must be remembered that the objecting father was a most unreasonable and selfish man. The climax of his selfishness was reached when in opposition to the advice of the physicians Mr. Barrett refused to allow his daughter to go to Italy. \"In the summer of 1846,\" writes Mr. Chesterton, \"Elizabeth Barrett was still living under the great family convention which provided her with nothing but an elegant deathbed, forbidden...", "...Howard was thirty-two when he was assigned to the command of a corps, and only a year older when he succeeded McPherson in the command of the army of the Tennessee. McPherson was thirty-five when he gave up his heroic life on the bloody field before Atlanta. Slocum was thirty-eight when he handled his division with consummate skill at White-Oak Swamp. Joseph J. Reynolds was a major-general before he was forty. Parke was at the head of a corps when he was thirty-five. Hazen was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> when he led in the important capture of Fort McAllister. McKenzie, Custer, Kilpatrick, and Ames had each won his star before he had passed his twenty-sixty hear. The only West-Point man who became conspicuous in the command of troops after he was fifty years of age was David Hunter. He entered upon his sixtieth year on the day of the unfortunate battle of Bull Run, and engaged thenceforth in severe and meritorious field-service. Montgomery C.

Cotton came to her from the Pacific Isles, and nuts from South America. Some idea of the commercial importance of Chicago's trade may be reached by the amount of some of her exports by rail during 1872: namely, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> million pounds of meat; eighty million, two hundred and fifty thousand pounds of lard; one million, nine hundred and sixty-five thousand whole swine; four hundred and eighty-four thousand head of cattle, and one hundred and sixty-two thousand head of sheep.

The young man, as I have said, was smoking a new pipe. His mother fell very ill. They had to operate, and it made her cry out aloud, until after <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> days of horrible suffering she died. His father, who was always so hale, was talking one day with a workman at the door of the little village church, which was undergoing repair, when a stone became detached from the arch and crushed his head.

Assuming the government tax to be ten cents a bushel, the average cost of alum salt to be seven cents, and the regrater's price to be fifty cents, and it is clear that he receives upwards of three times as much as the government does; and that the tribute to those regraters is near two millions of dollars per annum. Assuming again that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pounds in the bushel are lost to the consumer in the substitution of the weighed for the measured bushel, and here is another loss amounting to nearly three-eighths of the value of the salt; that is to say, to about $250,000 on an importation of $650,000 worth. These detailed views of the operation and effects of the salt duty, continued Mr. B., place the burdens of that tax in the most odious and revolting light; but the picture is not yet complete; two other features...", "...proved most effective in reclaiming the offenders. _Record of Success Ninety-two Per Cent_ During my thirteen months' term in the Maxwell Street Court, I tried upwards of eight thousand cases and placed upon probation 1,231 persons.

Eleven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> of the paroled offenders, or about ninety-two per cent., faithfully kept the terms of their parole, and became sober, industrious citizens. Substantially all of those who lapsed did so because they violated their pledge of total abstinence. None, with one or two trivial exceptions, afterward committed any offense against the law.

Some years ago a college president tested a class of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> men with a score of extracts from Tennyson, each of which contained a Scriptural allusion, none of them obscure. The replies were suggestive and quite appalling.

One colony, in order to reach a grove of aspens, dug a canal three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet long, which had an average depth of fifteen inches and a width of twenty-six inches. It ended in a grove of aspens, which were in due time cut down and floated through this canal into the pond, alongside the beaver house. The other colony endured dangers and greater hardships.

The scheme, as a whole, was, of course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to contend otherwise, as is now being done by the Nebraskites; it was so shown by the votes and quite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men.

Henry, on his side, very likely had some regard to the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> castles, and decided to bide his time. Peace, for the present, was made between them. Some measures which Henry considered necessary for the security of Normandy, he did not think it wise to carry out by his own unsupported action.

Within a year were condemned one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> ships and cargoes, worth $10,000,000.[229] That Jefferson consciously leaned to France from any regard to Napoleon is incredible; the character and procedures of the French Emperor were repugnant to his deepest convictions; but that there was a still stronger bias against the English form of government, and the pursuit of the sea for which England especially stood, is equally clear.

It may not be out of place to suggest, in this connection, that when a boy sentenced to the Reform School is known to have been guilty of truancy, if the parents were subjected to some additional burdens on that account, the cause of education would be promoted, and the number of criminals in the community would be diminished.

Immediately above the gable of the central portal is a wonderful rose window, of the spoke variety, containing <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> sections,--of immense size and nearly forty feet across. This \"most perfect rose,\" designed by Bernard de Soissons, may well be credited as one of the masterworks of architectural decoration in all the world.

Maisonneuve's answer was the famous promise of Christ: \"No man hath left house or brethren or sister for my sake but he shall receive a hundredfold.\" Maisonneuve was warned there would be no earthly reward--no pay--for his arduous task; but he answered, \"I devote my life and future; and I expect no recompense.\" Mademoiselle Jeanne Mance, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old, who had given herself to good works from childhood, though she had not yet joined the cloister, now felt the call to labor in the wilderness. Later, in 1653, came Marguerite Bourgeoys to the little colony beneath the mountain. She too, like Jeanne Mance, distrusted dreams and visions and mystic communings, cherishing a religion of good works rather than introspection of the soul. Dauversiere and Olier remained in France.

Instead of the little penny sheet of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years ago, \"The New York Herald\" of to-day is an immense journal, generally of twelve, and often of sixteen pages of six columns each, making a total of from seventy-two to ninety-six closely printed columns of matter.

Their displacements ranged from 17,250 to 28,000 tons, and their speeds from 25 to 30 knots, the last being that of the _Tiger_. Their speed is their greatest feature, for their armament and batteries are much lighter than those of the first-line ships. Next, there were ready <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> high-speed cruisers of quite light armament and armor. There were six of the _Cressy_ type, four of the _Drake_ type, nine of the same type as the _Kent_, six of the same class as the _Antrim_, six like the _Black Prince_, three of the same class as the _Shannon_, together with seventeen heavily protected cruisers, of which the _Edgar_ was the prototype.

The common people had their turn, when, a few years later, under a new king, the prohibitory law was repealed and a new May-pole, the highest ever in England (one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet), was set up in the Strand, London, with great pomp. But the English people were fast outgrowing the sport, and the customs have been dying out ever since. Now, a very few May-poles in obscure villages are all that can be found.

Who ever heard of a war which, in two months, destroyed _two-thirds_ of the capital of a nation, and subjected <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> millions of men to the despotism of two hundred thousand armed janizaries in the capital, as the recent revolution has done in France? Delivered by the firmness of our government, and the spirit of our people--by the wisdom which centuries of freedom has diffused, and the habits which wide-spread and long-continued prosperity have rendered general--from the immediate dangers of a similar convulsion, it well becomes us to take advantage of the breathing time thus afforded,...", "...them so as to reach the shore.

Single monsters may be autositic, or independent of another embryo or foetus; or they may be omphalositic, that is, dependent upon another embryo or foetus, which is commonly well developed, and which supplies blood for both through the umbilical vessels.

The first order of autositic single monsters contains four genera with eight species, and under these species are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> varieties. They may have imperfect limbs, no limbs, one eye in the middle of the forehead (_cyclops_), fused lower limbs (_siren_), and so on. Some of these monsters show a strong resemblance to lower animals, but there is no record that is in any degree scientific of a hybrid between a human being and a lower animal.

Not till Napoleon's huge fighting-flight, a Hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years after, did I read of such a transaction in those parts.

The allies had then in battery more than eight hundred pieces of artillery.

At present the letters A-E, G-H are catalogued; and the extent to which the whole Catalogue will run may be estimated from the fact that the letters B, C, and G fill sixty, sixty-five, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> volumes respectively.

It is not easy to describe what a graceful and brilliant creature he seemed to my boyish eyes, when I first saw him in 1867, nor how unlike what one had imagined a Head-master to be. He was then just <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> and looked much younger than he was. Gracefulness is the idea which I specially connect with him. He was graceful in shape, gesture, and carriage; graceful in manners and ways, graceful in scholarship, graceful in writing, pre-eminently graceful in speech.

So Ernest brought no troops, but he brought six hundred and seventy gentlemen, pages, and cooks, and five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> horses, not to charge upon the rebellious Dutchmen withal, but to draw coaches and six.

Its records yet remain, an evidence that it was a pleasant, active, high-principled association of literary men, laboring harmoniously to elevate the literary standard of the time, and with a success which may well be regarded as remarkable, considering the little sympathy they received from the community, and the many difficulties with which they had to struggle.\" The publication of the \"Anthology\" began in 1804, when Mr. William Emerson was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of age, and it ceased to be published in the year of his death, 1811. Ralph Waldo Emerson was eight years old at that time. His intellectual life began, we may say, while the somewhat obscure afterglow of the \"Anthology\" was in the western horizon of the New England sky.

Again, in 1814, a barbette battery of one four-pounder and two eighteen-pounder guns at Stonington, repelled a British fleet of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> guns. During the engagement the Americans exhausted their ammunition, and spiked their eighteen-pounders, and only one of them was afterwards used. Two of the enemy's ships, carrying one hundred and twelve guns, were engaged during the whole time of attack, and during much of this time bombarded the town from a position beyond reach of the land-battery.

His _Travels_ relates what he saw and heard in his wanderings through Ethiopia, Persia, Tartary, India, and Cathay.

St. Augustine's father was a pagan, and Monica, his wife, prayed seventeen years for his conversion, and he became a Christian. Just about that time her son Augustine, who was attending school, fell in with bad companions and became a great sinner. She prayed seventeen years more for him, and he reformed, became a great saint and learned bishop in the Church.

To render this conclusion palpable, suppose that Louis the XIV. and XV. had contracted debts in the name of the French nation, to the amount of ten thousand milliards, and that the whole had been contracted in Holland.

Bok decided that, given health and mental freshness, he would say good-by to his public before his public might decide to say good-by to him. So, at forty, he candidly faced the facts of life and began to prepare himself for his retirement at fifty under circumstances that would be of his own making and not those of others. And thereby Edward Bok proved that he was still, by instinct, a Dutchman, and had not in his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years of residence in the United States become so thoroughly Americanized as he believed. However, it was an American, albeit of Dutch extraction, one whom he believed to be the greatest American in his own day, who had set him thinking and shown him the way.

His father was governor of this town under the Earl of Huntingdon, when he was President of the North. His mother, Winifred, was a devout Puritan, and he was from infancy intended for the Church. In 1589, at the age of fifteen, Joseph Hall was sent to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was maintained at the cost of an uncle. He passed all his degrees with...", "...recovered his composure, and, fixing his keen eyes on Chief Justice Marshall, said in that deep tone with which he sometimes thrilled the heart of an audience: 'Sir, I know not how others may feel... but for myself, when I see my Alma Mater surrounded, like Caesar in the Senate house, by those who are reiterating stab after stab, I would not, for my right hand, have her turn to me and say, Et tu quoque mi fili! And thou, too, my son!'\" Whether this extraordinary scene, first described <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years afterward by a putative witness of it, ever really occurred or not, it is today impossible to say. * But at least it would be an error to attribute to it great importance. From the same source we have it that at Exeter, too, Webster had made the judges weep--yet they had gone out and decided against him. Judges do not always decide the way they weep! * Professor Goodrich of Yale, who is responsible for the story, communicated it to Rufus Choate in 1853. It next...", "...year--an insignificant sum. IN BEARING.--Having given the reader an idea of the probable cost of bringing an orchard to bearing age, it may be well also to give the cost of producing apples in a mature apple orchard. Our bearing apple orchard consists of 6.1 acres containing 234 trees. About one-half of the trees, or 110, are 36 years old. The remainder are nearly 50 years of age. As they are all in one block and handled together, the charges cannot well be separated. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> of the trees are Baldwins, 44 Twenty Ounce, 40 Tompkins County Kings, and the remainder odd varieties. For the whole period of ten years the orchard has had very good care and attention. A cover crop was not sown every year, but when it was used the charge was made against the orchard. The manure charge, omitted because of uncertainty as to the exact amount applied and as to its real value, is the only thing lacking in this table. Two or three sprayings have been made...", "...William Shakespeare's birth has usually been taken as three days before his baptism, but there is certainly no evidence of this fact. The family name was variously spelled, the dramatist himself not always spelling it in the same way. While in the baptismal record the name is spelled \"Shakspeare,\" in several authentic autographs of the dramatist it reads \"Shakspere,\" and in the first edition of his works it is printed \"Shakespeare.\" Halliwell tells us, that there are not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> ways in which the various members of the Shakespeare family wrote the name, and in the council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where it is introduced one hundred and sixty-six times during the period that the dramatist's father was a member of the municipal body, there are fourteen different spellings. The modern \"Shakespeare\" is not among them. Shakespeare's father, while an alderman at Stratford, appears to have been unable to write his name, but as at that time...", "...4s. 2d.; at Dr. Francis Bernard's sale (1697), ten for L1, 15s. 4d. There were a considerable number of Caxtons in the Harleian Library, and several of these were duplicates. They do not appear to have sold very readily, and they occur in several of Osborne's catalogues at a fairly uniform price of one guinea for the folios and 15s. for the quartos. At the Hon. Bryan Fairfax's sale (1756) nine Caxtons sold for L33, 4s. At James West's sale (1773) the price had considerably advanced, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> Caxtons realised L361, 4s. 6d.

Are you at leisure now?\" \"Yes, Mr. Turner.\" Philip accompanied his new friend to the neatly furnished room leased by the society. He was so well pleased with its appearance that he thought he should himself like to belong to such an association, whenever he found a permanent home. At present he was only a wanderer. \"Our debt is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> dollars,\" said the secretary. \"You may not think it large, but it's large for us.\" \"I hope our entertainment will enable you to clear it off.\" \"If it should it will give us new courage.\" On the evening of the next day Philip and the professor entered the hall engaged for the entertainment, and took seats on the platform.

On the north the downs end abruptly in a steep and rock-bound coast. Here is a wonderful cavern known as \"Piper's Hole,\" which penetrates inland for a distance of above two hundred feet. To enter it one has first to descend an iron ladder fixed to the rock, and then to clamber, bent double, along a dark passage, over large stone boulders, worn smooth by the action of the waves. At length the passage opens out into a cavern <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> feet high--plenty of room to stand upright now! Here there is a large pool of fresh water, on which a boat is kept during the summer, so that one can be ferried across it and land on the smooth beach of white sand at the far end of the cave. It used to be said that this Piper's Hole communicated by a passage under the sea with the small and insignificant cave of the same name on St. Mary's; that men had entered there and never returned; but that dogs had successfully...", "...except the city of London.

I believe nothing but such assistance, and the excitement of the contest, could have enabled me to support the toil. The amount of matter laid before the Committee may be judged of when I say that my examination-in-chief occupies a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> pages in the folio Blue Book (equal to two volumes of an ordinary novel), and engaged the whole time of the Committee at six consecutive sittings. The heaviest part of the work was in the beginning, as then my time for preparation was briefest, while, as it fell out, the mass of matter was largest--ninety-five of the hundred and thirty-four pages being taken up with the proceedings of the first four days. After having restated the principal features of my plan,...", "...theirs?

Again the \"Constitution's\" good luck seemed to justify the sailors' belief, for at noon she ran into a group of vessels. The first vessel was sighted on the larboard bow, and, as the frigate overhauled her, proved to be a full-rigged ship. Soon after a second sail, also a ship, was sighted; and a few minutes more sufficed to show that both were men-of-war. The one first sighted was the frigate-built corvette \"Cyane,\" of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> guns; and the second was the sloop-of-war \"Levant,\" of twenty-one guns. For either of these vessels singly, the \"Constitution,\" with her fifty-two guns and crew of four hundred and fifty men, was more than a match. Yet to attack the two was a bold movement, and this Stewart determined to undertake. Hardly had the character of the strangers been made out, when the corvette was seen making signals to the sloop; and the two vessels, then about ten miles apart, made all sail to...", "...accompanied by an apology for both the matter and the manner. Perhaps such an apology is more necessary now than it was then; but the warm reception given to the book on all sides--by literary critics, as well as by ethnologists and students of folk-lore, in this country and in Europe--has led the author to believe that a volume embodying everything, or nearly everything, of importance in the oral literature of the negroes of the Southern States, would be as heartily welcomed. The <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> legends in the first volume were merely selections from the large body of plantation folk-lore familiar to the author from his childhood, and these selections were made less with an eye to their ethnological importance than with a view to presenting certain quaint and curious race characteristics, of which the world at large had had either vague or greatly exaggerated notions. The first book, therefore, must be the excuse and apology for the present volume. Indeed, the...", "...nearly one ton each--seventeen hundredweight to be precise. They were mounted in specially constructed gun-pits amongst the sand-hills close behind the shore, and were so well hidden that they could not be seen from a distance of little more than a single gun's length. The projectiles stood over six feet high and were murderous-looking instruments of warfare. These particular guns, and there were others of a like nature, could probably have ranged up to sixty thousand yards (over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> land miles). The whole area off this section of the coast, up to about twenty miles to seaward, was included in the danger zone of the coast batteries. No vessel could maintain her position in that area, under ordinary conditions of visibility, for more than a few minutes at the outside limit. The reader may consider, however, that a ship desiring to attack the coast would merely have to approach in foggy weather or under cover of darkness. In foggy weather she would...", "...to find a sleeping-room for a single night on first arriving here. Tijuca, situated in the hills a few miles from the city, is perhaps the most desirable place of temporary sojourn for the newly arrived traveler, who will find at least one large and comfortable public house there, favorably known to travelers as Whyte's Hotel. It is some little distance from the city, but is easily reached by tramway, which takes one to the foot of the hills of the Tijuca range, whose tallest peak is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hundred feet above tide-water. This place abounds in attractive villas, tropical vegetation, and beautiful flowers, both wild and cultivated. From here also one gets a most charming view of the distant city, the famous bay, and the broad Atlantic; indeed, the view alone will repay one for making this brief excursion. The loftiest village in these hills is called Boa Vista. There are mountains, however, on either side, which are five or six hundred feet higher than the...", "...and those of the fourgon following closely behind, are changed at the post-stations, as well as the driver, who leaves us, after carefully removing his saddle from the box and the harness of the horses. He has to ride back to his point of departure with his horses. He expects a present of two krans,--or more if he can get it--and so does the driver of the fourgon. Two krans is the recognised tip for each driver, and as one gets some sixteen or seventeen for each vehicle,--thirty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> if you have two conveyances,--between Resht and Teheran, one finds it quite a sufficient drain on one's exchequer.

We have risen 262 feet at Kudum from 77 feet, the altitude of Resht, and as we travel...", "...and Josepha Blazek and the Maids, we have 10 cases, of which 9 were girls. Again, several of the pygopagous twins, of whom there are scientific records, survived birth and lived for a number of years, and thus resembled the Biddenden terata. Helen and Judith, for instance, were twenty-three years old at death; and the North Carolina twins, although born in 1851, are still alive. There is, therefore, nothing inherently improbable in the statement that the Biddenden Maids lived for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years. With regard also to the truth of the record that the one Maid survived her sister for six hours, there is confirmatory evidence from scientifically observed instances, for Joly and Peyrat (Bull. de l'Acad. Med., iii., pp. 51 and 383, 1874) state that in the case seen by them the one infant lived ten hours after the death of the other. It is impossible to make any statement with regard to the internal structure of the Maids or to the characters of their genital...", "...ran on Sundays only. After a time the train was run on Mondays also.

The train, however, travelled at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles per hour, including a halt at Redhill, no small achievement at that time.

The subject for the artists was the sacrifice of Isaac; and the competitors were required to observe in their work a certain conformity to the first bronze gate of the baptistery, executed by Andrea Pisano about 100 years previously. Of the six designs presented by different Italian artists, those of Donatello, Brunelleschi and Ghiberti were pronounced the best, and of the three Brunelleschi's and Ghiberti's superior to the third, and of such equal merit that the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> judges with whom the decision was left entrusted the execution of the work to the joint labour of the two friends. Brunelleschi, however, withdrew from the contest. The first of his two bronze gates for the baptistery occupied Ghiberti twenty years. Ghiberti brought to his task a deep religious feeling and the striving after a high poetical ideal which are not to be found in the works of Donatello, though in power of characterization the second sculptor often stands...", "...and not the florid and beautiful Meat Market; but the painter Frans Hals, whose masterpieces hang in the Town Hall. I have called Hals the glory of Haarlem, yet he was only an adopted son, having been born in Antwerp about 1580. But his parents were true Haarlemers, and Frans was a resident there before he reached man's estate. The painter's first marriage was not happy; he was even publicly reprimanded for cruelty to his wife. In spite of the birth of his eldest child just <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> weeks earlier than the proprieties require, his second marriage seems to have been fortunate enough. Some think that we see Mynheer and Myvrouw Hals in the picture--No. 1084 in the Ryks Museum--which is reproduced on the opposite page. If this jovial and roguish pair are really the painter and his wife, they were a merry couple. Children they had in abundance; seven sons, five of whom were painters, and three daughters. Abundance indeed was Hals' special characteristic; you...", "...or three inches more than when in the press. To press and bale expeditiously requires at least four or five hands and one horse. When the box has been sufficiently filled, generally eight or nine feet deep, the men bring down the beam by turning the screws with hand levers as long as they can turn them; then a large lever is placed in the screw, with a strong horse attached to one end, and a few turns of the screws by the horse bring the beam down to the proper point, within thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> inches of the sill. The requisite number of hands will put up and bale with a common press about ten or twelve bales a day, by pushing. After the bales are properly put up, the next thing is to mark and number them on one end. For this purpose a plate of copper, with the initials, or such mark as is fancied, cut in it, is applied to the end of the bale and the letters and figures painted through it with black marking ink.

Born on December 8, 1742, he had received his first commission in the militia at the age of thirteen, and from there had been transferred to the line. His war service was not inconsiderable, including three campaigns in Hanover, one in Portugal, and one in Italy; he had been wounded as far back as the action of Wartburg in 1760, but...", "...economical access to the cities of China, thus breaking down the barrier which separates the principal manufacturing centers of the United States from the markets of the vast population of Asia, and placing the Eastern States of the Union for all purposes of trade midway between Europe and Asia.

On the other hand, the comparative study of the embryology of the lower and higher animals led me <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years ago to the opposite conclusion, that a simple gastric sac was the first and oldest organ of all the metazoa, and that all the different forms of it had been developed from this primitive type. I gave this view in my _Biology of the Sponges_ in 1872; and I developed and established it in my _Studies of the Gastraea Theory_ in 1873. In the latter book I also worked out the important conclusions that follow from this monistic reform of the theory of germinal layers for...", "...the thought to him, \"if there is anything worthy the absurdity of life it's a newspaper--gibbering, whining, strutting, sprawled in attitudes of worship before the nine-and-ninety lies of the moment--a caricature of absurdity itself.\" His efficiency aloof from such moralizing moved like a separate consciousness through the day, as it had for the sixteen years of his service.

We will state briefly the proofs, as they now appear, of the existence of a race of human beings on this earth in an immense antiquity. A French gentleman, M. Boucher de Perthes, has for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years been devoting his time and his fortune, with rare perseverance, to the investigation of certain antiquities in the later geological deposits in the North of France. His first work, \"Les Antiquites Celtiques and Antediluviennes,\" published in 1847, was received with much incredulity and opposition; a second, under the same title, in 1857, met with a scarce better reception, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he could induce even the _savans_ of his own...", "...one point it looks exactly like a ship upside down.\" \"I'll bet it is, and a very good name for it.\" The diminutive chapel of Chilcombe stood in a farmyard beside a lofty knoll of trees. It was a stout little place of early English architecture, lifted high above the surrounding country and having a free horizon of sea and land. It consisted of a chancel, nave and south porch. Its bell cote held one bell; and within was a Norman font, a trefoil headed piscina, and sitting room for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> people. \"Isn't it a darling little church?\" asked Estelle, her voice sunk to a whisper; and Raymond nodded and said that it was 'ripping.' Then they examined the medieval treasure of the reredos--a panel of cedar wood, some ten feet in length, that surmounted the altar. It was set in a deep oaken frame, and displayed two circular drawings with an oblong picture in the midst.

Exception has frequently been taken to the anthropological classifications of different authors, from the time of F.

In all sciences, classifications change in proportion as the facts or objects to be classed become better known. Besides, if we go to the root of the matter we perceive that the diversity in the classifications of the genus _Homo_ is...", "...Lucian, in his _Tragopodagra_, gives an amusing account of the remedies employed for the cure of gout. In all times this disease has engaged a large share of the attention of physicians, from its wide prevalence and from the amount of suffering which it entails. Sydenham, the famous English physician of the 17th century, wrote an important treatise on the subject, and his description of the gouty paroxysm, all the more vivid from his having himself been afflicted with the disease for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years, is still quoted by writers as the most graphic and exhaustive account of the symptomatology of gout. Subsequently Cullen, recognizing gout as capable of manifesting itself in various ways, divided the disease into _regular gout_, which affects the joints only, and _irregular gout_, where the gouty disposition exhibits itself in other forms; and the latter variety he subdivided into _atonic gout_, where the most prominent symptoms are throughout referable to the...", "...into leaf, when Captain Lovewell, with forty-six men, started up the valley of the Merrimac once more. Three of the men, after marching about fifty miles, became lame and returned home. The others turned eastward, passed Lake Winnipiseogee, and came to Ossipee Lake--a beautiful sheet of water. One of the men was taken sick, and could not go on, and Captain Lovewell built a little fort, and left there the surgeon and six men, with a portion of the provisions. The rest of the party, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> in all, shouldered their packs and moved on in search of the Pigwackets. No one knew exactly where their wigwams were located, and they moved cautiously for fear of being surprised. Captain Lovewell was a religious man, and every morning, before starting, the soldiers kneeled or stood reverently with uncovered heads, while the chaplain, Rev. Jonathan Frye, offered prayer.

At first we took them for sailors. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> of the Englishmen, being all that were left of a company of the West Yorkshire Regiment of infantry.

In Colonel Wood's regiment eight had been killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> wounded; in the First Cavalry, seven killed and eight wounded; in the Tenth Cavalry, one killed and ten wounded. The percentage of losses to the whole strength of the several organizations engaged was as follows: Rough Riders, over 8 per cent.; First Cavalry, over 6 per cent.; Tenth Cavalry, 5 per cent. But if we take those on the firing line as the base the rate per cent. of losses among the regulars would be doubled, while that of the volunteers would remain the same....", "...and unobtrusive in his demeanor.

Was there a special prayer for a servant leaving her household after eighteen--no, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years' faithful duty; and if there was not, could he weave in a couple of sentences among the petitions? At half-past six he was certain that he could not, and was ashamed at the thought that with that well worn prayer-book of Margaret's before him he would allow her to depart without a benediction, when he was visited quite suddenly, he declares, with the most brilliant inspiration of his life.

At first but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> hands appeared; but the moderator having counted these, he looked round the crowd, until he fairly looked up three more; after which he honestly enough announced the vote to be thirty-seven for the Congregationalists.

James Marye was succeeded in the rectorship by his son, Rev. James Marye, Jr., who was rector for eleven years. From 1780, when the second James Marye closed his labors, to 1813 the church had many rectors, but their stay was of short duration.

He was invited to soirees by the prefect, by the archbishop, by the various social circles, as well as by the workmen's associations. They vied with each other for the honour of entertaining him. He went from matinees to soirees, and in ten days he appeared at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> different entertainments.

It was one of the most remarkable things about Jasmin, that he was never carried off his feet by the brilliant...", "...Alkohm, in fact, was a romancist of the first water. Perhaps the strongest argument against the theory that the pyramids were intended as strongholds for the concealment of treasure, resides in the fact that, search being made, no treasure has been discovered.

In conclusion, I may remark that the present publication embraces a period of fourteen years, extending from the accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria in 1837 to the _coup d'etat_ of Napoleon III. in 1851. The latest events recorded in these pages are separated from us by an interval of about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years. The occurrences which took place after the close of 1851, the subsequent establishment of the Imperial power in France, the formation of the Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen, followed in 1853 by the Crimean War, mark an important epoch in the history of this country and of Europe. I have therefore thought that this date is the appropriate conclusion of this portion of the work.

The session of 1900 was a fairly active one, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> measures being passed.

In 1864 the Public School Commissioners recommended that the school should be removed into the country. It was not easy, however, to get those in authority to consent to so great a change. Sentiment was aroused against a plan which broke long years of tradition, and it was not till 1872 that the school was moved to its present site at Godalming.

Dr. Haig Brown was appointed headmaster in 1863, and it was owing to his clear-sightedness and energy that this migration was accomplished.

Some years ago a college president tested a class of thirty-four men with a score of extracts from Tennyson, each of which contained a Scriptural allusion, none of them obscure. The replies were suggestive and quite appalling. Tennyson wrote, in the \"Supposed Confessions\": \"My sin was a thorn among the thorns that girt Thy brow.\" Of these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> young men nine of them did not understand that quotation. Tennyson wrote: \"Like Hezekiah's, backward runs The shadow of my days.\" Thirty-two of the thirty-four did not know what that meant. The meaning of the line, \"For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine,\" was utterly obscure to twenty-two of the thirty-four. One of them said it was a reference to \"good opportunities given but not improved.\" Another said it was equivalent to the counsel \"not...", "...data. It is said to have been called the 'Old Oak' at the time of William the Conqueror, but upon what authority I could never learn. Nevertheless, the thing is not impossible, if the speculations of certain writers on the age of trees be at all correct.

Now, an inscription on a brass plate affixed to the Winfarthing Oak gives us the following as its dimensions:--'This oak, in circumference, at the extremities of the roots, is seventy feet; in the middle, forty feet, 1820.' Now, I see no reason, if the size of the rind is to be any criterion of age, why the Winfarthing should not, at least, equal the Bentley oak; and if so, it would be upwards of seven hundred years old at the Conquest; an age...", "...port we were in search of, we attempted to turn into it, the wind being right out; but as it blew in violent squalls from this high land, one of these took us just after we had put in stays, payed the ship off again, and before she wore round, she was within a few yards of being driven against the rocks to leeward.

The result was the celebrated league of Venice. It was signed the last day of March, 1495, on the part of Spain, Austria, Rome, Milan, and the Venetian republic. The ostensible object of the treaty, which was to last twenty-five years, was the preservation of the estates and rights of the confederates, especially of the Roman see. A large force, amounting in all to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> thousand horse and twenty thousand foot, was to be assessed in stipulated proportions on each of the contracting parties. The secret articles of the treaty, however, went much further, providing a formidable plan of offensive operations.

The attack as planned, therefore, differed from that executed (1) in that the lee line was not to advance in column, but in line, thereby dispersing the enemy's fire, and avoiding the terrific concentration which crushed the leaders at Trafalgar; and (2) in that the weather squadrons were not to attack simultaneously with the lee, but after it had engaged, in order to permit the remedying of any mishap that might arise in delivering the crucial...", "...session for fifteen hours.

At daybreak, the northermost land bore from us W.S.W. and seemed to end in a point, from which we discovered a reef running out to the northward as far as we could see. We had hauled our wind to the westward before it was light, and continued the course till we saw the breakers upon our lee-bow. We now edged away N.W. and N.N.W. along the east side of the shoal, from two to one mile distant, having regular soundings from thirteen to seven fathom, with a fine sandy...", "...and the command fell to Lieutenant Chads, the first lieutenant, who refused to believe himself beaten. But he could do nothing; his fire ceased, and as the clouds of smoke rolled away they disclosed on the one hand a dismasted wreck, and on the other a frigate sound and whole, except for some slight damage to her spars and rigging. So there was nothing left for him but surrender.

This report of the War Department showed that the distance between Columbus and Vandalia was three hundred and thirty-four miles and the estimated cost of completing the road that far would be $4,732,622.83, of which $1,120,320.01 had been expended and $3,547,894.83 remained to be expended in order to finish the road to that extent according to plans then in operation; that after its completion it would require an annual expenditure on the three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles of $392,809.71 to keep it in repair, the engineers computing the annual cost of repairs of the portion of the road between Wheeling and Columbus (one hundred and twenty-seven miles) at $99,430.30. On the other hand the estimated cost of a railway from Columbus to Vandalia on the route of the Cumberland Road was $4,280,540.37, and the cost of preservation and repair of such a road, $173,718.25.

In due course Iowa came in as a free State, and Minnesota was given a territorial government, without removing the slavery restriction. Finally, the sole remaining part north of the line--Kansas and Nebraska--was to be organized; and it is proposed, and carried, to blot out the old dividing line of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years' standing, and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery. Now this, to my mind, is manifestly unjust. After an angry and dangerous controversy, the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention. The one party first appropriates her own share, beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it, and then seizes the share of the other party.

It had more acrid and irritable members than the Assembly, and its talkers had sharper tongues. In debate, Foster was the most formidable, but Albert Lester's acerbity of temper fixed the tone of the discussion.

It was a great victory for Seymour, then only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old. Indeed, the history of the session may be described as the passage of a single measure by a single man whose success was based on supreme faith in the Erie canal.

The family type is strong. One of the Pope's nieces might have sat for a portrait of his mother. The extraordinarily clear, pale complexion is also a family characteristic.

Why, the statement of this man Cowperwood made to his creditors at the time of his failure here a few weeks ago showed that he considered himself to be worth over one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and he is only a little over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years old to-day. How much was he worth at the time he first entered business relations with the ex-city treasurer? Have you any idea? I can tell. I had the matter looked up almost a month ago on my accession to office. Just a little over two hundred thousand dollars, gentlemen--just a little over two hundred thousand dollars.

Geologists distinguish three great epochs in the organic history of the earth, as far as we can read it in the monuments of the science of fossils--the primary, secondary, and tertiary epochs. According to a recent calculation, the first occupied at least <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> million, the second eleven million, and the third three million years. The history of the family of vertebrates, from which our own race has sprung, unfolds clearly before our eyes during this long period. Three different stages in the evolution of the vertebrate correspond to the three epochs; the _fishes_ characterized the primary (palaeozoic) age, the _reptiles_ the secondary (mesozoic), and the _mammals_ the tertiary (caenozoic). Of the three groups the fishes rank...", "...row. They start opposite the Brocas, and continue up-stream round \"Rushes,\" and then down-stream to Windsor Bridge. The contention of many is that the length of these races is too great, and that the trial put on boys of perhaps fifteen years of age is too severe. From this view of the matter I differ, for to any one who has rowed over both the Henley and Putney course it will be evident that the forty strokes per minute for a mile and a half would be more trying to a young boy than the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> per minute for four miles. A short note on the proceedings of the wetbobs on the 4th of June, the great day of celebration at Eton, may have some interest. As I have said, a procession of all the boats takes place on this day.

Jean Denys, of Honfleur, visited the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1506, and in 1508 Thomas Aubert sailed eighty leagues up the St. Lawrence River.[4] In 1518 Baron de Lery attempted to establish a colony on Sable Island, and left there some cattle and hogs, which multiplied and proved of advantage to later adventurers. Then followed the great voyage of John Verrazzano, who, in 1524, in a search for the East Indies, sailed up the coast from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> to fifty-four degrees. In 1534 Jacques Cartier visited Newfoundland and advanced up the river St. Lawrence till he reached the western part of Anticosti Island. The next year Cartier came again and ascended the great river many miles, visiting Stadacone (Quebec) and Hochelaga (Montreal). At Quebec he encamped with his men, and, after a winter rendered frightful by the cold and the ravages of the scurvy, he returned in the spring to St. Malo.[5] No further attempt was...", "...supposed he was strengthening the foundations of authority which Catherine II. had loosened. To him is attributed the famous saying, \"Know that the only person of consideration in Russia is the person whom I address, and he only during the time I am addressing him.\" He was a born despot, and his reforms consisted in a return to Prussian methods and to an Oriental servility. The policy he announced was one of peace with Europe--a cessation of those wars by which his mother had for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years been draining the treasury. He was going to turn his conquests toward the East; and vast plans, with vague and indefinite outlines, were forming in the narrow confines of his restless brain.

I did not attempt any live firing--in fact, I have never thought it serves any useful purpose to fire live rifle-grenades in practice.

The country is luxuriance itself, covered with corn and flax, separated by rows of peach and fig trees, with vines leaping from tree to tree. I drove to Arqua, a most picturesque village in a hollow of the hills. In the little court of the church is Petrarch's tomb, of red Verona marble, and on the high ridge his house, almost unaltered, with old frescoes of his life, his chair, his chest, and his stuffed cat, shrunk almost to a...", "...But I too well know, that neither perfect innocence nor consummate prudence are sufficient shields against conspiracy and folly, and that bankrupt fortune and bankrupt character prepare men for the most desperate attempts. I trouble you, my Dear Sir, with a few lines to express the deep sense that I have of regard and esteem for you and the amiable partner of your happiness; for so many as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> years we have been acquainted, and during that time I do not think that I have met any man of such singularly nice feelings of honour and justice. I am sensible that there is some impropriety in this address--but you must excuse it as I snatched this piece of paper the moment I had read the paragraph I allude to--and with tears of indignation in my eyes--aye Sir!--with actual, not...", "...a gleam of illusory sunshine at noon on the third day of the rain-storm and pull out, taking a cursory glance at the Memorial Church as I go. A drenching shower overtakes me in the native military lines, compelling me to seek shelter for an hour beneath the portico of their barracks. The road is perfectly level and smooth, and well rounded, so that the water drains off and leaves it better wheeling than ever; and with alternate showers and sunshine I have no difficulty in covering <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> miles before sunset. This brings me to a caravanserai, consisting of a quadrangular enclosure with long rows of cell-like rooms. The whole structure is much inferior to a Persian caravanserai, but there is probably no need of the big brick structures of Shah Abbas in a winterless country like India. Interesting subjects are not wanting for my camera through the day; but the greatest difficulty is experienced about changing the negatives at night. A small lantern with a...", "...on the north line of section two (2), township eleven (11) south, range thirty-three (33) east; thence westerly on the township line between townships ten (10) and eleven (11) south to the southwest corner of section thirty-five (35), township ten (10) south, range thirty-three (33) east, northerly to the quarter-section corner between sections thirty-five (35) and thirty-four (34), westerly to the center of section thirty-four (34), northerly on a line through the centers of sections <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> (34), twenty-seven (27), and twenty-two (22) to the center of section twenty-two (22), easterly to the center of section twenty-three (23), northerly through the centers of sections twenty-three (23), fourteen (14), and eleven (11) to the center of section eleven (11), easterly to the quarter-section corner between sections eleven (11) and twelve (12), northerly along the section line to the northwest corner of section twelve (12), easterly along the section line to the...", "...the inside of the principal colour and of the principal metal of the arms they accompany, though in a few cases, contrary to the present practice, the metal is outside, the lining being of the colour. Nineteen more of the mantlings are of the principal colour of the arms, the majority (eighteen) of these being lined with ermine. No less than forty-nine are of some colour lined with ermine, but thirty-four of these are of gules lined ermine, and in the large majority of cases in these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-four</span> instances neither the gules nor the ermine are in conformity with the principal colour and metal (what we now term the \"livery colours\") of the arms. In some cases the colours of the mantling agree with the colours of the crest, a rule which will usually be found to hold good in German heraldry. The constant occurrence of gules and ermine incline one much to believe that the colours of the mantling were not decided by haphazard fancy, but that there was some law--possibly..."]
