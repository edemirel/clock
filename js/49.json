In Philadelphia, only three per cent of employment agencies were found in business buildings. Chicago made a little better showing, with nineteen per cent in business houses.

But parsimony is not always economy.

In 1768 Mary Lee sold him two mulattoes (Will and Frank) for L61.15 and L50, respectively; and two boys (negroes), Adam and Frank, for L19 apiece.

A part of one of the choruses is of singular beauty, and it is doubtless to them that the preservation of the play is due. The play hardly seems to be a tragedy, for it ends without bloodshed. Further, it lacks dramatic interest, for the action almost stands still. It is a cantata rather than a tragedy. Both considerations, however, are sufficiently explained by the fact that this was the first play of a trilogy. The remaining plays must have furnished, in the death of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> of the sons of Aegyptus, both action and tragedy in sufficient measure to satisfy the most exacting demands. The 'Seven Against Thebes' deals with the gloomy myth of the house of Laius. The tetralogy to which it belonged consisted of the 'Laius,' 'Oedipus,' 'Seven Against Thebes,' and 'Sphinx.' The themes of Greek tragedy were drawn from the national mythology, but the myths were treated with a free hand.

The calculation concerning this has not been made with precision. [Note 3: Ortelius, in his _Geographia Sacra_, gives the name of Ophir to Hayti; and it was a commonly held opinion that Solomon's mines of Ophir were situated in America. Columbus shared this belief, and he later wrote of Veragua, when he discovered the coasts of Darien, that he was positive the gold mines there were those of Ophir.] [Note 4:...", "...youthful adversary. \"You ought to make an admiral of him,\" he said, and Prince Frederik smiled: \"If I were to make admirals of all my brave officers, I should have no captains or lieutenants left.\" When the _Dannebrog_ drifted on the shoals, abandoned and burning, Willemoes cut his cables and got away under cover of the heavy smoke.

They happened to select me, as their counsel, simply because I was born and brought up within a few miles from their plantation, and had known their people from my infancy.

This remonstrance was not prepared by the Indians. It came wholly from the Rev. Mr. Fish, and the Overseers. It speaks of the \"unprecedented impudence\" of the Indians, and mentions a \"_Traverse Jury_.\" No one who signed it, had any voice in preparing it.

He could not mistake the set of the girl's mind. Not only did brother call to sister, but youth called to youth.

One hundred grains out of one hundred and sixty-one, consist, as we see, in the Cheltenham, of muriate of soda, or common table-salt. Now, this substance, when perfectly freed from other salts adhering to it, possesses comparatively very feeble aperient properties; whereas the mass of the...", "..._Pitt_, Captain Edward Manning, anchored in the cove from England.

This annual payment of L4 for every L100 borrowed covers both principal and interest.

The only result of this ill-timed attack was that two Papal captains and a number of soldiers were killed. Grimani then returned to Corfu, to find Capello irritated to the last extent by the non-appearance of Doria. At last, on September 5th, the Imperial fleet hove in sight. It was composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> galleys, but these were supplemented by a great number of sailing ships; the sailing craft, however, did not arrive till September 22nd. These vessels were gradually making way among the Spaniards since the discovery of the new world. At this time the Venetians possessed fourteen nefs. Doria had augmented these by twenty-two of his own, and the total number of thirty-six was commanded by Franco Doria, a nephew of the admiral.

A half-dozen of his books were written there and, \"Om; the Secret of Ahbor Valley,\" shows the influence of this occult society. He contributed many articles to Tingley's theosophical magazines, her most noted publication being the Theosophical Path. After her death in 1929, Mundy left Point Loma but always retained his interest in and sympathy with Theosophy. Mundy continued writing almost to the time of his death on August 5, 1940. In all, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> books were produced under his name, thirty-nine of which were original works. At least one-hundred and fifty stories and articles appeared in magazines; most of these, perhaps nearly all, are listed in this bibliography.

It is still too soon to properly evaluate Mundy's importance in the stream of literature.

An additional contract (March 13) was then made with Mr. Aspinwall, as president of the Pacific Mail.[GM] This called for the enlargement of the line within a year, to six steamers; and for semi-monthly trips from Panama to Oregon and back, with stops and mail delivery at named points in California; and increased the company's subsidy by one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> thousand two hundred and fifty dollars per annum. Thus the yearly total became three hundred and forty-eight thousand two hundred and fifty dollars. Before the semi-monthly trips were begun, San Diego and Monterey were dropped for the regular service, to be served by a slower line.[GN] Also this year (1851) two more steamers were added to the fleet.

The blushing poetess consented. Mr. Wadsworth pronounced some of them worthy of publication, and, under his auspices, a volume was printed in Hartford, entitled \"Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse.\" The public gave it a generous welcome, and its success led to a career of authorship which lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years, and gave to the world fifty-six volumes of poetry, tales, travels, biography, and letters. So passed her life till she was past twenty-eight. She had received many offers of marriage from clergymen and others, but none of her suitors tempted her to forsake her pupils, and she supposed herself destined to spend her days as an old maid. But another destiny was in store for her.

The Land Bill which Mr. Gladstone introduced as a pendant to the Home Rule Bill of 1886 offered to every Irish landlord the option of selling his estate to his tenants, who would thereby become occupying owners at once, paying an interest of 4 per cent. for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years on the price, which would be twenty years' purchase of the judicial rents, paid by the State issue of fifty million pounds of Consols with the revenues of Ireland as security.

He based his demand upon the fall in prices which prevented tenants from paying judicial rents. By...", "...earmarked for the same purpose in 1888. Lord Randolph Churchill in 1889 expressed the opinion that something like L100,000,000 of credit should be pledged to effect purchase. In 1891 Mr. Balfour authorised the devotion of a further sum of L33,000,000 for this purpose. The whole of the purchase-money was to be advanced by the State by the issue of guaranteed land stock, limited to the amount stated, and giving a dividend at two and three-quarters per cent., repayment being effected in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years by the purchaser by the payment of an annuity on his holding of four per cent. The Act was too complicated to work well, but under its provisions 30,000 sales occurred, in comparison with 25,000 which had been effected under the Acts of 1885 and 1888. The passing of this Act marks the close of the experimental stage in land purchase.

There was a young prince, Dmitri, a child, grandson of Vassili the blind, whose claims to the throne were feared. He was thrown into prison and there forgotten. For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years he had now remained in a damp and dismal dungeon. He had committed no crime. He was accused of no crime. It was only feared that restive nobles might use him as an instrument for the furtherance of their plans. All the years of youth and of manhood had passed in darkness and misery.

The trade centered at Liverpool, and that city's commercial greatness was built largely on this foundation. In 1709 it sent out one slaver of thirty tons' burden; encouraged by Parliamentary subsidies which amounted to nearly half a million dollars between 1729 and 1750, the trade amounted to fifty-three ships in 1751; eighty-six in 1765, and at the beginning of the nineteenth century one hundred and eighty-five, which carried <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> thousand two hundred and thirteen slaves in one year.

Credit of the State was employed to convert the occupiers of Irish farms into the owners of the soil. The policy of the Ashbourne Acts was briefly that any landlord could agree with any tenant on the purchase price of his holding. The State then advanced the credit sum to the landlord in cash, while the tenant paid an instalment of 4 per cent. for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years. It is important to notice that the landlord received cash and that the tenants paid interest at the then existing rate of interest on Consols, namely, 3 per cent. The great defect in these Acts was that they applied only to separate holdings and not to estates as a whole; but their success can be estimated by the fact that under them twenty-seven thousand tenants became owners by virtue of advances which amounted to over ten million pounds. Under Mr. Balfour's Acts of...", "...the Ashbourne Acts, of 1885 and 1889. The method pursued was as follows. Any individual landlord could agree with any individual tenant on the price which he would accept for the extinction of his interest in that tenant's holding. The State facilitated the transaction by advancing that amount to the landlord in _cash_ whenever the holding offered sufficient security, and accepting from the tenant an undertaking to pay an instalment of L4 a year for every L100 advanced over a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years. The instalment comprised L3 for interest, 2_s._ 6_d._ for expenses, and 17_s._ 6_d._ for sinking fund. The loan from the exchequer was secured against individual failures to pay by the realisable value of the holdings. The salient features in this procedure were that the landlord received cash and that the tenant paid interest at the then existing rate on Consols, viz. 3 per cent. Both these features are important. A payment in cash, or its equivalent, is preferable...", "...know _all_ his money affairs; and I'm _certain_ he didn't _buy_ it.'

Willoughby had spent the morning lounging about a sunny rickyard; then, when the heat grew unbearable, he had retreated to an orchard, where, lying on his back in the long cool grass, he had traced the pattern of the apple-leaves diapered above him upon the summer sky; now that the heat of the day was over he had come to roam whither sweet fancy...", "...sleep that knows no waking).

In his campaigns against the French at a later age, he made it his chief merit, \"not that he conquered, but that he was not conquered.\" Saxe entered the army at the early age of twelve, and soon obtained the command of a regiment of horse; at twenty-four he became _marechal-de-camp_, at forty-four marshal of France, and at forty-nine gained the celebrated...", "...Charvati, the modern representative of the 'rich Mycenae.'

Was it suppression in Virginia and natural causes in Massachusetts? Last month Virginia cast sixty-nine per cent of her vote; and Massachusetts, fighting in every district, cast only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> per cent of hers. If Virginia is condemned because thirty-one per cent of her vote was silent, how shall this State escape, in which fifty-one per cent was dumb? Let us enlarge this comparison.

Those familiar with Irish affairs know that after a long agitation several acts have been passed to enlarge the rights of tenants and to secure them a larger share of what they produce. The Act of 1881 reduced the rents and fixed the amount to be paid at a specific annual sum in money for a long term of years; and the subsequent Ashbourne Act (so called from Lord Ashbourne, who introduced it) gave tenants a chance to buy and pay for lands in fixed yearly installments for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years. The intent was to create a peasant ownership somewhat like that of France. It was the end of a long fight, and was supposed to be a great victory and the inauguration of a very great reform.

Owing to the rawness of his troops, the first few days' march was necessarily cautious and cumbersome.

By 1886 it was cut down by the Commissioners to L 1800, and the landlord sold it for L30,000, for which the tenants used to pay four per cent, for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years, to cover principal and interest.

This may give us an idea of the extent of this religious massacre in that island. And though we should suppose that never more than one person is sacrificed on any single occasion at Otaheite, it is more than probable that these occasions happen so frequently, as to make a shocking waste of the human race, for I counted no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> sculls of former victims, lying before the _morai_, where we saw one more added to the number. And as none of those sculls had as yet suffered any considerable change from the weather, it may hence be inferred, that no great length of time had elapsed, since, at least, this considerable number of unhappy wretches had been offered upon this altar of blood.

The ratio in population is not less easily remembered: Scotland has _now_ (October 1843) hard upon three millions of people: Ceylon, by a late census, has just three _half_ millions.

Of course you could cut each strip into seven separate pieces, each piece containing a number, and the puzzle would then be very easy, but I need hardly say that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> pieces is a long way from being the fewest possible. 401.--EIGHT JOLLY GAOL BIRDS.

Among other advantages they had over Latimer was that they were on the ground. They saw Helen daily, at dinners, dances, at the country clubs, in her own drawing-room. Like any sailor from the Charlestown Navy Yard and his sweetheart, they could walk beside her in the park and throw peanuts to the pigeons, and scratch dates and initials on the green benches; they could walk with her up one side of Commonwealth Avenue and down the south bank...", "...And my love says to me: 'Don't send me there again to have the door shut in my face. Keep me with you to be your inspiration, to help you to live worthily.' And so it shall be.\" When Helen read that letter she did not know what to do. She did not know how to answer it. Her first impression was that suddenly she had grown very old, and that some one had turned off the sun, and that in consequence the world had naturally grown cold and dark. She could not see why the two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> expected her to keep on doing exactly the same things she had been doing with delight for six months, and indeed for the last six years. Why could they not see that no longer was there any pleasure in them?

He said that he would always love her, but how could she now know that? Why might not this letter...", "...For, in his own State, he was an \"Insurgent\" making a fight, the outcome of which was expected to show what might follow throughout the entire West. When he won his fight much more was written about him, and he became a national figure. In his own State the people hailed him as the next governor, promised him a seat in the Senate. To Helen this seemed to take him further out of her life. She wondered if now she held a place even in his thoughts. At Fair Harbor the two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> used to joke with her about her politician. Then they considered Latimer of importance only because Helen liked him. Now they discussed him impersonally and over her head, as though she were not present, as a power, an influence, as the leader and exponent of a new idea. They seemed to think she no longer could pretend to any peculiar claim upon him, that now he belonged to all of them. Older men would say to her: \"I hear you know Latimer?

Letters sometimes take <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days to get to England, and telegrams are _always_ kept a fortnight before being sent. We have had great difficulty about the ambulance cars, as they all got frozen into the river at Archangel; however, as you will see from the newspapers, there isn't a great deal going on yet. I do hope you and all the family are safe and sound. I wired to ---- for her birthday to ask news of you all, and I prepaid the reply, but, of course, none came, so I am sure she never got the wire....", "...to control or guide them--merely at the delicately expressed wish of her Majesty--thousands of charming, wealthy, and influential women would waste spare hour upon hour and expend small fortunes of pocket-money in keeping uncomfortable things comfortably going in their accustomed grooves. It was calculated that the Queen's patronage had the immediate effect of trebling the subscription list of any charity, while the mere withdrawal of her name spelt bankruptcy. Her Majesty was patron to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> charities and subscribed to all of them. For the five largest she appeared annually on a crimson-covered platform, insuring thereby a large supply of silk purses containing contributions, and a full report in the press of all the speeches.

On the panel, in five long columns, were the name plates of every cadet quartered in the dormitory and beside each plate were two words, IN and OUT, with a small tab that fitted over one of the words. Out of the one hundred and fifty cadets in the dormitory, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> were marked IN. The slender, blond-haired cadet quickly made it unanimous, reaching up to the tab next to the name of Roger Manning and sliding it over to cover the word OUT. With a last final look around, he raced up the slidestairs, smiling in secret triumph. In Room 512 on the fifth floor of the dormitory, Tom Corbett and Astro, the two other cadets who, with Roger Manning, made up the famed _Polaris_ unit of the Space Cadet Corps, were deep in their studies.

Troubles came thick and fast. The slave dealer who had beaten Lundy now attacked young Garrison. Carelessly worded criticisms of a Northern slave dealer from Garrison's own town of Newburyport led to a suit for libel, and a fine of fifty dollars; neither man could raise the money to pay the fine, and Garrison went to jail for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days. But the youth was full of courage and faith, and in 1831 we find him once more in Boston, starting a new paper, that was, if possible, more radical than ever. In this second venture he was alone, his office was a garret, his only helper a negro boy whom he had freed. His paper was called the _Liberator_, and the first edition appeared in January, 1831. Garrison registered his sublime vow in his opening editorial: \"I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as...", "...which Russia furnished, for we frequently find in the bills of mortality of this country for a single year, twice the number of centenarians.

In command of this army of invasion was General McDowell, held to be the most scientific general in the North. To supplement Beauregard's weakness as a commanding General in case of emergency, Joseph E.

To this, however, there was apparently, at least, one exception. Prices rose steadily from the beginning of the war. This was true not merely of unimportant articles, or those which, by the exercise of a more severe economy, could be in part dispensed with. The cost of the necessaries of life doubled. Wheat rose from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> shillings per quarter in 1797 to one hundred and forty shillings in 1813; while the beef which was sold in Smithfield market, at the beginning of the war, at three shillings per stone, constantly advanced in price, until the same quantity in 1814 could only be bought for six shillings.

Let us see. Virginia--a State now under fierce assault for this alleged crime--cast in 1888 seventy-five per cent. of her vote, Massachusetts, the State in which I speak, sixty per cent. of her vote. Was it suppression in Virginia and natural causes in Massachusetts? Last month Virginia cast sixty-nine per cent. of her vote, and Massachusetts, fighting in every district, cast only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> per cent. of hers. If Virginia is condemned because thirty-one per cent. of her vote was silent, how shall this State escape in which fifty-one per cent. was dumb? Let us enlarge this comparison.

Harmony seemed to be restored, and to establish it a festival of confederation was...", "...that there was only one district of boroughs in that county, although its population exceeded 100,000. The rest of the twenty-three, he continued, were given to the large towns to which the late bill gave one representative each. The consequence of all this was, that there would be only thirty boroughs in schedule B, instead of forty-one, and that in schedule C. instead of twelve members, there would be forty-two: instead of ninety-six places, as by the old bill, there would be only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> returning one representative each. His lordship next proceeded to the ten-pound qualification clause. As it stood in the last bill, he said, the right of voting in boroughs was to be enjoyed by occupiers of houses assessed to the house-duty, or poor-rates at ten pounds, or rented, or of the annual value of the same; but then this right was afterwards limited thus:--that no one whose landlord compounded for the rates should be entitled to vote unless he claimed to be rated in...", "...of failure, return to their original situation. His lordship then stated his various objections to the proposed bill; but, in conclusion, intimated his intention of voting for the second reading, in the hope that it might be brought into a better state in committee. The Marquis of Clanricarde, Lord Brougham, and the Marquis of Westmeath opposed the bill; and Lord Radnor and the Earl of Devon supported it. On a division the second reading was carried by a majority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> against twenty. In committee, Earl Fitzwilliam moved an am end-mend to the forty-first clause, by which he limited the relief under the bill to age, bodily infirmity, &c.; and he was supported by Lord Fitzgerald and Vesci, who contended that the operations of the bill would be mischievous; but it was not carried. On the 31st the latter noble lord moved another amendment, empowering the guardians to relieve in poor-houses \"all destitute persons who are either incurably lame,...", "...and consistency. Lord Melbourne vehemently disclaimed, on the part of himself and colleagues, the least desire to abolish the Jamaican constitution, or to interfere with the rights of the people either in this country or in any of the colonies. What they had done had been done with deep regret and reluctance; and it was with the utmost unwillingness that they made both the previous and present propositions. On a division, the first clause was expunged by a majority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> against eighty. Lord Brougham then moved an amendment to the second clause, limiting the power of the governor with regard to the renewal of money-bills; but was prevailed upon to postpone the discussion till Thursday, on which day, the other clauses having passed, it was agreed that the report should be brought up. When the order of the day for bringing up the report was read, his lordship moved as a proviso, \"that nothing herein contained shall enable the said governor,...", "...him, he was ordered to withdraw; when Lord John Russell moved that John Joseph Stockdale, having brought an action against Messrs.

Lord John Russell then moved, that John Joseph Stockdale, for the said breach of privilege, be committed to the custody of the sergeant-at-arms, and that the speaker do issue his warrant for the committal. After a brief discussion, this was carried by a large majority; and on the next day the sheriffs and bailiffs were called in, and, after examination, ordered to attend on the following Monday.

The second reading of the Irish municipal corporations bill was moved on the 14th of February in the commons by Viscount Morpeth. It was carried by a majority of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> against fourteen; and the house, on the 24th of February, went into committee on the bill, when several amendments were proposed and negatived. The bill was read a third time in the commons on the 9th of March; but the second reading was not moved in the lords until the 4th of May. The Earl of Winchilsea moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months, which amendment was supported by the Marquis of Westmeath; but the Duke of Wellington recommended their...", "...the postponement of the time at which the employment of females should cease until the 1st of March next; the abandonment of a clause for regulating the hours during which children should be employed; the restricting the term of apprenticeship in any mine or colliery to eight years instead of entire prohibition; and the enacting that no boy be apprenticed under ten years of age. Several noble lords spoke for and against the measure; but the motion for going into committee was carried by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> against three. In committee several amendments were successively proposed by Lords Beaumont, Littleton, Skelmersdale, Dunmore, and Mount Cashel; but they were all rejected, and the several clauses were agreed to, with some verbal amendments, and the bill reported. The third reading was opposed by Lord Londonderry, but without success; and the bill passed. The amendments were subsequently agreed to in the commons. BRIBERY AT ELECTIONS.

On a division, it was carried by a majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> against thirty-seven; but though the second reading was thus carried, a difficulty arose in another quarter, which frustrated the endeavours of the friends of North Wales to preserve the integrity of its episcopate.

M. de Lamarck, then <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years old, accepted this change in his scientific studies to take charge of that which everybody had neglected; because it was, indeed, a heavy load, this branch of natural history, where, with so varied relations, everything was to be created.

He promised, \"in accord with the desires of the President,\" as he put it, to increase black participation in the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and his superior, the Chief of Naval Personnel, started a program in the bureau for that purpose.[16-62] With the help of the National Urban League, Heinz arranged a series of lectures by black officers at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> black schools and other institutions to interest Negroes in the Navy's reserve officers program.

He recognized that it was impossible to establish an accredited twelve-grade system at the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> installations, yet at the same time he considered it \"incompatible with military requirements\" to assign black servicemen with children to areas where only integrated schools were available.

She was obliged to receive the united congratulations of the school, to accept, with feigned surprise, the present which was offered her, and to say a few appropriate words of appreciation and thanks.

He lost no time in sending messengers to all the cities, and making known to the whole people of Greece that Prince Jason, the son of King AEson, was going in quest of the Fleece of Gold, and he desired the help of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> of the bravest and strongest young men alive, to row his vessel and share his dangers. And Jason himself would be the fiftieth. At this news the adventurous youths all over the country began to bestir themselves.

And now I solicit your majesty's permission to encounter the dragon, that I may take down the Golden Fleece from the tree and depart with my <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> comrades.\" King AEetes scowled and looked very angry and excessively disturbed; for he knew that, in accordance with his kingly promise, he ought now to permit Jason to win the fleece if his courage and skill should enable him to do so.

At sight of the glorious radiance of the Golden Fleece, the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> heroes gave a mighty shout, and Orpheus, striking his harp, sang a song of triumph, to the cadence of which the galley flew over the water, homeward bound, as if careering along with wings!

On the 17th of December their preparations for a fresh start were completed.

Their party consisted of ninety-six souls, including Johann Schmidt and the faithful black Richarn, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> well-armed men. Khartoum was a nest of slave-traders, who looked with jealous eyes upon every stranger venturing within the precincts of their holy land, and, as Mr Baker observes: \"sacred to slavery and to every abomination and villainy that man can commit.\" The Turkish officers pretended to discountenance slavery; at the same time every house was full of slaves, and Egyptian officers received a portion of their pay in slaves.

But we are anticipating the events of our deeply interesting and melancholy history.

It will be thus seen, that in justice the honour should be awarded to Captain Collinson and his followers, equally with Captain McClure and his, of having discovered the North-West Passage. Indeed, it is believed that it is only by the way he came, if any passage is practicable, that a ship could get round from the east to the west. On the 10th August the _Enterprise_ once more put to sea, steering westward. The Straits were found free of ice till they were...", "...up clearvoyants.

Under the Taylor administration, Young received an appointment as assistant treasurer in New York City--the office given to William C.

It is simply an immense, large inclosed square, of some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> acres. On each side of this square there is a huge mass of ruins, and another in the center. In our next illustration we have a portion of the wall surrounding the ruins on the south side of the supposed temple. This is the largest of the group of ruins. The walls are seventy feet high; the area at the top is over five acres. Here, again, we notice the same mysterious feature already referred to, for \"on the top of this were also discernible the outlines of large square...", "...as large as the sun, but invisible, both because of its proximity to that star and because it yields no light, and revolving in a plane horizontal to our line of sight. The period of revolution is identical with the period of Algol's cycle of variation, and the diminution of light is caused by the interposition of the dark body as it sweeps along that part of its orbit lying between our point of view and the disk of Algol. In other words, once in every two days twenty hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> minutes Algol, as seen from the earth, undergoes a partial eclipse. In consequence of the great comparative mass of its dark companion, Algol itself moves in an orbit around their common center with a velocity quite sufficient to be detected by the shifting of the lines in its spectrum. By means of data thus obtained the mass, size, and distance apart of Algol and its singular comrade have been inferred. The diameter of Algol is believed to be about 1,125,000 miles, that...", "...for giving his fish away, when the Czar would have paid a good price for it.

I have been informed that nurserymen who raise seed for sale do not separate their plants; accordingly I procured seed of eighteen named varieties; of these, eleven varieties produced sixty-two plants all perfectly true to their kind; and seven produced <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> plants, half of which were true and half false. Mr. Masters of Canterbury has given me a more striking case; he saved seed from a great bed of twenty-four named varieties planted in closely adjoining rows, and each variety reproduced itself truly with only sometimes a shade of difference in tint. Now in the hollyhock the pollen, which is abundant, is matured and nearly all shed before the stigma of the same flower is ready to receive it;[231] and...", "...1893, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company failed, a break in the stock market followed, and an old-fashioned panic seized the country in its grasp.

At the end of the ninth year we have seen that each plant would not be able to get its full square foot of ground, and at the end of another year it would have to share that space with fifty others the produce of the seeds which it would give off. What, then, takes place? Every plant grows up, flourishes, occupies its square foot of ground, and gives off its fifty seeds; but notice this, that out of this number only one can come to anything; there is thus, as it were, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> chances to one against its growing up; it depends upon the most fortuitous circumstances whether any one of these fifty seeds shall grow up and flourish, or whether it shall die and perish.

An Irish tenant even when voluntarily leaving his farm must be compensated by the landlord for all improvements made by himself or his predecessors, or must be permitted to sell his improvements to the incoming tenant.

Andros at this time was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years old; he was a soldier by training and a man of considerable experience in positions requiring executive ability. His career had been an honorable one, and no charges involving his honesty, loyalty, or personal conduct had ever been entered against him.

He was, however, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years of age before he became known in the literary world. He then published a French translation of Tasso's \"Jerusalem,\" which brought him much fame; and many of the contributors to the French Encyclopaedia appear to have associated with him, and courted his friendship. He was afterwards elected a member of the French Academy of which he became the Secretary in 1742.

Its banks, unlike those of the former channel, were clothed with excellent grass; a pleasing sight for the cattle--and it was no slight satisfaction to their possessors to see the jaded animals, after thirsting so long among the muddy holes of the Lachlan, drinking at this full and flowing stream.

Again should it ever come to pass that the preacher lose interest in those before whom he stands, and this has been known to occur, there will remain small reason to listen to him for preaching of the sort we most desire. May it not be possible that \"the sermon-box\" is responsible for much of the dulness we deplore.

There may be some who have not this power, but who faithfully toil to prove the truth of the dictum. It was such a good sermon and went so well when we preached it the first few times, the while our hearts were fired by the truth it taught. So we whispered to ourselves as we turned over the contents of that precious box.

Such an assertion is quite incorrect, as may be ascertained by a careful examination of the rainfall of other localities; although, as in all hilly districts, we must, on account of the attraction of the hills, expect a somewhat larger rainfall than on the plains. The annual average fall in the neighbourhood of Buxton amounts to about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> inches, which is much less than that of many localities both in the Northern and Midland Counties. Even when there is an exceptionally heavy fall of rain the porous nature of the subsoil precludes the possibility of an accumulation of surface water to any great extent.

Finally, with an army of thirty thousand men, he invaded the country of the Khalkas, and in 1690 took his first open step of hostility against China, by arresting the envoys who had been sent to his camp. This insult put an end to all Kanghi's efforts to maintain peace. The diplomatic movements were followed by a display of military energy and activity, and the whole northern army, consisting of the eight Manchu Banners, the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> Mongol Banners, and a large force of Chinese auxiliaries, was set in motion across the steppes. Meanwhile Galdan, alarmed by the hostility he had provoked, sought to make an alliance with the Russians, an effort which brought him hollow promises but no assistance. Without waiting for the coming of all his foes, he made a vigorous attack on the Chinese advance force and drove it back in defeat, remaining master of the field.

Governor Nott died in August, 1706, aged <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years. The assembly erected a monument to his memory in the graveyard of the church at Williamsburg. In the inscription he is styled, \"His Excellency, Edward Nott, the late Governor of this Colony.\" It appears that he and his successors were allowed to retain the chief title, as giving them more authority with the people, the Earl of Orkney being quite content with a part of the salary.

The result was a surprise, and not least to the health officers. In the entire mass of nearly a million and a quarter of tenants[8] only two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> children under fourteen years of age were found at work in living-rooms. To anyone acquainted with the ordinary aspect of tenement-house life the statement seemed preposterous, and there are valid reasons for believing that the policemen missed rather more than they found even of those that were confessedly or too evidently under age. They were seeking that which, when found, would furnish proof of law-breaking against the parent or employer, a fact of which these were fully...", "...the Senate had to relinquish its prerogative of creating the extraordinary commands. Although no person had been nominated for this command in the law of Gabinius, the opinion of the voters had been so clearly expressed in a _contio_ that the Senate had to appoint Pompey.

In forty days he swept the pirates from the western Mediterranean. In <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> more he cornered them in Cilicia, where he forced the surrender of their strongholds. His victory was hastened by the mildness shown to those who surrendered. They received their lives and freedom, and in many cases were used as colonists to revive cities with a declining population. Within three months he had brought the pirate war to a triumphant conclusion, but his _imperium_ would not terminate for three years and he was anxious to gather fresh laurels. *The Manilian...", "...of the Timok River and the Danube, but it follows the river for only about ten miles.

This is determined by the character of the law rather than by the state of mind of the parties; and so far as the individuals are concerned, the ground alleged is thus a cloak rather than a clue or revelation.

Six out of every seven allow divorce for desertion, adultery or cruelty; and of the 945,625 divorces reported with their causes during the twenty years 1887-1906 nearly 78% were granted for some one of these three causes, viz. 39% for desertion, 22% for adultery, and 16% for cruelty. Probably nearly 9% more were for some combination of these causes. Three other grounds for divorce are admitted as legal in many or most...", "...were sent over from Boston. The officers flocked to the tavern in the square, where the cry was for drink. Guards were stationed in various parts of the town. One was placed at the neck, with orders to permit no one to go out.

General Pigot had the command in Charlestown the next day, when the troops all returned to their quarters.

Within five minutes he was at the top, and in three more he was by our side again below, claiming his reward. The Great Pyramid is seven hundred and forty-six feet square at its base. \"How many yards is that, Hugh?\" Hugh thought for a minute. \"Two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> yards all but a foot,\" he answered. \"Right, so that if you were to build a straight piece of wall as long as the four sides of the pyramid, it would stretch more than half a mile.\" \"How wonderful!\" exclaimed Hugh, gazing in astonishment at the gigantic pyramid. \"May I ride round it?\" We rode round it, and then went on to the second pyramid.

Well, Dick began, you see I am an old salt, having sailed the seas for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years, and being entirely unaccustomed to living upon the land. By some accident or other, I found myself, in the winter of 1849, cook for a party of miners who were sluicing high up the North Fork of the American. We had a hard time all winter, and when spring opened, it was agreed that I and a comrade named Liehard should cross the summit and spend a week fishing at the lake. We took along an old Washoe Indian, who spoke Spanish, as a guide. This old man had formerly lived...", "...shillings, and in some instances ten shillings, per week for liquor on shore and on board, whether drunk by him or not. The plan was to compel the coal-whippers to visit their houses previous to obtaining employment, and on the night before obtaining a ship to commence the score, and at six o'clock in the morning, before going to work, to drink a pot of beer, or spirits to an equal amount of value; then to take on board for each gang nine pots of beer, to be repeated on delivering every <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> tons during the day; after which they were compelled to pay nine or ten shillings per man for each ship for gear. The evil effects of such a system it is unnecessary to point out. After a week's hard work, a man had nothing to take home. The coal-whippers became a drunken and degraded class, the family were starved, the boys early learned to thieve, and the girls were too often thrown upon the streets. No wonder the men rebelled against this cruel tyranny. For long they...", "...the board blocked, he loses the game. The game is drawn when neither of the players has sufficient advantage in force or position to enable him to win.

Much difference of opinion exists regarding the relative strength of the various openings. It was at one time generally held that for the black side 11-15 was the best opening move. Towards the end of the 19th century this view became much modified, and though 11-15 still remained the...", "...of Lopez, and made him believe that the time for a successful invasion had at length arrived.[9] He was so confident, at one time, of the determination and ability of the Cubans alone to secure their independence, that he wished to embark without any force, and throw himself among them. It was this confidence that led him to embark with only four hundred ill-armed men on board the little steamer Pampero, on the 2d of August, 1851. This force consisted mostly of Americans, but embraced <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> Cubans in its ranks, with several German and Hungarian officers; among the latter, General Pragay, one of the heroes of the Hungarian revolution, who was second in command to General Lopez on this occasion.

A supply is also drawn from several important artesian wells in different localities,--that of Grenelle, in the Place de Breteuil, driven between 1833 and 1852, draws the water from a depth of five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> metres and elevates it to a height of seventy-five. This supply is turned into that of the Ourcq. The artesian well of the Butte aux Cailles, begun in 1863, was resumed in 1892 and is just being terminated; the depth attained is some six hundred metres.

Marriage was for long by banns, and the ceremony was at first performed by magistrates and not by clergymen. This fact, as well as the further fact that any \"man of dignity\" came under the generic title of \"magistrate\" in the meaning of the custom, gave rise to many complications and no little scandal--as in the case of old Governor Bellingham, who when a widower of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> married himself to Penelope Pelham, who was not half his age. This acting in the dual capacity of bridegroom and magistrate was a little too much for the patience of the community, and the governor was called upon to stand trial for his offence; but as he insisted upon his prerogative of occupying the bench the result was not edifying. There were many local customs at marriages which were by no means admirable, such as the scrambling for the bride's garter, the bedding of...", "...and with so little show of intention.

At Newcastle-on-Tyne, last year, there were 11,620 persons used the reference library, and only 3949 of these were of 'no occupation.' Yet, notwithstanding the numerical weakness of the latter, they managed to consult nearly half the books that were consulted during that year. The total number consulted was 36,100; and 16,800 were used by people who had 'no occupation.' And this is legislation for the Working Classes! There is little doubt that at least <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> out of every fifty working-men have no interest whatever in these institutions. For one penny they can buy their favourite newspaper, which can be carried in the pocket and read at any time; whereas if they wanted to see a paper at a Free Library they would generally have to wait half an hour or an hour in a stuffy room, without being allowed to speak during the time.

The introduction of the worship of Apollo must have had no less influence on the families of the soothsayers, who ministered at the altars of the Olympic deities. These were the Clytiadae, Iamidae, and Telliadae;(1091) of which the Clytiadae considered themselves as belonging to a clan, which produced very many soothsayers, viz., the Melampodidae.(1092) This explains the...", "...work by which his name was known outside his native land, but his first pianoforte quartet, op. 25 in G minor, incurred the wrath of the critics of the time by its introduction of some characteristics of Hungarian music into the finale.

He had a great admiration for the waltzes of Strauss, and in many passages of his own works the _entrain_ that is characteristic of the Viennese dance-writers is present in a striking degree.

Moreover, instead of having to chip every one of the one hundred and nineteen pieces to a definite size and shape, and then to place them slowly so as to ensure the truth of his angles of forty-five and twenty-two and a half degrees, as the Greek or Italian had, the Moor had only to place one of his <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> pieces with precision; and, provided he never took any of the eleven patterns, of which his repeats are composed, out of their right turn, his mosaic would work itself with scarcely any other attention on his part.

It is four hundred and twenty-five feet (Spanish) long, and two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> wide. The order is Corinthian, but defective in its true proportions, since the principal nave is only forty-five feet wide, its height is one hundred and twenty.\" It would profit us but little to follow Amirola through his straight-laced criticisms on a design the beauty of which he was unable to apprehend; and it may be well to take a larger and juster view of its merits.

Camarina had not at that time been rebuilt; he could therefore only have been so called from his native place; which would (according to the assumed dates) have been then destroyed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years. It must, however, have been uncommon for men of fifty to be victorious in running. If, however, we place the foundation of Camarina in Olymp. 45. 1, and the destruction in Olymp. 56 (with the Schol.

The unlimited importation of cheap grain from Spain, Egypt, Sicily, and Lybia, and nothing else. 2. In the next place, even if the gratuitous distributions of grain had embraced twenty times the number which they did, nothing can be clearer than that the effect _on agriculture_ is the same, whether cheap foreign grain is imported by the private importer, or bought and distributed by the government.

He had a daughter named Thoodzata.

Having left on that spot his golden cup, he undressed himself, and descended into the river.

He divided his exquisite fruit into forty-nine mouthfuls, which he ate entire, without mixing any water with it. During <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days he spent round the Bodi tree, Buddha never bathed, nor took any food, nor experienced the least want. His appearance and countenance remained unchanged; he spent the whole time absorbed, as it were, in an uninterrupted meditation.

At the foot of the linloon tree he sat in a cross-legged position, having his mind deeply engaged in the exercise of the sublimest contemplation. In that position he spent seven entire days, which completed the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days which were to be devoted to reflection and meditation around the Bodi tree. When this period of days was over, at daybreak, on the fifth day after the full moon of Watso, he felt the want of food. This was quickly perceived by a Thagia, who hastened from his seat to the spot where Buddha was staying, and offered him some Thit khia fruits, others say Kia-dzoo fruits, to prepare his system to receive more substantial food. After he had eaten them, the same celestial...", "...Buddha was staying, and offered him some Thit khia fruits, others say Kia-dzoo fruits, to prepare his system to receive more substantial food.

In this system, they admit that there exist certain beings called Pitzega-Buddhas, who possess all the knowledge and science of a genuine Buddha, but as they are divested of those benevolent feelings which induce the former to labour earnestly for the benefit and salvation of all beings, they cannot be assimilated to the real Buddhas. The cross-legged position which our Buddha has always taken in preference to any other, whilst he spent <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days at the foot of and in various places round the Bodi tree, is, as every one knows, peculiar to and a favourite with all Asiatics. But with him, it is the fittest position for meditation and contemplation.

Hence after having remained seven days on the same spot, deeply engaged in considering some parts of the law he was soon to preach, it is said of him that he comes out from a state of perfect ecstasy. This expression implies a state of complete mental abstraction, when the soul,...", "...No doubt could be entertained that there was in Buddha some secret power superior to the one he possessed. The pounha was at once disconcerted and bewildered. In his ignorance he attributed the accident to some superior magical formula possessed by Buddha, and asked him to teach him the said formula.

There is in me but one virtue; it is that which I have gathered at the foot of the Bodi tree during the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days that I have spent there in the deepest meditation.

Besides, how can it be maintained, that Antonello, after passing many years in Rome as a student, and many in Palermo as a master, and some years in Messina and Flanders, should not in Venice, in the forty-ninth year after the death of Giovanni, have passed the forty-ninth year of his age. Hackert quotes the opinion of Gallo, who in the _Annali di Messina_, dates the birth of Antonello in 1447, and his death at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years of age, that is, in 1496. But if this were so, how could he have known Gio. da Bruggia? Yet if such fact be denied, we must contradict a tradition which has been generally credited. I should be more inclined to believe that there is a mistake in his age, and that he died at a more advanced period of life.

Vasari and Ridolfi state such facts respecting him as are not easily reconcilable to the period of life in general assigned to him, reaching only to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years; and I have proved, in collecting memorials, to which they had no access, alluded to in the Neapolitan School, that there were two distinct visits made by Antonello to Venice. The first, it appears to me, must have taken place soon after his return into Italy; at which time he concealed the discovery from every one, except it were Domenico Veneziano, who is known to have availed himself of it for many years, both in Venice and elsewhere.

The moon in this respect is like the earth, being also a globe, but it is only 2,160 miles in diameter, and about 7,000 miles in circumference. It would therefore take <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> moons to compose a globe the size of the earth.

But the fifth is even more explicit. \"This day completes the first year of my exile among these barbarous mountains, dead to the Muses, divided by snows, fells, forests, rivers, from the mistress of my soul![622] I am nearly fifty, and yet love rules me like...", "...celebrated at Paris with a pomp worthy of their object. They had as spectators the entire population of Paris, increased by a prodigious crowd of strangers of every class. At four o'clock the Senate left its palace; the Council of State, the Tuileries; the Corps Legislatif, its palace; the Court of Cassation, the Court of Accounts, the Council of the University, and the Imperial Court, the ordinary places of their sittings; the municipal corps of Paris and the deputations from the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> good towns, the Hotel de Ville. On their arrival at the Metropolitan Church these bodies were placed by the master of ceremonies with his aides, according to their rank, on the right and left of the throne, reaching from the choir to the middle of the nave. The diplomatic corps at five o'clock took their place on the platform erected for this purpose. At half-past five cannon announced the departure of their Majesties from the Tuileries. The Imperial procession was...", "...and presented him to the clergy present. Immediately the acclamations, which had been repressed till then from respect to the ceremony and the sanctity of the place, burst forth on all sides. The prayers being ended, their Majesties, at eight o'clock in the evening, went to the Hotel de Ville, and were there received by the municipal corps. A brilliant concert and a sumptuous banquet had been tendered them by the city of Paris. The decorations of the banquet hall showed the, arms of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> good cities, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, being placed first, and the forty-six others in alphabetical order. After the banquet their Majesties took their places in the concert hall; and at the conclusion of the concert they repaired to the throne room, where all invited persons formed a circle. The Emperor passed round this circle, speaking affably, sometimes even familiarly, to most of the persons who composed it, each of whom responded in the most cordial manner. At last,...", "...the smoke. His clothes he must not change. White garments he must not put on. He must not offer sacrifice. The king must not drive a chariot. He must not issue royal decrees.

There was therefore not only a week of seven days, but a week of seven-day weeks as well. In fact, the chief difference between the Babylonian and the Hebrew institution lay in the subordination of the Sabbath to the festival of the \"new moon\" among the Babylonians. There was no Sabbath on the first day of the month; its place was taken by freewill offerings to the moon. The Sabbath, it will be noticed, was not...", "...The young man was not in the least cast down, but, calm and heroic, wrote two sonnets on the walls of his cell. Meantime, a noble young Quaker at the North, John G. Whittier, was deeply anxious for Garrison. He had no money to pay his fine, but, greatly admiring Henry Clay, whom he hoped to see President, wrote him urging that he aid the \"guiltless prisoner.\" Clay would doubtless have done so, but Arthur Tappan, one of New York's noble men, sent the money, releasing Garrison from his <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days' imprisonment. Wendell Phillips says of him, \"He was in jail for his opinions when he was just twenty-four. He had confronted a nation in the very bloom of his youth.\" Garrison had not been idle while in prison. He had prepared several lectures on slavery, and these he now gave when he could find a hearing. Large churches were not opened to him, and nobody offered him two hundred dollars a night!

On the 3d, the Prince of Hesse-Cassel was dispatched after him with 4000 foot and 60 squadrons. Lord Orkney, on arriving on the banks of the Haine, found the passage so strongly guarded that he did not deem it prudent to alarm the enemy by attempting to force them. The Prince of Hesse-Cassel, however, was more fortunate. He marched with such extraordinary diligence, that he got over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> English miles in fifty-six successive hours; a rapidity of advance, for such a distance, that had never been surpassed at that, though it has been outdone in later times.[25] By this means he reached the Haine on the other side of Mons, and surprised the passage near Obourg, at two in the morning of the 6th, and at noon he entered the French lines of the Trouille without opposition, the enemy retiring with precipitation as he advanced. He immediately extended his forces over...", "...Some think it is an advisable form of punishment; others view it with disfavour. This element of human lottery in the administration of the law should surely be kept under as far as possible. Out of a hundred and forty-five criminals convicted of robbery only three were flogged. An intending robber therefore who studies judicial \"form\" in the statistics will see that it is about fifty to one against the cat, and if he is the one unfortunate surely he has a distinct grievance against the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> lucky blackguards who escape. When only three criminals receive this punishment in one year it is worth while considering whether it should be continued, or, if it is to be continued, whether it should not be extended to crimes against women and children and other nameless horrors.

If it ever comes to be...", "...Roger Scott, for repeated sleeping in meeting on the Lord's Day, and for striking the person who waked him, was, at Salem, sentenced to be severely whipped.\" Whipping appears to have been a common means of punishing offenders who transgressed the laws. In the month of January, 1761, we see it stated that four men for petty larceny were publicly whipped at the cart's tail through the streets of New York. We gather from another newspaper report that a man named Andrew Cayto received <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> stripes at the public whipping-post for house-robbery--namely, for robbing one house, thirty-nine stripes; and for robbing the other, ten stripes. It appears in some instances prisoners had, as part of their sentence, to sit on the gallows with ropes about their necks.

He ordered these words to be engraved upon his tomb-stone: \"Here lies a prince, whose intentions were pure, but who had the misfortune to see all his plans shattered!\" History has done justice to his character, and the people whom he tried to help learned to appreciate his efforts when it was too late.

All these reasons, sufficiently account for the stationary condition of the population. Of strangers to the association, there are in Sarepta, thirty families of work people from the German colonies of Saratof, forty Russians, and twenty Tatars; some fifty Kalmuck kibitkas (tents) supply labourers for the gardens and for other works. There are now fifty-six stone and 136 wooden houses in Sarepta, and outside it, one stone and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> wooden. Its public buildings, are a church, with an organ and a belfry, and three large workhouses for bachelors, widows, and girls. These serve at the same time as asylums for orphans, and for all persons who have no families. There are also schools for the young of both sexes, in which the course of instruction is rather extensive, and includes the German, Russian, and French languages, history, geography, and elementary mathematics.

The notions of the Kalmucks on this head are so confused, that I have been unable to learn any thing in addition to what is stated by the learned Pallas. Their sacred books speak of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> epochs, ending by fire, or deluges, or hurricanes. They are all divided into four great periods. The first comprises the space of time in which human life begins with being 80,000 years long, and diminishes to 10,000; during the second period man perishes; during the third the earth remains desolate, and in the fourth occurs a hurricane which carries the souls from hell to the earth.

Both the army and constabulary were ordered out in Leyte and a good deal of fighting occurred before order was restored.

It is also notorious that Batangas suffered by the war more than any other province in the Philippine Islands.

While we will never know whether Batangas did or did not lose one hundred thousand as a result of the war and its consequences, still, if it did, the other <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> provinces above mentioned must have lost as many more, that is to say, must have lost another hundred thousand. So that while it is all a matter of surmise, with nothing more certain to go on than the foregoing, it would really seem by no means absurd to assume the Filipino loss of life, other than on the battlefield, caused by the war, and the famine, pestilence, and other disease consequent thereon, at not far from 200,000 people.

During Sutherland's administration, there were a considerable number of post offices opened, and many of them established at this period afterwards attained great importance. In 1816, when he became deputy postmaster general, there were only ten offices in Lower Canada and nine in Upper Canada. When he retired in 1827, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> in Lower Canada and sixty-five in Upper Canada. In 1816, Belleville post office was opened under the name of bay of Quinte: in 1825, Hamilton, London, Brantford, and St. Thomas were provided with post offices. In Lower Canada, besides those already mentioned, a post office was opened at Sherbrooke in 1819, replacing an office established in Aston township in 1817. A curious fact appears in the post office list of 1819. At this date Toronto was still called York, and...", "...the mails between Quebec and the leading points in the western part of the province was great. In 1853 the ordinary time for the winter mails to travel from Quebec to Kingston was four days; in 1857, they were carried between the two places in thirty-one hours; to Toronto the saving in time was the difference between seven days and forty hours. Before the era of railways ten and a half days were occupied in the journey from Quebec to Windsor. The railway carried the mails regularly in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> hours. The use of travelling post offices, with mail clerks assorting and distributing the mails from the railways in the course of their trips, was an early feature of the postal service in Canada. This mode of utilizing the railways had been in operation in England since 1838, and before the leading railways in Canada were completed, an officer of the post office department was sent to England to study the system. Thus, by 1857, this system, which is the leading feature...", "...as far as possible, the communication between the important cities of Great Britain and the sailing ports of the Canadian vessels, and to arrange for the exploitation of this transportation system, in the interests of Canada.

He pointed out that, by the Grand Trunk railway, the journey between Portland and Chicago was made in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> hours, and between Quebec and Chicago in forty-five hours, and, by making Cork a port of call for the mails, the voyage between land and land would be several hundred miles shorter than by any other route.

Of the Moslems only fourteen fell; the Quraysh lost <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> killed and about the same number of prisoners.

The custom of celebrating one _general auto-da-fe_ every year was so well established, that when the inquisitors of Cuenca, in 1558, gave up a man to secular justice in a _particular auto-da-fe_, it was doubted if the rules of the holy office permitted it; and though the council decided in the affirmative, the custom of reserving all the condemned persons for the general...", "...a month, for each.

The statement of the fragments, that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> native kings reigned, in the 458 years from 1976 B.C. to 1518 B.C., is also remarkable, since it allows for the reign of each of the kings of this dynasty the brief average of a little more than nine years.

The other two elements do not enter into the constitution of forms. The element earth predominates on the plane of Bhur or the material plane. Water is supreme on Bhuvar or the Astral plane. Our Kamic tendencies proceed from the presence of water in us. Fire is the element of Svarga or the Mental plane. Fire devas are therefore the highest devas of Triloki. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> forms of fire are therefore so many forms of consciousness. Some of the Pitris developed fire in them, _i.e._ they developed the principle of mind in them, in however rudimental a form it might be. Devas and Rishis were also preserved.

The reflector alone weighed nearly a ton. So large and ponderous an instrument must require a vast deal of machinery to work it,...", "...organic beings. At the end of the ninth year we have seen that each plant would not be able to get its full square foot of ground, and at the end of another year it would have to share that space with fifty others the produce of the seeds which it would give off. What, then, takes place? Every plant grows up, flourishes, occupies its square foot of ground, and gives off its fifty seeds; but notice this, that out of this number only one can come to anything; there is thus, as it were, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> chances to one against its growing up; it depends upon the most fortuitous circumstances whether any one of these fifty seeds shall grow up and flourish, or whether it shall die and perish.

Now, what is the result of all this? I have said that there are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> struggling against every one; and it amounts to this, that the smallest possible start given to any one seed may give it an advantage which will enable it to get ahead of all the others; anything that will enable any one of these seeds to germinate six hours before any of the others will, other things being alike, enable it to choke them out altogether.

In 1845 twenty-nine out of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> double set of locks between Albany and Syracuse were completed and ninety-eight miles of the new enlarged canal was open for use; the cost for this portion was $3,685,438. The total cost of enlargement contracted for prior to April 1, 1842, was $9,361,442.

Likewise, as Braddock got ready to move, Sir John became furious at obstacles which, not knowing till then that they existed, he considered that they had no right to exist, and therefore that the people were to be blamed.

He visited Braddock and was received and treated as a worthy guest.

Another point that takes from Gordin's interest to us as a sketch-writer is that his best stories have Russia rather than New York as a background; that his sketches from New York life are comparatively unconvincing.

The scenery in which they stood is hallowed by his shade. He was fond of indulging his melancholy minstrel musings among the woodland scenery there.

It was fifty-eight feet high, and contained one thousand six hundred and sixty-eight feet seven inches of solid timber. Magog was only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> feet in height; but its circumference was fifty-four feet four inches at the ground, and thirty-one feet three at three feet high. These two trees were near each other, and although a good deal bared at the top by age, they were very picturesque.

The historian Charles Merivale has made perhaps as strong a plea for Sulla as it is possible to make, in the following words: \"The personal rivalry of her two most fortunate generals becomes now the main channel of the history of Rome herself. In the year which closed the contest of the republic with her dependent allies (88), Sulla was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years old, Marius was about seventy. The former was enjoying the full breeze of popularity and renown, while the latter, wearied but not sated with accumulated honours, was moodily throwing away the advantages he had earned in his earlier career. From campaign to campaign Sulla, as we have seen, had dogged the steps of the elder warrior, always ready to step in and seize the opportunities which the other cast recklessly in his way....", "...her face was more so. At that time Amenaide was a very pretty young woman, slender, graceful and ethereal; her black eyes, level with her face, gleamed with health and animation; her mouth, which was a little large, laughed frequently to display a double row of faultless teeth; and although her nose was a little coarse, her forehead a little low, and her complexion a little dark, Mademoiselle Dufoureau might have passed for a very attractive person. Monsieur de Grandvilain, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> at that time, and considered himself still a young man, because he had retained the tastes and the temperament of a young man, had met Amenaide in society and had paid court to her; but with the frivolity of a man accustomed to making conquests, with the self-assurance of a rake who had never found women cruel, and with the fatuity of a marquis, who thought that he bestowed much honor upon a young woman of the middle class by allowing his eyes to rest upon her....", "...treatment, enemas were administered, nature being too weak to assist itself.

The restoration of letters was succeeded by the regeneration of religion: the days of criticism and neutrality by those of courage and action. Erasmus was then only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years old; but he had finished his career. From being first, he must now be second: the monk of Wittemberg dethroned him. He looked around himself in vain: placed in a new country, he had lost his road. A hero was needed to inaugurate the great movement of modern times: Erasmus was a mere man of letters.

After this bloody check, General Buller's report of the movement is delicious: 'The fact that we were able to withdraw our ox-waggons and mule transports over a river 85 yards broad and with a rapid current, without any interference from the enemy, is, I think, a proof that they have learnt to respect the fighting powers of our soldiers.'

The Boers had 168 men killed. And, as Ricciardi has pointed out, but for the incomprehensible opposition of General Joubert, this retreat across the Tugela would have been, not a proof that the enemy had learnt to respect the fighting powers of the English, but a terrific rout.

If it was not exactly the center of all eyes, due to its geographical position as the town nearest the Mahela, it was the center of deer hunting.

The European doctors who visited the hospitals on the following day found <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> bodies--forty-four of which were Europeans. Thirty-seven were so battered as to be unrecognizable. Seventy-one persons were also found wounded; of these, thirty-six were Europeans, two Turks, and thirty-three natives.

The men of Bruges built a fort commanding the River Scheldt at a point near Calloo, mounting on it no less than sixty cannon. The Antwerp burghers met this challenge by building a similar fort at Austruwel, and then attacked and captured the Flemish fort on April 23--St. George's Day. A yearly procession still commemorates this victory in the long contest to maintain the freedom of the river. A fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> merchant vessels that the Flemings had detained came triumphantly up the river, and the conflict for supremacy between the old sea gateway of the Netherlands and the new was settled once for all--as far as poor Bruges was concerned--in favour of Antwerp, the new maritime queen of the North.

But stop for a moment to remember, since we are speaking of the shipment of munitions, that Austria herself, the Government of Vienna, sold to the Confederate Government some thousands of stacks of arms during our Civil War, and refused either to forbid the shipment or to resell to the Government in Washington.

After talking to the rioters they were entirely satisfied to send the guns to the office, but said a portion of the crowd would object, and requested me to make a few remarks to them.

The rest of the stock on them consisted of five mules, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> cattle, three hundred and ninety hogs, and three sheep. The few months' continuous stay at home which Jefferson had been able to make during the past ten years had not been sufficient for him to set things to rights.

Upon receipt of the news that Dr. Whitman, in June, \"Had started to Oregon with a great caravan numbering nearly one thousand souls,\" another letter was sent to the English Minister, still more pointed and impressive.

But England did not want a part, she wanted all. During the negotiations in 1827 as to the renewal of the Treaty of 1818, her commissioners stated the case diplomatically, thus: \"Great Britain claims no exclusive sovereignty over any portion of that territory. Her present claim is not in respect to any part, but...", "...so long to yield without a contest. But there were rugged, brave, intelligent American citizens now in Oregon, and there to stay.

We will have \"Oregon and fifty-four forty, or fight.\" In a lengthy message in December, 1845, President Polk devotes nearly one-fifth of his space to the discussion of the Oregon question, and rehearses the discussion pro and con between the two governments and acknowledges, that thus far there has been absolute failure.

The redemption had to be paid by annuities for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years. As years went, and the greatest part of it was paid, it became easier and easier to redeem the smaller remaining part of it, and, as each allotment could be redeemed individually, advantage was taken of this disposition by traders, who bought land for half its value from the ruined peasants. A law was consequently passed to put a stop to such sales. 37. Mr. V.V., in his Peasant Community, has grouped together all facts relative to this movement.

That of 1490 was clearly not the one chosen, since among 'Anima Mia's' pictures we find illustrations to Genesis xiii., xv., xvii., xx., xxiv., and xxvi., none of which were illustrated in the 1490 edition, while pictures on the same subjects are found in that of 1492. Again, in the four books of Kings the 1493 edition agrees with the 1492 in having <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> cuts as against forty-three in the original edition of 1490. More conclusive still is the evidence of a mistake in Joshua ix., where it is impossible that the artist can have had before him the pretty little cut of the Gibeonites as hewers of wood and drawers of water, which is one of our illustrations. By 1492 the block for this had apparently been damaged and is replaced by a larger cut (56 mm. in height), representing a king and two councillors, apparently taken from some...", "...too aged to travel so far, some are detained by illness and will come later, and some, to their regret, are detained by the special circumstances of their own dioceses.

The pillar is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> feet eight inches; the capital, six feet two inches; the entablature and the pediment may be ten; making--say sixty-six feet. These pillars formed a portico all round it--a covered way; the pillars being connected with the temple by enormously large stones resting one end on the pillars, and the other on the walls. The lower faces of these stones were most richly wrought with various devices. The pillars are six feet four inches in diameter at the bottom, and five feet eight...", "...force of character or knowledge of the world. Such qualities are not to be expected from the kind of education which fell to the lot of Japanese princes in those days. In view of the expected return of the American ships in the following year, forts were constructed to guard the sea-front of the capital, and the ex-Prince of Mito was summoned from his retirement to take the lead in preparing to resist the encroachments of foreign powers. By a curious coincidence, this nobleman, then <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years of age, was the representative of a family which for years had maintained the theoretical right of the Mikado to exercise the supreme government, and was at the same time strongly opposed to any extension of the limited intercourse with foreign countries then permitted. Nor can it be wondered that Japan, who had so successfully protected herself from foreign aggression by a policy of rigid exclusion, and which had seen the humiliation of China consequent upon disputes...", "...the Golden Age! Life was far more elegant and luxurious than it was even fifteen years before. The transplanted Englishman had rapidly prospered in the new land. Great wealth had suddenly come to him through his tobacco, and he made haste to use and enjoy it. The four-roomed house--quite good enough for his cavalier grandfather--had stepped aside to give place to a pillared, porticoed, stately mansion. The dormer windows--like heavy-lidded eyes--had been superseded by \"five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> lights\" for one dwelling. The planter often built on the site of his old colonial residence, sometimes incorporating the old into the new. An eminence, commanding a wide view of the surrounding country, was a coveted spot in plantation times. It behooved the settler (for reasons similar to those which influenced Captain John Smith) to build his house \"on a high hill neere a convenient river, hard to be assalted and easie to be defended.\" When the perilous days of Indian...", "...add that of making me acquainted with Washington. He assented; and the day after my arrival, he went with me to dine with this famous man. I gave him a letter from my father; and, after a slight '_shake hand_,' he was kind enough to say a thousand flatteries and polite things to me. Here is his portrait, which I have formed from what I have been able to see of him for myself, and from what the conversations which I have had with regard to him, have taught me:-- \"The General is about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years of age; he is large, finely made, very well proportioned. His figure is much more pleasing than the picture represents it. He was fine looking until within about three years; and, although those who have been constantly with him since that time say that he seems to them to have grown old fast, it is undeniable that the General is still fresh, and active as a young man. \"His physiognomy is pleasant and open; his address is cold, though polite; his pensive eye is more...", "...sang themselves on to the paper.

The consequence was that before two days had passed, people in Bath were quarrelling over such details as whether Captain Mathews had or had not made an attack upon Mr. Long with his cane, or if it was really true that Miss Linley had been walking with Captain Mathews, thereby arousing the jealousy of Mr. Long, and causing him to assault the other. Before the second day had gone by, there was, of course, a report that a duel had taken place, and the...", "...She began to rock herself over the head of her stick again in that dreadful fashion which had alarmed Comethup before. The boy would have been glad to escape from an interview in which he appeared to have no part, but that Miss Carlaw had laid her hand again on his shoulder, and was detaining him beside her. \"O Bob, Bob, what a humbug you are! You're one of those fellows who can't take a straight line. If fifty different roads branched out before you, and you were blindfolded, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> of those roads made for good and the other didn't, by the Lord, you'd choose the other! I believe you've always been rather popular with women--I can see you twirling your mustache; I'm sure you are, you dog--but you haven't been popular with me. The others had ordinary eyes to see your perfections; I had other eyes which served me better.\" She sat up fiercely, and brought her stick down sharply on the floor. \"Why the devil can't you be honest? Why can't you say that you...", "...forth to proclaim it, the Buddha fasted, being too elated to seek food, and only once receiving it from two merchants, named Tapussa (Trapusha) and Bhallika. These became his first lay-reverers (p. 89) by repeating the _double_ formula of reverence for the Buddha and for his doctrine (the Sa[.n]gha not being then instituted, Maha-v deg. I. 4. 5). A later legend relates that they received in return eight of his hairs which they preserved as relics. In connexion with the legend of a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days' fast, I may mention that an ancient carving of Gautama was pointed out to me at Buddha-Gaya, which represents him as holding a bowl of rice-milk divided into forty-nine portions, one for each day. With these legends we may contrast the simple Gospel narrative of Christ's forty days' fast in the wilderness. The Buddha's first resolution to come forth from his seclusion and proclaim his gospel to mankind is of course a great epoch with all Buddhists. And here it...", "...as minors by the acting Regent. The last child was made away with in 1837. If these three children are reckoned, Ge Mure YamThso must be regarded as the eleventh Dalai Lama. He died in 1855. The twelfth was born in 1856, and seems to have lived till 1874. The discovery of the present Dalai Lama is thus related by Sarat Chandra Das. After the death of an incarnate Lama, his soul is said ordinarily to remain in the spiritual world for a space (called Bardo) of at least <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days. In 1875, one year after the demise of the late Dalai Lama, Thinle Gya-tsho, the Regency and the College of Cardinals at Lhassa consulted the celebrated oracle of Nachung Chhoskyong about the re-appearance of the Dalai. The oracle declared that the Grand Lama could only be discovered by a monk of the purest morals. Accordingly the Shar-tse Khanpo of the Galdan monastery, who was well known for his virtuous character and his profound knowledge of the sacred...", "...Das also witnessed at the same time the performance of a remarkable ceremony for the translation of the soul of a chief Lama or Khanpo to one of the heavenly mansions. It appears that a certain well-known Khanpo had died of small-pox. He was one of the most distinguished scholars of Tibet, and held the highest position in the Court of Potala. The day on which the ceremony was performed was the twenty-seventh day of this chief Lama's _Bardo_ (p. 371); that is, of the interval of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days between his death and his translation to another world. (According to Jaeschke the interval of the intermediate state only lasts for forty days.) The Dalai Lama, seated on his throne, chanted a hymn in a low indistinct voice. Afterwards the assembled monks in grave tones repeated what the Grand Lama had uttered. Then a venerable personage rose from the middle of the first row of seats, and addressing the Grand Lama as the incarnate Lord Chenressig (Avalokite[.s]vara),...", "...round the lot. Her performances were the signal for further Yankee inroads, and 1893 saw two American boats, namely _Meneen_ and _Morwena_, added to the list. So now there was an American in all three classes from two-and-a-half downwards, and to our shame be it said each one headed her class. It was not till the year 1897 either, that _Meneen_ may fairly be said to have been outclassed, her construction also was a masterpiece of lightness and durability. Her record was forty prizes in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> starts, and this with seven rivals, one of Mr. Nicholson's design and one of Mr. Payne's included. Mrs. Hardie Jackson constantly accompanied her husband in _Meneen_, and was as at home on the water as she is known to be in the saddle. This was not a propitious year for South coast designers, as Fife held the laurels in the five and likewise in the twenty class. The twenties were a new institution promoted by Lord Dunraven, and they flourished for four years as Solent...", "...at the point of a bayonet and loaded gun to have taken the train to the front? Surely the commanding officer of that force could not have been a model soldier or man of force, and much less an ardent, devoted patriot, in this instance. According to Dr. E. M. Haynes' History of the Tenth Vermont, the Union loss in killed, wounded and missing in this fight was 1,294, of which 1,072 were of Rickett's Third Division of the Sixth Corps. There were eleven officers and five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> enlisted men taken prisoners, thirty-five officers and five hundred and seventy-five enlisted men wounded and ten officers and one hundred and thirteen enlisted men killed.

I crept out of the dining-room, determined not to let my mother know that I had secretly viewed the supper-table. And as I was crossing the lobby to the drawing-room there was a third ring at the door, and a third time my mother rushed out of the kitchen. 'By Jove!' I thought. 'Suppose it's Agnes. What a scene!' And trembling with expectation I opened the door. It was Mr Nixon. Now, Mr Nixon was an old friend of the family's, a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> or fifty, with a reputation for shrewdness and increasing wealth. He owned a hundred and seventy-five cottages in the town, having bought them gradually in half-dozens, and in rows; he collected the rents himself, and attended to the repairs himself, and was celebrated as a good landlord, and as being almost the only man in Bursley who had made cottage property pay. He lived alone in Commerce Street, and, though not talkative, was usually jolly, with one or two good stories...", "...upon insects especially the grasshoppers. It is said that they will feed upon lizards, snakes and toads. They do not molest the poultry of the farmer or the game birds of the field, forest or of our water courses, at least not to any extent. Their size and their slow and heavy flight would nearly always give sufficient warning to permit the ordinary fowls to seek cover. No better evidence as to the character of its food can be furnished than the results of the examination of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> stomachs as related by Dr. Fisher. Of these forty contained mice; five, other mammals; one, lizards; one, the remains of seventy insects (this specimen was killed in Nebraska); and four, were empty.

Much of this, however, runs through territory soon to be covered by Gatun Lake, nearly all the rest of it is on the wrong side of the canal. An almost entirely new line, therefore, is being built through the virgin jungle on the South American side of the canal, which is to be the permanent line and is known in Zone parlance as the \"relocation.\" This is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> miles in length from Panama to Colon, and is single track only, as freight traffic especially is expected, very naturally, to be lighter after the canal is opened. Already that portion from the Chagres to the Atlantic had been put in use--on February fifteenth, to be exact; and the time was not far off when the section within our district--from Gamboa to Pedro Miguel--would also be in operation.

During the seventeenth century, in France, after all the splendid proofs added by Kepler, no one dared openly teach the Copernican theory, and Cassini, the great astronomer, never declared for it. In 1672 the Jesuit Father Riccioli declared that there were precisely <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> arguments for the Copernican theory and seventy-seven against it. Even after the beginning of the eighteenth century--long after the demonstrations of Sir Isaac Newton--Bossuet, the great Bishop of Meaux, the foremost theologian that France has ever produced, declared it contrary to Scripture.

During the voyage they were fed on the finest dog-cakes, but they undoubtedly felt the need of fresh meat and fish to withstand the cold and wet. In the...", "...tent and settled on the snow near by. In the calm, the heat was excessive and great thirst attacked us all the afternoon, which I attempted to assuage at every halt by holding snow in my hands and licking the drops of water off my knuckles----a cold and unsatisfactory expedient.

Correll pulled for the greater part of the afternoon in underclothing alone. At <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> and a half miles a new and wonderful panorama opened before us. The sea lay just below, sweeping as a narrow gulf into the great, flat plain of debouching glacier-tongue which ebbed away north into the foggy horizon.

At the end of the ninth year we have seen that each plant would not be able to get its full square foot of ground, and at the end of another year it would have to share that space with fifty others the produce of the seeds which it would give off.

Every plant grows up, flourishes, occupies its square foot of ground, and gives off its fifty seeds; but notice this, that out of this number only one can come to anything; there is thus, as it were, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> chances to one against its growing up; it depends upon the most fortuitous circumstances whether any one of these fifty seeds shall grow up and flourish, or whether it shall die and perish.

In their northern limits, some vestige may be discovered of the form and situation of Kamptchatka, of a people of hunters and fishermen, whose sledges were drawn by dogs, and whose habitations were buried in the earth. The Turks were ignorant of astronomy; but the observation taken by some learned Chinese, with a gnomon of eight feet, fixes the royal camp in the latitude of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> degrees, and marks their extreme progress within three, or at least ten degrees, of the polar circle. [27] Among their southern conquests the most splendid was that of the Nephthalites, or white Huns, a polite and warlike people, who possessed the commercial cities of Bochara and Samarcand, who had vanquished the Persian monarch, and carried their victorious arms along the banks, and perhaps to the mouth, of the Indus. On the side of the West, the Turkish cavalry advanced to...", "...of the enterprising English navigator. His poverty was honourable, for he had handled large funds during the Consulate and Empire; and there is probably as much sincerity as pathos in what he said to Soult and Gouvion-Saint-Cyr in his declining days, that nothing remained to him after thirty years of honourable service and the occupancy of high offices, except the satisfaction of having at all times done his duty. He died in 1832. His official papers fill no fewer than one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> volumes and are preserved in the library of the ancient Norman city whose name he bore as his own. CHAPTER 6. THE MOTIVES OF BONAPARTE. Did Bonaparte desire to establish French colonial dominions in Australia? The case stated. We will now turn to quite another aspect of the Terre Napoleon story, and one which to many readers will be more fruitful in interest. An investigation of the work of Baudin's expedition on the particular stretch of coast to which was applied...", "...twin pregnancy, with the death of one fetus at the fourth month and the other delivered at term. Beall reports the conception of twins, with one fetus expelled and the other retained; Beauchamp cites a similar instance. Bothwell describes a twin labor at term, in which one child was living and the other dead at the fifth month and macerated. Belt reports an analogous case. Jameson gives the history of an extraordinary case of twins in which one (dead) child was retained in the womb for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> weeks, the other having been born alive at the expiration of nine months. Hamilton describes a case of twins in which one fetus died from the effects of an injury between the fourth and fifth months and the second arrived at full period. Moore cites an instance in which one of the fetuses perished about the third month, but was not expelled until the seventh, and the other was carried to full term. Wilson speaks of a secondary or blighted fetus of the third month with fatty...", "...some of the cases examined by Dercum he found that the thyroid was indurated and infiltrated by calcareous deposits. The disease is not myxedema because there is no peculiar physiognomy, no spade-like hands nor infiltrated skin, no alteration of the speech, etc. Dercum considers it a connective-tissue dystrophy--a fatty metamorphosis of various stages, possibly a neuritis. The first of Dercum's cases was a widow of Irish birth, who died both alcoholic and syphilitic. When forty-eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> her arms began to enlarge. In June, 1887, the enlargement affected the shoulders, arms, back, and sides of the chest. The parts affected were elastic, and there was no pitting. In some places the fat was lobulated, in others it appeared as though filled with bundles of worms. The skin was not thickened and the muscles were not involved. In the right arm there was unendurable pain to the touch, and this was present in a lesser degree in the left arm. Cutaneous sensibility...", "...24, 1884. 100 Miles.--13 hours 26 minutes 30 seconds, made by Charles Rowell at New York, February 27, 1882. In instances of long-distance traversing, rapidity is only a secondary consideration, the remarkable fact being in the endurance of fatigue and the continuity of the exercise. William Gale walked 1500 miles in a thousand consecutive hours, and then walked 60 miles every twenty-four hours for six weeks on the Lillie Bridge cinder path. He was five feet five inches tall, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years of age, and weighed 121 pounds, and was but little developed muscularly. He was in good health during his feat; his diet for the twenty-four hours was 16 pounds of meat, five or six eggs, some cocoa, two quarts of milk, a quart of tea, and occasionally a glass of bitter ale, but never wine nor spirits. Strange to say, he suffered from constipation, and took daily a compound rhubarb pill. He was examined at the end of his feat by Gant. His pulse was 75, strong, regular,...", "...and as the stick was located, gastrotomy was proposed; the patient, however, would not consent to an operation. On the twenty-sixth day an abscess formed on the left side below the nipple, and from it was discharged a large quantity of pus and blood. Four days after this, believing himself to be better, the man began to redress the wound, and from it he saw the end of a stick protruding. A physician was called, and by traction the stick was withdrawn from between the 3d and 4th ribs; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days after the accident the wound had healed completely. Two years afterward the patient had an attack of cholera, but in the fifteen subsequent years he lived an active life of labor. Occasionally an enormous mass of hair has been removed from the stomach. A girl of twenty a with a large abdominal swelling was admitted to a hospital. Her illness began five years previously, with frequent attacks of vomiting, and on three occasions it was noticed that she became quite...", "...some extraordinary cases of retention and suppression of urine on record. Actual retention of urine, that is, urinary secretion passed into the bladder, but retention in the latter viscus by inanition, stricture, or other obstruction, naturally cannot continue any great length of time without mechanically rupturing the vesical walls; but suppression of urine or absolute anuria may last an astonishingly extended period. Of the cases of retention of urine, Fereol mentions that of a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> who suffered absolute retention of urine for eight days, caused by the obstruction of a uric acid calculus. Cunyghame reports a ease of mechanic obstruction of the flow of urine for eleven days. Trapenard speaks of retention of urine for seven days. Among the older writers Bartholinus mentions ischuria lasting fourteen days; Cornarius, fourteen days; Rhoclius, fifteen days; the Ephemerides, ten, eleven, and twelve days. Croom notes a case of retention of urine from...", "...are a great man [here a bitter sneer], I an obscure one [here Castruccio drew himself up]--I only come to discharge a debt to you which I find I have incurred.\" \"What tone is this, Castruccio; and what debt do you speak of?\" \"On my arrival in town yesterday,\" said the poet solemnly, \"I went to the man whom you deputed some years since to publish my little volume, to demand an account of its success; and I found that it had cost one hundred and twenty pounds, deducting the sale of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> copies which had been sold. _Your_ books sell some thousands, I am told. It is well contrived--mine fell still-born, no pains were taken with it--no matter--[a wave of the hand]. You discharged this debt, I repay you: there is a cheque for the money. Sir, I have done!

He reminded the poor poet that his verses were written in a foreign tongue--that even English poets of great fame enjoyed but a limited sale for their works--that it was impossible to make the avaricious public purchase what the stupid public would not take an interest in--in short, he used all those arguments which naturally suggested...", "...a botanical furor on the Doctor's part, especially as he always looked at the ground when he walked about, until I understood that they were roots of words, with a view to a new Dictionary which he had in contemplation. Adams, our head-boy, who had a turn for mathematics, had made a calculation, I was informed, of the time this Dictionary would take in completing, on the Doctor's plan, and at the Doctor's rate of going. He considered that it might be done in one thousand six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years, counting from the Doctor's last, or sixty-second, birthday. But the Doctor himself was the idol of the whole school: and it must have been a badly composed school if he had been anything else, for he was the kindest of men; with a simple faith in him that might have touched the stone hearts of the very urns upon the wall. As he walked up and down that part of the courtyard which was at the side of the house, with the stray rooks and jackdaws looking after him with...", "...this confidence to me, one Wednesday; 'who's the man that hides near our house and frightens her?' 'Frightens my aunt, sir?' Mr. Dick nodded. 'I thought nothing would have frightened her,' he said, 'for she's--' here he whispered softly, 'don't mention it--the wisest and most wonderful of women.' Having said which, he drew back, to observe the effect which this description of her made upon me. 'The first time he came,' said Mr. Dick, 'was--let me see--sixteen hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> was the date of King Charles's execution. I think you said sixteen hundred and forty-nine?' 'Yes, sir.' 'I don't know how it can be,' said Mr. Dick, sorely puzzled and shaking his head. 'I don't think I am as old as that.' 'Was it in that year that the man appeared, sir?' I asked. 'Why, really' said Mr. Dick, 'I don't see how it can have been in that year, Trotwood. Did you get that date out of history?' 'Yes, sir.'

Although it should be supposed, that no more than one person is ever devoted to destruction on any single occasion, at Otaheite, it will still be found that these occurrences are so frequent, as to cause a shocking waste of the human race; for our commander counted no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> skulls of former victims, lying before the Morai, where he had seen another added to the number. It was apparent, from the freshness of these skulls, that no great length of time had elapsed since the wretches to whom they belonged had been offered upon the altar of blood. There is reason to fear, that this custom is as extensive as it is horrid. It is highly probable that it prevails throughout the widely diffused islands of the Pacific Ocean; and Captain Cook had...", "...about to be married to him this afternoon! YUM. Alas, yes! NANK.

'Why do they not stay upon the roof for fifty days instead of forty- nine?' 'Seven weeks is the time allotted them before they must depart: seven weeks make the measure of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days. But why this should be, I cannot tell.' I was not unaware of the ancient belief that the spirit of a dead man haunts for a time the roof of his dwelling, because it is referred to quite impressively in many Japanese dramas, among others in the play called Kagami-yama, which makes the people weep.

During that period he was granted one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> other patents on the lamp and its manufacture. Although very many of these inventions were of the utmost importance and value, we cannot attempt to offer a detailed exposition of them in this necessarily brief article, but must refer the reader, if interested, to the patents themselves, a full list being given at the end of this Appendix. The outline sketch will indicate the principal patents covering the basic features of the lamp.

From there only the danger of getting saddle-sick after our long disuse of horses and the certainty of getting saddle-sore, as we did, restrained us. We tore on through Martha, Forum Aurelii, and a nameless change-house, spurring and lashing as much as we dared, for we dared not disable ourselves with blisters, changing at each halt and getting splendid horses, our diplomas unquestioned. Thus at dusk we reached Cosa, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> miles from Centumcellae and a hundred and nine miles from Rome. We dreaded that we should wake too sore to ride, perhaps too sore to mount, perhaps even too sore to get out of bed. But, while stiff and in great pain, we managed to breakfast and get away. That day we, perforce, rode with less abandon, though we both felt less discomfort after we warmed to the saddle.

On the 31st of December four fresh horses arrived, which had been kindly sent up by Mr. Finke the moment he heard of the difficulty in which Mr. Stuart was placed. The party was also further increased, both by horses and men, so that when it left Chambers Creek, on the 1st of January, 1861, it numbered twelve men and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> horses.

Their place is at present occupied by the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> Hords or Banners of the Mongous, a pastoral nation, which consists of about two hundred thousand families. But the valor of the Huns had extended the narrow limits of their dominions; and their rustic chiefs, who assumed the appellation of Tanjou, gradually became the conquerors, and the sovereigns of a formidable empire. Towards the East, their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean; and the tribes, which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and the extreme...", "...supply the needs of the men, have added to the population and wealth of Cleveland.

They who had opposed the law saw their fears verified; as they had prophesied, silver began to replace gold in circulation; the latter was hoarded and used for foreign shipments; customs duties, which had hitherto been paid largely in gold, were now paid in paper currency; since gold was now more desired than silver, large amounts of paper were presented to the government for redemption in the more valuable metal.

The debate on the last clause of the resolution began, and it soon became apparent that the Whigs were outnumbered. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> peers who had supported the proposal of a regency--which implied that the royal title was still in James--were bound, of course, to oppose the proposition that the throne was vacant; and they were reenforced by several peers who held that that title had already devolved upon Mary.

The Record of Rites consists, according to the ordinary arrangement, of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> Chapters or Books. Liu Hsiang (see ch. I. sect. II. 2) took the lead in its formation, and was followed by the two famous scholars, Tai Teh [1], and his relative, Tai Shang [2]. The first of these reduced upwards of 200 chapters, collected by Hsiang, to eighty-nine, and Shang reduced these again to forty- six. The three other Books were added in the second century of our era, the Great Learning being one of them, by Ma Yung, mentioned in the last chapter, section III.2....", "...have expected to find some indication that the sage was the grandfather of the author, but nothing of the kind is given. The external evidence, however, or that from the testimony of authorities, is very strong. In Sze-ma Ch'ien's Historical Records, published about B.C. 100, it is expressly said that 'Tsze-sze made the Chung Yung.' And we have a still stronger proof, a century earlier, from Tsze-sze's own descendant, K'ung Fu, whose words are, 'Tsze-sze compiled the Chung Yung in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> p'ien [3].' We may, therefore, accept the received account without hesitation. 2. As Chi, spoken of chiefly by his designation of Tsze-sze, thus occupies a distinguished place in the classical literature of China, it 1 \u00a4\u00a4\u00b1e\u00b3\u00b9\u00a5y. 2 \u00a4l\u00ab\u00e4\u00a7@\u00a4\u00a4\u00b1e; see the \u00a5v\u00b0O,\u00a5|\u00a4Q\u00a4C,\u00a4\u00d5\u00a4l\u00a5@\u00aea. 3 This K'ung Fu (\u00a4\u00d5\u00ec{) was that descendant of Confucius, who hid several books in the wall of his house, on the issuing of the imperial edict for their burning. He was a writer himself, and his Works...", "...disgrace put on him by a youth, that he listened to the advice of evil counsellors, and made an attack on him to put him to death. The duke of Sung, hearing the tumult, hurried to the rescue, and when Chi found himself in safety, he said, 'When king Wan was imprisoned in Yu-li, he made the Yi of Chau. My grandfather made the Ch'un Ch'iu after he had been in danger in Ch'an and Ts'ai. Shall I not make something when rescued from such a risk in Sung?' Upon this he made the Chung Yung in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> p'ien. According to this account, the Chung Yung was the work of Tsze-sze's early manhood, and the tradition has obtained a wonderful prevalence. The notice in 'The Sacrificial Canon' says, on the contrary, that it was the work of his old age, when he had finally settled in Lu, which is much more likely [2]. Of Tsze-sze in Pi, which could hardly be said to be out of Lu, we have only one short notice,-- in Mencius, V. Pt. II. iii. 3, where the duke Hui of Pi is introduced...", "...will appear from the examination of the Chung Yung in the section iv below. His place in the temples of the Sage has been that of one of his four assessors, since the year 1267. He ranks with Yen Hui, Tsang Shan, and Mencius, and bears the title of 'The Philosopher Tsze-sze, Transmitter of the Sage [1].' SECTION III. ITS INTEGRITY. In the testimony of K'ung Fu, which has been adduced to prove the authorship of the Chung Yung, it is said that the Work consisted originally of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> p'ien. From this statement it is argued by some, that the arrangement of it in thirty-three chapters, which originated with Chu Hsi, is wrong [2]; but this does not affect the question of integrity, and the character p'ien is so vague and indefinite, that we cannot affirm that K'ung Fu meant to tell us by it that Tsze-sze himself divided his Treatise into so many paragraphs or chapters. It is on the entry in Liu Hsin's Catalogue, quoted section i,-- 'Two p'ien of...", "...looks to misjudge him. He, with nearly all the disciples whose names follow, first had a place assigned to him in the sacrifices to Confucius in A.D. 739.

Corresponding to the preceding, on the west, is the tablet of Fu Pu-ch'i styled Tsze-tsien (\u00ccW [al. \u00b1K and \u00d7{, all = \u00a5\u00f1] \u00a4\u00a3 \u00bb\u00f4, \u00a6r\u00a4l\u00bd\u00e2). He was a native of Lu, and, according to different accounts, thirty, forty, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years younger than Confucius. He was commandant of Tan-fu (\u00b3\u00e6\u00a4\u00f7\u00ae_), and hardly needed to put forth any personal effort. Wu-ma Ch'i had been in the same office, and had succeeded by dint of the greatest industry and toil. He asked Pu-ch'i how he managed so easily for himself, and was answered, 'I employ men; you employ men's strength.' People pronounced Fu to be a superior man.

Forces from New Hampshire and Connecticut joined the expedition at Canso; and this remarkable fortress, whose fortifications alone cost five million dollars, was besieged, and capitulated after <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> days, yielding to untrained soldiers; the victory owing to \"mere audacity and hardihood, backed by the rarest good luck\", as one English writer says.

But now, when two vast peoples, English and American, counting between them <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> millions, when the leaders of transcendent civilization (to say nothing of Germany and France) behold their entire educated class, male and female alike, calling out, not for _Panem et circenses_, (Give us this day our daily bread and our games of the circus,) but for _Panem et literas_, (Give us this day our daily bread and literature,) the universality of the call has swept away the very name of _bluestocking_; the very possibility of the ridicule has been undermined by...", "...are a great man [here a bitter sneer], I an obscure one [here Castruccio drew himself up]--I only come to discharge a debt to you which I find I have incurred.\" \"What tone is this, Castruccio; and what debt do you speak of?\" \"On my arrival in town yesterday,\" said the poet solemnly, \"I went to the man whom you deputed some years since to publish my little volume, to demand an account of its success; and I found that it had cost one hundred and twenty pounds, deducting the sale of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> copies which had been sold. /Your/ books sell some thousands, I am told. It is well contrived--mine fell still-born, no pains were taken with it--no matter--[a wave of the hand]. You discharged this debt, I repay you: there is a cheque for the money. Sir, I have done!

He reminded the poor poet that his verses were written in a foreign tongue--that even English poets of great fame enjoyed but a limited sale for their works--that it was impossible to make the avaricious public purchase what the stupid public would not take an interest in--in short, he used all those arguments which naturally suggested...", "...of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes or the firstfruits as a vintage.

The industrial efficiency of two men working without society might have differed as two to one--that is, while one man was able to produce a full quarter dollar's worth of work a day, the other could produce only twelve and a half cents' worth. This was a very great difference under those circumstances, but twelve and a half cents is so slight a proportion of...", "...Ludlow Ogden and Joseph Fellows, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have granted, bargained, sold, released and confirmed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, release and confirm unto the said Thomas Ludlow Ogden and Joseph Fellows, and to their heirs and assigns, all that certain tract or parcel of land situate, lying and being in the county of Erie and State of New York, commonly called and known by the name of Buffalo Creek Reservation, containing by estimation <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> thousand nine hundred and twenty acres, be the contents thereof more or less.

Dr. George T. Moore, director of the garden, made in his address of welcome a brief statement in regard to its origin in the private garden and by the later endowment of Mr. Henry Shaw. Mr. Shaw came to this country from England in 1818, and with a small stock of hardware began business in one room which also served as bedroom and kitchen. Within twenty years he had acquired a fortune and retired from active business to devote the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> years of his life to travel and to the management of a garden surrounding his country-home on the outskirts of St. Louis. In 1859 he erected a small museum and library, and in 1866 Mr. James Gurney was brought to this country as head gardener. Mr. Shaw died in 1889, leaving his estate largely for the establishment of the Missouri Botanical Garden, but providing also for the Henry Shaw School of Botany of Washington University and a park for the city. With this liberal...", "...in northern America, these vivid tints which give to the country the appearance of a land covered with a varied and brilliant garment, \"a coat of many colors.\" A soft hazy light pervaded the atmosphere, while at the same time the October air was gently exhilarating to the nervous system.

M. the canoe arrived at Hudson City, which is on the east bank of the river, and I completed a row of thirty-eight statute miles, according to local authority; but in reality <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> miles by the correct charts of the United States Coast Survey. After storing the Maria Theresa in a shed, I repaired to a dismal hotel for the night. At seven o'clock the next morning the river was mantled in a dense fog, but I pushed off and guided myself by the sounds of the running trains on the Hudson River Railroad. This corporation does such an immense amount of freighting that, if their freight trains were connected, a continuous line of eighty miles would...", "...had not been there above twenty-four hours before news was brought us by a trusty friend, that the tories, on Pedee, were mustering, in force, under a captain Barfield. This, as we learnt afterwards, was one of the companies that my uncle's old coachman had been so troubled about. We were quickly on horseback; and after a brisk ride of forty miles, came upon their encampment, at three o'clock in the morning. Their surprise was so complete, that they did not fire a single shot! Of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> men, who composed their company, we killed and took about thirty. The arms, ammunition, and horses of the whole party, fell into our hands, with which we returned to Britton's Neck, without the loss of a man. The rumor of these two exploits soon reached the British and their friends the tories, who presently despatched three stout companies to attack us. Two of the parties were British; one of them commanded by major Weymies, of house-burning memory. The third party...", "...reveal unto him the sciences of the celestials and the terrestrials, the knowledge of the present order of the world and the knowledge of the future order of the world. Furthermore, I have made him the guardian of the treasures of the palaces in the heaven 'Arabot, and of the treasures of life that are in the highest heaven.\" Out of the love He bore Enoch, God arrayed him in a magnificent garment, to which every kind of luminary in existence was attached, and a crown gleaming with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> jewels, the splendor of which pierced to all parts of the seven heavens and to the four corners of the earth. In the presence of the heavenly family, He set this crown upon the head of Enoch, and called him \"the little Lord.\" It bears also the letters by means of which heaven and earth were created, and seas and rivers, mountains and valleys, planets and constellations, lightning and thunder, snow and hail, storm and whirlwind--these and also all things needed in the world,...", "...marked with the names of giver and receiver, and placed in a large clothes-basket. At last all was done. I had wrapped up my knife, my pencil-case, my lettercase, for Steele, Blatchford, and Dick. To my wife I gave my gold watch-key, which fortunately fits her watch; to Hosanna, a mere trifle, a seal ring I wore; to Bertha, my gold chain; and to Sarah Blatchford, the watch which generally hung from it. For a few moments we retired to our rooms while the pretty Hosanna arranged the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> presents on the tree. Then she clapped her hands, and we rushed in. What a wondrous sight! What a shout of infantine laughter and charming prattle! for in that happy moment were we not all children again? I see my story hurries to its close. Dick, who is the tallest, mounted a step-ladder, and called us by name to receive our presents. I had a nice gold watch-key from Hosanna, a knife from Steele, a letter-case from Phebe, and a pretty pencil-case from Bertha.

I took the hint at once: the Indian who had come up to the fort was a great man--that was evident; I walked on with a majestic air, gathered up the velvet reins, and sprung into the magnificent high- peaked saddle. \"Buk, buk,\" said I. \"It is good. In the name of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> Imaums, let us ride on.\" And the whole party set off at a brisk trot, I keeping silence, and thinking with no little trepidation of what I was about to encounter. As we rode along, I heard two of the men commenting upon my unusual silence (for I suppose, I--that is the Indian--was a talkative officer). \"The lips of the Bahawder are closed,\" said one. \"Where are those birds of Paradise, his long-tailed words? they are imprisoned between the golden bars of his teeth!\"...", "...i. 58, 70, 94, 106, 179, 184; ii. 200, 306, 363; iii. 389, 393 Section II Fortunately, just when the great houses had attained the summit of their prosperity, and were beginning the slow decline to dissolution, learning and book-culture were freshly encouraged by the coming of the Friars. The Black Friars settled at Canterbury and in London, near the Old Temple in Holborn, in 1221. The Grey Friars were at London, Oxford, and Cambridge in 1224, and by 1256 they were in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-nine</span> different localities.[1] lt is strange how the latter order, founded by a man who forbade a novice to own a Psalter, came to be as earnest in buying books as the Benedictines were in copying them. St. Francis' ideal, however, was impossible. The peripatetic nature of their calling, and their duty of tending the sick, compelled many friars to learn foreign languages, and to acquire some medical knowledge. Books were, therefore, useful to them, if not essential; as indeed St...."]
