He had an appointment to meet Colonel Poindexter the next morning to consummate the purchase of some oil stock certain to appreciate fabulously in value. He had promised to listen further to Mr. Isidore Lewis regarding a plan for obtaining control of a certain line of one of the metal stocks. And he had signified his desire to make one of a party the affable younger man would guide later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to a sumptuous temple of chance, to which, by good luck, he had gained the entree. The three gentlemen parted most cordially from him after he had paid the check. To Mr. Lewis, when Colonel Poindexter had also left, the young man with a taste for gaming remarked, ingenuously: \"Say, Izzy, on the level, there's the readiest money that ever registered at this joint.

Unless especially asked about it, few men give particulars in this matter, yet they are extremely important. Women, on the other hand, are likely to take hot baths more frequently than is good for them. Especially when they have maids to assist in dressing and undressing, it is not unusual to find that women take two, and sometimes even three, hot baths in a day. They take them in the early morning when they first get up, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before dressing for dinner. I have known cases where some took a third hot bath before going to bed and sometimes even put in a fourth before luncheon in case they had had any exercise in the morning hours--tennis, or horseback riding, or the like--that made them perspire. These are details which the physician will learn only if he asks particularly about them. Until he has actually had the experience of finding that they play an important role in some ailment he is...", "...he had twelve pieces of ordnance brought up in front of the castle, provided them with gabionades, and once more sent a herald to summon the garrison to surrender. The reply was that the garrison would not surrender till it saw itself incapacitated from continuing the struggle. On the morning of the 29th the twelve pieces began to open fire against the defences of the gate. The besieged could only answer the attack with small pieces mounted on the summit of the towers. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> all these summits were dismantled, the roofs pierced, and the machicolations destroyed. Moreover, in the course of the 30th of September and 1st of October, four large bombards were mounted in front of the outer tower of the gate. In the evening this tower was falling in ruins into the ditch. Messire Charles d'Amboise, before commencing the assault, again proposed to the governor to capitulate. The latter then appeared on the ruins, and declared that he would...", "...his object was achieved, or did he meet with repulsion, he retired with a celerity that baffled pursuit to his unknown asylum. The Northmen became terror-stricken at the ravages which this secret foe was making upon them, and finally came to believe, with the superstition of the age, that the attacks were of a supernatural character. Gradually the king extended his assaults, harassing the Danes with hostility in a distant quarter as well as those near. By day and by night, at dawn, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> twilight, from woods and marshes, he was ever rushing on the Northmen with all the advantages of selection and surprise. But still the provisions grew less, and the king was sore put for supplies.

They were so merry inside there that all those outside were forgotten, and he was on the outside. Each day he could read <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> papers of the doings within this walled city. In the notices of passengers for Europe he read the names of eminent frequenters of his old resort.

Then said the little girl, \"Dear mother, do not weep, I will go and seek my brothers.\" So she took the twelve shirts and went far and wide in the great forest. The day sped on, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she came to the enchanted house. She went in and found a youth, who asked, \"Whence do you come, and what do you want?\" and he marvelled at her beauty, her royal garments, and the star on her forehead.

The two returned silently up the mountain side, to the higher levels, where the light still lingered, though the sun was down. At the Lookout they stopped. \"We'll wait for the moon, here,\" she said; and so seated on a big rock, they watched the last of the evening go out from the west.

Instead of making the announcement that she had promised for the dinner hour, Mrs. Livingston later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> visited the campfire about which the greater part of the camp had assembled and there she told the girls what she had to say. It was in reference to what had occurred on the previous evening. \"I take pleasure, young ladies,\" she said, \"in informing you that for heroic conduct in the face of great peril, Miss Harriet Burrell has been awarded five honors. She will add five more beads to her string to-morrow.\" Harriet blushed. \"How much doeth thhe get for the...", "...the pursuers. In the evening, at the house of Gracchus, where the events of the day are discussed, Calpurnius, who had been in the thickest of the fight, but had escaped unhurt, relates the fate of Zabdas. The scene is one for the pencil: \"Calpurnius had been in the thickest of the fight, but had escaped unhurt. He was near Zabdas when he fell, and revenged his death by hewing down the soldier who had pierced him with his lance. \"'Zabdas,' said Calpurnius, when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we recalled the sad events of the day, 'was not instantly killed by the thrust of the spear, but falling backward from his horse, found strength and life enough remaining to raise himself upon his knee, and cheer me on, as I flew to revenge his death upon the retreating Roman.

Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail. When I had made twenty-four leagues, by my reckoning, from the island of Blefuscu, I saw a sail steering to northeast. I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened, and in half an hour she spied me and discharged a gun. I came up with her between five and six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on the 26th of September, 1701, but my heart leaped within me to see her English colours. I put my cows and sheep into my pockets and got on board with all my little cargo. The captain received me with kindness and asked me to tell him what place I came from last, but at my answer he thought I was raving. However, I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him.

They are followed by older children who come to afternoon classes, while <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> every room is filled with grown persons who meet in some form of study, club or social life. But if you should go there now you would find instead of one building, with which Miss Addams began, thirteen buildings and forty persons living there to help to teach anyone who may come to Hull House.

The journal gave the names of the officers. Fitz was wondering whether Eve Challoner ever saw the Globe. Mrs. Ingham-Baker became lost in a maternal fit of admiration. She was looking at Agatha with her head on one side. At intervals she glanced towards Fitz--an inviting glance, as if to draw his attention to the fact that one of Nature's most perfect productions was waiting...", "...the vessels rolled tremendously at their anchors. Most of the troops suffered terribly from seasickness. The next day, the weather continued thick and stormy. On the 6th there was fog, but towards noon the wind went down, whereupon the signal was made, the boats were lowered, and the troops took their places in them. Scarcely had they done so, when the wind rose again, and the sea got up so rapidly that the landing was postponed. The next day the fog and heavy surf continued, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the sea grew calmer, and orders were issued for the troops to take to the boats, at two o'clock next morning. This was done, and the frigates got under sail, and steered for the four points at which the real or pretended attacks were to be made, and, anchoring within easy range, opened fire soon after daylight; while the boats, in three divisions, rowed towards the shore.

And, knowing Herman's pride, he assured him that the hill need never learn of Anna's flight, and if any inquiries came he advised him to say the girl was sick. In Rudolph's twisted mind it was not so much Anna's delinquency that enraged him. The hill had its own ideas of morality. But he was fiercely jealous, with that class-jealousy which was the fundamental actuating motive of his life.

They had made some progress in English; and though Signor Armari was still rather melancholy, we got on much better; but to my annoyance and chagrin, I could scarcely see anything of him or his friend. In the daytime, Cornelius kept me in his studio, which they never entered but twice in my absence; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he either went out with them, or got me in a corner of the sofa, and sat most pertinaciously by me. Once, however, he was late, and accordingly found me between his two friends, hearing them through the universal verb, to love, which one pronounced, \"I loaf,\" and the other, \"I loove.\" They laughed good- humouredly at their own mistakes, and I laughed too; but Cornelius seemed to think it no joke, and looked on with a face of tragic gloom.

Five grains of opium, given at the time the cough commenced disturbed the period, from seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to eleven, at which time it regularly returned for some days, during which time the opium was gradually omitted.

After this there was rest and music till four, and then outdoor work or play, lawn-tennis being a very favourite pastime, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they had more music, and a game at cards.

As he stood there, tall, fair, and broad- shouldered, his calm face with its slightly mocking expression at the corners of the mouth showed not a sign of fatigue or of emotion, and the boisterous greeting of his mother and sister subsided of itself. While he was eating, and drinking tea, his sister, sitting opposite, gazed steadfastly at him. She was in love with him, as most...", "...one, who repents of a letter that he wrote yesterday and who will leave Paris to-morrow if you do not forgive him, wishes to know at what hour he might lay his repentance at your feet. \"When can he find you alone? for, you know, confessions must be made without witnesses.\" I folded this kind of madrigal in prose, and sent it by Joseph, who handed it to Marguerite herself; she replied that she would send the answer later.

'The great folk are terribly scared,' said my portress, but the small fry triumphed: it was their turn. So much had never been said about work before, and so little was never done. People walked about all day, planted liberty-trees at every street-corner, illuminated willy-nilly, and perorated in the clubs and squares until midnight. The Exchange rang with disasters in the morning: <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it sparkled with lanterns and fireworks. It was the gayest anarchy for the lower classes of Paris, who had no police and looked after themselves. The street-boys ran about with flags; workmen without work, but paid nevertheless, walked in perpetual procession; the demireps had kicked over the traces, and on the sidewalks the most virtuous fellow-citizenesses were hugged without ceremony: it must be added that they did not resent it too much.

They came under the command of their caziques, and one of our soldiers named Barrientos, and marched into Sempoalla in the best military order possible, two abreast. They were all tall and powerful men, armed with their immense-sized lances and huge shields; every lancer was followed by a bowman.

It will be his own act which causes it, but I will not allow Mr. R---- to accompany me under false pretences.\" Having concluded our bargain with the skipper at a tolerably fair rate, and laid in a stock of stores and provisions, the party sailed from Mobile at five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of Tuesday, May 14, with the flag of the Confederate States flying; but, as a precautionary measure, I borrowed from our acting Consul, Mr. Magee, a British ensign, which, with a flag of truce, would win the favorable consideration of the United States squadron.

There being nothing in the address on the matter of woman suffrage, the society desired the speaker to address them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on that subject. Accordingly a meeting was held, and despite the fatigue of the day, there was a good attendance and considerable interest. A good dinner was provided on the grounds, and afterwards they had singing and speaking. Mr. Hendershot addressed the children.

The plebian Dutch supper is the very latest mode of dispensing hospitality, and has, as yet, the charm of novelty. The hours range from six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> until midnight, and during the heated term is very popular as the windup of a trolley or automobile ride. Now, it would not do to seat an American crowd to a genuine Dutch supper, in all its glory of limburger and sour-kraut, but relieve it of the disagreeables, and a menu, not fancy, but simple and eatable, remains. The table must be covered with the whitest of linen, while the decorations should be blue and red, thus to combine effectively Holland's national...", "...June sixth, and closing the evening of June twelfth, was crowded with literary and musical exercises of high order.

There are three healthy and vigorous societies at Fisk, and it was difficult to tell which of the three gave the best evidence of the superior quality of its drill, in the exercises presented.

Trimmy then came joyfully, and performed in half an hour what her master could not have effected before night. When he had gotten them all collected, and settled at their food, he went away <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to seek for his friend Croudy, to have some amusement with him. He found him lying in a little hollow, conversing with himself, and occasionally with Mumps, who paid very little attention to what he said. He now and then testified his sense of the honour intended to him, by giving two or three soft indolent strokes with his tail upon the ground, but withall neither lifted his head nor opened his eyes.

Anna should really have been going to school now, but she suffered a good deal from the cold and was altogether not very strong, so Pelle and Ellen dared not expose her to the long wading through the snow, and taught her themselves. Ellen had become a little lazy about walking, and seldom went into town; the two men made the purchases for her <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on their way home. It was a dull time, and no work was done by artificial light, so they were home early. Ellen had changed the dinner-hour to five, so that they could all have it together. After dinner Brun generally went upstairs to work for another couple of hours. He was busy working out projects for the building on the Hill Farm land, and gave himself no rest.

Next day, in passing places covered with mud, deposited by the dry branches on the way, the foot prints of the captives were distinctly traced, until the pursuers had learned to discriminate not only the number, but the peculiar form of each foot print. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the fifteenth day's pursuit, from a little eminence, they discovered in the distance before them, through the woods, a smoke and the light of a fire. The palpitation of their parental hearts may be easily imagined. They could not doubt that it was the camp of the captors of their children. The plan of recapture was intrusted entirely to Boone. He led his company as near the enemy as he deemed might be done with safety, and selecting a position under the shelter of a...", "...honour to know him only for two days. \"Sir\" he said, with barefaced impudence, \"having recognised in you a man of great intelligence, I felt certain that you would at once see the advantages of my offer, and that you would not raise any objection.\" \"You must see your mistake by this time, and most likely you will take me for a fool now you see that I should believe myself a dupe if I accepted.\" He left me with an apology for having troubled me, and saying that he hoped to see me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at St. Mark's Square, where he would be with Madame C----, he gave me his address, telling me that he had retained possession of his apartment unknown to his father. This was as much as to say that he expected me to return his visit, but if I had been prudent I should not have done so. Disgusted at the manner in which that man had attempted to get hold of me, I no longer felt any inclination to try my fortune with his mistress, for it seemed evident that they were...", "...my back in the mud. The fact that I was again _enceinte_, and the other fact that I was covered with dirt, ought to have prompted me to return to the palace at once, but how un-Louise-like the straight and sane course would have been.

Unfortunately, a reporter heard of the incident and, for the benefit of his pocket, made a column out of it. A few hours after the story appeared <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> paper, the palace was in an uproar. The King wasn't well enough to scold me, so he delegated that pleasant duty to Prince George.

Green Lane <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light had a fairy air. The stumpy trees on either side with the bright new green of the spring seemed to be concealing lamps within their branches. So thick a glow suffused the air that it was as though strangely coloured fruit, purple and orange and amethyst, hung glittering against the pale yellow sky, and the road running up the hill was like pale wax.

Before, however, any of the other ships could get into action the Frenchmen hauled their wind and stood away to the eastward, under all the sail they could set.

On December 21, 22, and 23 there were large parties of the nobility at Count Firmian's, at which vocal and instrumental music was performed from five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> until eleven.

He had lost sight, he said, of Rochford, and though he had hunted about in every direction, he could not rejoin him. He hoped, however, that he would before long find his way home. Latterly we became somewhat uneasy at the non-appearance of our countryman. Could he possibly have fallen into the hands of Indians? If so, anxious as he was to serve them, they, ignorant of this, would kill and...", "...to have a second line of retreat.\" \"It _was_ rather convenient, as things turned out,\" interposed Tommy. \"Very,\" admitted Latimer drily. \"They got back to the garden just as I had opened one of the windows, and shot at me from behind the hedge.

By this time we were again just off the entrance to Queenborough, and the thick haze that had obscured everything earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was rapidly thinning away. A watery moon showed up the various warships at anchor--dim grey formless shapes, marked by blurred lights. \"What do you say?\" he asked, turning to Tommy. \"Shall we run in here and pick up some moorings? Before we go any further I want to hear Lyndon's part of the story, and then we all three shall know exactly where we are.

After the Te Deum, the authorities gave a grand dinner to the officers of the garrison at the \"Ville de Metz.\" The weather was fine and the windows were open, and the hall was lighted by clusters of lamps hanging from the ceiling. Catherine and I went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to enjoy the spectacle. We could see the uniforms and the black coats sitting side by side around the long tables, and first the mayor would rise, and then his assistants, or the new commandant of the post, Mr. Brandon, to drink to the health of the Emperor or of his ministers, of France, to peace or to victory, etc., etc., and this they kept up till midnight.

Perhaps, the bells which she had heard ringing earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> were to call the students to the dining-room. Hester had not understood that, but it really made little difference. She would not have ventured alone into the dining-hall though she were starving. The hall-girl from the west dormitory had evidently forgotten her. It was the duty of hall-girls to play the part of hostess to new students. Fortunately for Hester, there were other persons more thoughtful than the hall-girls. Hester had reached the stage where a good...", "...A curtain of lace, covered with stars and ending in rich gold embroidery, hangs over each side. When Marie Louise's walks were limited to the terrace of the Tuileries, by the side of the sheet of water that bounds the garden, a small doorway with an iron grating was thrown open into the first floor of the palace, to make easier her access to the spot. Around the grating the crowd used to gather to watch the Empress and respectfully to offer her their best wishes. At nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of March 19th, 1811, the great bell of Notre Dame and all the church bells sounded, bidding the faithful spend the night in prayer and to invoke the blessings of Heaven on their Empress and the child which was about to enter the world. With Marie Louise there were M. Dubois, the Duchess of Montebello, the Countess of Lu\u00e7ay, Mesdames Durand and Ballant, ladies-in-waiting, ladies of the bedchamber, etc., and Madame Blaise. The Emperor, his mother and sisters, and two...", "...wooden shutters to keep the worst of the rain out, and across his own room's window he has a frame covered with greased paper.

One wonders what supports all this, for the business of the town seems of little account.

The police had marched out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to her place to protect her in. I was eager to see this lady, who enjoys a world-wide fame, so sent her my card requesting an interview, which she declined. I caught a glimpse of her in the hall as she passed out with her friend and guard. She is a very stout, loud-voiced lady, not pretty.

Evidence may be direct or indirect. If a man sees a boy steal a bag of apples from the orchard across the way, his evidence is direct. If instead, he only sees him with an empty bag and later with a full one, the evidence will be indirect. If you testify that early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> you saw a tramp enter a barn which later in the evening caught fire, your testimony as regards the cause of the fire would be indirect evidence against the tramp. If you can testify that you saw sparks fall from his lighted pipe and ignite a pile of hay in the barn, the evidence which you give will be direct. Direct evidence has more weight than indirect, but often the latter is nearly equal to the former and is sufficient to convince us.

They were in the open, under shelter of some thick grass; the bull was half sitting up, and his head and horn <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light might have been taken for the stump of a broken tree. The cow was not visible at first, but almost immediately after they sighted the bull, she heaved herself up and stood a silhouette against the sky.

It is well known that many of the special magistrates are totally unprincipled men, monsters of cruelty, lust, and despotism.

He was out to find and analyse Potterism, so much of it as lay hid in the rocky Cornish coves and the grave Cornish people. Katherine Varick was the only member of the party who knew that he was also seeking and finding it in the hidden souls of his fellow-seekers. 2 They would meet <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with the various contributions to the subject which they had gathered during the day. The Urban District Council, said Johnny, wanted to pull down the village street and build an esplanade to attract visitors; all the villagers seemed pleased. That was Potterism, the welcoming of ugliness and prosperity; the antithesis of the artist's spirit, which loved beauty for what it was, and did not want to exploit it. Their landlady, said Juke, on Sunday, had looked coldly on...", "...had been so happy, so happy. \"What text did you get?\" she asked quickly, so as to take his thoughts away from it. \"I don't know it by heart,\" he said evasively, and his cheeks that had grown pale flamed. \"But it suited.\" And with that he went out of the door. He went straight home--why should he waste any more time? the matter was urgent. He did not notice the starlings flying in and out of their boxes on the tall pines, did not notice that there was already a bright crescent <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> sky that was growing darker and darker, and a golden star near it, he only noticed with satisfaction as he entered the hall at the villa that the coats and hats had disappeared from the pegs. That was good, the visitors had left. He rushed to the drawing-room, he almost fell into the room. His father and mother were still sitting there--no, his father and she, the--the---- \"Come, tell us where you've been such along time,\" inquired his father, not without a touch of...", "...strange about him.\" \"Yes, he is a bit queer; but how on earth could he have stolen the box if he did not even go behind the counter?\" \"He couldn't; but still I mistrust him.\" \"I wonder where Ambrosio was all this time?\" mused Billie. \"Tied up at home, most likely. An American among Americans would hardly feel like traveling around with a hand organ and a monkey,\" was Don's emphatic reply. Upon arriving at Santiago's residence they were told that Strong had been there earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and seemed much disappointed at not finding them at home. \"Did he leave any word?\" asked Billie of the portero. \"None, senor; but Donna Lucia would like to see you in the library.\" \"What is the matter? Is Santiago worse?\" \"No, senor. He is sleeping quietly. I could not say what she wants, but she seemed considerably disturbed.\" \"Better go up alone, Billie,\" said Donald. \"If we are needed, you can call us.

So to my office for a little business and then home, my mind having been all this day in most extraordinary trouble and care for my father, there being so great an appearance of my uncle's going away with the greatest part of the estate, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> by Gosnell's coming I do put off these thoughts to entertain myself with my wife and her, who sings exceeding well, and I shall take great delight in her, and so merrily to bed. 6th.

We were much in need of clothing, particularly shoes, and these were issued to us while at Harrison's Landing; also the medical department ordered whiskey and quinine occasionally as a prevention against malarial fever, as had been done while we were on the Chickahominy. Most of the soldiers would have preferred to take this dose unmixed, dispensing with the quinine. We had regular drum and bugle calls and bands played <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at this camp. Promotions took place among the soldiers--I was made a sergeant, the youngest sergeant in the regiment at that time. Shortly after midnight on August first a heavy fire from field pieces on the south side of the James, which quickly aroused the entire army, was opened on our camps and the many vessels in the river. Our batteries at the river opened fire; so did the gun-boats. For more than half an hour there was a tremendous noise of guns and exploding...", "...of mind in which you went. Lawrence had said, \"Victory--Victory is a state of mind.\" Well--it was a state that came naturally to Nicky, and did not come naturally to him. It was all very well for Nicky: he had wanted to go. He had gone out victorious before victory. Michael would go beaten before defeat. He thought: \"If this is volunteering, give me compulsion.\" All the same he was going. All morning and afternoon, as he walked and walked, his thoughts went the same round. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they began again, but on a new track. He thought: \"It's all very well to say I'm going; but how _can_ I go?\" He had Lawrence Stephen's work to do; Lawrence's Life and Letters were in his hands. How could he possibly go and leave Lawrence dead and forgotten? This view seemed to him to be sanity and common sense. As his mind darted up this turning it was driven back. He saw Lawrence Stephen smiling at him as he had smiled at him when Reveillaud died. Lawrence would have...", "...Like some blue day That grows more lovely as it fades away, Gaining that calm serenity and height Of colour wanted, as the solemn night Steals forward thou shalt sweetly fall asleep For ever and for ever; I shall weep A day and night large tears upon thy face, Laying thee then beneath a rose-red place Where I may muse and dedicate and dream Volumes of poesy of thee; and deem It happiness to know that thou art far From any base desires as that fair star Set <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> magnitude of heaven.

Moses began to try and get me to purchase a ring from him, and I judged from that that I should not have to press them very much. \"I can only buy this ring from Leah's hands,\" said I. He grinned, thinking doubtless that I intended to make her a present of it, but I was resolved to disappoint him. I gave them a magnificent dinner and supper, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they were shewn a double-bedded room not far from mine. I might have put them in different rooms, and Leah in a room adjoining mine, which would have facilitated any nocturnal excursions; but after all I had done for her I was resolved to owe nothing to a surprise; she should come of herself. The next day Moses (who noticed that I had not yet bought the ring) was obliged to go out on business, and asked for the loan of my carriage for the whole day, telling me that he...", "...several times, and took great pains to settle the dispute between the counts and their subjects. When matters were settled Luther began to think of returning home; but God had decided otherwise. [Illustration: Luther's Death.] 3. LUTHER'S ILLNESS AND DEATH. Already on the 17th of February Luther could not attend the meetings because of his increasing weakness. In accordance with the advice of his friends and the counts he remained in his room and rested. About eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he took his medicine and lay down on his couch, saying, \"If I could sleep for half an hour I believe I would improve.\" He now slept calmly till ten o'clock, when he awoke, arose, and went into his bedroom. As he entered the room he said, \"In the name of God, I am going to bed. Into Thy hands I commend my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, Thou faithful God.\" At one o'clock he awoke and said, \"O Lord God, I feel so bad! Ah, dear Dr. Jonas, I believe I shall die here at...", "...call was made on Otoo, and with the usual exchange of presents the old footing was re-established. On the return from this visit a stop was made \"at the dockyards, for such they deserve to be called,\" and the canoes in construction were inspected, two of them being the largest the Englishmen had yet seen. The king soon after returned the visit, and requested that the big guns should be fired, but Cook thinks it was very doubtful if the experience was enjoyed. A display of fireworks <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was much more to the native taste. Referring to the numerous robberies that had been committed, Cook says he found it far the best to deal mildly with the delinquents, and the regulations he made were, as a rule, well kept by the natives. He was now better pleased with his reception, and concluded that the island was in a more prosperous condition than at his last visit. When the ship was ready to resume her voyage, several young natives volunteered to accompany her, and...", "...let 'em way, WAY out! So I guess Willie would look too funny in 'em after they're fixed; an' anyway, Mr. Parcher, the secret won't be home from the tailor's for two weeks, an' maybe by that time Miss Pratt'll be gone.\" They had reached Mr. Parcher's gate; he halted and looked down fondly upon this child who seemed to have read his soul. \"Do you honestly think so?\" he asked. \"Well, anyway, Mr. Parcher,\" said Jane, \"mamma said--well, she said she's sure Willie wouldn't come here <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> any more when YOU're at home, Mr. Parcher--'cause after he'd been wearin' the secret every night this way he wouldn't like to come and not have the secret on. Mamma said the reason he would feel like that was because he was seventeen years old. An' she isn't goin' to tell him anything about it, Mr. Parcher. She said that's the best way.\" Her new friend nodded and seemed to agree. \"I suppose that's what you meant when you said he wasn't coming back but didn't know it...", "...that age it is not easy to explain one's self so that older people can understand. She could only have said, \"I hate it. It comes so fast. It is always coming. It makes a sound as if thunder was quite close. I can never get away from it.\" The children in the other flats rather liked it. They hung out of the window perilously to watch it thunder past and to see the people who crowded it pressed close together in the seats, standing in the aisles, hanging on to the straps. Sometimes <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> there were people in it who were going to the theatre, and the women and girls were dressed in light colours and wore hats covered with white feathers and flowers. At such times the children were delighted, and Judith used to hear the three in the next flat calling out to each other, \"That's MY lady! That's MY lady! That one's mine!\" Judith was not like the children in the other flats. She was a frail, curious creature, with silent ways and a soft voice and eyes. She...", "...it ought to be. \"I believe you would take anybody's part against me,\" Lady Ball had said, and then as a matter of course she had been very cross. The whole of that day was terrible to Miss Mackenzie, and she resolved that nothing said by her cousin should induce her to postpone her departure for another day. In order to insure this by a few minutes' private conversation with him, and also with the view of escaping for some short time from the house, she walked down to the station <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to meet her cousin. The train by which he arrived reached Twickenham at five o'clock, and the walk occupied about twenty minutes. She met him just as he was coming out of the station gate, and at once told him that she had come there for the sake of walking back with him and talking to him. He thanked her, and said that he was very glad to meet her. He also wanted to speak to her very particularly. Would she take his arm? She took his arm, and then began with a quick...", "...move and breathe within one short flight of a cuckoo from this home of Pan. One could not but at first feelingly remember the old Boer saying: \"O God, what things man sees when he goes out without a gun!\" But soon the infinite incongruity of this juxtaposition began to produce within one a curious eagerness, a sort of half-philosophical delight. It began to seem too good, almost too romantic, to be true. To think of the gramophone wedded to the thin sweet singing of the olive leaves <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> wind; to remember the scent of his rank cigar marrying with this wild incense; to read that enchanted name, \"Inn of Tranquillity,\" and hear the bland and affable remark of the gentleman who owned it--such were, indeed, phenomena to stimulate souls to speculation. And all unconsciously one began to justify them by thoughts of the other incongruities of existence--the strange, the passionate incongruities of youth and age, wealth and poverty, life and death; the wonderful...", "...was asked for his prayers, as a means of deliverance from the plague. After quoting Scripture and urging them to works of repentance, he said, \"Let no one of you now go to his fields, thinking that by human care you can ward off the locusts.\" All were affected by this advice, and assembled in church, acknowledging with tears their sinful courses. Only one poor man, from anxiety about his land, while the rest were at church was absent all day, trying to drive away the locusts, and only <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> found time to join the rest at church. But next morning he found his field devoured by the locusts, while the other fields had escaped. This occurrence made a great impression, which Severinus turned to account by teaching them how their duties towards God should take precedence of everything else. But he also added, \"It is but reasonable that by your bounty this poor man should be maintained during the present year, seeing that by the punishment he has suffered he has...", "...Especially was she tried at Madame de Netteville's. For Robert's sake she tried for a time to put aside her first impression and to bear Madame de Netteville's evenings--little dreaming, poor thing, all the time that Madame de Netteville thought her presence at the famous 'Fridays' an incubus only to be put up with because her husband was becoming socially an indispensable. But after two or three Fridays Catherine's endurance failed her. On the last occasion she found herself late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> hemmed in behind Madame de Netteville and a distinguished African explorer, who was the lion of the evening. Eugenie de Netteville had forgotten her silent neighbor, and presently, with some biting little phrase or other, she asked the great man his opinion on a burning topic of the day, the results of Church missions in Africa. The great man laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and ran lightly through a string of stories in which both missionaries and converts played parts...", "...and five thousand opera chairs. Several necessary committees were organized and George Ingram's gospel of Helpfulness found another practical expression. The Educational Bureau was not a gratuity in any of its departments, as small fees were charged in all the evening classes, which were crowded with old and young.

By 7:30 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the Central Hall was packed to the walls, no reserved seats were sold, and the rule was observed \"First come, first served,\" which brought promptly the audience. Season ticket-holders had the exclusive right to the hall till 7:25 o'clock, when a limited number of single admission tickets were sold. A large force of polite ushers assisted in seating the people, and in keeping order. At 7:30 all the entrance doors were closed, so that late comers never disturbed the...", "...myself with the Canadian people, which must ever be a bright epoch in my life. I shall bear away with me a grateful remembrance of kindness and affection which, as yet, I have been unable to do anything to merit; and it shall be the constant effort of my future years to prove myself not unworthy of the love and confidence of a generous people.\" Fire-works, a state concert, a visit to the Central School, a luncheon at the Royal Hotel, a visit to the waterworks and a grand ball <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> were amongst the events of the stay in Hamilton. On September 20th the last address received and answered by His Royal Highness in Canada was presented by the Agricultural Society of Upper Canada. To its loyal phrases the King and Emperor of a distant future made this final response: \"My duties as representative of the Queen, deputed by her to visit British North America, cease this day; but in a private capacity I am about to visit, before I return home, that remarkable...", "...of Marion, to our assistance, the works advanced with rapidity. Such was their forwardness on the 10th, that it was determined to summon the commandant. A flag was accordingly despatched to Captain M'Pherson, stating to him with truth our relative situation, and admonishing him to avoid the disagreeable consequences of an arrogant temerity. To this the captain replied, that, disregarding consequences, he should continue to resist to the last moment. The retreat of Rawdon was known <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the besiegers; and in the course of the night a courier arrived from General Greene confirming that event, urging redoubled activity, and communicating his determination to hasten to their support. Urged by these strong considerations, Marion and Lee persevered throughout the night in pressing the completion of their works. On the next day, Rawdon reached the country opposite to Fort Motte; and in the succeeding night encamping on the highest ground in his route, the...", "...enormous as they were, were not guarded by a large force, the besiegers not dreaming that the batteries prepared for attack could be themselves attacked! The Governor instantly perceived the value of this information, but kept it to himself, and had the deserter closely confined lest he should incautiously reveal to others what he had told to him. Keeping his own counsel, he made his preparations, which he did not disclose even to his lieutenants until the moment for action. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when he called them together, and announced his intention to make an attack on the works of the besiegers _that very night_, and at midnight about two thousand men were in arms on the \"Red Sands,\" now the Alameda, to carry the daring purpose into execution. Their orders were of the strictest kind: \"Each man to have thirty-six rounds of ammunition, with a good flint in his piece and another in his pocket. No drums to go out, excepting two with each of the regiments. _No...", "...to do so. Then he gave a yell and started to sing a ridiculous song about the milkmaid and the summer boarder. When he had finished one verse he took another \"fit\" of laughter, but somehow the audience did not see it his way, and when he tried it again, he broke off with an explanation. He felt sure that the people did not quite understand the joke, and he tried to tell them how very funny it was. To relieve the situation another person came on. One side of the figure was draped <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> garb of a lady, while the other wore the full dress suit of a gentleman. The illusion was not at all bad, especially when the \"person\" waltzed with himself, with his arms around the other side of the evening dress the effect was really funny. \"That's Spencer,\" declared Jack to Hazel. \"He did that at college. Isn't it great?\" \"Very funny,\" admitted Hazel, while the man made in halves bowed on one side first, then on the other, to his applause. \"Mabel is going to...", "...the nuisance of their presence, and goes so far as to appropriate to their exclusive use two streets in the neighbourhood of the Campo de Santa Anna.\" A little further on the traveller remarks,-- \"Any one who saw Rio de Janeiro only by day would come to the conclusion that the population consisted entirely of negroes.

During the day all remain indoors, and pass the time between their couches and their looking-glasses. The only places where a man can enjoy the society of the ladies are the theatres and the churches.\" During the sail from Brazil to the Cape of Good Hope nothing occurred deserving special mention. On the 7th March the _Uranie_ anchored in Table Bay.

Martin stayed close around the house all day.

Most likely when the other miners hear of it they will drive them out of the place.\" It was only when Dick came over <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that they first learned what had happened in the mining town. The young man was much animated this evening, and told in an amusing way the whole story. \"Tom is really a brick,\" he declared. \"I knew that he was all gold, as the miners say, but it takes something out of the ordinary to stir him up. Then when he is once aroused it will be well for his opponents to be on their guard.\" \"What has he been doing now?\" Nance queried, unable to restrain her eagerness to hear...", "...was he to have nothing? And then, though no accusation was made against him, though no one had insinuated that he had been to blame in the matter, still there was apparent among them all a strong feeling against him. Who had made away with this will, as to the existence of which at one time there was no doubt? Of course the idea was present to his mind that they must think that he had done so. In such circumstances it was not singular that he should say nothing and do nothing. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Mr Apjohn, just before he left the house, asked Cousin Henry a question, and received an answer. \"Mrs Griffith tells me, Mr Jones, that you were closeted with your uncle for about an hour immediately after the Cantors had left him on that Tuesday,--just after the signatures had been written. Was it so?\" Again the drops of sweat came out and stood thick upon his forehead.

If that had happened, I should not have exactly suspected M---- M----, but the ambassador would have thought that I had caused the scheme to miscarry.

But again the _daemon_, that still small voice echoing from the far-off shores of the ocean of time, whispers in our ear, \"In the morning sow thy seed, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.\" So we sow in weakness and in fear and trembling, \"line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a little,\" sometimes in mirth and laughter, sometimes in tears.

Mrs. Gibson, it is true, was ready to go over the ground as many times as any one liked; but her words were always like ready-made clothes, and never fitted individual thoughts. Anybody might have used them, and, with a change of proper names, they might have served to describe any ball.

It was not till eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that the public mind was relieved at last from all suspense by an announcement that the child was born, and screaming lustily; that the mother was wonderfully well, considering all things; and that Mr. Orridge had covered himself with distinction by the skill, tenderness, and attention with which he had performed his duties. On the next day, and the next, and for a week after that, the accounts were still favorable. But on the tenth day a catastrophe was reported. The...", "...himself to the expense of a lawsuit in which he was certain to be beaten, he relinquished them to Monroe, and filed his claim for the money against Sandford's estate.

Presently he saw Jeffreys disappear into the shop, and what was his amazement, when presently he \"casually\" passed the door, to see him seated with the bookseller at a table earnestly poring over and discussing a small faded sheet of paper which lay between them! Trimble would have given worlds to know what the mysterious document was, and what villainy was brewing. Had he known it, he might not have stood out there <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> air quite as patiently as he did. For the mysterious document happened to be nothing but an old tattered and torn Commonwealth tract which Jeffreys had discovered folded up between the leaves of an ancient volume of poetry, and which he and his friend the bookseller were spending a very agreeable half-hour in piecing together and deciphering. About seven o'clock Jeffreys rose to go, pocketing the precious relic, which his friend had given him; and Trimble, having...", "...her.

You know these are the correct figures, and they are enough for me. That evening, then, my mother will be delighted, because, in her heart, what is it she desires for me? What all good mothers desire for their sons--a good marriage, or a discreet liaison with some one in society. At Longueval I...", "...ago, on Mustapha's and Mariette's business. 'By God! this English way is wonderful,' said a witness, 'that English Bey questioned me till my stomach came out.' I loved Mustapha Bey, who was with him; such a nice, kind, gentle creature, and very intelligent and full of good sense. I rejoice to hear that he returns my liking, and has declared himself 'one of my darweeshes.' Talking of darweeshes reminds me of the Festival of Sheykh Gibrieel this year. I had forgotten the day, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> some people came for me to go and eat some of the meat of the Sheykh, who is also a good patron of mine, they say; being a poor man's saint, and of a humble spirit, it is said he favours me. There was plenty of meat and _melocheea_ and bread; and then _zikrs_ of different kinds, and a _Gama el Fokara_ (assembly of the poor). _Gama_ is the true word for Mosque--_i.e._, Meeting, which consists in a great circle of men seated thick on the ground, with two poets facing...", "...gone with him, to gently chide when sinners should entice, and lead him from error's path, should gay temptation lure him therein!

It was a late hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that the coach entered the metropolis. Railroads were not then in vogue, and large baggage-waggons, lumbering teams and clumsy coaches, were drawn by two or more horses, over deep-rutted roads, and almost endless turnpikes. The bells had-rang their nine o'clock peal; most of the stores were closed; the busy trader and industrious mechanic had gone to their respective homes, and left their property to faithful watchers, whose muffled forms moved slowly through the...", "...the fine sand, among the bunches of dried grass. But forward they drove, and broke into a ragged, sliding charge up the breast of the dunes. \"Hold your fire, men! Hold it--then give 'em Hell!\" the Master shouted. He was in the first wave of the assault. Close by came Rrisa, his brown face contracted with fanatic hate of the Beni Harb, despoilers of the Haram sanctuary. There, too, was \"Captain Alden,\" grim with masked face. There was Bohannan, Leclair--and pistol-barrels flickered <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> glow, and half the men gripped knives in their left hands, as well. For this was to be a killing without quarter, to the very end. CHAPTER XXIII A MISSION OF DREAD Panting, with a slither of dry sand under their laboring feet, the Legionaries charged. At any second, a raking volley might burst from the dunes. The lethal pellets--so few in this vast space--might not have taken effect. Not one heart there but was steeling itself against ambush and a...", "...had gone, but she did not. With eyes blinded with tears she waved to him from the platform as he leaned half out of the window watching to see the last of her, and he was gone.

About two hours later, when in the middle of its longest non-stop run, Marston Seward fell from the train. There were headlines <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> paper posters, but somehow or other Melian did not notice these. It was not until the next day, when they opened their morning paper, that the tragedy rose up and hit them between the eyes--name, description, everything, for by this time identification had been easily obtained. Melian hardly knew how she lived through that stunning blow--perhaps because it was a stunning one. But the shock was too much for her mother--the shock only, for there was little if any...", "...but little better. In a lower class, Luke Watson stood second, Buster Beggs fourth, and Chip Macklin fifth. Shadow Hamilton, although generally a good student, dropped to tenth place in his class. \"I am more than gratified at this showing,\" said Doctor Clay, when the examinations were over. \"The general average is higher than usual. You have done well, and I shall award the prizes with much pleasure.\" After that there was an entertainment lasting the best part of the afternoon, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the students celebrated by a bonfire on the campus and a general merrymaking. They sang the school song over and over again, and gave the Hall cry: \"Baseball! Football! Oak Hall Has the call! Biff! Boom! Bang!

If a trip to Europe in the _Kaiser Wilhelm_ to-morrow morning seems to you opportune, you will certainly escape reading the record of your own folly <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> papers.\" Weiss threw away his half-chewed cigar, and taking another from the box, lit it deliberately. \"Now, Mr. Vine,\" he said, \"you are a young man whose attention has never been turned to the practical affairs of life. You are a literary person, and you walk a good deal with your head in the clouds. You haven't the hard common sense of us business men to be able to determine exactly what the result in a commonplace world is of any definite action. I can assure...", "...a short time was spent by the men in smoking, and at about four o'clock in the afternoon the journey was resumed. Feeling secure because of numbers, and the reports made by the newcomers that there was no one in the immediate vicinity the boys were allowed to follow their own inclinations as to the line of march, and each strayed here or there as he pleased until the coming of night forced them to keep together because of the danger to be apprehended from wild animals. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when they arrived at the hunters' camp; but Cummings did not propose to remain there even for one night. He insisted that they could travel by water as well during the hours of darkness, while it would be no more labor for one to guide the canoe, allowing her to drift with the current, than to stand watch. The strangers used every argument to induce him to defer the beginning of the journey until morning; but he was determined, and after some controversy the men made...", "...but it is interesting to observe that the proportion of his years spent in his trade is the same six sevenths of the time that most men must spend in the effort to gain the necessaries or luxuries of life. One has only to stand on the streets of the city in the early morning and see the throngs as they move to their places of work to appreciate how large a part the wage motive plays in actual living. Each day many millions of men and women go down to the various marts in order that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> time they may come back from the struggle with increased gains. If the Bible takes an attitude toward the spirit that dominates work it must also take an attitude toward the spirit that dominates the object of work. It would be small use to have men made right toward toil if they were to be twisted in their relation to the proceeds of toil. We should expect, then, that the Bible would give some explicit teaching to individual men concerning the right attitude toward...", "...a moment would come when the prince would take them in hand and enforce discipline such as they had never heard of. They took advantage of the opportunity all the more. \"Let us rejoice while we are free,\" they cried. \"When the time for obedience comes we will listen, for we have some one to obey who is not _baby_ nor _Latin_ nor _feather-bed_.\" And the unfortunate Prince Dominik always came out worst, for the soldiers' tongues ground him to bran. They said that he prayed whole days, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> hung to the handle of a mug, spat on his stomach, and with one eye open inquired, \"What is that?\" They said also that he took \"jalap\" at night, and that he saw as many battles as there were depicted on his carpet by Dutch art. No one defended him any longer, and no one pitied him; and those who were in open opposition to military discipline attacked him most savagely. But all were surpassed by Zagloba, with his satire and ridicule. He had already recovered from the...", "...greatcoat over his legs, not realizing that he was an enemy, since the remnants of his khaki uniform were indistinguishable from the field-grey after they had been \"chromed\" by the fumes of bursting shells. Otherwise it is doubtful whether the stretcher-bearers would have removed a wounded enemy. Without the discovery being made, the New Zealander was taken to the German advance dressing-station, and his injuries dressed, and thus he found himself wounded and a prisoner. It was later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when Malcolm was taken by motor-ambulance to a railway station twenty miles behind the lines. With him were about twenty Prussians, Saxons, and Wuertemburgers, whose demeanour was one of extreme dejection. Their wounds, although serious, were not of a nature to debar them from further military service. They realized that they were going to be patched up in order to be again sent to the front, more than likely to the terrible Ypres district. Now that they were wounded...", "...edification. Miriam made the bedstead prance, fairly, while Anna's laugh sounded like a bull of Bashan with his head in a bolster case. Saturday, October 11th. Miriam went off to Clinton before daylight yesterday, with Mr. Carter and Mrs. Worley. She would not let me go for fear mother should keep us. At midnight they got back last night, tired, sleepy, and half-frozen, for our first touch of cool weather came in a strong north wind <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> which grew stronger and stronger through the night, and they had worn only muslin dresses. I shall never cease to regret that I did not go too. Miriam says mother is looking very sad. Sad, and I am trying to forget all our troubles, and am so happy here! O mother, how selfish it was to leave you! I ask myself whether it were best to stay there where we would only be miserable without adding anything to your comfort or pleasure, or to be here, careless and happy while you...", "...indeed? You see now before you a despairing man and a dying man.\" \"And a sinner?\" questioned Home. \"Ay, ay, God knows, a sinner.\" \"Then I see also before me a man whose despair can be changed to peace, and his sin forgiven. What hour shall I call upon you this evening?\" Mr. Harman named the hour. Then he rose feebly; Home gave him his arm and conducted him to his carriage; afterwards he re-entered the church to pray. CHAPTER LII. A HIDDEN SIN. Nine o' clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was the hour named by Mr. Harman, and punctually at that hour Home arrived at Prince's Gate. He was a man who had never been known to be late for an appointment; for in little things even, this singular man was faithful to the very letter of the trust. This nice observance of his passed word, in a great measure counteracted his otherwise unpractical nature. Home was known by all his acquaintances to be a most dependable man. Mr. Harman had told Charlotte that he was...", "...ago gone to fevered men. \"First ambulance I've seen in twenty-four hours,\" said Captain Davies, as he came on them out of the dusk of Hoogar wood. The stern and unbending organization of the military had found it necessary to hold a hundred or more ambulances of the Royal Army Medical Corps in readiness all day in the market place of Ypres against a sudden evacuation. So there were simply no cars, but their one car, to speed out to the front and gather the wounded. It was strange, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light, to work out along the road between lines of poplar trees. Dim forms kept passing them--two by two, each couple with a stretcher and its burden. An old farm cart came jogging by, wrenching its body from side to side as it struck invisible hummocks and dipped into shell holes. It was loaded with outstretched forms of men, whose wounds were torn at by the jerking of the cart. In companies, fresh men, talking in whispers, were softly padding along the road on their...", "...shot that you made, and you are master of the hunt this day, Edward. Now, I'll remain, and you go home for White Billy; Humphrey is right about the cart. If we had one, we could have carried all home at once; but I must go now and cut the throat of the other stag which you killed so cleverly. You will be a good hunter one of these days, Edward. A little more knowledge, and a little more practice, and I will leave it all to you, and hang my gun up over the chimney.\" It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before they had made their two trips and taken all the venison home, and very tired were they before it was all safely housed. Edward was delighted with his success, but not more so than was old Jacob. The next morning Jacob set off for Lymington, with the pony loaded with venison, which he sold, as well as two more loads which he promised to bring the next day, and the day after. He then looked out for a cart, and was fortunate in finding a small one just fitted to...", "...he was fond of her--but he hated scenes. \"Mary's always howling about something now,\" he confided to Helen. \"Is she?\" Helen answered with indifference. \"Mary's such a baby.\" So Mary began to attribute everything to the dog. It seemed to her then that she met the animal everywhere. Cow Farm was a rambling building, with dark, uneven stairs, low-ceilinged rooms, queer, odd corners, and sudden unexpected doors. It seemed to Mary as though in this place there were two Hamlets. When, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she went to her room, hurrying through the passages for fear of what she might see, stumbling over the uneven boards, sniffling the mice and straw under the smell of her tallow candle, suddenly out of nowhere at all Hamlet would appear scurrying along, like the White Rabbit, intent on serious business. He came so softly and with so sudden a flurry and scatter when she did hear him that her heart would beat for minutes afterwards, and she would not dare that night to...", "...abroad on this account, _since the peace_. When I opened, I found that this man was willing to open too; and he uttered sentiments that would have convinced me, if I had not before been convinced of the fact, that there are very few, even amongst the labourers, who do not clearly understand the cause of their ruin. I discovered that there were two Ely men flogged upon that occasion, and that one of them was still alive and residing near the town. I sent for this man, who came to me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when he had done his work, and who told me that he had lived seven years with the same master when he was flogged, and was bailiff or head man to his master. He has now a wife and several children; is a very nice-looking, and appears to be a hard-working, man, and to bear an excellent character. But how was I to harangue? For I was determined not to quit Ely without something of that sort. I told this labouring man who showed me the flogging spot, my name, which seemed...", "...the apartment that had so taken his fancy, especially toward the large, well-filled bookcase and the pictures, which, if not very expensive, had evidently been the choice of a cultivated taste. They were brought to a consciousness of the flight of time by a clock chiming out the hour of eleven, and the old soldier with a sigh of regret saw Mrs. Mayburn rise. Miss St. John touched a silver bell, and a moment later the same negress who had reminded her of her father's impatience early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> entered with a tray bearing a decanter of wine, glasses, and some wafer-like cakes. \"Have I earned the indulgence of a glance at your books?\" Graham asked. \"Yes, indeed,\" Miss St. John replied; \"your martyr-like submission shall be further rewarded by permission to borrow any of them while in town. I doubt, however, if you will find them profound enough for your taste.\" \"I shall take all point from your irony by asking if you think one can relish nothing but...", "...just as far as ever from the end!\" The creeping voice toiled on across the haunted plain, growing louder, clearer, nearer. Vision was forced upon Clare, serene in her form-room, swift and sudden vision. She not only heard, every sense responded. At her feet lay the waste land of the poem, she smelt the dank air, shrank from the clammy undergrowth, watched the bowed figure of the wandering knight, stumbling forwards doggedly. It was coming towards her, the outline blurred <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> mist, the face hidden. The voice was surely his? \"Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled Increasing like a bell.\" She heard it alive with warning. Nearer, ever nearer; the bowed form was at her very feet, as the voice rose anew in despairing defiance. \"To view the last of me----\" The helmeted head was flung back; the voice echoed from hill to hill-- \"I saw them and I knew them all. And yet Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips...", "...is all very fine,\" said the Duchess. \"You may have told him that you do not love him, but you have not told him that you love another man.\" \"I have certainly not told him that.\" \"Then you are unfair to him, and also unfair to James Randolph. You think nothing at all of breaking his heart.\" \"He was away when he might have helped me,\" I replied. \"That was, I know, through no fault of his, but I cannot say any more except that I will not break my bond.\" The Duchess went away, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Jim arrived. He came in with that very quiet manner which he always wore, that absolute self-possession which I do not think under any circumstances would desert him, but I read the anxiety in his grey eyes, the quizzical, half-laughing glance was gone altogether, the eyes were very grave and almost stern. \"Now,\" he said, \"I have come to say very plain words. I want to know why you will not marry me.\" \"Have you not heard?\" I asked. \"I have heard nothing,\" he...", "...meat for the great cities to come from, dear father?\" asked Franzelius, who had been silently listening, and meantime making great havoc in these two articles, which his wife had set before him. \"That's the business of the railroads,\" replied the shoemaker, without the slightest embarrassment. \"The country people, or rather the members of the great rural industrial societies, will go out every morning through the open country, till the fields, attend to the cattle, and return by rail <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the city, which they'll reach in time to witness William Tell or hear Lucca. Why should these worthy people be forever excluded from all education and culture, merely because hitherto no theatres, concerts, and universities have existed in the villages?\" \"They'll have to stay in the country over night very often during the haying season,\" Franzelius dryly remarked. The old man cast a side glance at him, to see if he were in jest or earnest, but no satirical lines...", "...Vanishing Girl included.

But beware, as you set store by my friendship and by your life, that you do not blow the horn lightly.' 'I give you great thanks for your kindness, and will hearken to your words,' said Huon; 'and now, I pray, let me depart hence to do the emperor's bidding.' So the knight and the fairy king took leave of each other, and they fared on their way, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they sat and rested in a green meadow, and ate and drank of the food that Oberon had given them. Now Huon was uplifted by the gifts the king had given him, and thought that he himself must be in some way better than other men, to be singled out for such honour, and, as young men will, he began to boast and talk idly, making pretence that he doubted the magic qualities of the horn and the cup, so that he might prove them at once before his company.

We'll find out about that route when we reach New York.\" It was exactly ten o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that the train rolled into the Grand Central Depot at Forty-second Street and Randy and Earl alighted. The crowd was very thick, and though both looked for Roland and Guardley, the two men could not be discovered. The coming and going of so many people confused them, and the many cries which greeted them as they emerged on the street did not tend to set them at ease. \"Cab, sir? Coupe?

It had been one of those hot, breathless sort of days with no breeze; and now, near sunset, nothing but an occasional cat's-paw stole gently across the sea to ruffle its glassy surface in irregular-shaped patches. Elsewhere, the water, shining like a mirror, reflected the blazing glory of the sky. Some distance off lay the coast, its familiar outline dim, purple, and mysterious <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> mist. But it was neither the sunset, glorious as it was, nor the scenery which held our imagination. It was the shipping. All manner of craft there were. First came the _Spurt_, of Tromso, a Norwegian tramp of dissolute and chastened appearance, whose deliberate, plodding gait and general air of senility belied her name, or at any rate the English meaning of it. Her rusty black hull was decorated with three large squares painted in her national colours, red, with...", "...in her comfortable bed with a sense of safety and comfort. \"I wish my father and mother could know I am at Fort Sumter,\" was her last waking thought. CHAPTER XVII A CHRISTMAS PRESENT Every nook and corner of Fort Moultrie was searched for the missing Sylvia, and when no trace of her could be discovered, her friends became nearly certain that the little girl must have slipped from the landing-place into the sea, and that it was useless to search for her. But it was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before Mr. Fulton gave up the search, and with a sad and anxious heart headed the Butterfly toward Charleston. He still hoped that his little girl might be found. A party of soldiers, headed by Captain Carleton, had started to search for her on Sullivan's Island, but this had not been determined upon until late in the evening, at about the time when Estralla and Sylvia were embarking upon their adventurous voyage to Fort Sumter. No one had given a thought to the little...", "...and the vegetation, with the exception of the timber, reminded me strongly of the desert of Arnavatn in the interior of Iceland.

The formation of the rocks is still red granite, with a good deal of mica showing in the boulders. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we heard a gun, and, on our replying, four or five shots were fired in rapid succession, the signal of good news; soon afterwards Paul and Francois came in, each carrying a small load of meat, which we finished promptly.

The nest cavity that she left was little more than a shallow depression. Three other females were digging nests early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on July 3, 5, and 8; in each of these instances the female stopped digging to eat when food was placed in the cage and completed the nesting process, unobserved, later in the evening.

The outer surface now shows a rough, jagged ensemble of masses of stone rudely put together, the entire pyramid being solid. We walked home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light, getting dozens of charming pictures in the twilight--pictures already familiar to me, yet ever bringing a sense of newness. French towns, like French scenery, should be revisited thus, and I hope ere very long to pay Autun my fourth visit, and to take, for a second time, those delightful drives from Avallon to Vezelay, and from the modern capital of the little Celtic kingdom to the ancient, perched so airily above the surrounding hills. CHAPTER III....", "...other children were educated. Nor is it astonishing that she should not have understood the highly complex organism of the young lady we have chosen for our heroine, who was shaken, at the age of thirteen, by unfulfilled longings. Very early in life Honora learned to dread the summer, when one by one the families of her friends departed until the city itself seemed a remote and distant place from what it had been in the spring and winter. The great houses were closed and blinded, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the servants who had been left behind chattered on the front steps. Honora could not bear the sound of the trains that drifted across the night, and the sight of the trunks piled in the Hanburys' hall, in Wayland Square, always filled her with a sickening longing. Would the day ever come when she, too, would depart for the bright places of the earth? Sometimes, when she looked in the mirror, she was filled with a fierce belief in a destiny to sit in the high seats, to...", "...allowed.

Such extension cannot be allowed to the employer during more than 40 days in any one year. Further extension beyond the two weeks, or for more than forty days in the year, can only be granted by the higher court of administration, and by it, only on condition that in the business or in the department of business in question, the total average number of hours per day, calculated...", "...was afterwards published. In his own remarks the President pointed out that the project had served its main purpose in very largely promoting knowledge of the Empire's resources and products and that, incidentally, its success had given the management a surplus of L35,000. This sum, he suggested, should be largely devoted to the advancement of the project for a permanent Exhibition or Imperial Institute--\"in the promotion of which the Queen and I both take so warm an interest.\" Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the Prince expressed the hope that as the late Exhibition had been, allegorically, burnt that day, \"the Imperial Institute may be a Phoenix rising out of its ashes. I trust that it may be a lasting memorial not only of that but of the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen.\" Of the sum mentioned, L25,000 was accordingly voted to the new project. The proposal of the Heir Apparent--as first expressed in a letter to the Lord Mayor on September 13, 1886--was that the idea...", "..._Oran Hollanda_, that is, _Holland men_, on which the soldiers instantly stopped, throwing water on their heads in token of peace, and approaching in a friendly manner, said they had mistaken the Dutchmen for Spaniards. At the request of the seamen they went on board, where, being well treated, they promised to bring provisions and refreshment to the ship, which they afterwards did. Sailing thence on the 14th they got sight of Ternate and Tidore on the 16th, and anchored on the 17th <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before Malaya in Ternate, in eleven fathoms sandy ground. Here captain Schouten and Jaques Le Maire went ashore, and were kindly entertained by the general Laurence Real, admiral Stephen Verhagen, and Jasper Janson, governor of Amboina. On the 18th they sold two of their pinnaces, with most of what had been saved out of the unfortunate Horn, receiving for the same 1350 reals, with part of which they purchased two lasts of rice, a ton of vinegar, a ton of Spanish wine,...", "...such an absurd little clown of a fop. * * * * * When the manicure girls read this they will snort.

We know him and his kind.\" Fortunately I don't know him as well as the manicure girls do, so there is room for this speculation as I watch him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> now and then. I see him standing under the blaze of lobby lights, in the thick of passing fur coats and dinner jackets, in the midst of laughter, escorts, intrigues, actors, famous names. He stands perfectly still, with his right arm crooked as if he were going to place his hand over his heart and bow, with his left arm slightly curved at his side. Grace.

As to the 'Saxon,' M. de la Ronciere perceived by this time that the worthy Englishman had presumed too much on his power. The 'Saxon' was evidently incapable of following us. The captain, therefore, made her a signal that she was to take her own course, to try and reach Jan Mayen; and if she could not succeed, to direct her course on Onundarfiord, and there to wait for us. The English vessel fell rapidly astern, her hull disappeared, then her sails, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> every trace of her smoke had faded from the horizon. In the evening, the temperature grew gradually colder; that of the water underwent a more rapid and significant change. At twelve at night it was only three degrees centig. (about 37 degrees Fahr.). At that moment the vessel plunged into a bank of fog, the intensity of which we were enabled to ascertain, from the continuance of daylight in these latitudes at this time of the year. There are tokens that leave no...", "...and others were on the pier and in the outfitters' shops, eager for gossip, as the languid stretch of indolence inclines men to be. The Admiral asked me for the whereabout of Prince Ernest's territory. He too said that the prince would be free of the Club during his residence, adding: 'Where is he?'--not a question demanding an answer. The men might have let the princess go by, but there would have been questions urgently demanding answers had she been seen by their women. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> my father's yacht was sighted from the pier. Just as he reached his moorings, and his boat was hauled round, the last steamer came in. Sharp-eyed Janet saw the squire on board among a crowd, and Temple next to him, supporting his arm. 'Has grandada been ill?' she exclaimed. My chief concern was to see my father's head rising in the midst of the crowd, uncovering repeatedly. Prince Ernest and General Goodwin were behind him, stepping off the lower pier-platform....", "...about, as he proceeded, for some signs of a landing-place, but without success. He re-crossed the bar, reached the Adelaide without accident, and the next day went on in her to Xavier Island. On the way they passed Dead-tree Island; where, observing seal on the rocks, a boat was sent ashore, and her crew succeeded in killing a few sea-elephants, twenty feet long. Favoured with fine weather, they were enabled to land on the north side of Xavier Island, to improve the former survey; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> anchored in Xavier Bay, where they remained four days; during which, Jesuit Sound was explored, and found to terminate in two narrow inlets. Being a leewardly opening, it is unfit for any vessel to enter. The name Jesuit Sound, and those of the two inlets at the bottom, Benito and Julian, are memorials of the missionaries, who, in the expedition of 1778, entered and explored it.[176] (Agueros, p. 232.) The Adelaide anchored the next night in Ygnacio Bay, at the south...", "...and hoarser. She only kept moaning, \"Forgive me.\" Presently she said between her sobs, \"I only went this morning to tell him to go away. I wanted him to go away; I have prayed him to go again and again.\" \"Since when hast thou known him?\" Again she made no answer, but inarticulate moans. Peter stood looking at her for a few seconds with an indescribable expression of sorrow and aversion. \"I loved thee,\" he said; and turning away, left her. CHAPTER III. Peter went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> without speaking to Louise again, and was not seen till the following afternoon, when he called his mate to go mackerel-fishing, and they were absent two days getting a great haul. He came back and slept at Mesurier's, and did not go near his own home for a week, though he sent money to Louise, when he sold the fish. At the end of that time he went over to Jean's. The stranger had gone, but Peter sat down on a stool opposite Jean, and began to enter into conversation...", "...a few minutes.\" \"Have you seen a newspaper to-day?\" asked Uncle Eric. \"A newspaper? I should think not, indeed; we've had too many important things to do to waste time on trifles. Why, has the Government gone out?\" \"Ivor Dundas has got into a mess here,\" Uncle Eric answered, looking very much worried--so much worried that I thought he must care even more about Ivor than I had fancied. \"Of course it's the most awful rot,\" said Lord Bob, \"but he's accused of murder.\" \"It's <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> papers: not a word had got into the morning ones,\" Uncle Eric went on. \"We've only just seen the news since we came here to wait for you; otherwise I should have tried to do something for him.

The one is called the little Geyser, the other the Bogensprung. The little Geyser has an inner basin of about three feet diameter. The water boils violently at a depth of from two to three feet, and remains within its bounds till it begins to spout, when it projects a beautiful voluminous steam of from 20 to 30 feet high. At half-past eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I had the good fortune to see one of these eruptions, and needed not, as I had done at the great Geyser, to bivouac near it for days and nights. The eruption lasted some time, and was tolerably equable; only sometimes the column of water sank a little, to rise to its former height with renewed force. After forty minutes it fell quite down into the basin again. The stones we threw in, it rejected at once, or in a few seconds, shivered into pieces, to a height of about...", "...in, and on the receipt of the cattle and these weapons the English must retire from Zululand. The trader had written in a corner of the letter, in pencil, a few words of warning, and an intimation that Cetewayo had with him at Ulundi a picked force of 20,000 men. Lord Chelmsford refused to receive the tusks, and told the messengers to inform Cetewayo, that before he should think of retiring, all the conditions must be complied with, and the Zulu regiments lay down their arms. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> several large bodies of the enemy, amounting to some thousands, were noticed moving from the direction of Ulundi, passing by their left flank. The next morning General Wood moved forward as far as the left bank of the White Umvolosi, and Newdigate's column followed in the afternoon. Wood's division bivouacked on the farther side of the river, Newdigate's halted on the right. The most vigilant watch was kept, with pickets in every direction, and patrols of cavalry...", "...jackanapes----\" But he was so astonished that he had to lean out of his box and watch the blasphemer--a quaint figure, bowed as though under a heavy burden, its hands thrust hard into its trousers pockets--stalk away from the great tent and without so much as a backward glance lose itself among the crowd.

The smaller of the two young men took off his soft hat and set it beside him so that he could let the wind brush through his thick red hair. He held himself very straight, his slender body taut with solemn exultation. \"If only one could do something with it,\" he said; \"eat it--hug it--get inside of it somehow--belong to it. It hurts--this gaping like an outsider. Look now--one shade of purple...", "...since the Great Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice? Hast lost thy wits? Begone! And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.\" The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk. {1} Chapter IX. The river pageant. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the whole vast river-front of the palace was blazing with light. The river itself, as far as the eye could reach citywards, was so thickly covered with watermen's boats and with pleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated by the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of flowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. The grand terrace of stone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army of a German...", "...out of all that was in it, but the two. To them he said: \"I spare you to clean out the house, and make the place fit for the monarch of Erin to spend the night in. Bring rushes, and make ready to receive Fin MacCumhail.\" And from wherever they got them, they brought two baskets of rushes, each basket as big as a mountain, and spread litter on the ground two feet deep through the whole house; and then at the knight's command they brought a pile of turf, and made a grand fire. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the king's attendants brought food, which they left near the house of the guards; these monsters were fed twice a day, morning and evening. To their great surprise the attendants saw the bodies of the dead giants piled up outside the house; they ran off quickly to tell the news. Now the Knight of the Full Axe sat by the fire. The two guards that he had spared tried to chat and be agreeable; but the knight snapped at them and said: \"What company are you for the monarch...", "...and the pensive tranquillity of evening was gathering before we returned. We sang those passionate, desperate love-songs which young people always sing when they are happiest and most sentimental. So rapidly had we advanced--for a Watering-Place is the very hot-bed of romance--that I dropped my hand idly upon Lulu's; and finding that hers was not withdrawn, gradually and gently clasped it in mine. So, hand-in-hand, we sang, floating homeward in the golden twilight. There was a dance <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at the hotel. Lulu was to dance with me, of course, the first set, and as many waltzes as I chose. She was so sparkling, so evidently happy, that I observed the New York belles, to whom happiness is an inexplicable word, scanned her with an air of lofty wonder and elegant disdain. But Lulu was so genuinely graceful and charming; she remained so quietly superior in her simplicity to the assuming _hauteur_ of the metropolitan misses, that I kept myself in perfect...", "...the possibility of any unfortunate mistake being made; besides, I was the better able to chaperone Polly. In the winter season, as I have said, we were much quieter than in summer, for then the rowing men almost all went away to London till the spring; but twice a week at any rate we went in of an evening to the Planters', or one of the other resident families, or they came in to us. Saturday was the club-day, and then Harry went out on the water when the weather was fine, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the club-room, where he boxed, fenced, and played whist till twelve o'clock. It was not till we had been there two years that we came to know one of Harry's friends, he had never brought home before; and yet we had heard more of him than of almost any man in the club. This was Charley Horton, a merchant, with a very good business in the City--not that any one would have taken him for a merchant, or, indeed, for anything connected with business in any way. He was a...", "...he stood on tiptoe, and, in spite of the discomfort of that position, he used to stay so, with his chin on the wall, looking, listening, while the evening unfolded over the lawns its soft waves of gold, which lit up with bluish rays the shade of the pines. There he could forget himself until he heard footsteps approaching in the street. The night scattered its scents over the garden: lilac in spring, acacia in summer, dead leaves in the autumn. When Jean-Christophe, was on his way home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> from the Palace, however weary he might be, he used to stand by the door to drink in the delicious scent, and it was hard for him to go back to the smells of his room. And often he had played--when he used to play--in the little square with its tufts of grass between the stones, before the gateway of the house of the Kerichs. On each side of the gate grew a chestnut-tree a hundred years old; his grandfather used to come and sit beneath them, and smoke his pipe, and the...", "...was revered by the Koreysh; the holy places, Muna, Szafa, Meroua, had their respective saints or demi-gods; and the historians give a long list of other deities. The number of idols increased so much, that one was to be found in every house and tent of this valley; and the Kaaba was adorned with three hundred and sixty of them, corresponding probably to the days of the year. The tribe of Kossay were the first who built houses round the Kaaba; in these they lived during the day, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they always returned to their tents, pitched upon the neighbouring mountains. The successors of the Beni Kossay at Mekka, or Bekka, (the name then applied to the town,) were the Beni Koreysh. About their time the Kaaba was destroyed by fire; they rebuilt it of wood, of a smaller size than it had been in the time of the Kossay, but indicating by the wall Hedjer (already described) its former limits. The roof was supported within by six pillars; and the statue of Hobal,...", "...gone out, thinking that I would not come. There is no mistake about the room. I won't wait--I'll write to her to-morrow, and give her twenty-four hours to get out of London.\" He went slowly down the dark stairs, and as he stepped into the street he brushed against a stout, elderly woman. With a muttered apology, he moved aside. The woman turned and looked after him sharply for an instant, then entered the house and closed the door. Jack thought nothing of the incident. How to put <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was the question that concerned him. He was walking undecidedly down the Quadrant when he saw approaching an artist friend whom he did not care to meet. On the impulse of the moment he darted across the street, narrowly missing the wheels of a hansom, and in front of the Cafe Royal he ran into the arms of Victor Nevill. \"Hello, old chap; you _are_ in a hurry!\" cried Nevill. \"What's up now? Seen my uncle?\" Jack was flushed and breathless. \"No; I couldn't manage...", "...Holdsworth came again, and they all were admitted to the room, and he saw the feeble sign and summons to the Vicar to bend down and listen.

That day had been one of rapid change, and the remedies and suffering had so exhausted Louis that he could scarcely speak, and seemed hardly conscious who was present. All his faculties were absorbed in the one wish, which late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was granted. The scene was like an epitome of his life--the large irregular room, cumbered with the disorderly apparatus of all his multifarious pursuits, while there he lay on his little narrow iron bed, his features so fair and colourless as to be strangely like his mother's marble effigy--his eyes closed, and his brows often contracted with pain, so that there was a doubt how far his attention was free, but still with a calm, pure sweetness, that settled down more...", "...had a cover of tough gray cloth. At the sight of it his grandfather smiled, for he had seen it once before. Where George had obtained it, the Lord only knew. Its title was \"Bulls and Breeding.\" A thoroughly practical little book, but nothing for George's mother to see. As his grandfather entered behind him, the boy looked up with a guilty start, and resumed with a short breath of relief. Young Elizabeth, too, had a furtive air, for instead of preparing her history lesson she was deep <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> paper reading about the war abroad.

There are heavy dews also by night, during that month and in October; thick fogs appeared on the coast, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and morning. During the summer months, the wind blows generally between east and south, seldom veering to the west, but sometimes to the north. In September, the regular northerly winds set in, and continue during the whole winter.

When we arrive <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at a suitable spot for an encampment, Captain W. rides round a space which he considers large enough to accommodate it, and directs where each mess shall pitch its tent. The men immediately unload their horses, and place their bales of goods in the direction indicated, and in such manner, as in case of need, to form a sort of fortification and defence.

During the whole day their horses had had neither food nor water, and the animals were much exhausted when they came up with the waggons.

Indeed, my resolution was continually faltering. It faltered when I turned out my gun <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and thought of the grouse it ought to have accounted for. It faltered again when I contemplated the miscellaneous list of commissions, sown broadcast through Davies's letter, to fulfil which seemed to make me a willing tool where my chosen _role_ was that of an embittered exile, or at least a condescending ally. However, I faced the commissions manfully, after leaving the office.

In case the wedding is <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and the bride is to wear her traveling dress, hat, and gloves, the bridegroom may wear the same suit as for an afternoon wedding, if he chooses. The custom of having a new wardrobe throughout is not necessarily followed, of course.

His first thought was, as he told us, to bring about a provisional division of the peninsula; the far larger portion of the country, to the south of the Padus, to belong to the Emperor, the northern half to the Goths. One day at noon, we had left the Emperor's presence with great hopes; the audience had turned out more favourably than all former ones. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the same day we were surprised by the arrival of the Curo-palata Marcellus, accompanied by slaves carrying the gifts which it is customary to present to parting guests--a not-to-be-mistaken sign that all negotiations were broken off. Confounded at this sudden change, Cassiodorus decided, for the sake of his work of peace, to dare the utmost--namely, to seek an audience of the Emperor after the presentation of the parting gifts. Tribonianus, who had always opposed the...", "...my double, Somers; for you know my thoughts before I utter them.\" \"I was just thinking, when you spoke, that we were running into a nest of the enemy.\" \"Just before the battle of the Alma, I went on just such an expedition as this; but we went down the river beyond the enemy's lines, and doubled up in the rear of them; thus finding out all we wanted to know.\" \"That is what I propose to do.\" \"Captain Brickfield and myself landed, and walked sixty-four miles between nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and four o'clock in the morning,\" added Captain de Banyan. \"How far?\" \"Sixty-four miles.\" \"Good!\" exclaimed Somers. \"Did you walk all the way?\" \"Every step.\" \"It was tip-top walking, De Banyan--a little more than nine miles an hour.\" \"Do you doubt the story?\" \"I don't doubt that it is a story.\" \"Now, that isn't kind of you, Somers, to be perpetually throwing discredit upon everything I say,\" replied the captain, apparently much hurt. \"You mustn't...", "...to the mainland. The British also threw up a work at the end of the causeway. In the afternoon nine ships, with a great number of schooners, sloops, and flat-bottomed boats full of men, passed through Hell Gate, towards Throg's Point; and information received from two deserters, gave Washington reason to believe that the greater part of the enemy's forces were gathering in that quarter. General McDougall's brigade, in which were Colonel Smallwood and the independent companies, was sent <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to strengthen Heath's division at King's Bridge, and to throw up works opposite the ford of Harlem River.

But it was impossible to banish her image, and day after day the struggle within my soul grew more severe. Thus the rainy months passed away; during which I scarcely left home at all, and saw no one but my wife. One day she was taken sick, and soon became so ill that Brother Jonathan, who was the physician of the mission, and for whom I sent at once, became very anxious. It was on the fifth day of her illness, and Jonathan had been to see her in the afternoon; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she became much worse. She complained so much that about ten o'clock I concluded to ride out to the doctor's. Jonathan was much sought after as a physician, and when I reached his house about eleven o'clock, he had already been roused up from his sleep by a man who wanted some medicine for a child, and who was waiting to have it prepared. Ah, how I remember every trifle, exactly as if it all had occurred only yesterday! \"When I told Jonathan how very ill my wife was,...", "...and gave the generous and worthy old man a happy evening. This was always the case; I made him and his two good friends happy whenever I took meals with them.

We do not light the candles <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> for fear of attracting the gnats, but when you want to go to bed we will shut the door and go away. I beg to introduce you to my younger sister, my mother has gone to bed.\" I answered her to the effect that the balcony was always at her service, and that since it was still early I begged their permission to put on my dressing-gown and to keep them company. Her conversation was charming; she made me spend two most delightful hours, and did not leave me till twelve...", "...Brownies--young ladies!--are much desired as wives, whereas a man might as well marry an old witch as a young Boggartess.\" \"And about the Owl?\" clamoured the children, rather resentful of the Doctor's pausing to take breath. \"Of course,\" he continued, \"the Tailor heard the whole story, and being both anxious to thank the Old Owl for her friendly offices, and also rather curious to see and hear her, he went with the boys one night at moon-rise to the shed by the mere.

There they found the Owl looking very solemn and stately on the beam. She was sitting among the shadows with her shoulders up, and she fixed her eyes so steadily on the Tailor, that he felt quite overpowered. He made her a civil bow, however, and said, \"I'm much obliged to you, Ma'am, for your good advice to my Tommy.\" The Owl...", "...getting after you.

He questioned her concerning her aunt and her relations generally, but Lillian knew little more than that her aunt resided in Toronto, and was generally considered to be what is called \"flighty.\" This somewhat reassured Trevelyan, and he dismissed the subject for a time from his mind. He determined, however, to clear the matter up, and so <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he called to see Mr. D'Alton, requesting a few words with him in private. The two men entered the study, and Trevelyan led off by saying:--\"I have received a strange communication from your sister-in-law, Miss Wilson; from what Lillian has told me, I am aware that she is a person of weak intellect, and her stories are not worthy of credence, but I thought it due to you, nevertheless, to bring the matter to your notice.\" At the mention of Miss Wilson's name D'Alton...", "...heat, which began to pour down from the deep blue cloudless vault of heaven.

But Madame Olenska, heedless of tradition, was attired in a long robe of red velvet bordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur. Archer remembered, on his last visit to Paris, seeing a portrait by the new painter, Carolus Duran, whose pictures were the sensation of the Salon, in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath-like robes with her chin nestling in fur. There was something perverse and provocative in the notion of fur worn <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in a heated drawing-room, and in the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms; but the effect was undeniably pleasing. \"Lord love us--three whole days at Skuytercliff!\" Beaufort was saying in his loud sneering voice as Archer entered. \"You'd better take all your furs, and a hot-water-bottle.\" \"Why?

The officer in question was a huge pithecoid lout of a creature, with a wooden face and a receding forehead, and his accuser whom he had arrested the preceding evening was a little grig of a red-headed man, obviously respectable, and almost incoherent with rage. The anger of the little red-headed man was but natural, for he had just come out from a night in the station-house. He had been arrested late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on suspicion that he was a policy-player, because of the rows of figures on a piece of paper which he had held in his hand, and because at the time of his arrest he had just stepped into the entrance of the hall of a tenement-house in order to read by lamplight.

There were the three rows of figures all right, but, as the accused explained, hopping up and down with rage and excitement, they were all of them the numbers of hymns.

Sibylla was in no humour to talk: she had repulsed Decima rudely--or it may rather be said fractiously--when the latter had ventured on conversation. Lady Verner had gone out to dinner. The Countess of Elmsley had been there that day, and she had asked Lady Verner to go over <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and take a friendly dinner with her. \"Bring any of them that you like with you,\" had been her careless words in parting. But Lady Verner had not chosen to take \"any of them.\" She had dressed and driven off in the hired fly alone; and this it was that was exciting the anger of Sibylla. She thought Lady Verner might have taken her. Lucy came in and knelt down on the rug before the fire, half shivering. \"I am so cold!\" she said. \"Do you know what I did, Decima? I let the...", "...weeks of uninterrupted companionship with her would have been the death of me, she laughed heartily.

It was only when she was excited, especially <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when she was with friends, that the attractive and radiant side of her nature asserted itself to a marked extent. I remember one fine evening at Herwegh's, when Liszt was moved to the same state of enthusiasm by a grand-piano abominably out of tune, as by the disgusting cigars to which at that time he was more passionately devoted than to the finer brands.

[Illustration: NIBLO'S GARDEN] Shortly after Niblo had established himself in this place the new Bowery Theatre burned down and Charles Gilfert, the manager, opened a summer theater in the old circus building, then still standing in the middle of Niblo's Garden, where he gave theatrical performances, while his own theatre was being rebuilt, which was done in ninety days.

This was a great disappointment to me, as I should much have liked to land and see the ruins of Berenice. The country is inhabited, and further inland gazelles and deer are found; there is also some vegetation, including mimosa bushes. Cordock and I went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in the captain's gig to try to catch some fish, but we only got a good tossing among the reefs, yet I think the fresh breeze was beneficial to me. _April 6._--We are still at anchor under Ras Benas, it is blowing so hard. The captain gave us and his officers a breakfast in Egyptian fashion: it was very good, some of the dishes being quite original to me. _April 7._--We weighed anchor at seven o'clock in the morning, it was blowing very hard, and the captain wished...", "...to increase their duties in many ways.

During this journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to point out to her the various beauties of the scene. I often suffered my mule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of reflection. At other times I spurred on the animal before my companions, that I might forget them, the world, and, more than all, myself. When at a distance, I alighted, and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I arrived at Chamounix. My father and Elizabeth were very much fatigued; Ernest, who accompanied us, was delighted, and in high spirits: the only circumstance that detracted from his pleasure was the south wind, and the rain it seemed to promise for the next day. We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did not. I remained many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning that played above Mont Blanc, and listening to the rushing of the...", "...the prelude to what I expected, for I heard her freely censure the imprudence of my parents. She spoke in whispers; yet, though I could not hear every word, I made out the tenor of her discourse. She was very anxious, lest her husband should be involved in the ruin of our house. He was the chief clerk in my father's counting-house; towards evening he came in and quieted her fears, by the welcome news that he had obtained a more lucrative situation than the one he had lost. At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Mrs. Hartley said to me, \"Miss Wilmot, it is time for you to be in bed, my dear;\" and ordered the servant to shew me up stairs, adding, that she supposed she must assist me to undress, but that when Maria came home, she must teach me to wait on myself. The apartment in which I was to sleep was at the top of the house. The walls were white-washed, and the roof was sloping. There was only one window in the room, a small casement, through which the bright moon shone, and it...", "...at Cambridge. The table in Nicky's sitting-room at the top of the house in Chelsea was now covered with the parts of his model of the Moving Fortress. He made them at the Works, one by one; for the Morss Company were proud of him, and he had leave to use their material and plant now and then for little ideas of his own. The idea of the Moving Fortress was with him all day in the workshops and offices and showrooms, hovering like a formless spiritual presence among the wheeled forms. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it took shape and sound. It arose and moved, after its fashion, as he had conceived it, beautiful, monstrous, terrible. At night, beside the image of the _forteresse mobile_, the image of Desmond was a thin ghost that stood back, mournful and dumb, in the right-hand corner of the vision. But the image of Desmond was there. At first it stood for Nicky's predominant anxiety: \"I wonder when Desmond will have finished the drawings.\" The model of the Moving Fortress...", "...us our supplies by the day, we purpose therefore to pay at once for every article as it is purchased, and never to buy anything except we can pay for it at once, however much it may seem to be needed, and however much those with whom we deal may wish to be paid only by the week.

I got him lifted on to a stretcher and taken to the dressing station so that he might die in peace and be buried in the little soldiers' cemetery behind it. When I returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to our billet I told the transport officer of the magnificent bravery of the artillery drivers. \"Any other drivers would behave just as well, if caught in the same trap,\" he replied. He spoke the simple truth. They would. Such supreme courage and devotion to duty are common to the army.

The envy he had felt earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> increased. He thought of the look he had seen in Atherton's eyes and the intonation of his voice when the American spoke of the wife to whom he was returning. What did love like that mean to a man? What factor in Atherton's strenuous and adventurous life had affected him as this had done? What were the ethics of a love that rose purely above physical attraction--environment--temperament; a love that grew and strengthened and absorbed until it ceased to be a part of life...", "...to which they are dedicated. Those sanctuaries are generally situated out of the towns. Some of them are convents, others mere chapels; but in both one case and the other, large sums of money are collected on those occasions. In ancient times, in Spain, as also in all other Roman Catholic countries, these pilgrimages were acts of sincere devotion, which imposed the necessity of confession and communion. The devout passed all their time in the church,--in the morning hearing mass, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> reciting prayers dictated to them by a priest from the pulpit. On these occasions it was usual for enemies to be reconciled, confessing their most grievous sins, and celebrating other acts of true repentance and piety. But in modern times these usages have been much relaxed; the greater part of those who attend such pilgrimages give up the entire day to dinners, dancing, and other amusements.

It was about five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when Leon Delbes left the posada in the company of Crevel. The great heat of midday had been succeeded by a refreshing sea breeze, which was beginning to rise and blow softly, producing an exquisite temperature, of which all took advantage to rush from their houses, and join the numerous promenaders crowding the streets, squares, and the shore of the ocean, whose calm and smooth surface was tinged by the ardent beams of the sun, which had spent two-thirds of its course....", "...again, like a French Cat in despair.

Jean d'Estivet could not hold still, he was so worried and angry about the suspicion of poisoning which Joan had hinted at; so he came back <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and stormed at her till he brought the fever all back again. When Warwick heard of this he was in a fine temper, you may be sure, for here was his prey threatening to escape again, and all through the over-zeal of this meddling fool.

Polly, who was now fourteen, had just come home from her schooling at Marsden for good, and was about to go out into service there. But after the birth of her little girl Mrs. Marner, who had never for a Varley girl been strong, faded rapidly away; and Polly's stay at...", "...him ferociously conceited.

In the afternoon he expounded his theory of success over the little tables, dipping now and then his moustache in the crushed ice of the cocktails; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he would often hold forth, cue in hand, to a young listener across the billiard table. The billiard balls stood still as if listening also, under the vivid brilliance of the shaded oil lamps hung low over the cloth; while away in the shadows of the big room the Chinaman marker would lean wearily against the wall, the blank mask of his face looking pale under the mahogany marking-board; his eyelids dropped in the drowsy fatigue of late hours and in the buzzing monotony of...", "...Harris.\" \"When shall you see her again?

They carried the King on deck; he could not walk. Photini, weeping, threw herself into his arms. It was happiness to see that those whom she loved had survived the battle, but she found her father grown twenty years older. Possibly, also, she suffered from Harris' indifference. He delivered her to her father in a characteristic American fashion, saying: \"We are quits! You have returned my friend to me; I have...", "...above the water line. Above this was a magnificent gate, approached by a flight of steps. Higher still was the theater, which commanded a glorious view of Lesbos and the sea, and those various buildings which are now a wilderness of broken columns, triglyphs, and friezes. The whole was crowned by a citadel of Greek masonry on a cliff of granite.

From the number of disgraceful failures heretofore, the last very recently, the enemy must have come to the desperate resolution to storm the city this time at all hazards. And indeed the coming upon it was sudden, and if there had been a column of 15,000 bold men in the assault, they might have penetrated it. But now, twenty-four hours subsequently, 30,000 would fail in the attempt. The Department Clerks were in action <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in five minutes after they were formed in line. Capt. Ellery, Chief Clerk of 2d Auditor, was killed, and several were wounded. It rained fast all the time, and it was very dark. The enemy's cavalry charged upon them, firing as they came; they were ordered to lie flat on the ground. This they did, until the enemy came within fifteen yards of them, when they rose and fired, sending the assailants to the right and left, helter-skelter.

Midway between Echo Lake and Profile Lake, standing in the very jaws of the Notch, overhung on the one side by Cannon Mountain and on the other by a bold spur of Lafayette, it makes a contrast between the elegance and order of civilization and the untouched ruggedness and sublimity of nature scarcely anywhere else to be seen. The hotel was still full, and when King entered the great lobby and office <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> a very animated scene met his eye. A big fire of logs was blazing in the ample chimney-place; groups were seated about at ease, chatting, reading, smoking; couples promenaded up and down; and from the distant parlor, through the long passage, came the sound of the band. It was easy to see at a glance that the place had a distinct character, freedom from conventionality, and an air of reposeful enjoyment. A large proportion of the assembly being residents for the summer,...", "...was indeed a house of mourning. My mother's grief I respected, and tried all I could to console her; that of my father was so evidently worldly, and so at variance with his clerical profession, that I must acknowledge I felt more of anger at it than sorrow. He had become morose and sullen, harsh to those around him, and not so kind to my mother as her state of mind and health made it his duty to be, even if inclination were wanted. He seldom passed any portion of the day with her, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she went to bed very early, so that there was little communication between them. My sister was a great consolation to her, and so I hope was I; she often said so as she embraced me, and the tears rolled down her cheeks, and I could not help surmising that those tears were doubled from the coolness and indifference, if not unkindness, with which my father behaved to her. As for my sister, she was an angel; and as I witnessed her considerate attentions to my mother, and...", "...is greatly to be regretted that we had not established such intimate relations with the natives, as afterwards was the case, in the winter of 1881-'82, since this was the only one of the two seasons that the great winter festival was held at Utkiavw[)i]n. In the winter of 1882-'83 there had been so many deaths in the village that the natives did not feel like celebrating any regular festival, and only indulged in a few impromptu dances late in the season. These were unfortunately held <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the writer's tour of duty at the station prevented his witnessing them. Those of the party who did go over brought back only fragmentary and rather vague accounts of the performance. The confining nature of the work at the station prevented our witnessing any of the celebrations at Nuw[)u]k or at Pernyu, when the \"Nunatanmiun\" visitors were entertained. The best accounts we have of any performance is given by Lieut. Ray. He and Capt. Herendeen went over to...", "...sees at dawn.

You remember how the wind wails about the hilltop on which I live. The wailing of wind has something to do with my condition of mind; one cannot sit from eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> till twelve at night staring at the lamp, hearing the wind, and remain perfectly sane.

It frequently happened that the houses of farmers, clergymen, etc., lay a short distance up or down a lane or path branching from the direct track of the postman's journey. To save time and distance, at the point of junction of some of these paths with the main road, the gate-post was hollowed out to form a letter-box, in which the postman deposited his missives in the morning, looking in the box again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to collect those placed there for the return post. Tolchurch Vicarage and Farmstead, lying back from the village street, were served on this principle. This fact the steward now learnt by conversing with the postman, and the discovery relieved Manston greatly, making his intentions much clearer to himself than they had been in the earlier stages of his journey. They had reached the outskirts of the village. Manston insisted upon the flask being emptied before they...", "...of fashionable amusements with which I could have nothing to do; frivolous badinage, which was of all things most distasteful to me.

He knew well enough by this time what a blunder he had made, but there was no turning back for him. When the Princess Anna the Fair arrived in her kingdom, she set Prince Ivan to take care of the cows. Every day he went afield with the herd at early morn, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he drove them back to the royal yard. At that hour the Princess was always sitting on the balcony, and looking out to see that the number of the cows were all right.[321] Katoma remained sitting on the stump one day, two days, three days, without anything to eat or drink.

The battalions were respectively commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leckie and Lieutenant Colonel Boyle, and after a most fierce struggle in the light of a misty moon they took the...", "...show that we who represent the Democracy understand our work.

Toward nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of this same day, the enormous gateway was opened to a glittering carriage, which, after having described a scientific curve in the immense court stopped before a covered porch, which led to an antechamber.

Incidentally, Jockobinski was very affable and the function went off well. Everybody was there and no one would for a moment have thought that there was anything strange in the transfer of the scene from Onyx House to Bolivar Lodge. \"Who wrote that letter, Henriette?\" I asked late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the last guest had gone. \"Who do you suppose, Bunny, my boy?\" she asked with a grin. \"Bunderby?\" \"No,\" said I. \"You've guessed right,\" said Henriette. As a postscript let me say that until he reads this I don't believe Tommy Dare ever guessed what a successful joke he perpetrated upon Mrs. Shadd and the fair Henriette.

The usual effect of this was somewhat counteracted, however, by the wails of those who had lost relatives during the year.

Although I knew it was not in his power to hinder me from following him, and that he could not proceed to violence without entirely losing his reputation among the Arabs, for ill-treating his guest, yet I had acquired sufficient knowledge of the Sheikh\u0092s character to be persuaded that if I did not acquiesce in his demand, he would devise some means to get me into...", "...virtues of a prayer.

Rosabell Pickett did yeoman's service at the badly tuned piano; but her own voice had the sweetness of a crow with the carrying power of that same non-soothing bird. Rosabell kept the hymns going; but sometimes Hunt could have wished for even Miss Pelter of the Ditson Corners' choir to carry the air! As has been said, the Sunday evening service at Tolley's old shack was not so formal as the morning session. Hunt tried <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to lead the singing himself. He had managed through the summer to teach the young folks several of the newer and more sprightly songs out of the collection he had brought with him from the East. Some of the rougher young men who filled the rear benches in the evening were glad to make a noise with something besides their heavy boots, and they \"went in\" for the singing with gusto.

The old man did not understand what good the sword would do, however he took it down, and the young man went his way.

When Grindlay entered his first words were: \"Your friend Bethune has returned and again bolted.\" I feigned surprise, but in the course of the conversation that ensued he sought my advice on the most likely places to find him. I suggested Hounslow, but the detective had already made inquiries there, and could glean nothing. \"The curious part of the affair is that he should, after his recent extraordinary show of bravado...", "...to take a visitor into their confidence. Barring the slight polish acquired from mariners who have seen the strange regions of Cowes and Dartmouth, these villagers are like survivals of a dim past. In fact, so thoroughly marine is the general atmosphere, that shore-going costume seems incongruous in Leigh, the presence of a dealer is painful, and one feels as if it were a sin against propriety to wear anything but old-fashioned garments. It is worth while to pay a visit to the station <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the last up-train is about to start; the platform is crowded with hampers of all shapes and sizes.

In his first astonishment he...", "...Professor here paused and smote his bundle of papers. Then he lifted and wagged one of his great fingers. \"But!\" he exclaimed. \"But--but--always a but!

In classical times the hours for meals in Rome were about as they are now in our large cities: that is, the _cena_ was postponed until the work of the day was finished, thus crowding out the _vesperna_, and a luncheon (_prandium_) took the place of the old-fashioned \"noon dinner.\" The evening dinner came to be more or less of a social function, guests being present and the food and service the best the house could afford, while the _ientaculum_...", "...he would marry her for a pie.

Though he could sleep anywhere, by virtue of youth and a hard body, he appreciated comfort. Earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Jean, Chetwood and Turkey had borne them company. But the two former had gone, followed by caustic comment from the latter. And soon after that young gentleman had announced that Angus and Faith were a darn sight worse, and that he was going to bed. Left alone, Faith spoke the thing which was in her mind. \"I am glad,\" she said, \"that it was not you who killed Blake.\" \"I intended to kill him,\" he replied, \"and I would if it had been my luck to come up with him.

M. de Compiegne, after attending many palavers, was duly upset when returning to the ship. On the Fernao Vaz there are now (1873) five factories, each named after some French town: Paris Factory, however, had fallen to ruins, the traders having migrated 150 miles higher up the Kamma River.

For miles I pressed forward without turning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I found myself in Dublin. The union with England was being debated in the Parliament House; huge and angry crowds raged without. Remembering the tactics De Meudon had taught me, I sought to organize the crowd in a kind of military formation against the troops; but a knock on the head with a musket-butt ended my labours, and I knew nothing more until I came to myself in the quarters of an old chance acquaintance--Captain Bubbleton.

The soldier uttered a horrible cry--the wrestler had broken his neck like a rabbit's back. I did not want to see any more and rushed out, whilst the crowd threw itself upon the mountebank. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> an accidental turn in my walk brought me in front of the booth. In the midst of all the gaiety, of songs, of meals in the [p080] open air, of the illuminations and noise of the shows, the wrestler's booth, silent and closed, was the only dark spot in the fair.

What did she want to go loitering about <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with those dissipated girls for? Was that the sort of thing for Silla?

The close air and continually shifting crowd in the rooms were beginning to give her a headache. At the further end of the terrace stood a row of palms and tree-ferns, planted in large tubs which were hidden by a bank of lilies and other flowering plants. The whole formed a complete screen, behind which was a little nook commanding a...", "...ATHOS, TAKEN FROM THE SEA SHORE.] The same evening I got back to my comfortable room at Xeropotamo, and did ample justice to a good meagre dinner after the heat and fatigues of the day. A monk had arrived from one of the outlying farms who could speak a little Italian; he was deputed to do the honours of the house, and accordingly dined with me. He was a magnificent-looking man of thirty or thirty-five years of age, with large eyes and long black hair and beard. As we sat together <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in the ancient room, by the light of one dim brazen lamp, with deep shades thrown across his face and figure, I thought he would have made an admirable study for Titian or Sebastian del Piombo. In the course of conversation I found that he had learnt Italian from another monk, having never been out of the peninsula of Mount Athos.

The odd thing was that in spite of the nipping atmosphere to which his sensitiveness was exposed, it seemed to grow more acute. He had a very real sense of inferiority in the presence of others. Not only did he suffer from a lack of any kind of social training, but even the few counters he was painfully acquiring in a difficult game he had not the art of playing to advantage. Thus he was only too glad to accept Cora's ukase. It was a merciful relief to sit at home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and eat the meager cold supper that Royal Daylight provided, and then go on with his work to what hour he chose, instead of being haled abroad at the heels of a superfashionable and therefore hyperdisdainful Cora to public places, where he was always at a miserable disadvantage. She thus formed a habit of sallying forth alone in the evening.

We worked very half-heartedly the rest of the day, and it was not until we assembled in the orchard <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that our spirits recovered something like their wonted level. It was clear and slightly frosty; the sun had declined behind a birch on a distant hill and it seemed a tree with a blazing heart of fire. The great golden willow at the lane gate was laughter-shaken in the wind of evening. Even amid all the changes of our shifting world we could not be hopelessly low-spirited--except Sara Ray, who was often so, and Peter, who was rarely so. But Peter had been sorely vexed in...", "...setting they rode all three of them abreast into the little hamlet of Saint Philbert, and saw the sullen waters of the Etang de Grande Lieu spread marshy and brackish as far as the eye could reach, edged by peat bogs and overhung perilously by gloomy pines nodding over pools blacker than scrivener's ink. As the three Scots looked into the stockaded entrance of the village, they could see the children playing on the long, irregular street, and the elder folk sitting about their doors <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light. But as soon as the clatter of horses' hoofs was heard, borne from far down the aisles of the forest, there arose a sudden clamour and a crying. From each little sparred enclosure rushed forth a woman who snatched a baby here and there and drove a herd of children before her indoors, glancing around and behind her as she did so with the anxious look of a motherly barn-door fowl when the hawk hangs poised in the windless sky. By the time the three men had...", "...a stone to sit upon while she ate her supper. She soon found one, smooth as any pebble in the brook. Here she could eat at her leisure, while a band of crickets and katydids played to her, and all the beautiful stars twinkled over her head, and all the grass about her was strung with glistening drops of dew. \"After all,\" she thought, \"this is more to my taste than being shut up in my curtained bed at home. What's the use in stars and dew, if we never look at them? What use is there <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> breeze, if we shut it out with our windows?

The long blades bent this way and that, and shook their dew-drops over her. What could this mean? Had the grass feet? Could it draw its roots up out of the ground and walk? Why, _she_ was moving! The grass behind...", "...happy to see her so hungry, and now feeling tranquil herself, said to her as they left the table: \"All our friends are coming to spend Sunday with us. I have invited the Prince, the Chevalier, and Monsieur de Belvigne.\" Yvette turned a little pale, but did not reply. She went out almost immediately, reached the railway station, and took a ticket for Paris. And during all the afternoon, she went from druggist to druggist, buying from each one a few drops of chloroform. She came back <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with her pockets full of little bottles. She began the same system on the following day, and by chance found a chemist who gave her, at one stroke, a quarter of a liter. She did not go out on Saturday; it was a lowering and sultry day; she passed it entirely on the terrace, stretched on a long wicker-chair. She thought of almost nothing, very resolute and very calm. She put on the next morning, a blue costume which was very becoming to her, wishing to look well. Then...", "...both hands, and he drank as long as she gave any milk. But the icy rain began to fall more heavily, and he saw no place of shelter on the whole of that bare plain. He was cold, and he looked at a light which was shining among the trees in the window of a house. The cow had lain down again heavily, and he sat down by her side and stroked her head, grateful for the nourishment she had given him. The animal's strong, thick breath, which came out of her nostrils like two jets of steam <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> air, blew on the workman's face, and he said: \"You are not cold inside there!\" He put his hands on her chest and under her stomach to find some warmth there, and then the idea struck him that he might pass the night beside that large, warm animal. So he found a comfortable place and laid his head on her side, and then, as he was worn out with fatigue, fell asleep immediately. He woke up, however, several times, with his back or his stomach half frozen, according as he...", "...certainty you had fondly hoped. Of course it is not always so. I recollect one evening on the Test, when, after a hot day with scarce a semblance of a feeding fish, except tailers, there was a grand evening rise, and on a big red quill I got seven fish, almost from the same spot, in little over a quarter of an hour; but these days are too infrequent to alter my stated opinion that the evening rise is an overrated pleasure, and generally produces vexation of spirit. If you do fish <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> hours, recollect that you must be just as cautious in approaching fish as if it were broad daylight; that any sign of drag will as effectually put a fish down as in the earlier hours. Your fly must float and cock as jauntily as in the morning, but you lose the chief charm of fishing the floating fly, namely, that you cannot spot your fish in the water and watch their movements; you have to cast at a rise, or where you imagine a rise to have been. Use a small fly at first...", "...death, notwithstanding that the papers were full of it, and that the reward gave an excellent description of his personal appearance, greatly puzzled Gorby. The only way in which to account for Moreland's extraordinary silence was that he was out of town, and had neither seen the papers nor heard anyone talking about the murder. If this were the case he might either stay away for an indefinite time or return after a few days. At all events it was worth while going down to St. Kilda <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on the chance that Moreland might have returned to town, and would call to see his friend. So, after his tea, Mr. Gorby put on his hat, and went down to Possum Villa, on what he could not help acknowledging to himself was a very slender possibility. Mrs. Hableton opened the door for him, and in silence led the way, not into her own sitting-room, but into a much more luxuriously furnished apartment, which Gorby guessed at once was that of Whyte's. He looked keenly...", "...away. THE LIGHT OF STARS. The night is come, but not too soon; And sinking silently, All silently, the little moon Drops down behind the sky.

O no! from that blue tent above, A hero's armor gleams. And earnest thoughts within me rise, When I behold afar, Suspended <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> skies, The shield of that red star. O star of strength!

CHAPTER XIII TONY STRETTON RETURNS TO STEPNEY Mr. Chase left the mission quite early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and walked towards his lodging. That side of his nature which clamoured for enjoyments and a life of luxury was urgent with him to-night. As he turned into his street he began to debate with himself whether he should go in search of a cab and drive westwards out of the squalor. A church clock had just struck nine; he would find his club open and his friends about the fire. Thus debating he came to his own door, and had unconsciously taken his latch-key from his pocket...", "...ways for which I gave some Small articles in return.-Great numbers of Skiming knets on their houses.

They were just as eager for a change as Jerry. Without delay, the boys started back to the storehouse. They took with them a lighted lantern, and each was provided with a snowshoe for digging purposes. The task proved a long and weary one, but they pluckily persevered. They chiseled a passage straight down the trough of the ravine, guided along the way by well-remembered landmarks. Shortly after seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Jerry's snowshoe broke through the thin wall of snow, and the delighted boys tumbled out into the dusky night air. They found themselves several yards beyond the mouth of the ravine. Far in front stretched the lake, its icy surface almost free of snow. Behind was the great drift, mounting higher and higher as it receded, until it rose many feet above the banks of the ravine. The tree that had fallen across the storehouse was utterly invisible, while of the upper tree...", "...over in silence. It is only fair, however, to say that the same men who, when furiously drunk, were a disgrace to themselves and the organization to which they belonged, were, as a general rule, faithful and brave soldiers when sober. At 4 o'clock on the morning of the 28th we broke camp at Springfield, and started back to Little Rock, marching in a south-easterly direction. We marched all that day, the 29th, 30th, and 31st, and arrived at our old camp at Huntersville at 9 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the last mentioned day. According to the official report the entire distance marched on the expedition, going and coming, was 190 miles, and we didn't see an armed Confederate on the whole trip. Our return route was through the wilderness, most of it primeval forest, and we didn't pass through a single town. But now there is a railroad that runs practically over all the course we followed during the last three days we were on this march. I haven't been in that region...", "...told I should find boats that would carry me the rest of the way to Philadelphia. It rained very hard all the day. I was thoroughly soaked, and by noon a good deal tired, so I stopped at a poor inn, where I stayed all night, beginning now to wish that I had never left home. I cut so miserable a figure, too, that I found, by the questions asked me, I was suspected to be some runaway servant and in danger of being taken up on that suspicion. However, I proceeded the next day, and got <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to an inn, within eight or ten miles of Burlington, kept by one Dr. Brown. He entered into conversation with me while I took some refreshment, and, finding I had read a little, became very sociable and friendly. Our acquaintance continued as long as he lived.[n] He had been, I imagine, an itinerant doctor; for there was no town in England, or country in Europe, of which he could not give a very particular account. He had some letters,[41] and was ingenious, but much of...", "...life. Samson's stirring up of the Israelites reminded me of many scenes in Petrograd in 1917, and when, at last, he brings the temple down in ruins on his triumphant enemies, I was reminded of the words attributed to Trotsky:- \"If we are, in the end, forced to go, we shall slam the door behind us in such away that the echo shall be felt throughout the world.\" Going home afterwards through the snow, I did not see a single armed man. A year ago the streets were deserted after ten <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> except by those who, like myself, had work which took them to meetings and such things late at night. They used to be empty except for the military pickets round their log-fires. Now they were full of foot-passengers going home from the theatres, utterly forgetful of the fact that only twelve months before they had thought the streets of Moscow unsafe after dark. There could be no question about it. The revolution is settling down, and people now think of other...", "...from Spanish machetes. Night came; heavy clouds hung low in the sky; the force of the wind had increased almost to a gale; below in the bay the war-ships were anchored, their search-lights streaming out here and there like ribbons of gold on a pall of black velvet. No signs of the enemy on land or sea, and, save for those two cold, lifeless forms on the heights, one might have believed the previous rattle of musketry had been heard only by the imagination. Until nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the occupants of the camp kept careful watch, and then without warning, as before, the crack of repeating rifles broke the almost painful stillness. [Illustration: U. S. S. MARBLEHEAD.] The enemy was making his presence known once more, and this time it became evident he was in larger force. Another 3-inch gun was brought into play; a launch from the _Marblehead_, with a Colt machine gun in her bow, steamed swiftly shoreward and opened fire; skirmish lines were...", "...and S.S.E., I thought this a good time to stretch to the eastward, in order to get round, or, at least, to get a sight of the S.E. end of the island. The wind continued at S.E. by S., most part of the 16th. It was variable between S. and E, on the 17th; and on the 18th, it was continually veering from one quarter to another; blowing, sometimes, in hard squalls, and, at other times, calm, with thunder, lightning, and rain. In the afternoon, we had the wind westerly for a few hours; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it shifted to E. by S., and we stood to the southward, close hauled, under an easy sail, as the Discovery was at some distance astern. At this time the S.E. point of the island bore S.W. by S., about five leagues distant; and I made no doubt that I should be able to weather it. But at one o'clock, next morning, it fell calm, and we were left to the mercy of a north-easterly swell, which impelled us fast towards the land; so that, long before day-break, we saw lights upon...", "...what can one do?\" asked Ann Veronica. Part 3 She dressed carefully for dinner in a black dress that her father liked, and that made her look serious and responsible. Dinner was quite uneventful. Her father read a draft prospectus warily, and her aunt dropped fragments of her projects for managing while the cook had a holiday. After dinner Ann Veronica went into the drawing-room with Miss Stanley, and her father went up to his den for his pipe and pensive petrography. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she heard him whistling, poor man! She felt very restless and excited. She refused coffee, though she knew that anyhow she was doomed to a sleepless night. She took up one of her father's novels and put it down again, fretted up to her own room for some work, sat on her bed and meditated upon the room that she was now really abandoning forever, and returned at length with a stocking to darn. Her aunt was making herself cuffs out of little slips of insertion under the...", "...I can't tell you how he had come to know. I am sure Curdie had not told him. Someone about the palace must have seen them, after all. He sat for a good while thinking. There was no sound to be heard except that of a little stream which ran merrily out of an opening in the rock by where they sat, and sped away down the hill through the garden. Then he rose and, leaving Irene where she was, went into the house and sent for Lootie, with whom he had a talk that made her cry. When <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he rode away upon his great white horse, he left six of his attendants behind him, with orders that three of them should watch outside the house every night, walking round and round it from sunset to sunrise. It was clear he was not quite comfortable about the princess. CHAPTER 11 The Old Lady's Bedroom Nothing more happened worth telling for some time. The autumn came and went by. There were no more flowers in the garden. The wind blew strong, and howled...", "...moor of sixteen miles, which promises very little for the interior parts of the kingdom; but the prospect mended as we advanced. Passing through Dunbar, which is a neat little town, situated on the sea-side, we lay at a country inn, where our entertainment far exceeded our expectation; but for this we cannot give the Scots credit, as the landlord is a native of England. Yesterday we dined at Haddington, which has been a place of some consideration, but is now gone to decay; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> arrived at this metropolis, of which I can say very little. It is very romantic, from its situation on the declivity of a hill, having a fortified castle at the top, and a royal palace at the bottom. The first thing that strikes the nose of a stranger, shall be nameless; but what first strikes the eye, is the unconscionable height of the houses, which generally rise to five, six, seven, and eight stories, and, in some places (as I am assured), to twelve.

The last was now increased by the arrival of Smith-Dorrien, who brought with him a much needed convoy with sufficient supplies to carry us on to Heilbron and a march beyond. It was midnight before all the waggons were across; but though this cruel day of march and sun tore the hearts out of the transport animals, and the flocks of sheep were so weary they could scarcely be driven along, we knew that the exertions had not been made in vain. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> came the news from the right flank guard. They had waited, fearing to expose the rear guard to a flank attack. The rear guard had made good its retreat. A gap had sprung up between the two bodies. The vigilant Boers had pounced in and stampeded the horses of one Mounted Infantry company. A sharp, fierce fight followed; rear guard hearing the fusillade swung in to help. Ultimately the Boers were checked sufficiently to enable rear and flank guards to cut inwards...", "...of a Sussex parson feigning illness a whole Sunday on hearing suddenly in the morning that a cargo, hard pressed by the revenue, had in despair been lodged among his pews. But the classical passage on this subject comes from Cornwall, from the pen of R. S.

The stranger, who was a native of some inland town, and utterly unacquainted with Cornwall and its ways, had reached the brink of the tide just as a \"landing\" was coming off. It was a scene not only to instruct a townsman, but also to dazzle and surprise. At sea, just beyond the billows, lay the vessel, well moored with...", "...heartily in the chorus, making the old prison walls ring--\"Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!\" [Illustration: SIXTEENTH CORPS.] Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible quick sword; His truth is marching on. CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!

Apunkewis, who had the two villages under Black Rock and was a friend of Long-Hand, told him that there would be a Sign. \"'There will,' said Taku-Wakin, 'but I shall bring it.' He knew that Opata meant mischief, but he could not guess what. All the way to Opata's his thought went round and round like a fire-stick in the hearth-hole. When he heard the drums he flared up like a spark in the tinder. Earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> there had been a Big Eating at Opata's, and now the men were dancing. \"'_Eyah, eyah!_' they sang. \"Taku-Wakin whirled like a spark into the ring.

Lieutenant Decater then selected for the enterprise the ketch Intrepid, lately captured by him. This vessel he manned with seventy volunteers, chiefly of his own crew; and on the 3d of February sailed from Syracuse, accompanied by the brig Siren, lieutenant Stewart. After a tempestuous passage of fifteen days, the two vessels arrived off the harbor of Tripoli, towards the close of day.--It was determined that at ten o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the Intrepid should enter the harbor, accompanied by the boats of the Siren. But a change of wind had separated the two vessels six or eight miles. As delay might prove fatal, Lieutenant Decater entered the harbor alone about eight o'clock.

On her starboard quarter lay two Tripolitan cruisers within two cables length; and on the starboard bow a number of gun-boats within half gun...", "...to hear it,\" said the old man. \"She hasn't called on me yet, though I'm the only relation she's got within a thousand miles.\" \"Mrs. Ross is very much occupied,\" said her husband, coldly. \"However, you will excuse me if I proceed to the object of my visit.

Somebody's horse came up missing, or somebody's saddle needed repairing, or somebody's shirt did not come home in season from the washer-Chinaman (for if we _do_ wear flannel shirts, we choose to have them clean when we ride out with the ladies), or something else equally important detained us. It was about nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when we reached the valley and rode up to Greenwood's Rancho, which, by the way, was the headquarters of the Democratic party. It was crowded to overflowing, as our ears told us long before we came in sight of it, and we found it utterly impossible to obtain lodgings there. This building has no windows, but a strip of crimson calico, placed half-way from the roof and running all round the house, lets in the _red_ light and supplies their place. However, we did not stop...", "...villas. We partook of some refreshment, and I was offered sundry coins and antiques, supposed to have been dug up from the amphitheatre, or the still more ancient Etruscan village. I selected an iron coin, with a fine superscription.

In this life of elbowings, unknown strangers assume an extreme importance. Curiosity is aroused, sympathy is ready to exhibit itself, and sociability is the order of the day. We cherish antipathies for a week and friendships for a month; we see people with different eyes, when we view them through the medium of acquaintanceship at watering places. We discover in men suddenly, after an hour's chat, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> after dinner, under the trees in the park where the healing spring bubbles up, a high intelligence and astonishing merits, and a month afterward we have completely forgotten these new friends, who were so fascinating when we first met them.

By day he was compelled to exercise the utmost caution, as his life would have been in jeopardy had Ibrahim Chan descried him casting loving looks at Zuleikha, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he was safe to draw attention to himself, as after eight o'clock the old man never crossed his threshold. Then the flames of the lover's heart burst into song, and he gave utterance to a _ghazel_ now of Hafiz, now of Firdusa, while still more frequently he sang his own songs.

Never have I heard of or imagined an artist so spoiled as Reeves. The spring was a very hot one for London, although to us who were accustomed to the summer heat of America, it seemed nothing. But poor Sims Reeves evidently expected to have heat prostration or a sunstroke, for he always wore a big cork helmet to rehearsals, the kind that...", "...had stayed and traded with the soldiers.

They fired about fifty shots at one Taube, but didn't register a bull.

Strange indeed--very strange!\" He returned to his study, and lighting his green-shaded reading-lamp upon the writing-table, sat down to attend to some letters. He was too wakeful now to retire to rest. Besides, Roddy was out, and he had decided to remain up until his son returned. Why Roddy should be out all night puzzled the old man greatly. His only intimate friend was the village doctor, Hubert Denton, and perhaps the doctor being called to a patient early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Roddy had gone out in the car with him. Such seemed the only explanation of his absence. \"That woman!\" remarked the old rector angrily, as he took some writing paper from a drawer. \"That woman intends mischief!

Ariadne had a big brown bruise done by a jagged pew on her upper leg shaped like a tortoise, and so we called it, so to be able to allude to it at all times and seasons. At lunch, Christina used to ask Ariadne how her tortoise was, and Ariadne answered demurely that it was getting a nice pea-green, or a good strong blue, till...", "...in purchase of four hundred free sittings for the poor and the children of the national schools; 120l. for the dome and tower, and latterly a donation of 400l., together with many other contributions and assistance, amounting in the whole to upwards of 1000l.

It was arranged that the newly-wedded pair should go abroad immediately after their marriage, accompanied by Gipsy and her mother. The wedding-day dawned, bright and beautiful, as all wedding-days should. Celeste wished to be married in the church, and no one thought of opposing her will. Gipsy stood beside her, robed in white; and if her face rivaled in pallor the dress she wore, it was thinking...", "...and between herself and the faithful young nurse they could learn, she thought, tolerable Italian.

That day was another one long to be remembered by every member of the _Rambler_ party. They drifted, using the motors just enough to give headway, fished in the clear water, and told stories of old days on the South Branch--days long to be remembered by them all. That night partook of the character of the last one so far as sleep and rest were concerned. The boat lay at a little pier not far from a rural settlement. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> villagers came down attracted by the clamor of the motors but soon returned to their homes. It was on that evening that Alex made his famous attempt to cook a river fish a la Indian. There was something the matter with the fish, or with the hot stones, or with the soil!

He had come in for his handful of grain, at the supper hour, but with hardly a word. The Father had never succeeded, save on that one occasion when Danton was the subject, in carrying on a long conversation with the maid; and now after a few sorry attempts he went out of doors.

It was very irreverent. He burst into tears, Hester moved to leave the room, but was restrained by her sister. \"My position is a most unfortunate one; since the death of poor Julia I have had no one to turn to, there has been no restraining influence in this house. Here am I working all day long in the City for those girls, and when I come home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I find my house full of people I don't know. I assure you, Mary, I don't know any of the people who come to my house. I am consulted in nothing. It is not fair--I say it is not fair; and at my death those girls will have thirty thousand pounds a-piece.\" \"I knew you had the money, James, I knew you had,\" exclaimed Aunt Mary, and even Aunt Hester could not help casting a look of admiration on her weeping brother. \"I say it is not fair; a man of my money should have a...", "...always be thankful for it.\" Finally we decided to go to Geneva and then choose some resting place in the Alps. Brigitte was enthusiastic about the lake; I thought I could already breathe the air which floats over its surface, and the odor of the verdure-clad valley; already I beheld Lausanne, Vevey, Oberland, and in the distance the summits of Monte Rosa and the immense plain of Lombardy. Already oblivion, repose, travel, all the delights of happy solitude invited us; already, when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with joined hands, we looked at each other in silence, we felt rising within us that sentiment of strange grandeur which takes possession of the heart on the eve of a long journey, the mysterious and indescribable vertigo which has in it something of the terrors of exile and the hopes of pilgrimage. Are there not in the human mind wings that flutter and sonorous chords that vibrate? How shall I describe it? Is there not a world of meaning in the simple words: \"All is...", "...way. \"It is a thing for us all to be proud of; the nation has already adopted it as a national emblem--our emblem of courage and devotion and patriotism, which will always, I hope, be treasured beyond price by the men and women of our Dynasty, the Nation, that is--of the Nation that is to be.\" Later on in the evening we had a strange endorsement of the national will. A \"People's Deputation\" of mountaineers, without any official notice or introduction, arrived at the Castle late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in the manner established by Rupert's \"Proclamation of Freedom,\" wherein all citizens were entitled to send a deputation to the King, at will and in private, on any subject of State importance. This deputation was composed of seventeen men, one selected from each political section, so that the body as a whole represented the entire nation. They were of all sorts of social rank and all degrees of fortune, but they were mainly \"of the people.\" They spoke...", "...opposite direction, he became the head of the Helping Hand League, and was atop the wave of contrition. For the tide did turn. Men are always afraid to carry their propaganda beyond the point of the ridiculous. When tomfoolery turns to foolishness its perpetrators are only too anxious for a chance to abandon it. It was impossible to keep the thing out of the newspapers. The day after that sign incident, there was a lurid story to be read at each of the city's breakfast tables and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> subways. New York took it up and made it a matter of shocked debate for a day and a half. The president of the university, in his quarterly sermon in chapel, spoke fervently of toleration and the gentle spirit. The reaction was almost as hysterical as the movement itself. The little Jewish freshmen--timid, frightened little mice, who had been going about their classroom work and scurrying home and out of reach for so many months--suddenly found themselves lauded as...", "...Fox unblushingly declaring, that \"Hanover ought to be as dear to us as Hampshire;\" although the act of settlement expressly declares it to be a breach of the compact between the king and the people, to go to war on account of any of the king's foreign possessions.

TENTH, and lastly, they abandoned the cause of the Catholics, in order to save and keep their places, when they found that the King made that abandonment a _sine qua non_: they had always, for many many years, when in opposition, supported the Catholic claims for emancipation, and had pledged themselves that, whenever they had the...", "...that made it their duty to attend corpses, ranged themselves in their white gowns, with hooded faces, of which nothing could be seen but the eyes. Silently the train moved on: they had now nearly reacht the church, when a rider on a foaming horse gallopt toward them. \"What is the matter?\" cried the youth. He threw a look into the coffin, and with a shriek of despair turned his horse, darted away, and in his wild speed lost his hat, so that his long hair waved about behind him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> breeze. He was the bridegroom, come to the wedding. Darkness gathered round the train of mourners, and their husht rites, as the beauteous corpse sank down into the vault of her family. * * * * * When the crowd had disperst, the young stranger, who had followed the procession in wonder mixt with sadness, went up to an old priest who remained alone praying by the grave. He longed to learn who that majestic old man was, that had seemed...", "...Men are frequently injured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon them. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out of his mother's sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker. There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their hard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest. I have mentioned Dick's faults and defects, because I want it understood, to begin with, that I don't consider him a model boy. But there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above doing...", "...silenced by anything short of the deepest degradation. The people--the great people--need something--something higher, more ennobling, more tender--to fill the vacant spot in their hearts and homes, to preserve the balance between the animal and the spiritual part of their lives, and to clothe their surroundings with a higher and holier significance than can arise from the events and associations of the work-day life. In art the missing link is found, and whether it be the simple ballad <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> circle or the modest print that graces the humble cottage walls--and the humbler the habitation the deeper the manifestation, because the more touching--it is but the expression of the people's appreciation of the needs, the capacities, and the holier aspirations of the better part of humanity. Hence the revival of art has a deep significance; it is something more than a forced, an exotic, and hence ephemeral growth; it is the manifestation of the awakening of the people...", "...inaugurating the \"ball,\" as Sibley took pains to term it on all occasions, Van Berg, as a part of his tactics to win the beauty's good-will, tried at first to make the affair successful. He danced with others, and twice sought her hand; but in each case she rather indifferently told him that she was engaged. He would not have sought her as a partner after his first rebuff had he not imagined, from occasional and furtive glances, that she was not as indifferent as she seemed. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it occurred to him that her slightly reckless manner was assumed, but he saw that she was abandoning herself to the growing excitement of the dance, as Sibley, her most frequent partner, and others, were to the stronger excitement of liquor. Observant mothers called away their daughters. Ladies, in whom the instincts of true refined womanhood were in the ascendancy, looked significantly at each other, and declined further invitations. Van Berg had also withdrawn, but...", "...12 bushels of Corn--& smoked &c I answered the Speech it explained, many parts which he Could not understand-of the Speech of yesterday.

The \"St. George\" was a beautiful boat with three masts, and as we have said Willy had made more than one trip on it with his father. He was then the darling of the crew. Now as he climbed the ladder behind the Captain strange faces peered down at him over the railing; there were new officers, and officers and crew alike seemed rough fellows. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> as he stood on the rear deck watching the golden crosses of the Church of the Holy Saviour in the light of the setting sun, he heard a well-known voice behind him speak his name. \"Oh, it is you, Tommy Green!\" said Willy looking around in a friendly manner. \"So there really is after all one old friend on board. Are you still the second mate? Where are James and John and all the rest?\" \"Well, Master Willy,\" said Tommy, \"they are all gone, one to the 'South Star,'...", "...The farmers out on the hills heard it, and came driving furiously into the village to see what was the matter. Mr. Tooter and Mr. Noggin, with Mr. Chrome, who had a new flag, walked out upon the parade-ground. The musicians struck up Yankee-Doodle. How it stirred the hearts of everybody,--the sharp, shrill notes of the fife,--the roll, the rattle, and the rat-a-tat-tat of the drum, and the clanging of the bell, and the sight of that flag, its crimson folds and fadeless stars waving <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> breeze! Never had it looked so beautiful. The little boys swung their caps and cheered, the women waved their handkerchiefs, and the men hurrahed in an outburst of wild enthusiasm. Then they formed in procession with Colonel Dare for marshal,--the music and the flag in advance, Rev. Mr. Surplice, Judge Adams, and Squire Capias next, and then all the citizens, marching round the public square to the church, filling the house, the pews, the aisles, the entry, and hanging...", "...to you this morning in a way of which I am ashamed; we have lived so long together--and yet we came nearer to quarrelling to-day than we have ever done before; and it was my fault.\" Roland smiled, and held Mark's hand for a moment. \"Oh, I had not given it another thought,\" he said; \"the wonder is that you can bear with an idle fellow as you do.\" Then they talked for awhile with the pleasant glow of friendliness that two good comrades feel when they have been reconciled. But late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Roland said, \"Was there any story, Mark, about your grandfather's leaving any treasure of money behind him?\" The question grated somewhat unpleasantly upon Mark's mood; but he controlled himself and said, \"No, none that I know of--except that he found the estate rich and left it poor--and what he did with his revenues no one knows--you had better ask the old men of the village; they know more about the house than I do. But, Roland, forgive me once more if I say that I...", "...and the other thirty. I was only an evening student at the Business College, while Archie spent his days there. Often enough he did not turn up in the evening at all; indeed, he only began to do so with unfailing regularity some time after Evie Soames had put her name down for the social evening course of lectures on Business Method. Evie Soames was a day student too, though only on three days in the week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; and the lectures on Method were given <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> because they were specially addressed to those who, like myself, were employed during the day, and deemed to be ripe for the more advanced instruction. I don't think Archie was very much wiser for Weston's (our lecturer) efforts, but he was genuinely grateful to me for my explanations of them afterwards, and would pat me on the shoulder affectionately, and tell me he couldn't understand why everybody else didn't see what a rare good sort I was.

The room in which young Robinson lived in New York faced Washington Square and was long and narrow like a hallway. It is important to get that fixed in your mind. The story of Enoch is in fact the story of a room almost more than it is the story of a man. And so into the room <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> came young Enoch's friends. There was nothing particularly striking about them except that they were artists of the kind that talk. Everyone knows of the talking artists. Throughout all of the known history of the world they have gathered in rooms and talked. They talk of art and are passionately, almost feverishly, in earnest about it. They think it matters much more than it does. And so these people gathered and smoked cigarettes and talked and Enoch Robinson, the...", "...knocked up, although we had only advanced twelve miles; I therefore ordered a hut to be built that we might afford the dogs time to recruit, and also have the sledge-runners put in order.

We were many of us dwellers on the hill-tops that summer--though not at all after Mr. Grant Allen's fashion, I fancy; and one of our daily entertainments was to watch the thunderstorms marching along the lower country, investing first one mountain, then another, dividing here, converging there. And one could not but notice how the most awful thunderstorms passed by all obstacles to concentrate themselves on Matung. Commenting upon this as we sat in the starlight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> watching our other entertainment, the play of the lightning, we remarked it might be worth while to go to Matung to see what had happened there, and then were told of the magistrate's visit to inspect the egg that had been hatched, and that before all these great storms, which we had looked down upon at intervals, in a small way being at times ourselves partakers. There evidently must therefore have been some striking indication of coming calamity to call for an official...", "...the priests taught him to write with pens of reed upon tablets of wood, and told him more about the gods of Egypt than he ever wanted to hear again. During these hours, except when she was being instructed by the great ladies of the Court, or by high-priestesses, Tua was left solitary, since by the command of Pharaoh no other children were allowed to play with her, perhaps because there were none in the temple of her age whose birth was noble.

That the forceful energy of this general had a great influence in restoring the _morale_ of the French army in the confused and desperate movements which followed may freely be granted. But his claims to have been the main spring of the French movements in those anxious days deserve a brief examination. He asserts that Bonaparte, \"devoured by anxieties,\" met him at Roverbella late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of July 30th, and spoke of retiring beyond the River Po. The official correspondence disproves this assertion. Bonaparte had already given orders to Serurier to retire beyond the Po with his artillery train; but this was obviously an attempt to save it from the advancing Austrians; and the commander had ordered the northern part of the French besieging force to join Augereau between Roverbella and Goito. Augereau further asserts that, after he had roused Bonaparte to the...", "...happened to her before within my knowledge. I felt almost ashamed of her; but she loved you so much, as she later confessed to me weeping! When she came to herself again, and whilst, as we thought, she was reposing in her own room, she had stealthily gone off to the farm, ordered Tancredo to be saddled, and ridden away at full gallop. At dinner we became dreadfully uneasy as she did not put in an appearance, and neither the General nor myself could eat.

We are making for Santos, and an old German who rests his elbows on the rail tells how he has known this coast for thirty years, and how, in the old days, it reeked with yellow fever; how whole ships' crews went down before the scourge, and how no passenger boats dared lie at Santos for the night, but always slipped down to the mouth of the river <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> so that fresh air could be obtained. Now drainage has done wonders, and Santos, a great export town for Brazilian coffee, is improving itself. I get into conversation with the man who has been engaged to settle in Santos and see that the place is improved. The river is deep, serviceable, and runs far inland.

So far, everything had succeeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent men. Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great precept, they made a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them. After the heat of these warm summer days, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when their work was finished and the sea breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the edge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of verandah, covered with creepers, which Neb had made with his own hands. There they talked, they instructed each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humour of the sailor always amused this little world, in which the most perfect harmony had never ceased to reign. They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What...", "...could be seen returning to their lines. There were but few preparations to be made by the garrison for their journey. It had been settled that they might take their personal effects with them, but it was at once agreed to take as little as possible, as there would probably be but little room in the boats, and the fewer things they carried the less there would be to tempt the cupidity of the natives. \"Well, Bathurst, what do you think of the outlook?\" the Doctor asked, as late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they sat together on some sandbags in a corner of the terrace. \"I think that if we get past Cawnpore in safety there is not much to fear.

The odds against the British on this day were two and a half to one. The 50th Division on the left was doing well on the Craonne Plateau, when in the course of the morning they suddenly found that the enemy was behind them. Owing to this surprise, the neighboring brigade of the 50th Division suffered badly. By afternoon General Fritz von Below's men had got to the line of the river, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the British were back at Guyencourt. By Wednesday evening they held a large crescent around Fismes from Lopeigne on the west through Coulanges and Lagery back to the Vesle at Muizon. By this time the fighting strength of the British units was greatly reduced, but reinforcements were coming up and the worst of the crisis was over. The full story of the splendid episode can hardly yet be told, but some day it will shine among the greatest achievements of the war. Some...", "...a flood in the river from coming up the channel, for it indicates plainly how requisite it is that the river should be seen from below and not from above. The best view of the larger fall itself is that seen from the wood. And here again I would point out that any male visitor should walk the channel of the river up and down. The descent is too slippery and difficult for bipeds laden with petticoats. We found a small hotel open at Trenton, at which we got a comfortable dinner, and then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> were driven back to Utica. Albany is the capital of the State of New York, and our road from Trenton to West Point lay through that town; but these political State capitals have no interest in themselves. The State legislature was not sitting, and we went on, merely remarking that the manner in which the railway cars are made to run backward and forward through the crowded streets of the town must cause a frequent loss of human life. One is led to suppose that...", "...journall for five or six days backward, and so home to look after dinner, it being now almost noon. At noon comes Mrs. Turner and Dyke, and Mrs. Dickenson, and then comes The. and Betty Turner, the latter of which is a very pretty girl; and then Creed and his wife, whom I sent for, by my coach. These were my guests, and Mrs. Turner's friend, whom I saw the other day, Mr. Wicken, and very merry we were at dinner, and so all the afternoon, talking, and looking up and down my house; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I did bring out my cake--a noble cake, and there cut it into pieces, with wine and good drink: and after a new fashion, to prevent spoiling the cake, did put so many titles into a hat, and so drew cuts; and I was the Queene; and The.

Swarms of mosquitoes succeeded the storm and their tormenting stings, superadded to other inconveniences, induced us to embark and, after taking a hasty supper, to pursue our voyage down the stream during the night. At six on the following morning we passed the Reindeer Islands and at ten reached the entrance of the Dog River where we halted to set the fishing nets. These were examined <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> but, to our mortification, we obtained only four small trout and were compelled to issue part of our preserved meats for supper.

The weather being very hazy, we had but an indistinct view of the Isle of Sal, one of the Cape de Verd islands, bearing NW by W 1/4 W distant eight leagues; and at one the same day, we came in sight of the Island of Bonavista, bearing S.W. distant two leagues. Captain Phillip designing to anchor for a few hours at the Island of St. Iago, to procure water and other refreshments, if he could get in without any risk or difficulty, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> shortened sail, and made the convoy's signal to close, the run from thence to that island being too great to admit of our reaching it before dark. The _Supply_ was directed at the same time to keep ahead with a light during the night; and at twelve o'clock the night signal was made for the fleet to bring-to. At six the next morning we made sail again, and soon after passed the Isle of May, distant about four leagues, bearing NW by W of us.

A little way on several paths branched off through patches of second-growth forest to cane-fields, gardens, and scattered houses, beyond which again the dark wall of verdure striped with tree-trunks, marked out the limits of the primeval forests. The voices of many birds promised good shooting, and on my return I found that my boys had already obtained two or three kinds I had not seen before; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> a native brought me a rare and beautiful species of ground-thrush (Pitta novaeguinaeae) hitherto only known from New Guinea. As I improved my acquaintance with them I became much interested in these people, who are a fair sample of the true savage inhabitants of the Aru Islands, tolerably free from foreign admixture. The house I lived in contained four or five families, and there were generally from six to a dozen visitors besides. They kept up a continual row from...", "...over the immense building. Oreille was very angry, and peremptorily told his wife to get him a new one, a good silk one, for twenty francs, and to bring him the bill, so that he might see that it was all right. She bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger as she gave it to her husband: \"This will last you for five years at least.\" Oreille felt quite triumphant, and received a small ovation at the office with his new acquisition. When he went home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> his wife said to him, looking at the umbrella uneasily: \"You should not leave it fastened up with the elastic; it will very likely cut the silk. You must take care of it, for I shall not buy you a new one in a hurry.\" She took it, unfastened it, and remained dumfounded with astonishment and rage; in the middle of the silk there was a hole as big as a six-penny-piece; it had been made with the end of a cigar. \"What is that?\" she screamed. Her husband replied...", "...lilting upward leap in the refrain, when, with a dexterous movement of the frying-pan, he tossed the cake into the air, making it execute a joyful somersault, and catching it with a sizzling _splat_ in the pan, just as the lilting measure ceased abruptly.

On this important occasion he was dressed in a suit of dark brown cloth of American manufacture. He wore white silk stockings, silver buckles and a steel-hilted sword. His hair was powdered and tied behind, according to the fashion of that time. The day was given up to rejoicings; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> there were illuminations and fireworks.

Sometimes days would elapse before a favourable opportunity occurred for the murder; an instance is mentioned of a gang having accompanied a family of eleven persons for twenty days during which they had traversed upwards of 200 miles and then murdered the whole of them; and another gang accomplished 160 miles in twelve days in company with a party of sixty men, women and children, before they found a propitious occasion.

I had been paired off, for the occasion, with a Mademoiselle Dumoulin, daughter of a retired colonel, a young, blond, soldierly person, well formed, frank and talkative.

You've no business here!\" \"No, no, sentry; leave him alone!\" said a loud voice; and Richard looked up, to see that the windows were full of officers, whose scarlet mess-vests, with their rows of tiny buttons, shone <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light. Higher up there were ladies looking down; and then the musician glanced sharply round and began to thrust his piccolo back into his breast-pocket. \"Hold hard, there!\" cried the same voice, and Richard looked quickly up, to meet the dark eyes of a big, handsome, youngish man, who, napkin in hand, towered above the others, but turned sharply round, and Richard heard him say-- \"May we have him in, sir?\" \"Oh, yes!\" came back in a quick, commanding voice, and...", "...their dogs, to let Trotsey have them, and they said that it made a great difference in the health and appearance of their pets.

The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrushka (Denisov's servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that he was applying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff--and this interested him extremely--whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostov had betted he would sell...", "...and said, 'Go and take the goats to pasture!'

'And what are we to do?' asked the uncle. 'I will kill _her_, dear uncle. I do not want either a father or a mother like that!' When they came home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they saw the woman preparing supper, and secretly scattering the powdered bones of the serpent on one side of the dish. On the other, where she meant to eat herself, there was no poison. And the boy whispered to his uncle, 'Dear uncle, be sure you eat from the same side of the dish as I do!'

They set out on their march <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the 18th of April, 1775. The next morning, the General sent Lord Percy, with nine hundred men, to strengthen the troops which had gone before. All that day, the inhabitants of Boston heard various rumors.

Others affirmed that every man had turned out with his musket, and that not a single soldier would ever get back to Boston. \"It was after sunset,\" continued Grandfather, \"when the troops,...", "...was much surprised at this, for all the talk was that the match would be with the eldest sister, Lady R--, and not the youngest.

On three sides of him stretched the lake; on the fourth, the forest, darkening <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> gloom. Somewhere far out in the lake, a fish leaped with a splash. Kiopo turned his head uneasily towards the sound. It seemed to make the immense water more vast and lovely than before. He dreaded the lake now: it was a horror he would never forget.

The tramp withdrew to some distance from the cabin and lay down under a tree, where he was soon fast asleep. Curiously, it was the very oak tree under which Peter's little hoard was concealed, but this, of course, he did not know.

At the little noisy wharf crowds of natives pressed goods on us for sale, among them being lovely baskets of coral, conch shells, _sulu's_ and _tapa_.

Therefore, train yourself every morning to protect yourself by the words of faith before going to your work and fight your fight; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when you lie down to rest, you must train yourself so that in fight as well as during the lull, you can be covered by the shield of faith; then you will conquer the wiles of the devil, and his fiery darts will not wound you.

In a frenzy of enthusiasm the Viennese resumed the struggle. A corps of students attempted a sortie.

Haydn, in fact, having done his day's work manfully, seemed determined to have a jolly fling <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of his life, and, we may note, he determined to have it at a profit. In the event his little fling turned out to be, so far as externals went, quite the most exhilarating part of his life; until now all might seem to have been mere prelude and preparation. At Eisenstadt, Esterhaz and Vienna he had received compliments and presents, and had been regarded as more or less of a great little man. But in those days he had also been a servant, compelled when on duty to wear a...", "...You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at.

And he was not without weapons, either. Sir George could have unfolded a tale in that respect had he chosen to do so.

Rejoicings over their victory were mingled with lamentations over the death of their chief--ceremonies in which neither Kiddie nor Rube took any personal interest.

The _Mariner's_ men saw several raids; but it was the first one they witnessed which left the most lasting impression on their minds. There had been the usual report early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the effect that Zeps might be expected; but they had been warned so often before that, beyond taking the usual precautions in regard to lights, nobody on board really paid very much attention to it.

The act had been a breach of discipline, so Mr. Sparling prudently kept himself out of sight until the show had progressed further.

Mrs. Daker's still sweet eyes fell upon me; and she shook my hand; and by her commanding calmness smothered my astonishment, so that the bystanders should not see it.

AT BOULOGNE-SUR-MER. I had an unfortunate friend at Boulogne in the year 1865--then and many years before.

Gallito sat down to his cards <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> as regularly as he went to bed exactly at twelve o'clock; and not cards alone. When he came \"inside\" there were brought forth from various nooks of obscurity in his dwelling other gambling devices, among them a faro layout, a keno goose, and a roulette wheel. Undoubtedly, the play ran high in the Gallito cabin, but although Hanson sometimes sat in at this or that game, more often he sat talking to Pearl in the soft shadow of the porch. To her he made no secret of his...", "...other children were educated. Nor is it astonishing that she should not have understood the highly complex organism of the young lady we have chosen for our heroine, who was shaken, at the age of thirteen, by unfulfilled longings. Very early in life Honora learned to dread the summer, when one by one the families of her friends departed until the city itself seemed a remote and distant place from what it had been in the spring and winter. The great houses were closed and blinded, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the servants who had been left behind chattered on the front steps. Honora could not bear the sound of the trains that drifted across the night, and the sight of the trunks piled in the Hanburys' hall, in Wayland Square, always filled her with a sickening longing.

Sometimes, when she looked in the mirror, she was filled with a fierce belief in a destiny to sit in the high seats, to...", "...which was prettier than the one he had worn before. III. STRONG DESIRE, AND THE RED SORCERER. There was a man called Odshedoph, or the Child of Strong Desires, who had a wife and one son. He had withdrawn his family from the village, where they had spent the winter, to the neighborhood of a distant forest, where game abounded. This wood was a day's travel from his winter home, and under its ample shadow the wife fixed the lodge, while the husband went out to hunt. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he returned with a deer, and, being weary and athirst, he asked his son, whom he called Strong Desire, to go to the river for some water. The son replied that it was dark, and he was afraid. His father still urged him, saying that his mother, as well as himself, was tired, and the distance to the water very short. But no persuasion could overcome the young man's reluctance. He refused to go. \"Ah, my son,\" said the father, at last, \"if you are afraid to go to the...", "...no further coin from you, for the rapacity of the Governor is like a bottomless pit that would swallow all that you have.\" What Suleiman told him agreed perfectly with the report of the officer whom Haroun had sent to Ali that morning. \"Suleiman,\" said the Caliph, \"I believe you are right; moreover, I think I can forward your suit better than by sending any more gold pieces to Ali.

Being continued in the lectureship after the appointment of Hooker, Travers was in the habit of attempting a refutation <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of what Hooker had spoken in the morning, Hooker again replying on the following Sunday; so it was said \"the forenoon sermon spake Canterbury, the afternoon Geneva.\" On account of the keen feeling displayed by the partisans of both, Archbishop Whitgift deemed it prudent to prohibit the preaching of Travers, whereupon he presented a petition to the council to have the prohibition recalled.

He argued that it was a rare thing for Bessie not to be in the garden late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> if the weather happened to be fine, and that the man on the other side of the wall would be naturally surprised, and perhaps alarmed. Mr. Daniel Meggison chuckled to himself at the thought of his own cunning, and sat down in such a position that he could watch the garden. He had not long to wait.

In these they drive to certain gardens, where they are entertained by the owners in pavilions erected on purpose, and there they divert themselves the livelong day, with their ladies, returning home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in those same carriages.[NOTE 10] (FURTHER PARTICULARS OF THE PALACE OF THE KING FACFUR.) The whole enclosure of the Palace was divided into three parts. The middle one was entered by a very lofty gate, on each side of which there stood on the ground-level vast pavilions, the roofs of which were sustained by columns painted and wrought in gold and the finest azure. Opposite the gate stood the chief Pavilion, larger than the rest, and painted in like style, with...", "...until they reach the front of the High Altar; there they remain, striking their castanets and performing slow and very graceful evolutions for some time, gradually retiring again as they came in, dancing, down the nave. The boys are regularly instructed in the dance by the priests, and the number is kept up, so that neither dancers nor garments ever fail. The Pope's order is obeyed, while the Sevillanos retain their strange religious function. The fact of the performance taking place <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> perhaps accounts for its being so little known, but it would seem also as if the authorities of the cathedral do not care to have attention drawn to it. The dance is called _los seises_, and even the origin of the name is unknown.

He came back in an hour, and told me that we were to start that evening in a boat belonging to the admiralty, which was placed at our disposal. The governor, M. Fadier, the port-admiral, and all the superior society of the place were visiting the prince, as we had before been told; but Madame Fadier had been kept at home by indisposition, and that lady, whose name will frequently appear in our reminiscences of Astrakhan, obligingly removed all our difficulties. We embarked <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in the boat, with a crew of six stout Kalmuck rowers and a Tatta pilot. We expected to arrive at the prince's in the morning; but by some unaccountable chance I was seized all at once with a dread that obliged us to halt, in spite of our eager desire to reach our journey's end. The night was very dark, and the river, the waves of which made our boat reel, seemed to me boundless; yet all this was not enough to account for the insurmountable terror that took hold of me so...", "...which if true is very sad. 19th (Lord's day).

He had been to a concert, and had been quite enchanted with the admirable performance of a famous violin player whom he had heard there. The performer had produced from his instrument a richness of tone that sometimes sounded like tinkling waterdrops or rolling pearls; sometimes like the birds twittering in chorus, and then rising and swelling in sound like the wind through the fir-trees.

We met several of them on the road, and they travel as if time were no object to them; for example, the courier now alluded to kept company with us at our two mile an hour pace from 6 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> till 10 next day. Others of them on ponies have done the same thing, and I know they spend their time in yourts, gossiping and drinking tea for hours together.

The ferry landed; she hurried out and took a surface car And how good the crowd seemed, how warm the noise and the lights, what gladness was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> ebb-tide of people, how splendid the avenues shone with their sparkle and their shops and their traffic! She felt again the good hard pave under her feet. She met again a hundred familiar scenes. The vast flood of life seemed to engulf her, suck her up as if to say: \"Well, you're here again!

Am I to be _hunted_ in this manner?' I satisfied him that I could not divine that the visit would not be convenient, and that I certainly could not take it upon me of my own accord to forbid the General. I found Dr. Johnson <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in Mrs. Williams's room, at tea and coffee with her and Mrs. Desmoulins, who were also both ill; it was a sad scene, and he was not in very good humour.

At a period when scarcely anyone gave a thought to the peasants, or heeded whether they lived or died, Arnauld's labourers were all well paid, and the old and ill fed and clothed. And if monsieur Arnauld did not go amongst them much himself, he allowed his wife to do as she liked, and gave her sound advice in her difficulties.

There were several parties walking there even at the early hour in the morning when we saw it, and I understood upon enquiry, that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it is exceedingly thronged both with walkers and carriages. I did not omit to make my usual enquiries, as to the prices of land, provisions, and the state of society, for a foreigner who should select it as a place of residence.

In rating French and English purchases, there is one considerable point of...", "...do that just once ... won't you? Please!\" \"Yes, yes.\" \"It would mean so much to me.

He had only been in the mills for about three months and had spent his spare time inciting well-satisfied workmen to strike.

So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> about seven o'clock the deputation of six men came, headed by Luc Baste. \"Well, what is it?\" Carnac asked calmly. Luc Baste began, not a statement of facts, but an oration on the rights of workers, their downtrodden condition and their beggarly wages. He said they had not enough to keep body and soul together, and that right well did their employers know it. He said there should be an increase of a half-dollar a day, or there would be a strike.

Then Owen unsheathed his sword, and cut off the serpent's head and went on his way, and the lion followed and played about him, as if he had been a greyhound. And much more useful was he than a greyhound, for <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he brought large logs in his mouth to kindle a fire, and killed a fat buck for dinner. Owen made his fire and skinned the buck, and put some of it to roast, and gave the rest to the lion for supper. While he was waiting for the meat to cook he heard a sound of deep sighing close to him, and he said: 'Who are thou?'

For as Martin Luther said, \"God writes the Gospel not in the Bible alone, but in trees and flowers and clouds and stars.\" Sunday Sunday in a boys' camp should be observed by the holding of a service in the morning, with song, scripture reading, prayer and a short talk. The afternoon is usually occupied by letter writing, Bible study, or reading, the day closing with a vesper service <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> just as the sun is setting.

All of us can recollect the myriads of shells and bombs that flew in our midst and over our heads, dealing out death wherever they struck in our ranks, and few of the headstones which marked the graves in the old cemetery were left unbroken after that shower of shells. \"The terrible charge the rebels made <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the second day to force us from our position on Cemetery Hill has passed into history as one of the most desperate and bloody of this memorable battle. The charge was made from the streets of the town by the rebel brigade known as the 'Louisiana Tigers,' and it is officially stated that out of 1700 men in that brigade less than 300 'Tigers' returned to the town after that charge. The third day's battle was nearly a duplicate of the day...", "...old commandant, as were the dying man's by the Director. He died. When he had been dead some days the Director sent to Psamatia a kind request to the officer to come and talk to his friend, with private directions that they were to be told the man had just died when they came. Anyway, by the end of the third day after the \"torpedoing,\" my patience was at an end. I had learned, after many weeks, how difficult it was to get out of a hospital once one was in. After more scenes I left <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in an _arabana_, bearing a letter in Turkish, saying I had been excellently treated and had received the best attention possible. On arrival at Psamatia my little sad room seemed heaven again. I was alone, and the groaning of the Russians was somewhere away. The new commandant was haughty and somewhat Germanic, but I found him a much better fellow, and straight. He did what he promised. He heard my complaints about the men, and rectified their pay and provisions, he...", "...such as have often been described, though mine probably were of a new character. The detail of them, however, is not within the limits of my present undertaking; I record only simple facts, in the manner of an obtuse old chronicler; and if there be a colouring of imagination, it is not only unsought, but unwelcome and involuntary. During these three days, I did not behold the features of any living being, except the peevish face of an old sub-janitor, who brought my food, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> lighted my lamp. Hitherto, I had felt like a warrior, who, in a mood of martial excitement, was determined, at all, risks, to meet danger and fight his way to the last; but such passion had now time enough to decline entirely away. I fell into a dark melancholy trance, during which all things became indifferent. Even the cherished vision of Aurelia had faded, or floated in dim colours before me. But unless I had been in body as much disordered as in mind, this state of...", "...solitary point of the Houmet of Vason Bay, two lovers were lingering, hesitating before they parted for the night. The young woman addressed the young man with the words, \"I am not going because I don't care to stay with you: I've a great deal to do.\" Their farewell kiss was interrupted by a good sized sailing boat which passed very near them, making for the direction of the Messellettes. Monsieur le Peyre des Norgiots, an inhabitant of Cotillon Pipet, was engaged about nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in examining a hole made by some trespassers in the hedge of his property called La Jennerotte, and his \"_friquet_ planted with trees.\" Even while ascertaining the amount of the damage, he could not help observing a fishing-boat audaciously making its way round the Crocq Point at that hour of night. On the morrow of a tempest, when there is always some agitation upon the sea, that route was extremely unsafe. It was rash to choose it, at least, unless the steersman knew...", "...golf than at home--and Lady Henrietta had been gracious to her, and given her Paul's address, and there had been a \"jolly big party\" at Verdayne Place for Sunday, but none of his \"pals.\" At least if there were, they were not in church, she added naively. All this Paul read in his launch on the way to the Rigi, and for some unexplained reason the information seemed about things a long way off, and less thrilling than usual. He had a splendid climb, and when he got back to Lucerne <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he was thoroughly tired, and so hungry he flew down to his dinner. It was nearly nine o'clock; at least if she came to-night he would be there to see her. But of course it did not matter if she came or not, he had conquered that ridiculous interest.

February 5, 1853 (seven o'clock in the morning).--I am always astonished at the difference between one's inward mood of the evening and that of the morning. The passions which are dominant in the evening, in the morning leave the field free for the contemplative part of the soul. Our whole being, irritated and overstrung by the nervous excitement of the day, arrives <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at the culminating point of its human vitality; the same being, tranquilized by the calm of sleep, is in the morning nearer heaven. We should weigh a resolution in the two balances, and examine an idea under the two lights, if we wish to minimize the chances of error by taking the average of our daily oscillations. Our inner life describes regular curves, barometical curves, as it were, independent of the accidental disturbances which the storms of sentiment and passion...", "...to the world. Two priests with wide dirty black hats, long hair, and soiled grey gowns slowly found their way through the crowd. A bunch of Austrian prisoners in their blue-grey uniform made a strange splash of colour in a corner of the platform, where, very contentedly, they were drinking their tea; some one in the invisible distance was playing the balalaika and every now and then some church bell in the town rang clearly and sharply above the tumult. The thin films of dust, yellow <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> sun, hovered like golden smoke under the station roof. At last with a reluctant jerk and shiver the train was slowly persuaded to totter into the evening air; the evening scents were again around us, the balalaika, now upon the train, hummed behind us, as we pushed out upon her last night's journey. The two Sisters had the seats by the windows; Nikitin curled up his great length in another corner and Andrey Vassilievitch settled himself with much grunting and many...", "...the longer he left it the more it would resist. From this combat, there must result one conquered and one contused--a diabolical contusion which he wished to keep distant from his physiognomy by God's help until after his death. The poor seneschal had already great trouble to follow his lady to the chase, without being dismounted; he sweated under the weight of his trappings, and almost expired in that pursuit wherein his frisky wife cheered her life and took great pleasure. Many times <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she wished to dance. Now the good man, swathed in his heavy clothing, found himself quite worn out with these exercises, in which he was constrained to participate either in giving her his hand, when she performed the vaults of the Moorish girl, or in holding the lighted fagot for her, when she had a fancy to do the torchlight dance; and in spite of his sciaticas, accretions, and rheumatisms, he was obliged to smile and say to her some gentle words and gallantries after...", "...Timothy Crabshaw was so metamorphosed by a plain livery-frock, that even Gilbert with difficulty recognised his person. As for the novice Crowe, his head had almost resumed its natural dimensions, but then his whole face was so covered with a livid suffusion, his nose appeared so flat, and his lips so tumefied, that he might very well have passed for a Caffre or Ethiopian. Every circumstance being now adjusted, they departed from Bugden in a regular cavalcade, dined at Hatfield, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> arrived at the Bull and Gate Inn in Holborn, where they established their quarters for the night.

The first step which Sir Launcelot took in the morning that succeeded his arrival in London was to settle Mrs. Dolly Cowslip in lodgings at the house where John Clump had promised to visit her; as he did not doubt, that, though the visit was delayed, it would some time or other be...", "...ocean inviting to the tragic rite, I do not believe there is ever a kitten drowned in Kittery; the illimitable sea rather employs itself in supplying the fish to which \"no cat's averse,\" but which the cats of Kittery demand to have cooked. They do not like raw fish; they say it plainly, and they prefer to have the bones taken out for them, though they do not insist upon that point. At least, Jim never did so from the time when he first scented the odor of delicate young mackerel <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> air about our kitchen, and dropped in upon the maids there with a fine casual effect of being merely out for a walk, and feeling it a neighborly thing to call. He had on a silver collar, engraved with his name and surname, which offered itself for introduction like a visiting-card. He was too polite to ask himself to the table at once, but after he had been welcomed to the family circle, he formed the habit of finding himself with us at breakfast and supper, when he...", "...the children on the fire, and caused one of them to run near half a mile in a dark night in his shirt. After this he went and preached in the fields, where he had numerous meetings, particularly at the hill of Beeth in Fife in the year 1670. He had been before this, by the council's letter, put to the horn; and after this, came west about the year 1675, and preached in the parish of Kilbride and other places. The same year being in the Cow-hill in Mr. Livingston parish, he went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> (being in the month of August) unto a retired place. When he came in again, he seemed somewhat melancholy. Being asked by some friends, what was the reason? He said he was afraid of a contagious mist that should go through the land in many places that night, which might have sad effects, and death to follow; and as a mean he desired them to keep doors and windows as close as possible, and notice where it stood thickest and longest: which they did; which was upon a little...", "...\"but a little bit prosy,\" she whispered to me. It would charm you to hear how intelligently Mrs. P. speaks about French society, since that evening at the opera. When we return, you will find how accomplished she is. We have been here only a few weeks, and we already know all the fashionable shops, and a little more French, and we go to the confectioners, and eat _savarins_ every morning at 12, and we drive in the _Bois de Boulogne_ in the afternoon, and we dine splendidly, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we go to the opera or a theatre. To be sure, we don't have much society beside our own party. But then the shop-girls point out the distinguished women to Mrs. Potiphar, so that she can point them out when we drive; and our banker calls and keeps us up in gossip; and Mrs. Potiphar's maid, Adele, is inestimable in furnishing information; and Mr. Potiphar gets a great deal out of his commissionaire, and goes about studying his Galignani's Guide, and frequents the English...", "...was used in the preparation of food. The kitchen and commissary department was in the basement at the north end of the building. The privileges of the restaurant were by card only, and were extended to New Yorkers, Exposition officials and prominent Exposition visitors.

No restaurant upon the grounds enjoyed a greater popularity among those who were privileged to use it than did that of the New York State building.

CHAPTER X I AND THE DEMON It was already late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when Balnokhazy's butler brought me a letter, and then hurriedly departed, before I could read it. It was Lorand's writing. The message was short: \"My dear brother:--I have been betrayed and must escape: comfort our dear parents. Good-bye.\" I leaped up from my bed:--I had already gone to bed that I might get up early on the morrow:--and hastened to dress. My first idea was to go to Balnokhazy.

The situation just mentioned is nearly the same that Mr Dalrymple assigns for the S.W. point of the gulph of St Sebastian. But as we saw neither land, nor signs of land, I was the more doubtful of its existence, and was fearful that, by keeping to the south, I...", "...the contents run out. Old Ben took matters very coolly, but Story and Peter were so vexed that they undertook to ride back and replace our loss, if we would consent to move on slowly with the rest of the animals. This we gladly did, the old trapper managing them with perfect ease. He said that he had seldom known a pack of wolves to come so far east, and advised that in future we should keep a sharp look-out lest we might encounter others. Our friends overtook us the next day, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we reached Mr Praeger's. We found Dick quite recovered and ready to set off again; but it seemed doubtful whether Armitage would continue his expedition. It struck me that although Mr Praeger was very civil, he would be glad to have us go. To say the least, we occupied a great deal of the attention of the ladies of the family, and Charley hinted that honest Dick was somewhat spoony on one of them. Story had also been warm in his praises of another, and it struck me...", "...all well and glad to see us. It was late in the afternoon when we got there, and we spent the remainder of the day and evening in recounting our summer's experience for Uncle Kit's benefit, who was a very interested listener to all that had befallen us since we parted from him in the spring. While we ate supper, Jim told Uncle Kit of the fight with the Indians in which I killed the old chief and took his scalp and war bonnet, an account which amused Uncle Kit very much, and later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he insisted on my undoing my pack and showing the bonnet to him. After he had examined it, he said, \"Will, I always knew that you would make an Indian fighter since that night when you were not fifteen years old and showed such bravery in showing me the two scalps of the Indians you had killed that morning all by yourself. But little did I think that you would have the honor of killing a Ute Chief and capturing his war bonnet. There will be many times when that bonnet...", "...Bonaparte grew uneasy and revealed all his policy. \"Tell Saint-Arnaud to execute my orders.\" Saint-Arnaud obeyed, the _coup d'etat_ acted according to its own code of laws, and from that appalling moment an immense torrent of blood began to flow across this crime.

To enter into further details of anatomy is beyond the scope of this discussion and readers interested are referred to the work of Manson and of Fulleborn. One of the most surprising features of the habits of these larvae is the periodicity which they exhibit in their occurrence in the peripheral blood. If a preparation be made during the day time there may be no evidence whatever of filarial infestation, whereas a preparation from the same patient taken late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> or during the night may be literally swarming with the parasites. Manson quotes Mackenzie as having brought out the further interesting fact that should a \"filarial subject be made to sleep during the day and remain awake at night, the periodicity is reversed; that is to say, the parasites come into the blood during the day and disappear from it during the night.\" There have been numerous attempts to explain this peculiar phenomenon of periodicity but in spite of...", "...well stocked with sacks of flour and grain. I was, however, much pleased with the fine circular building, with lofty dome, and the quantity of grain it contained.

But he employed these few hours well, sleeping as the weary sleep, hands clenched, without dreaming, waking, or moving; and the thought that occupied his mind <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was with him on waking in the morning, not having been put to flight by others, any more than by dreams. After Caffie's death this tranquil and refreshing sleep continued the same; but suddenly, after Madame Dammauville's death, it became broken. At first it did not bother him. He did not sleep, so much the better! He would work more. But one can no more work all the time than one can live without eating. Saniel knew better than any one that the life of every organ...", "...And, now that all had done him cheer, Tedaldo with his own hands rent his brothers' suits of black upon their backs, as also the sad-hued garments which his sisters and sisters-in-law wore, and bade bring other apparel. Which when they had donned, there was no lack of singing, dancing and other sorts of merry-making; whereby the banquet, for all its subdued beginning, had a sonorous close. Then, just as they were, in the blithest of spirits, they hied them all to Tedaldo's house, where <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they supped; and in this manner they held festival for several days. 'Twas some time before the Florentines ceased to look on Tedaldo as a portent, as if he were risen from the dead; and a shadow of doubt whether he were really Tedaldo or no continued to lurk in the minds of not a few, including even his brothers: they had no assured belief; and in that frame had perchance long continued, but for a casual occurrence that shewed them who the murdered man was.

But for the two days' coaching on the west coast, the necessary steaming among the islands, our utter collapse on the east coast, I am sure we never should have worked at all. Day after day we were dispirited, disheartened, and only happy when we were not walking. We went to bed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and got up in the morning wearied and exhausted. The usual walking tours of which one hears mean a day's climbing in the mountains, or a day's tramp with bag or knapsack sent before by train or stage. Under these conditions we probably would not be the first to give in. But to be as independent as if on a tricycle, to have one's sketching traps when needed, one must carry a knapsack one's self.

She felt anxious to understand something about the king whose personality...", "...when it reached her ears that Yudushka, weary of solitude, had taken in a damsel named Yevpraksia, from among the clergy, as his housekeeper. On the contrary, she made off right for Golovliovo and before alighting from the carriage called to Yudushka with childish impatience: \"Well, well, you old sinner, let's see your queen, let's see your queen.\" That entire day she spent most pleasurably, because Yevpraksia herself waited upon her at table and made her bed after dinner, and because <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she played fool with Yudushka and his queen. Yudushka himself was pleased with this denouement, and in token of filial gratitude ordered a pound of caviar, among other things, to be put into Arina Petrovna's carriage as she was about to depart. That was the highest token of esteem, for caviar is not a home product; one has to buy it. The courtesy so touched the old woman that she could refrain no longer and said: \"Well, I do thank you for this. And God, too, will love...", "...that he was hit by a shot of the second volley. It has been asserted that I fired the gun which killed General Polk, and that I knew it was directed against that general. The fact is, at that distance we could not even tell that the group were officers at all; I was on horseback, a couple of hundred yards off, before my orders to fire were executed, had no idea that our shot had taken effect, and continued my ride down along the line to Schofield's extreme flank, returning late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to my head-quarters at Big Shanty, where I occupied an abandoned house. In a cotton-field back of that house was our signal-station, on the roof of an old gin-house. The signal-officer reported that by studying the enemy's signals he had learned the key, and that he could read their signals. He explained to me that he had translated a signal about noon, from Pine Mountain to Marietta, \"Send an ambulance for General Polk's body;\" and later in the day another, \"Why...", "...\"Isaaco, I bear you no malice now; but did so once, because you conducted white men to Sego; and never passed here to let me have something from them, whilst every body else shared their generosity.\" I took my leave of him and went to Chicouray, Chiaman's village, where I met my family and things safe.

Some day, he thought, should the worst come to the worst, he could creep back to the quietness of that old college town on the Isis, where it seemed always evening, and everything seemed always <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of life. But could he ever go back? he suddenly asked himself. Could he creep back to the gray corridors and the quiet shadows and the little gardens? Could he, indeed, after knowing that taste of the wider and more challenging life, after touching to his lips the intoxicating cup of the outer world?

I was presented to several state officials, and shown through the handsomest state capitol grounds in the Union. Half the day was devoted to business duties; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I delivered a lecture; and several times I was asked to escort a party of ladies to the stable to see the donkey that enjoyed the unrivaled distinction of having made a 4,000 mile journey from the Hudson to the Sacramento.

There were many who advised me to go by way of Stockton, a longer journey by forty miles, cautioning me that my donkeys would...", "...that is, on the 28th, there would still have been plenty of time for him to have arrived in England and to have seen her, as he would have reached Southampton by the 3rd of August, or by the 4th at latest. And it was now the 9th! As Kitty tried to puzzle the matter out, her fears, vague, but none the less distressing, were greatly increased, and she began to suspect that something, she knew not what, had happened to her father. Gilbert, now as anxious as Kitty was, was at Surbiton <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to hear what news she had received from Vancouver, and he was as much bewildered as she by the cablegram from Wallace, Morris Thornton's agent. All he could do was to remind her, as he had done before, that the delay in her father's coming, as well as his silence, might all be part of his scheme to \"surprise\" her. But Kitty replied that this made her father out as unkind in the extreme; she was sure he would never willingly put such a strain upon her affection. \"I...", "...or by speech utter Him.\" But in Cosimo's day men had no fear, the day was at the dawn: who could have thought by sunset life would be so disastrous? [Illustration: CHIOSTRO DI S. MARCO] Cosimo de' Medici had a villa near the convent of S. Domenico at Fiesole, where, as it is said, he would often go when Careggi was too far, and the summer had turned the city into a furnace. Here, as we may think, he may well have talked with Fra Angelico, for he would often walk in the cloisters <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with the friars, and must have seen and praised the frescoes there. These Dominicans at Fiesole had already sent a colony to Florence, for in June 1435 they had obtained from Pope Eugenius iv, who was then at S. Maria Novella the little church of S. Giorgio across Arno. Seeing the order and comeliness of that convent at Fiesole, Cosimo, on behalf of the magistrates of Florence, presented a petition to the Pope about this time, praying that since he was engaged on a...", "...of the splendid struggle for life in which the struggle itself, the fact of work, was a thing ecstatic.

Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since he had been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recent past, had become so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette told him satisfied him completely. It did not even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thenardier, about the burn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father. Marius had momentarily forgotten all this; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he did not even know that there had been a morning, what he had done, where he had breakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hours when he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite natural that he should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers. Alas! Who is there who has...", "...emotion a propitious omen, he assumed the lover in good earnest. \"Give me time till the New Year.

In many places carved oak was pierced quite through, so that voices were audible from behind it. The musicians had gone down to supper, the young folk were quietly busy at the other end of the hall, and as the old gentleman admired the quaint carving, the sound of his own name caught his ear. The housekeeper and butler still remained, though the other servants had gone, and sitting cosily behind the screen chatted in...", "...boys I tried to photograph at a quiet game of \"craps\" (see picture on page 122) in the hallway of the Duane Street lodging-house--James Brady. Father and mother had both died two months after they came here from Ireland, and he went forth from the tenement alone and without a friend, but not without courage. He just walked on until he stumbled on the lodging-house, and fell into a job of selling papers. James, at the age of sixteen, was being initiated into the mysteries of the alphabet <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> school. He was not sure that he liked it. The German boy who took a hand in the game, and who made his grub and bed money, when he was lucky, by picking up junk, had just such a career. The third, the bootblack, gave his reasons briefly for running away from his Philadelphia home: \"Me muther wuz all the time hittin' me when I cum in the house, so I cum away.\" So did a German boy I met there, if for a slightly different reason. He was fresh from over the sea, and had not...", "...in the front ranks, while Miss Woodford was left far in the rear among the servants.

So came All Saints' Day Eve, when there was to be a special service late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at the Romanised Chapel Royal at St. James's, with a sermon by a distinguished Dominican, to which all the elder and graver members of the household were eager to go. And there was another very different attraction at the Cockpit, where good-natured Princess Anne had given permission for a supper, to be followed by burning of nuts and all the divinations proper to Hallowmas Eve, to which were invited all the subordinates of the Whitehall establishment who could be...", "...a room ready for you. Give me your card and I will write down my address on it.\" All this was said so cordially that I could not resist my friend's invitation, and promised to visit him. Three or four days later, Paris being empty and the recollection of my old companion haunting me, I felt a strong desire to take a peep at his conjugal felicity and to see with my own eyes this stream, this mill, this steeple, beside all which he was so happy. I reached Les Roches at about six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and was charmed at the very first glance. Oscar's residence was a little Louis Quinze chateau buried in the trees; irregularly built, but charmingly picturesque. It had been left unaltered for a century at least, and everything, from the blackened mansard roofs with their rococo weather-cocks, to the bay windows with their tiny squares of glass and the fantastic escutcheon over the door, was in keeping. Over the thick tiles of the somewhat sunken roof, the rough-barked...", "...position, and not having sufficient force to contend with them, they determined to fall back to Fishing Creek, and await further orders. A retreat was ordered, and our men retired in good order, and at daylight next morning were safely arrived at Fishing Creek. In the meantime, the balance of the Battery were on the way to their assistance, and on the night previous were camped only two miles from the creek, where we soon found them. We remained here through the day, and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> were ordered to have all the horses harnessed, and everything ready in case of an emergency; information having been received that the enemy were advancing. One section of the Battery, under Lieutenant Baldwin, was posted on the spur of a hill, commanding the crossing of the creek. A part of the Seventeenth Ohio were also stationed with them, and all were prepared for an attack. About ten o'clock, our pickets were driven in by the enemy's advance. They reported the...", "...us to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good Hope, or about 45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some general words I overheard among them, being I supposed to the south-east in their intended voyage to Madagascar. And although this were little better than conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward, hoping to reach the south-west coast of New Holland, and perhaps some such island as I desired lying westward of it. The wind was full west, and by six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I computed I had gone eastward at least eighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league off, which I soon reached. It was nothing but a rock, with one creek naturally arched by the force of tempests. Here I put in my canoe, and climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the east, extending from south to north. I lay all night in my canoe; and repeating my voyage early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the south-east...", "...away from him, and sat back in his chair. \"I suppose it is caddish to talk of her like this,\" he went on. \"One ought to bear one's wounds in silence and feel no resentment at all ... but somehow she draws out the caddish part of me.

As they walked up the steps into the entrance hall, Henry saw Lady Cecily standing in a small group of men and women who were talking and laughing very heartily. \"There she is!\" he whispered to Gilbert. \"Who is?\" \"Lady Cecily!\" \"Oh, so she is. Let's find our seats!\" \"Perhaps you could catch her eye, Gilbert....\" \"Catch my grandmother!\" said Gilbert. \"Come on!\" But if Gilbert were not willing to catch Lady Cecily's eye,...", "...resting, in all sorts of limp attitudes, with their legs dangling or crossed, their arms round their heads, their pigtails loose or twisted around their skulls.

The motley colours showed dingy <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> darkness, lit by innumerable little lamps. The Chinese shops, crammed with goods, displayed red and gold signboards and red and gold placards with inscriptions; in the background was the domestic altar with the sacred print; the white god seated, with the black god grimacing behind him.

We stopped for only a few hours; for on the wind lulling we again proceeded on our course.

Putting the matter more exactly, there is, according to Flammarion, a mean abatement of one degree for every 345 feet where the sky is clear, and of one degree for every 354 feet when the heavens are overcast; the decline being quicker when the day is hot than when it is cold, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> than in the morning. Mr. Glaisher, however, feels himself compelled to repudiate this theory of a steady, constant diminution of heat. The results of all his midday experiments amounted to this:-- 'The change from the ground to 1,000 feet high was 4 deg. 5' with a cloudy sky, and 6 deg. 2' with a clear sky.

His efforts to convince the colonel that he was merely a country lad, who had...", "...get at them now, as his warder might at any moment look round. The latter was relieved twice during the course of the day. None of the men paid any attention to the prisoner. The succession of victims who entered the walls of the prison only to quit them for the gallows was so rapid that they had no time to concern themselves with their affairs. Probably the boy was a heretic; but whether or not, if he had incurred the enmity of Councillor Von Aert, his doom was sealed. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before a warder appeared at the door, and said that the councillor was below, and that the prisoner was to be brought before him. Ned was led by the two men to a chamber on the ground floor. Here Von Aert, with two of his colleagues, was seated at a table, the former's clerk standing behind him. \"This is a prisoner I myself made this morning,\" Von Aert said to his companions. \"I overtook him two miles this side of Axel, and questioned him. He admitted that he came from...", "...horribly stuffy; for the nights are very hot. But I am quite at home now, and enjoy the society, mixed though it is.

The patients dwell \"in marble halls,\" spacious, lofty rooms. Had a pleasant chat with Dr. Stokes. (The I.H. were shipmates of ours on the _Montfort_.) Also, to my great delight, found two men of our Battery there; it was a great treat to see familiar faces again. They said the Battery or part of it was at Waterval.

If the lively Russian councillor in the passages I am going to translate describes correctly what he heard and saw, he must have witnessed an exceptional occurrence; it is, however, more likely that the bad reception he received from the lady prejudiced him against her. Lenz relates that one day Chopin took him to the salon of Madame Marliani, where there was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> always a gathering of friends. George Sand [thus runs his account of his first meeting with the great novelist] did not say a word when Chopin introduced me. This was rude. Just for that reason I seated myself beside her. Chopin fluttered about like a little frightened bird in its cage, he saw something was going to happen. What had he not always feared on this terrain?

The wind was cutting, and Rodney's clothes were worn thin. The weather was almost too cold for snow, but by night it fell in fine, stinging particles. Out on the road young Allison tramped to and fro to keep warm, occasionally stopping to thresh his arms. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he saw someone go to the stable, and soon after a double team was driven out. The door of the house opened and a woman came out and entered the carriage. There were good-byes spoken in loud tones with no apparent attempt at concealment. Rodney was no coward, but in his heart he was glad that, instead of two men, he had only one and a woman to deal with. The woman might scream but probably wouldn't shoot. The driver cracked his whip and the team came down the road at a...", "...in the Rue St.-Honore, _entre cour et jardin_, a few doors from the English embassy. The said garden is the most tempting part of the affair; for, though the _salons_ and sleeping-rooms are good, the only entrance, except by a _passage derobe_ for servants, is through the _salle a manger_, which is a great objection. Many of the houses I have seen here have this defect, which the Parisians do not seem to consider one, although the odour of dinner must enter the _salons_, and that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> visitors must find servants occupied in removing the dinner apparatus, should they, as generally happens, come for the _prima sera_. French people, however, remain so short a time at table, and dine so much earlier than the English people do, that the employment of their _salle a manger_ as a passage does not annoy them.

He introduced me to a Jesuit he had in his household, who was called Adam, and he added, after telling me his name, \"not the first Adam.\" I was told afterwards that Voltaire used to play backgammon with him, and when he lost he would throw the dice and the box at his head. If Jesuits were treated like that all the world over, perhaps we should have none but inoffensive Jesuits at last, but that happy time is still far off. I had scarcely got to my inn <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when I received my three golden balls, and as soon as the syndic came we set off to renew our voluptuous orgy.

A crown of woven cocoa-nut leaves is also worn as a shade for the eyes. The women appear to be in greater want of some becoming costume even than the men. Nearly all the natives understand a little English--that is, they know the names of common things; and by the aid of this, together with signs, a lame sort of conversation could be carried on. In returning <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the boat, we stopped to witness a very pretty scene. Numbers of children were playing on the beach, and had lighted bonfires which illumined the placid sea and surrounding trees; others, in circles, were singing Tahitian verses. We seated ourselves on the sand, and joined their party. The songs were impromptu, and I believe related to our arrival: one little girl sang a line, which the rest took up in parts, forming a very pretty chorus. The whole scene made us...", "...Dusk, with the 4 Elk, of which we had a Sumptious Supper of Elk Tongues & marrow bones which was truly gratifying.

On the 27th of December we left Milledgeville at nine o'clock in the morning. It was a pretty cold day, and there was ice half an inch thick. We rode only thirty miles to Macon. In spite of the large sum of money which our carriage had cost us, it broke twice; the repairs consumed much time, and we left it several miles behind. The day was very clear, and towards midday moderately warm, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> there was again a strong frost. I was pleased with the dark blue of the sky, such as we hardly have in Germany in a midsummer's day. We met with several families, emigrating with their property to Macon and the State of Alabama. One of these families, who had paid their wagoners beforehand, had been left by them under frivolous pretext in the middle of the woods, two miles from Milledgeville: we found these unfortunate persons, who had made a bivouac, after they had...", "...Spring and sweet Easter coming on, and Love, perhaps, always helpful of illusions, might convey a certain greenness and sentiment of nature--and echoing her soft responses to the afternoon prayers--perhaps the Curate might have felt that such devotion was not entirely pure and simple.

Whether he had himself cast loose the lashings, or whether anybody else had liberated him, we could not discover, for although there were the marks of several feet on the ground, they might have been ours. As there was little probability that the Indian would have remained in the neighbourhood, we soon abandoned the search and rejoined the party. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when we approached the farm, and recollecting the threatened attack by the Indians, I felt more anxiety than I can express, lest during our absence, they should have carried out their project.

Wherever....\" And she was not slow to see how he was pleased at her surprise, and proud of it, for she said more in the same strain--oh, she had never seen the like, and how had he ever managed to find such things! Inger was a blessing, too, in other ways. No clever head nor great...", "...right. We'll soon put you straight.\" \"Straight?\" he echoed. \"Yes, I dare say you will!\" CHAPTER XXXII OPERATION The news came as a distinct shock to him. He had not even entertained the possibility of undergoing an operation. Years ago he had had his adenoids removed, and the memory was by no means pleasant. All along he had told himself he would recover in time--that was all he wanted. To have an operation was, he thought, to run another and unnecessary risk. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the Sister came in with a large phial, and injected the contents into his arm. \"Morphine,\" she explained. In a moment or so he felt that he did not care what happened. The morphine made him gloriously drunk. \"Sister,\" he confided. \"I'm drunk. It isn't fair to go and kill a fellow when he's drunk, you know. It isn't playing the game. You ought to suspend hostilities till I'm sober!\" He felt ridiculously proud of himself for these inanities. \"I know you,\" he...", "...lend. She had no toys or dolls except of home manufacture, but her rag baby and set of broken dishes afforded just as much happiness as children nowadays get from a roomful of imported playthings. To go to school the children had to pass Grandmother Read's, and they were always careful to start early enough to stop there for a fresh cheese curd and a drink of \"coffee,\" made by browning crusts of rye and Indian bread, pouring hot water over them and sweetening with maple sugar. Then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they would stop again for some of the left-over, cold boiled dinner, which was served on a great pewter platter, a big piece of pork or beef in the center and, piled all round, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, beets, carrots, etc. The story runs that, when the mother remonstrated with the children for bothering the grandmother for what they could have at home, Susan replied, \"Why, grandma's potato peelings are better than your boiled dinners.\" The Anthonys and Reads used...", "...She knew what it was for.

Louis Napoleon had declared war against Prussia. The news came into our little corner of the Orsini like a clap of thunder--but the exiles around that table went right on drinking beer.

However, Pencroft had thought of doing so, but Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him nearly five thousand five hundred years to finish his task, the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea. The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and procured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were, however, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration, swept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed and the thunder continued to roll for some hours. At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous. The tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus, but it became...", "...this Wyck, whom you called a soft line?\" \"The first time I saw him was the second cos I only had a back view first. It was one morning just as I drove to the stand, about ten o'clock. I was in my cab, and Dick Burton was just foreninst of me. I twigged a fellow coming along who looked like a swell looking out for a cab, so I drove up to him before Dick could, but by jabers if he did not pass me right by and beckon to Dick. That was Wyck. I was a bit cross all day, and when I saw Dick <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I asked him who he was. 'He's my property,' says he. 'He's a good un, and allus pays in gold.' Dick drove him about for several days, and last night he comes to me in great excitement. 'Terence,' says he, 'we'll go on the booze.' 'All right,' says I; and we had a regular good booze, we had.

What makes you so venturesome and hardy?\" The idiosyncratic appeal Tabitha Aykroyd made to Charlotte is related identically wherever she is portrayed. That Charlotte Bronte had been initially entranced by her fairy tales, and the old songs she sang, is shown more especially in the phases she gives of Tabitha as Bessie and as Ellen Dean. Thus we read in _Jane Eyre_, Chap. IV., in the close of the scene just given:-- \"That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; ... <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and sang me some of her sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.\" And in _Wuthering Heights_, Chap. XXII., Ellen Dean says of Miss Catherine Linton (see my reference to this character as a phase of Charlotte Bronte, in my preface):--\"From dinner to tea she would lie doing nothing except singing old songs--my nursery lore--to herself, ... half thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.\"...", "...the world. One whisper startled her more than any ether. It concerned Lord Averil's bonds. What was amiss with them? That there was something, and something bad, appeared only too evident. In her terrible state of suspense, of uncertainty, she determined to inquire of Thomas Godolphin. Writing a few words on a slip of paper, she sent it into the Bank parlour. It was a request that he would see her before he left. Thomas sent back a verbal message: \"Very well.\" It was growing late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before he came to her.

Tembarom, returning from his bath much refreshed after a warm plunge and a cold shower, evidently felt that as a costume it was all that could be desired. \"Will you wear--these, sir,--this evening?\" Pearson suggested. It was suggestive of more than actual inquiry. If he had dared to hope that his manner might suggest a number of things! For instance, that in England gentlemen really didn't wear tweed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> even in private. That through some unforeseen circumstances his employer's evening-dress suit had been delayed, but would of course arrive to-morrow! But Tembarom, physically stimulated by hot and cold water, and relief at being left alone, was beginning to recover his natural buoyancy. \"Yes, I'll wear 'em,\" he answered, snatching at his hairbrush and beginning to brush his damp hair. It was a wooden-backed brush that Pearson had found in his Gladstone bag and...", "...to grandfather as I am or else perhaps he would not know me; you hardly did at first.\" Brigitta went with her to the door, and there said in rather a mysterious voice, \"You might have kept on your dress, he would have known you all right; but you must be careful, for Peter tells me that Alm-Uncle is always now in a bad temper and never speaks.\" Heidi bid her good-night and continued her way up the mountain, her basket on her arm. All around her the steep green slopes shone bright <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> sun, and soon the great gleaming snow- field up above came in sight. Heidi was obliged to keep on pausing to look behind her, for the higher peaks were behind her as she climbed. Suddenly a warm red glow fell on the grass at her feet; she looked back again--she had not remembered how splendid it was, nor seen anything to compare to it in her dreams-- for there the two high mountain peeks rose into the air like two great flames, the whole snow-field had turned crimson,...", "...moment separating Ahmed farther from the faith of his father and drawing him closer to the faith taught by a stranger.

It was not late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when in the midst of their conversation, Ahmed turned abruptly to his missionary host and said, \"I believe. I want to be a Christian. What must I do?\" The missionary explained to him that the next step after belief was testimony, a testimony usually given by baptism, but that Ahmed could not think of being baptized until he had prayed long and earnestly over the matter. Indeed, it might mean death to him, for he himself must surely know the bitterness of the Prophet's...", "...were all removed before the complete destruction of the house by fire. The long, deep trenches, full of Federal and Confederate dead, told the awful story of Chancellorsville. This scene will never be forgotten by the survivors of the battle. This was one of the greatest battles yet fought on the American Continent, and has gone down in history as being one of the greatest of modern times. The Union loss was about 17,000, while that of the Confederates was about 13,000. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the first day's battle General \"Stonewall\" Jackson was mortally wounded, in which the South suffered incalculable loss. After his brilliant flank march and the evening attack on Hooker's army had been driven home, at half-past eight, Jackson had ridden beyond his lines to reconnoiter for the final advance. By the sudden fire of musketry in his front, he discovered that he was within the enemy's lines. His party, suddenly turning back and riding at full speed, was...", "...count. \"Why, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.\" \"And she's in love with Boris already.

I had not said even a word in allusion to what I was doing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> hours, and the three volumes of my large manuscript were received by him in a way that warranted the worst fears.

She thought that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she would go across the bridge, and consult with the two good old brothers Foster. But something occurred to put off the fulfilment of this plan. That same morning Sylvia had preceded her, with no one to consult, because consultation would have required previous confidence, and confidence would have necessitated such a confession about Kinraid as it was most difficult for Sylvia to make.

Jane was for some minutes so lost in gazing at the wonderful illumination, that she had not remarked the professor standing close by her side, and now, she was almost frightened at the sound of his voice. \"Can our Rhine also win a moment's admiration from you?\" he asked in a tone of peculiar satisfaction. \"From me?\" The thought suddenly occurred to Jane that he might have divined something of the weakness...", "...him; and the Kickapoos, whose lodges were pitched on the meadow, sent him a message to the effect that, if the Miamis did not put him to death, they themselves would do so, whenever he should pass their camp. He was still on the threshold of his journey, and his final point of destination was several hundred miles distant; yet, with great resolution, he determined to persevere, and, if possible, fulfil his mission. His Indian and Canadian attendants used every means to dissuade him, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> held a council with the Miami chiefs, the result of which was most discouraging. Morris received message after message, threatening his life, should he persist in his design; and word was brought him that several of the Shawanoe deputies were returning to the fort, expressly to kill him. Under these circumstances, it would have been madness to persevere; and, abandoning his mission, he set out for Detroit.

They have two meetings every Sunday, morning and evening, and one every Thursday--at half-past ten in the morning during winter months, and at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in summer. The average attendance at each of the Sunday meetings is about 70. The character of the services is quite unsettled. Throughout Christendom the rule in religious edifices is to have a preliminary service, and then a discourse; in Quaker meeting houses there is no such defined course of action. Sometimes there is a prayer, then another, then an \"exhortation\"--Quakers have no sermons; at other times an exhortation without any prayer; now and then a prayer...", "...we came, to see if I cannot find it.\" So he started. She remained in her ball dress without strength to go to bed, sitting on a chair, with no fire, her mind a blank. Her husband returned about seven o'clock. He had found nothing. He went to police headquarters, to the newspapers to offer a reward, to the cab companies, everywhere, in short, where a trace of hope led him. She watched all day, in the same state of blank despair before this frightful disaster. Loisel returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with cheeks hollow and pale; he had found nothing. \"You must write to your friend,\" said he, \"that you have broken the clasp of her necklace and that you are having it repaired.

A pleasure steamer, one of the largest and best known of the London Steam-packet Company, with some 700 happy merrymakers, a large proportion of whom were children, left London Bridge on Tuesday morning, September 3rd, 1878, for Gravesend and Sheerness, and everything, even the temper of our uncertain climate, combined to make the day one of real and innocent pleasure. How true is it that danger is never so near as when we deem it farthest off. It was eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the _Princess Alice_ hove in sight off Woolwich Arsenal, with her living freight of gladsome excursionists. The song that comes when toil ceases, the careless laugh and harmless jest were going round; eager eyes watched the dim lights of home glinting through the purple September twilight, and no whispered thought of peril dulled the harmony of the day, when a large steam collier, the _Bywell Castle_, loomed darkly in the gloom. Those who feared the least and knew...", "...from the river banks, and this delightful garden laid out. Shortly after the Crimean war Marshal Canrobert planted an oak among the ilexes and cedars and cypresses that mix their dark foliage with the living green of the deciduous trees, and dedicated the garden to the use of the citizens of Avignon. It is a charming spot at all times. I found myself continually wandering up there, in the intervals of more serious sight-seeing, or in the early morning before sight-seeing began, or <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when it was over. Sight-seeing is really the bane of all beautiful places; one wants to see everything and is glad one has done so afterwards, but the way to enjoy a place is to live one's own life in it, for however short a time, and take the sights as they come. Unfortunately they do not come quickly enough when one has only a day or two to spare for a place that is full of them, and the only way is to make a business of sight-seeing, with whatever intervals of peace...", "...Marseilles rouses the enthusiasm of the artist, and some days are spent in exploring the city.

We were, of course, ready at that time, but not only were we not called at one, but we waited in suspense until six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before we were called, and before we left the city it was seven o'clock; thus consuming a half-day of daylight which we had promised ourselves to see the scenery, and bringing all our travelling in the night, which we wished specially to avoid. Besides this, we found ourselves in a little, miserable, jolting vehicle that did not, like the diligence, suffer us to sleep. \"Thus we left Marseilles, pursuing our way through what seemed to us a wild country, with many a dark...", "...continued Roy, with an air of immense authority, \"I shall take you out and buy you an engagement ring.

Within the point was a fair bay, with a good harbour, having anchorage in four fathoms, within a cable's length of the shore. Coming...", "...it cannot be; my heart is too hard. I am too impure, too depraved, too guilty.\" This novel train of thought was broken off by the entrance of his mother into the parlour, who was surprised and delighted by seeing him with the hymn-book, which he still held in his hand.

The cooper appeared abstracted, and did not take as much interest as usual <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> paper. Jack was restless, and found it difficult to fix his attention upon anything. Even Aunt Rachel looked more dismal than usual, if such a thing be possible. In the morning all felt brighter. \"Ida will be home to-night,\" said Mrs. Crump, cheerfully. \"What an age it seems since she left us!\" \"We shall know better how to appreciate her presence,\" said the cooper, cheerfully. \"What time do you expect her home?

It was now too late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> for us to attack; we therefore fell back on Timahoe, determined to be at them in the morning. At Timahoe an express met us from Sir Charles, desiring we should return to Maryborough; this was answered by an express from us, proposing to Sir Charles to attack the Rebels next morning on the road from Donane, and that we would attack on the road from Timahoe. The answer to this proposal we received at 7 o'clock next morning from Sir Charles, who could not agree to it, as he...", "...of stopping the destruction of property and driving the rioters from the ground--from the railroad ground? Was that the subject of conversation? A. I think not. I don't remember that. There was no conversation amongst us. We had no idea of ordering the troops alone--that detachment of troops. The general plan was to bring on the Philadelphia troops, at Torrens station, unite them with Guthrie, and march them down on the rear of the mob, and attack and disperse them. Q. How early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> did the General adopt that as a plan of action? A. I couldn't say, as I said before. I couldn't, at this time, say. Q. Can you tell us anything in relation to the dispatch that was sent by General Latta and General Brinton, Sunday morning, by Captain Aull, what knowledge you have of that dispatch, and what was done? A. I don't think that I have any personal knowledge of that dispatch--don't think I saw it--and what I would give you would be hearsay about that. I...", "...eyes were those of Charlotte Pain's!

Perhaps his conscience told him that he _had_ implied more, in a certain pressure he remembered giving to that fair hand, which was resting now, gauntleted, upon her reins. Gay George had meant to dissipate Ashlydyat's ennui, if nothing more tempting offered. But something more tempting did offer: and he had...", "...Nonconformist divine, and a voluminous theological writer, born 1616, made Dean of Christ Church in 1653 by the Parliament, and ejected in 1659-60.

Jews and Gentiles who had struck out in their blind fury, who had felt the terror of the law and the greater terror of taking, or trying to take, human life. Some guilty, some innocent; all of them caught in the same net. Characteristic is the story of a Warsaw merchant who sailed with me on my last journey. On the evening of the 21st of April, 1906, he went to a dentist to have some work done. He went <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> because he was busy in the daytime, and when he arrived the police were searching the house; after which all the inmates, dentist and patients, were taken to the police station and cast into prison. Two hundred and fifty persons were together in a room large enough for twenty. The odours were frightful, as in common with all Russian prisons there were no toilet conveniences outside of that room, in which for three days they were left. After bribing the officials, twenty...", "...the prisoner was silent. From that time he became more sullen than ever, only at times he was observed, when alone, to fling himself on the ground and cry like a child. It was generally thought that his brain was affected.

After working there for some time, and being released from his irons, he concealed himself on the slip, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> swam across the harbour. He was pursued, retaken, and flogged. Then he ran the dismal round of punishment. He burnt lime, dragged timber, and tugged at the oar. The heaviest and most degrading tasks were always his.

The soft ripple of the wavelets on the shore sounded like faintest music in the intense stillness, and the crooning of some belated sea-bird came like a cry across the waters.

In this manner the poor men were hurried to their doom. Several of them, in passing, had the privilege of shaking hands with our comrades in the other room. Robinson, though too sick to walk, was dragged away with them. Thus we parted. The rough wagon, with a wood-rack for a bed, drove off with our comrades, surrounded by cavalry. In about an hour it came back, _empty_. The deed of shame was done. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the provost-marshal came to our door, and, in response to eager questions, informed us that our friends \"had met their fate as brave men should die everywhere.\" The next day we obtained from the guards, who, in the absence of their officers, were always willing to talk with us, full particulars of the sevenfold murder.

For Robert's sake she tried for a time to put aside her first impression and to bear Madame de Netteville's evenings--little dreaming, poor thing, all the time that Madame de Netteville thought her presence at the famous 'Fridays' an incubus only to be put up with because the husband was becoming socially an indispensable.

At this Allen became impatient and left the meeting; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he told The brethren that the Quaker inspiration was as real as their own, but that they did not write down what was spoken by their preachers; whereto he received for reply that it was not necessary, for it was evident that the Quakers had not the real inspiration, nor the proper and consecrated \"instruments\" to declare the will of the Lord; and so the Quaker went away on his journey home, apparently not much edified.

One after another the rest swept off, their rafts dancing light as corks on the emerald water, each with its flaming torch fast fixed, and its two struggling Mulgars tugging at their long water-poles. And as each raft drifted beneath the lowering arch of the cavern, the Mulgars aboard her raised aloft their poles for farewell to...", "...well repaid, for the air was a tonic too good to be missed. The ship was well disciplined, the table inviting, the service entirely Chinese--whose sense of decorum was most marked. On Sunday evening, the thirteenth day out, we expected to anchor at Yokohama, but a fearful wind arose; the captain left his seat at the dinner table in haste and ordered the ship's course changed. We were skirting a terrific typhoon. We were in sight of land, but instead of reaching it at seven-thirty <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we did not accomplish it until 10 o'clock Monday morning. The steamer \"Belgic\" was stranded that night forty-three miles from Yokohama. The captain, who had for forty years made successful trips, was destined to see his vessel wrecked; no lives were lost but the rebuke he received cost him the loss of his position--and much greater the loss of reason. He was taken to a madhouse.

So we moved our camp to our original position by the side of the cavalry for safety. In the evening a guerrilla, while trying to crawl through the lines, was caught by the pickets. The next day three men were arrested, one of which proved to be a guerrilla, and was sent to General Getty for sentence. His name was Finley. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> three more companies of the 5th Pennsylvania cavalry came to reinforce us. On September 14th a spy came into camp and informed us that the commander of the guerrilla band was in town, and that he was to leave that night with four recruits.

These offers he was to refuse, and to say that he had come a great distance to be the wife of the Red Head, and that if the chief could not seek her for himself, she would return to her village. She said, that as soon as the Red Head heard of this he would come for her in his own canoe, in which she must embark. \"On reaching the shore,\" added the little old woman, \"you must consent to be his wife; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> you are to induce him to take a walk out of the village, and when you have reached a lonesome spot, use the first opportunity to cut off his head with the blade of grass.\" She also gave Strong Desire general advice how he was to conduct himself to sustain his assumed character of a woman.

Ruth then departed, promising to return <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with her mother. Soon after it became dark, Dame Ipgreve and her daughter reappeared, the former carrying a lamp, and the latter a basket of provisions. Ruth's countenance was so troubled, that Viviana was certain that some fresh calamity was at hand. \"What is the matter?\" she hastily demanded. \"Make your meal first, dear young lady,\" replied Dame Ipgreve. \"Our news might take away your appetite, and you will have to pay for your supper, whether you eat it or...", "...the king were an immense number of ladies, so closely packed that it was impossible to count them.

Count Tisza, with his wife and the Countess Almassy, advanced to meet the intruders, asking what they wanted. \"What have you in your hand?\" a soldier demanded of Tisza.

The faint saffron that lingered below the crests and peaks of rosy cloud showed between the stems of the silver birches like the friendly smile of a happy day.

She has learned to do the minuet with me nicely, but she likes her own dances better.\" Vivi followed Dian to the door when he went out, and as he opened it Minuit came in, rubbing herself against him as she passed him. Dian walked toward the city. The sky was bright with stars. He thought of the stars as they shone on the meadows of Les Vignes. When he came to the corner leading into the rue Saint Honore, he stood still. There was the way of the Champs Elysees, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> always the more quiet of the avenues. The tumbrils, which passed there all day, stopped at sundown when the guillotine finished its day's work, and the crowds gathered along the rue Royale or about the Place de la Bastille, or down the length of the rue Saint Honore. Dian hesitated. He felt so tired of crowds, even of the thought of them, and, like Rosanne, he wanted Pigeon Valley. Still he hesitated. Years before, one wild, cold night, he had been a good distance from...", "...to the west; and soon after, the gale increasing, we were reduced to two courses, and close-reefed main top-sails. Not long after, the Resolution sprung a leak, under the starboard buttock, which filled the spirit-room with water before it was discovered; and it was so considerable as to keep one pump constantly employed. We durst not put the ship upon the other tack for fear of getting upon the shoals that lie to the N.W. of Cape Newenham; but continued standing to the west till six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the 26th, when we wore and stood to the eastward, and then the leak no longer troubled us. This proved that it was above the water line, which was no small satisfaction. The gale was now over, but the wind remained at S. and S.W. for some days longer. At length, on the 2d of October, at day-break, we saw the island of Oonalashka, bearing S.E.

When they heard of the letter a lot of the workmen adopted the suggestion and walked in the road so as to avoid contaminating the idlers. This letter was followed by others of a somewhat similar kind, and one or two written in a patronizing strain in defence of the working classes by persons who evidently knew nothing about them. There was also a letter from an individual who signed...", "...His knowledge of life was limited, having resided in that inkstand, and performed all the writing of the family, ever since he was a quill. But his experience was wise and virtuous; and he could bear witness to many an industrious effort at improvement, in which he had been the willing instrument; and to many a hard struggle for honesty and independence, which figures of his writing had recorded. I liked to watch the good Pen at his work when the father of the family spent an hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in teaching Susan and her brothers to write; or when the careful mother took him in hand to help her in balancing her accounts, and ascertaining that she owed no one a penny, before she ventured upon any new purchase. Then my worthy friend was in his glory; and it was delightful to see how he enjoyed his work. He had but one fault, which was a slight tendency to splutter; and as he was obliged to keep that under restraint while engaged in writing, he made himself amends...", "...the matter; since the girl was nothing to me, and a Papist.

I took the bowl silently, as she gave it. I gave it back with only one 'Thank you,' which sounded hoarse and rustic in my ears; but I suppose my eyes were more eloquent, for she blushed and trembled. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she did not come. Instead one of the children brought my supper, and sitting down on the straw beside me, twittered of Marie and 'Go' and other things. 'Who is Go?' I said. 'Go is Marie's brother,' the child answered, open-eyed at my ignorance. 'You not know Go?' 'It is a strange name,' I said, striving to excuse myself.

But Considine and Charlie were in great form, directing, arguing, and planning the expedition. One of the black boys rode out, and returned driving a big mob of horses that dashed into the yard at full gallop.

DEPARTURE FROM FLORENCE. December 3d. At seven in the evening I quitted Florence, and proceeded in the mail-carriage to Bologna, distant about eighty miles. When the day broke, we found ourselves on an acclivity commanding a really splendid view. Numerous valleys, extending between low hills, opened before our eyes, the snow-clad Apennines formed the background, and in the far distance shone a gleaming stripe--the Adriatic sea. At five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of December 4th we reached Bologna. This town is of considerable extent, numbers 50,000 inhabitants, and has many fine houses and streets; all of these, however, are dull, with the exception of a few principal streets.

I proceeded at once to visit the cathedral, which is rich in frescoes, gilding, and arabesques. A...", "...endure it. I carried her out to her bed in the wagon and drove two miles, when I alighted at a house and carried my wife and her bed into it, with a determination to tarry there until she either recovered her health or passed away. This was on Sunday morning, December 2nd. After getting my wife and things into the house and wood provided to keep up a fire, I employed my time in taking care of her. It looked as though she had but a short time to live. She called me to her bedside <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and said she felt as though a few moments more would end her existence in this life. She manifested great confidence in the cause she had embraced, and exhorted me to have confidence in God and to keep His commandments. To all appearances, she was dying. I laid hands upon her and prayed for her, and she soon revived and slept some during the night. December 3rd found my wife very low.

At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I passed through the cigar shop and into the court and knocked at the second door. \"Come in!\" I entered. It was a small room, carpetless, dusty, with a naked deal table, and two cheap wooden chairs for furniture. A giant Irishman was standing there, with shirt collar and vest unbuttoned, and no coat on.

At the spring ploughing in Prussia, when the ploughmen and sowers returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> from their work in the fields, the farmer's wife and the servants used to splash water over them. The ploughmen and sowers retorted by seizing every one, throwing them into the pond, and ducking them under the water.

He hesitated between the two religions, knowing not which to take.

At the same time, I repeated that I was prepared to renew the attempt at any time.

The Governor told him, that he must not go, but must keep him prisoner. The Doctor desired to know for what reason ? how he had transgrest ? well it was his will to have it so. The pacquet-boat hoisted sail <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> (which was very clear), and the Doctor's companions in it. There ensued a terrible storm, and the pacquet-boat and all the passengers were drowned: the next day the sad news was brought to Dover. The Doctor was unknown to the Governor, both by name and face; but the night before, the Governor had the perfect vision in a dream, of Doctor Hamey, who carne to pass over to Calais; and that he had a warning to stop him. This the Governor told the Doctor the next day.

Even my saddle was wrapped up in a piece of canvas, and deposited in a deep bed of shale.

And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring. \"It is your garden now, little children,\" said the Giant, and he took a great ax and knocked down the wall. And when the people were going to market at 12 o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen. All day long they played, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they came to the Giant to bid him good-by. \"But where is your little companion?\" he said, \"the boy I put into the tree.\" The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him. \"We don't know,\" answered the children; \"he has gone away.\" \"You must tell him to be sure and come here to-morrow,\" said the Giant. But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.

She visited Baltimore--which she called \"Baltimer\"--in the fall and again in the spring, after having made detailed, dignified, and long-announced plans, and there, with the aid of a commissionnaire, made her purchases for six months.

On the same day he ate his dinner with a good appetite; but about six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he was struck with hemiplegia, which deprived him completely of the use of his left side. He lay insensible of what passed about him, muttered constantly to himself, and appeared to be keeping up a kind of conversation. The pulse was feeble, but not oppressed or intermitting. He never had any stertor. He continued in this state until the 12th, when he died. He was opened twelve hours after death.

This demand being rejected by the enemy, Bailey later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> sent Henry Kelsey with a proposition to retain a portion of their armament; this also was refused. There was now nothing for it but to surrender, Iberville having granted an evacuation with bag and baggage.

This place is much resorted to by the Moors, who bring salt from Beeroo, and beads and coral from the Mediterranean, to exchange here for gold-dust and cotton-cloth. This cloth they sell to great advantage in Beeroo, and other Moorish countries, where, on account of the want of rain, no cotton is cultivated.

As this would go on unchangingly at the equator every day throughout the year, it should be clear that, at any particular place upon the earth, the sun would in these conditions always be seen to move in an unvarying manner across the sky at a certain altitude depending upon the latitude of the place. Thus the more north one went upon the earth's surface, the more southerly in the sky would the sun's path lie; while at the north pole itself, the sun...", "...departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.

The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

That night the regular watch was kept, and the sea was steadily swept in search of danger in the shape of canoes stealthily approaching to try and take the yacht by surprise. But no danger came near, and at last, after lying awake for some time, thinking of the account his father had given him of the attack made by the enemy, and the terrible anxiety about the little shooting party, Jack fell...", "...Their consultation resulted in a determination, to carry the war into the enemy's country; and as the Shawanees had been most efficient in waging hostilities, it was resolved to commence operations, against their most considerable town.

Hercules could not have accomplished a quarter of her labours in the same space of time.\" Human happiness was not to this gay Gordon a \"painless languor\"; and if she failed to have nervous prostration--under another name--she was cheated of her dues.

At nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> on the 10th,[79] we saw the island of Bonavista bearing south, distant little more than a league; though, at this time, we thought ourselves much farther off: But this proved a mistake. For, after hauling to the eastward till twelve o'clock, to clear the sunken rocks that lie about a league from the S.E. point of the island, we found ourselves, at that time, close upon them, and did but just weather the breakers.

The cheers of the congregated tens of thousands were almost insupportable; I never heard such before.

When he first emerged, he had some difficulty in descrying his goal across that confused sea. His eye was guided by a patch of foam, larger than the ordinary run of white-caps, and glittering <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> sun like a black-thorn blossom. As the sky brightened behind it, he saw, rising upright, like the single slim pistil of those rough white petals, the faint shaft of the light-house itself.

Dr. Maclaren of Manchester gave expression to these thoughts in his speech <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the day of Union, when, after paying a worthy tribute to the great leader to whose skill and patience the goodly consummation was so largely due, he went on to say: \"But all during the proceedings of this day there has been one figure and one name in my memory, and I have been saying to myself, What would John Cairns, with his big heart and his sweet and simple nature, have said if God had given him to see this day!

In the morning, Mr. N. and myself were up before the dawn, strolling through the umbrageous forest, inhaling the fresh, bracing air, and making the echoes ring with the report of our gun, as the lovely tenants of the grove flew by dozens before us. I think I never before saw so great a variety of birds within the same space. All were beautiful, and...", "...and the wet does the herdsman harm no more. And is it night, so sit we only in a cooler shadow, from which we plainly discern the daylight on the northern horizon and on the sweet warm stars of heaven. Wheresoever I look, there do I find my beloved blue on the flax in blossoms, on the corn-flowers, and the godlike endless heaven into which I would fain spring as into a stream. And now, if we turn homeward again, we find indeed but fresh delight. The street is a true nursery, for <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> after supper, the little ones, though they have but a few clothes upon them, are again let out into the open air, and not driven under the bed-quilt as in winter. We sup by daylight, and hardly know where the candlesticks are. In the bed-chamber the windows are open day and night, and likewise most of the doors, without danger. The oldest women stand by the window without a chill, and sew. Flowers lie about everywhere--by the ink-stand--on the lawyer's papers--on the...", "...a part of Mr. Bradford's supplies, and all of Uncle Will's except certain tools, on the western shore, within six miles of Kah Sha gorge, for they would eventually return to look after the Alder Creek claims, and it was, besides, advisable to lighten the loads and hasten forward before the snow and ice were gone. Uncle Will accordingly took Lucky and Long Peter and set out across the bay of the lake with three sled-loads, leaving his brother and the boys to rest after their labors. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he returned and reported that he had built a strong platform of saplings high up between three trees and enclosed on all sides. There he had left the goods covered with oiled canvas, and felt confident that they would be safe alike from dogs, wild beasts, and stormy weather. It was now thought best to dismiss Long Peter, since the remaining thirty-five miles consisted of level lake and river, and furthermore it was necessary to husband the provisions. The Indian seemed...", "...Why, I can do as much myself!' 'I am sure you can't,' said they, much too surprised to be polite. Then the maid sprang off the stake and left the room, and instantly the new wife took her place. But the sharp stake ran through, and she was dead in a moment. So they sent to the prince and said, 'Come quickly, and bury your wife.' 'Bury her yourselves,' he answered. 'What did she do it for? It was not by my orders that she impaled herself on the stake.' So they buried her; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the prince came to the daughter of Buk Ettemsuch, and said to her, 'Speak to me, or I shall have to take another wife.' But she was afraid to speak to him. The following day the prince hid himself in the room and watched. And soon the maiden woke, and said to the pitcher and to the water-jug, 'Quick! go down to the spring and bring me some water; I am thirsty.' And they went. But as they were filling themselves at the spring, the water-jug knocked against the pitcher...", "...Of the glad meeting with our other kith and kin I will say nought. As to Cousin Maud, she had remained at home to welcome her darling at the gate of the Schopperhof, which she had decked forth bravely. Yea, her warm heart beat more fondly for him than for us. She could not wholly conceal her dismay at seeing him so changed. She would stroke him from time to time with a cherishing hand, yet she went about him as though there were somewhat in him of which she was afeard. Howbeit, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it was with her as it had been with me in the land of Egypt, and she found him again for whom her heart yearned so faithfully. Now, that which had seemed lacking came to light once more, and from that hour she no longer grieved for what he had lost and which a true mother peradventure might never have missed; indeed as his bodily health failed, and she shared the care of tending him with Ann, none could have conceived that he was not verily and indeed her own son. The...", "...Howe with advantage. Determining to avail himself of it, he formed a plan for surprising the camp at Germantown. This plan consisted, in its general outline, of a night march and double attack, consentaneously made, on both flanks of the enemy's right wing, while a demonstration, or attack, as circumstances should render proper, was to be directed on the western flank of his left wing. With these orders and objects the American army began its march from Skippack creek at 7 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the 3d of October (1777), in two columns--the right, under Sullivan and Wayne, taking the Chestnut Hill road, followed by Stirling's division in reserve; the left, composed of the divisions of Greene and Stephen, with M'Dougal's brigade and 1,400 Maryland and Jersey militia taking the Limekiln and old York roads, while Armstrong's Pennsylvania militia advanced by the Ridge road. Washington accompanied the right wing, and at dawn of day, next morning, attacked the...", "...wrote to him, unhappy girl, three days since? You wept over your letter; and the handwriting was disguised.\" Louise looked at Rodolph in great consternation. \"How did you know that, sir?\" \"Do not alarm yourself; I was alone in Madame Pipelet's lodge when they brought in the letter; and I remarked it quite accidentally.\" \"Yes, sir, it was mine. In this letter, which bore no signature, I wrote to M. Bradamanti, saying that, as I did not dare to go to him, I would beg him to be <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> near the Chateau d'Eau. I had lost my senses. I sought fearful advice from him; and I left my master's house with the intention of following them; but, at the end of a minute, my reason returned to me, and I saw what a crime I was about to commit. I returned to the house, and did not attend the appointment I had written for. That evening an event occurred, the consequences of which caused the misfortune which has overwhelmed me. M. Ferrand thought I had gone out for a...", "...coloured with dirty yellow lime-wash, vaguely Byzantine and vaguely Romanesque in its architecture, and that little cell with the plaster Christ nailed to a flat black wooden Cross--that tiny Sanctuary plainly white-washed, and so small that one could step across it in any direction--they were pregnant with her presence, all the same!\" \"Surely She revisited that spot, in spite of Her apparent desertion, to comfort all comers; She seemed so close at hand, so attentive and so grieving, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> as one sat alone by the light of a candle, that the soul seemed to burst open like a pod shedding the fruit of sin, the seeds of evil deeds; and repentance, that had been so tardily evolved, and sometimes so indefinite, became so suddenly despotic and unmistakable that the penitent dropped on his knees by the bed, and buried his head sobbing in the sheets.

He finally produced a horrific contrivance, made up of whirling sickles, knives, and revolving rods, pushed from behind by two horses; when he tried this upon a grain-field, however, it made a humiliating failure.

Robert McCormick had several sons, and one manifested a particular interest in his repeated failures. From the time he was seven years old Cyrus Hall McCormick became his father's closest companion.

He also became his father's...", "...Puss--Puss--Puss!\" For in the afternoon Rose left the house, attended by her uncle, who carried by its cord her little trunk. In her going forth she wore a clean white linen gown. She wore, not the Hat, nor yet the sad thing that Tanqueray had sat on, but a little black bonnet, close as a cap, with a black velvet bow in the front, and black velvet strings tied beneath her chin. It was the dress she had worn when she was nurse in a gentleman's family. V Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of that day, Tanqueray, as he sat in miserable meditation, was surprised by the appearance of Mrs. Eldred. She held in her hand Rose's hat, the hat he had given her, which she placed before him on the table. \"You'll be good enough, sir,\" said Mrs. Eldred, \"to take that back.\" \"Why should I take it back?\" he replied, with that artificial gaiety which had been his habitual defence against the approaches of Mrs. Eldred. \"Because, it was all very well for you to offer...", "...of their own. Rags was, as ever, a general favorite and heaps of fun, and Rover, the Old English sheepdog, proved to be almost as playful and humorous. He was wonderfully active for a dog who appeared to be so clumsy. He could hold his own in a scrap, too, as Mr. O'Brien learned to his sorrow. In aquatic sports, Rover shone. Speaking of the dogs, there came a night when one of them nearly upset the entire camp. It was the handsome collie, MacTavish. He strayed away from camp <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and managed to get into trouble with a little animal that is sometimes found in the woods whose method of defense is peculiar. It was a black and white skunk. MacTavish returned, very unhappy, just as the boys were getting to sleep. Seeking help and consolation in his distress, he entered the tent where his master lay. In less time than it takes to tell it every inmate of that tent was out in the open air.

The Begum and Moonna Jan were sent off with their attendants to the fort of Chunar, where they were lodged as state prisoners. As it became safe, the restrictions to which they were at first subjected became by degrees relaxed, and they were permitted to enjoy all the freedom and comforts compatible with their safe keeping. Both died at Chunar, Moonna Jan some time before the Begum. He left three sons by two slave-girls at Chunar, and...", "...to trust you doubted you, wouldn't you turn upon somebody and rend him?\" \"Are you going to rend anybody?\" \"I do not know as yet.\" \"I wish you would let me go down with you.\" \"No; that you certainly cannot.

Yves treats my wife as if she...", "...I constantly set apart some time for thrice every day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun for food, which generally took me up three hours in every morning, when it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking what I had killed or caught for my supply; these took up great part of the day. Also, it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day, when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to stir out; so that about four hours <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was all the time I could be supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I changed my hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning, and abroad with my gun in the afternoon. To this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the exceeding laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of tools, want of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time. For example, I was full two and forty days in making a...", "...from her mouth. By many she is considered an even more remarkable medium than the celebrated Mrs. Piper. It was one of these messages, the one written by her left hand, that Mr. Vincey now had before him. It consisted of eight words written disconnectedly: \"George Bessel... trial excavn.... Baker Street... help... starvation.\" Curiously enough, neither Doctor Paget nor the two other inquirers who were present had heard of the disappearance of Mr. Bessel--the news of it appeared only <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> papers of Saturday--and they had put the message aside with many others of a vague and enigmatical sort that Mrs. Bullock has from time to time delivered. When Doctor Paget heard Mr. Vincey's story, he gave himself at once with great energy to the pursuit of this clue to the discovery of Mr. Bessel. It would serve no useful purpose here to describe the inquiries of Mr. Vincey and himself; suffice it that the clue was a genuine one, and that Mr. Bessel was actually...", "...to marching on Brussels during the night with his whole force of about 50,000 men. The Guard is to be kept in reserve as much as possible, so as to support either Napoleon on the Gembloux road, or Ney on the Brussels road; and \"if any skirmish takes place with the English, it is preferable that the work should fall on the Line rather than on the Guard.\" As for the Prussian resistance, Napoleon rated it almost as lightly as that of the English; for he regards it as probable that he will <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> _march on Brussels with his Guard_. While he pictured his enemies hopelessly scattered or in retreat, they were beginning to muster at the very points which he believed to be within his grasp. At 11 a.m. only Ziethen's corps, now but 28,000 strong, was in position at Sombref, but the corps of Pirch I. and Thielmann came up shortly after midday.

But my mind was full of our conversation, and as I went on pondering over the matter, I thought that Yusuf might be right in his opinion as to the essence of God, for it seemed evident that the Creator of all beings ought to be perfectly simple; but I thought at the same time how impossible it would be for me, because the Christian religion had made a mistake, to...", "...\"That is my secret, friend Joseph. Does he look to you like the little color-bearer, my friend, that marched gayly out, in the sparkling sunshine? But see--he is no child--his hair is gray.\" He bent forward.

He held with his own the sufferer's eyes so that he could not fail to understand. \"He is a hero--!\" The President sat with the sick man in a pregnant silence, while the color came back into the face of the man on the bed. At last there came a smile. When he was satisfied that his work was done, the...", "...when it was of course most required.

When they started out in the morning, they were always on foot; but scarcely one of them returned in the evening without being mounted on a horse or mule. These would be turned in for the general use of the army, and the next day these men would start out afoot and return again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> mounted. Many of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of romance; indeed, I am afraid that in telling some of their experiences, the romance got the better of the truth upon which the story was founded, and that, in the way many of these anecdotes are told, very little of the foundation is left. I suspect that most of them consist chiefly of the fiction added to make the stories better. In one instance it was reported that a few men of Sherman's army...", "...adjourn to the parlor. Here Gregory changed his tactics, and drawing the children aside, told them a marvellous tale as a good-by souvenir, thus causing them to feel deep regret for his departure.

But all saw that he was growing very weary, and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he quietly rose and excused himself, saying that he needed rest for his journey on the morrow. There was the same polite, distant bow to Hunting as at first, and in deep disappointment Annie admitted that nothing had been gained by the interview from which she had hoped so much. They were no nearer reconciliation. While Gregory's manner had compelled respect and even admiration, it had annoyed her excessively, for he had made her lover appear to disadvantage, and she was...", "...bore S.W. by S. ten leagues distant.

On another occasion Mr. Huxley and myself landed at the site of the settlement of Gladstone, and were picked up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> by Captain Stanley in one of the surveying boats, on his return to the ship. It is difficult to conceive a more dreary spot, and yet I saw no more eligible place for a settlement on the shores of the harbour.

The Archduchess Valerie's portraits were exposed in the windows of all the picture-shops; the papers contained long articles full of jubilation.

He was in his...", "...as if in deep study, oftentimes neglecting to answer a question, and Enoch noticed that his apparent preoccupation occurred more often when his opinion was asked concerning some point upon which his officers were divided in opinion.

He had made arrangements for attacking them with the fireships and his explosion-vessel. But nearly all the crews refused to serve. Kanaris alone among the Greeks was brave. Having command of the fireships, he induced the sailors of two of them to bear down upon the enemy, and at about eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> one man-of-war was burnt.

That some mystery hung about her I felt convinced. I must fathom it or die. Her honor I never for a moment doubted; yet there seemed to weigh continually upon me the prophecy of some awful domestic calamity. This time the prophecy was not in vain. About three weeks after I had forbidden Brake my house, I was strolling over my farm <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> apparently inspecting my agriculture, but in reality speculating on that topic which latterly was ever present to me. There was a little knoll covered with evergreen oaks at the end of the lawn. It was a picturesque spot, for on one side the bank went off into a sheer precipice of about eighty feet in depth, at the bottom of which a pretty pool lay, that in the summer time was fringed with white water-lilies. I had thought of building a summer-house in this spot,...", "...which was woman's special task, would be a conspicuous figure even in the festival crowds.

Evidently they did not return, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Jesus led the others straight to the place. Mark says that He came 'with the twelve'; but he does not mean thereby to specify the number, but to define the class, of His attendants. Each figure in this preparatory scene yields important lessons. Our Lord's earnest desire to secure that still hour before pushing out into the storm speaks pathetically of His felt need of companionship and strengthening, as well as of His self-forgetting purpose to help His handful of...", "...this for truth; no man is so ingenious, but what another may be found equally ingenious.

A very effective medicine may be composed of the bones of some pious Lama ground into a powder. This may be given alone or in combination with other substances. It appears to be essential that the prayers recited on these occasions should be accompanied by terrific noises. M.

The Lama, of course, announced that a devil had possession of her body; and so <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he and eight other Lamas began operations for its expulsion. First they made a little figure or manikin of dried herbs, which they called the devil of intermittent fevers. This they stuck upright in the tent of the sick woman. Then at eleven o'clock at night the Lamas ranged themselves at the back of the tent, armed with bells, tambourines, conch-shells, and other noisy instruments.

The Gauchos also have frequently <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> killed them, by holding out a piece of meat in one hand, and in the other a knife ready to stick them.

Before French reached Kimberley, however, the Boers made a last effort to stay his victorious advance. But they were driven back with heavy loss. Only the frightful condition of his horses prevented French from turning rout into annihilation. But his worn-out animals were quite beyond pursuing even a beaten enemy. At length, Kimberley, seeing the huge sand cloud on the horizon, came to the conclusion that it enveloped the horsemen, not of Cronje but of French. About six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> an officer rode out of the besieged city to meet the soldier who had saved it. At 7--just one hour after the moment of French's historic promise, the General entered Kimberley with his Staff. He dined that night at De Beer's Sanatorium. But there was no rest for the conquerors.

So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> twilight, when they could not be seen or shot at from the city wall as deserters, they stole down to the Syrian camp. When they reached its outermost circle, to their amazement all was silence. They crept into one of the tents in fear and astonishment.

To this they helped themselves, and took it away and hid...", "...even with a very heavy sea. The writer, seeing the confidence which these gentlemen possessed with regard to the situation of things, found himself as much relieved with this conversation as he had previously been with the seeming indifference of the forecastle men, and the smile of the watch upon deck, though literally lashed to the foremast. From this time he felt himself almost perfectly at ease; at any rate, he was entirely resigned to the ultimate result. About six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the ship's company was heard moving upon deck, which on the present occasion was rather the cause of alarm. The writer accordingly rang his bell to know what was the matter, when he was informed by the steward that the weather looked considerably better, and that the men upon deck were endeavouring to ship the smoke-funnel of the galley that the people might get some meat. This was a more favourable account than had been anticipated.

At last, Saturday night came; tea and prayers were half an hour earlier than on other days. Mr. Frost played the harmonium, and the children sang sweetly \"Shall we gather at the river?\" Then they had their baths, and all retired to rest, looking forward to a happy day on the morrow, the first Sunday in our new Institution.

Everything seemed to be safe and comfortable, and at 11 p.m. I retired to rest. About 3 o'clock in the morning Mrs. Wilson and myself were simultaneously awakened by the running to and fro of the boys in the dormitory overhead, and the shouting of the schoolmaster. We were both up in an instant.

Do not be afraid, but go on and tell others.\" So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I preached on Sanctification, and we had an after-meeting in the schoolroom. Many believers stayed behind to ask questions upon the subject of my sermon. I do not remember how I replied to them; but imperfect as my statements must have been, it nevertheless led others to desire to enter into the experience of this same blessing. The following morning, I happened to take up a tract by John Fletcher, of Madeley, in which I read, that at a breakfast party on the occasion...", "...not settled yet.

He felt for a moment as if he were transported back to the days before the Revolution and was looking upon a reception in the crowded salons of the chateau de Rochefort where the baron entertained as became a grand seigneur. The republican colonel turned a look of inquiry toward St. Hilaire. The latter gave a slight shrug as he answered:-- \"The ladies dress three times a day and appear <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in full toilet.

Accordingly, to work they went, and by my return <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they had grubbed up a piece of a jawbone, with several teeth in it. The bone was very much decayed, and ready to crumble to pieces, but the teeth were quite sound.

Here it remained for some four hours, when it retired to the Quevy road and again entrenched. Nothing, however, in the way of a serious attack occurred, and at five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it fell back to its appointed place just east of Bavai.

As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o'clock the young man met the princess...", "...to which we were exposed in scraping the frozen surface of the rocks. On the contrary when we left the fire to collect it in the neighbourhood of the hut we became chilled at once and were obliged to return very quickly. Michel proposed to remain out all night and to hunt next day on his way back. He returned in the afternoon of the 18th, having found the blanket together with a bag containing two pistols and some other things which had been left beside it. We had some tripe de roche <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> but Mr. Hood, from the constant griping it produced, was unable to eat more than one or two spoonfuls. He was now so weak as to be scarcely able to sit up at the fireside and complained that the least breeze of wind seemed to blow through his frame. He also suffered much from cold during the night. We lay close to each other but the heat of the body was no longer sufficient to thaw the frozen rime formed by our breaths on the blankets that covered him. At this period...", "...a short time a few bright rays until the long polar night wrapped us in its sombre mantle, and enveloped us in gloom and obscurity for many months. \"'Tis gone, that bright and orbed blaze, Fast fading from our wistful gaze; Yon mantling cloud has hid from sight The last faint pulse of quivering light.\" A few hours of twilight, therefore, were all we had in which to work. Candles we had none. Our breakfast before we started in the morning and our supper after we halted <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> had to be discussed in gloomy darkness. Our notes had to be written in our journals before entering the tent, even at the risk of frost-bitten fingers. In the second place, at this time of the year the ice, over which the sledges have to be dragged, is of very recent formation, and is consequently weak and dangerous. The travellers are therefore more liable to immersion by breaking through the thin ice at this period of the season than they are during the spring, or...", "...lugger, to England, with despatches, intending to remain with the _Indefatigable_, and take part in the expected battle. But reflecting on the importance of conveying the information quickly to England, with the uncertainty of its being carried safely by so small a vessel; and assured that the _Revolutionaire_, which he had again spoke that morning, would not fail to meet Sir J. Colpoys, he gave up the hope of distinction to a sense of duty, and made sail for Falmouth. He arrived late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the 20th. If Lord Bridport had been waiting at Falmouth, with discretional powers, Sir Edward having been instructed to communicate directly with him, he might have sailed early on the 21st, and found the enemy in Bantry Bay, where, perhaps, not a ship would have escaped him. It is, however, to be remembered, that as the destination of the French armament was unknown to the last, the Admiralty might very properly determine that he should receive his final...", "...their return. At Trieste on St. Sylvester's Eve people form processions and drive the evil spirits with sticks and brooms out of the houses, while they invite the good spirits and good luck to come and dwell there.(412) In the town of Biggar, in Lanarkshire, it has been customary from time immemorial to celebrate a custom called \"burning out the Old Year\" on the thirty-first of December. A large bonfire, to which all the onlookers think it their duty to contribute fuel, is kindled <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at the town cross, and fires are also lighted on the adjacent hills.(413) When we remember how common it is in Central Europe to kindle fires at critical seasons for the purpose of burning the witches, we may suspect that what the good people of Biggar originally intended to burn on the last night of the year was not the Old Year but the witches. It would have been well for Scotland and for Europe if the practice of burning witches had always been carried out in this...", "...in state. It was amusing to us to see the way in which the runners made use of their tails. When the street was blocked by the crowd, they turned them into whips, and laid them about the people's shoulders to right and left! We had a little trouble in finding our wheel-barrows; but eventually succeeding, we paid off the chair coolies, mounted our humble vehicles, and returned to the river, accompanied for fully half the distance by an attendant from the magistrate's office.

Here I made...", "...and was perfectly disgusted with the whole thing. Then I fell to knitting socks for babies, but they only occupied my hands, and my head felt as empty as ever. Mamma took me off on a journey, as she always did when I took to moping, and that diverted me for a while. But after that everything went on in the old way. I got rid of part of the day by changing my dress, and putting on my pretty things-it is a great thing to have a habit of wearing one's ornaments, for instance; and then <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> one could go to the opera or the theater, or some other place of amusement, after which one could sleep all through the next morning, and so get rid of that. But I had been used to such things all my life, and they had got to be about as flat as flat can be. If I had been born a little earlier in the history of the world, I would have gone into a convent; but that sort of thing is out of fashion now.\" \"The best convent,\" I said, \"for a woman is the seclusion of her...", "...But not only is the mode of travel strange in Topsy-turvy Land, even the time of the day is all upside down. When the boys and girls of America are going to bed the boys and girls of Arabia are thinking of getting up. As early as four o'clock by western time the muezzin calls out loud from the top of the minaret (for Moslem churches have no steeples and no bells) to come and pray. Arabs count the hours from sunrise. It is noon at six o'clock and they breakfast at one; at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> all good boys and girls are asleep. [Illustration: MODES OF TRAVEL.] In Topsy-turvy Land all the habits and customs are exactly opposite to those in America or England. For instance when a boy enters a room he takes off his shoes but leaves his hat on his head. I do not know whether we should call it a _hat_, however. His hat has no rim and is not made of felt or straw, but is just a folded handkerchief of a large size and bright colour with a piece of cord to hold...", "...booty taken by his sailors. But this cowardice and avarice of their admiral very nearly caused a mutiny among the sailors. It was not suppressed without the greatest efforts. \"I will myself conduct you to the spot and show you the house where a rich set of diamonds and some thousands of scudi are lying in company with your epaulets!\" \"And as I have rather long fingers, I shall be able to grasp both the epaulets and the treasure,\" laughingly responded Ribas. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> after this conversation of Orloff with Joseph Ribas, a wonderfully brilliant evening, such as is known only under Italian skies. Natalie inhaled the soft air with delight, and drank in the intoxicating odor of the flowers which poured out their sweetest fragrance in the cool of the evening. She was on this evening unusually cheerful; with the smiling brow and childish gayety, as in happier days, she skipped down the alleys, or, with her guitar upon her arm, reposed...", "...on the bed. Then he put his hands on Ita's shoulders and kissed her. \"Good-night, you poor little thing,\" he said. \"Sleep well, order anything that you want, and don't leave this room until I come and fetch you. Your troubles are over.\" She clung to him. \"But you vill stay a leetle--just a leetle?\" \"No, I'm going now.\" There was nowhere in Graham's mind the remotest desire to stay. A new and strange chivalry had taken the place of the passion that had swept over him earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the blue light had fallen on her slim body. She looked into his face, nodded and put her lips to his cheek. \"Good night, zen,\" she said. \"You 'ave taken me out of hell. You are very good.\" And as Graham walked home under the gleaming moon and the star-bespattered sky, there was a little queer song in his rather lonely heart. Poor, simple, sophisticated lad! How easy it had been for that cunning little creature whose one ambition was to be the mistress of an...", "...it did not occur; but the pirate and his followers got safely into a little bay, where they dropped their anchor, and offered up their thanksgivings to their patron saints, for having preserved them from the great danger they had just encountered. After having thus piously performed their religious duties, they set to work to prepare the materials for a fire-ship, with which they purposed to blow the English brig and all her crew to the devil. The storm had soon spent its fury, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they again got under weigh, and beat round to the south side of the island to the bay, where they had at first intended anchoring, it being, by far the safest, as the wind was very likely to shift round, and blow with almost equal violence down the gulf. Among the islands of the Archipelago, the gales generally come from the northward, and it is consequently considered always more prudent to anchor under a southern shore. The pirates now recollected, as they were...", "...between them. Some fragrant word of the poets which called up from the depths of his being passionate emotions could not in him be severed from the beloved lips that had made him hear it for the first time. Even twenty years later he could never read Egmont or Romeo, or see them played, without there leaping up in him at certain lines the memory of those quiet evenings, those dreams of happiness, and the beloved faces of Frau von Kerich and Minna. He would spend hours looking at them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when they were reading; in the night when he was dreaming in his bed, awake, with his eyes closed; during the day, when he was dreaming at his place in the orchestra, playing mechanically with his eyes half closed.

He went into the matter gravely, and did not know which to choose. And yet, as it...", "...named Miles and Derry as head men. They had about eighty acres put in cotton. The recorded contract required them to work under my direction, and I was to furnish means to raise the crop, and their share was half the cotton. Owing to the almost constant spring rains, their crop became hopelessly overgrown with weeds and grass. I vainly tried to induce them to abandon the lowest part of the land and save about sixty acres; they refused. I then wrote a note to the agent. He came out late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with the deputy sheriff and sent for Miles and Derry, heard what they had to say; then severely reprimanded them; took Miles by the ears and backed him against the side of the house and pounded his head against the wall vigorously; then taking Derry by the ears, he pounded his head as he did Miles's.

He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years....", "...of a settlement remains, save the ruins of an old stone house, which may probably have been the theatre of wild and bloody incidents, in by-gone years. The serrated hills are grey and barren, and the surrounding country shows no verdure. Anchoring here, we waited several hours for the wind to moderate, and tried to get such sleep as might perchance be caught in an unsteady boat. By great diligence in working against wind and current, we succeeded in reaching Genella at 9 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the second day. Our mulatto pilot, Manuel Quatrine, whistled shrilly through his fingers; and, after a brief delay, the response of a similar whistle reached our ears from shore. A conversation was sustained for some moments, by means of shouts to-and-fro in Portuguese; a man then swam off to reconnoitre; and, on his return, the people launched a canoe and carried us ashore, weary enough of thirty-six hours' confinement in an open boat. We took up our quarters in the...", "...two days after Commodore Bainbridge had left Boston. She expected to make a very long cruise and so carried with her an unusual quantity of stores and sixty more men than ordinarily, so that her muster-roll contained 319 names. Being deep in the water she reached San Jago after Bainbridge had left. Nothing was met with until after the Essex had crossed the equator in longitude 30\u00b0 W. on Dec. 11th. On the afternoon of the next day a sail was made out to windward, and chased. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it was overtaken, and struck after receiving a volley of musketry which killed one man. The prize proved to be the British packet _Nocton_, of 10 guns and 31 men, with $55,000 in specie aboard. The latter was taken out, and the _Nocton_ sent home with Lieutenant Finch and a prize crew of 17 men, but was recaptured by a British frigate. The next appointed rendezvous was the Island of Fernando de Noronha, where Captain Porter found a letter from Commodore Bainbridge,...", "...rainfall of Bougainville Straits and that of the eastern end of the Solomon Group are much about the same, viz., about 150 inches: the chief difference between the two regions being, that in the former region, there are a greater number of rainy days and fewer heavy falls. The heavy falls, when they do occur, are not easily forgotten; thus, at Treasury we measured, in July, 1884, 11 inches of rain in 10 successive hours; but the daily record was only 8.09 inches, since the rain began <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of one day and lasted well into the following morning. During the heavy rainfalls in these regions the streams swell in an astonishingly quick manner. Rivulets become turbid streams, the whole hill-slope discharges a continuous sheet of water, and the water rushes down the permanent stream-courses with the roar of a mountain-torrent. Large blocks of stone are swept some distance along the lower courses of the streams; and the trunks of trees are carried by each...", "...I have always supposed he was selected to be the Chief of the Confederacy, mainly with a view to this object, as it was generally believed he possessed military genius of a high order.

I have faith in President Davis, and believe he will gain great glory in this first mighty conflict. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Secretary Walker returned from tea in great excitement. He strode to and fro in the room where we were sitting, d----g his office. He said a great battle was then going on, and he wished himself present participating in its perils. Again he denounced the office he filled--and seemed, for a time, almost frantic with anxiety. He said all young men ought to be in the field, and this was understood by those present, who had merely shouldered their pens. Before long the...", "...resisted their entrance with all his might, but, unarmed as he was, he was quickly thrown down, and the terrified Dumah was dragged over his body and hurried off to be put in chains in a Moslem cell. Amzi was distracted. There seemed little hope for Dumah. The small Jewish band then in Medina could not dare to cope with the overwhelming numbers of Moslems that swarmed in the streets. If Dumah were delivered it must be by stratagem; and yet what stratagem could be employed? Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Amzi and the priest withdrew to the roof for consultation. \"You believe that your God is all-powerful--why do you not beseech him for our poor lad's safety?\" cried Amzi passionately. \"I have not ceased to do so since his capture,\" returned Yusuf. \"But it must be as the Lord willeth.

How long she had slept or what awakened her, Mrs. Miller could not tell, but as she strained her ears for the slightest sound, she imagined she could hear outside the footfalls of some heavy animal. She knew it could be no bear, for whatever it was the snow was crunching under its feet, nor was it a human, for the steps were those of a four-footed object. The moon, that earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> had flooded the valley until it was almost as light as day, was now just dipping behind the mountain to the west, throwing the stable into deep shadow, from which the sounds now seemed to come.

And then she saw so little of him. He was frequently absent from Hidvar for weeks at a time, and when he returned he regularly brought in his train a merry company of comrades, in whose pastimes Henrietta could take no sort of pleasure. During those long days when she had Hidvar all to herself and was left entirely to the company of her sad thoughts, she would sometimes walk about till late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in the shady alleys of the home park, listening to the songs of the girls working in the fields. At the end of the park was a church, and in front of it a small clearing fenced around with stakes and looking like a cabbage garden. It surely belonged to some poor man or other. It did--and the poor man was the parish-priest. Henrietta often saw him, a tall, grey-bearded man in a long black cassock, hastening to his little garden; there the reverend gentleman would divest...", "...twenty-three-story Masonic Temple, in Quincy, Ill.?\" inquired another, dropping his nose-glasses. \"Will he spring one of those Western Mississippi River catfish stories, in which they use yearling calves for bait?\" demanded Kirk, fiercely. \"Be comforted,\" said Vuyning. \"He has none of the little vices.

And when the ones who pass their lives in city streets spoke of skyscrapers or of the little Czar on his far, frozen throne, or of insignificant fish from inconsequential streams, this big, deep-chested man, faultlessly clothed, and eyed like an Emperor, disposed of their Lilliputian chatter with a wink of his eyelash.

We now travelled in this delightful manner; there were great numbers of guinea-fowl throughout the country, which was the same everlasting flat and rich table land, extending for several hundred miles to the south, and dotted with green mimosas; while upon our left was the broken valley of the Atbara. The only drawback to the journey was the rain. At about 2 P.M. daily we...", "...could have done; she put on the dhaja (a coarse red turban) and broke her bracelets in pieces.

If she starved herself to death her family would be disgraced; and, moreover, starving would be a more lingering misery than the death by fire.

But, you will note, the scenery changes help to keep the interest of the audience from flagging, and also stamp the lapses of time effectively. A still greater violation of the \"rule\"--if it were stated as absolutely rigid--is to be found in Mr. Granville's later act, \"The Yellow Streak,\" written in collaboration with James Madison. Here scene two takes place later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the first scene, and the third scene after a lapse of four months. But these two exceptions, out of many that might be cited, merely prove that dramatic genius can mold even the rigid time of the vaudeville stage to its needs. Of course, there is the possibility of foreshortening time to meet the exigencies of vaudeville when the scene is not changed. For instance: a character telephones that he will be right over and solve the whole situation on which the punch...", "...in the morning, and arrived at Yamina at forty-five minutes past four o'clock.

The game at kick-ball which preceded the wedding was admittedly one of the best that had ever been played at that station, partly, no doubt, because the captain and crew of the English ship, headed by Red Rooney, took part in it. Strange to say, the only man who seemed to be at all cast down on that occasion was Ippegoo.

At nine miles we entered a dense brush of pinetrees, acacia and other shrubs growing on pure sand. Through this we rode for...", "...eclipse the earlier historical interest. Two important battles were fought in the near vicinity of the town. The first took place on September 20, 1643. The Londoners, under Essex, were returning to the capital after raising the siege of Gloucester, and had taken the longer, and southern, route as being the most open and practicable. News of the approach reached the King at Oxford and it was decided to stop them and give battle. Essex had led his men out of Hungerford the day before and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he found his way barred by the Royalist cavalry at Newbury Wash. The Parliamentary forces bivouacked on Crockham Heath and next morning opened the attack. They were fortunate enough to be able to seize the high ground commanding the Kintbury road before the King's men awoke to the importance of the position. The Life Guards under Biron charged up the hill with great valour, but failed to shift the stubborn townsmen, and brave and gentle Falkland was killed in the melee....", "...against chairs and tables, or looking for them in each and every commodious corner, saying: \"Eh, little rascals.

When the Cure came, the injured man was handed over to his care, and he arranged that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Boily should be removed to his house, to await the arrival of the doctor from the next parish. This was Charley's public introduction to the people of Chaudiere, and it was his second meeting with Rosalie Evanturel. The incident brought him into immediate prominence.

They traveled on in this way for two days more, when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they arrived at a large plain sprinkled with mimosa-trees, and abutting on the foot of a low range of hills. The Matabili told them that they would find the giraffes on these plains, and the Major, who was very anxious, kept his telescope to his eyes, looking round in every direction till nightfall, but did not succeed in descrying any of the objects of his search. They retired that night with anxious expectation for the following morning, when they anticipated that they...", "...face of a man whom she thought she had seen before, though she could not tell where, and the face haunted her, causing much uneasiness. \"Could he have seen and known me?\" she queried most anxiously. He had done both. He was no other than Tom Crowl, a clerk in the village at one of the lesser dry-goods stores, where the Allens had a small account. He was one of the mean loafers who were present at the bar-room scene, and had cheered, and then kicked Gus Elliot, and \"laid for him\" <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with the \"boys.\" He was one of the upper graduates of Pushton street-corners, and having spent an idle, vicious boyhood, truant half the time from school, had now arrived at the dignity of clerk in a store, that thrived feebly on the scattering trade that filtered through and past Mr. Hard's larger establishment. He was one of the worst phases of the male gossip, and had the scent of a buzzard for the carrion of scandal. The Allens were now the uppermost theme of the...", "...out to the north-east. The following day it retraced its steps to the south of the town where it joined the \"C.-in-C.\". He had with him the remainder of the Division and the Australians. A triumphal entry into the town with the troops named was then made. The Machine-Gun Squadron, given the choice, went independently, straight to their next camp at El Judeide, nine miles south-west of Damascus, preferring to rest their horses. There they camped in orange groves, being re-joined <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> by the remainder of the Brigade, who had taken part in the \"show\".

When we were ordered back to El Judeide Mr. Arden was told to go into the town and make all the purchases he could, so as to provide the Squadron with a few comforts. He took with him Q.M.S. Fisher, the officers' mess cook, and his groom. Having made his purchases, Mr. Arden, who had...", "...woman merely to satisfy my natural desires, for such can be found easily enough; I wished for some one whom I could love. I expected beauty, both of the body and the soul; and my love increased with the difficulties and obstacles I saw before me. As to failure, I confess I did not give it a moment's thought, for there is not a woman in the world who can resist constant and loving attentions, especially when her lover is ready to make great sacrifices. When I got back from the theatre <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the maid told me that the lady had chosen a modest closet at the back, which was only suitable for a servant. She had had a moderate supper, only drinking water, and had begged the cook's wife only to send her up soup and one dish, to which the woman had replied that she must take what was served, and what she did not eat would do for the servant. \"When she finished she shut herself up to write, and wished me good evening with much politeness.\" \"What is she going to...", "...one, some rocks, favourably situated, enabled us to effect a passage by bedding logs between them and covering the whole with branches and earth, leaving room for the water to pass between. HALT TO REPAIR THE CARTS AND HARNESS. August 5. A halt was this day unavoidable, but the necessity was the less to be regretted as the weather was very unfavourable. Indeed we had scarcely seen one fine day for some weeks. Mr. Stapylton set out to trace the rivulet downwards, and returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> after having reached its junction with the Glenelg at the distance of nine miles in a north-west direction. The course of the river thus determined to that junction appeared to be more to the westward than I had previously expected, and I began again to think its estuary might still be to the westward of Cape Northumberland, and this prospect induced me to alter our course. The carts having come up about one P.M., the blacksmith was set to work and wrought throughout the...", "...home. I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying, \"Bangles, crystal bangles!\" When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school, I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging the ground. He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or gets wet. I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with nobody to stop me from digging. Just as it gets dark <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and my mother sends me to bed, I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and down. The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like a giant with one red eye in its head. The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at his side, and never once goes to bed in his life. I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night, chasing the shadows with my lantern. SUPERIOR Mother, your baby is silly! She is so...", "...Again Smith performed the work and waited on Mr. Girard for payment. \"Ah, ha, you all finish?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Very well; how much money shall I give you?\" \"One dollar, sir.\" \"Dat is honest. You take no advantage. Dare is your dollar.\" \"Can I do anything else for you?\" \"Oui, come here when you get up to-morrow. You shall have more work.\" Smith was punctual, but for the third time, and yet again for the fourth, he was ordered to \"take dem stone back again.\" When he called for his pay <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Stephen Girard spoke very cordially. \"Ah, Monsieur Smit, you shall be my man; you mind your own business and do it, ask no questions, you do not interfere. You got one vife?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Ah, dat is bad. Von vife is bad. Any little chicks?\" \"Yes, sir, five living.\" \"Five? Dat is good; I like five.

Night closed around, and the old man sat later by the fireside than he had done for years, for much of life's vigour had returned with his hopes and joy; he breathed the evening prayers with a deeper fervour; he joined <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> hymn with a voice less tremulous than the others, and he walked without his staff to his bed. Poor bereaved heart! nearly all had been taken from him; none save the little orphan grandson had been left for him to love; the waters of affliction had rolled deeply over his head; but the heart, consecrated to heaven, had learnt to bow meekly to the rod, and now the most bitter cup of his life had been filled with joy. \"Thy will be done,\" was the old man's closing prayer,...", "...but I find that there was another at the time when I wrote thus--a young man of good family, who came out here seeking an appointment. He was sun-stricken three days ago, and violent fever and delirium set in, during the height of which he overpowered four Sikhs who were taking care of him, rushed out of doors, fell down exhausted, was carried home, and died at four in the morning, his last delirious dreams being of gambling and losing heavily. The lamentable burial took place <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> as the shadows fell. This sums up the story--a career of dissipation, death at twenty-one, a rough, oblong box, no one to be sorry. It made my heart ache for the mother, who would have given much to be where I was, and see \"the dreary death train\" move slowly to the dreary inclosure on a hill-top, where the grass grows rank and very green round a number of white wooden crosses, which mark the graves of the officers and soldiers who fell in 1876. The Union Jack was thrown...", "...with open parklike meadows--splendid wapiti country. Our tents were pitched two hundred yards from the Chung-tien road just within the edge of a stately, moss-draped forest. That night we celebrated with harmless bombs from the huge fires of bamboo stalks which exploded as they filled with steam and echoed among the trees like pistol shots. Marco Polo speaks of the same phenomenon which he first witnessed in this region over six hundred and thirty years ago. About nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we ran our traps with a lantern and besides several mice (_Apodemus_) found two rare shrews and a new mole (_Blarina_). I went out with the hunters at dawn but saw nothing except an old wapiti track and a little sign. All during the following day a dense fog hung close to the ground so that it was impossible to hunt, and, on the night of December 2, it snowed heavily. The morning began bright and clear but clouded about ten o'clock and became so bitterly cold that the...", "...a rich and beautiful suit, and fretted over with gold. This suit along with other spoils of war King Ryence had caused to be hung up in his chief church as a lasting monument of his success and victory. In the same church was a famous and mighty spear. It had been fashioned in olden days by magic lore, and was preserved on account of its magic powers. No matter how well or firmly a warrior sat his charger, this spear bore him to the ground. Glauce remembered these things, and late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she led Britomart to the church, and taking down Angela's armour from its place on the wall, arrayed her fair nursling therein. She took also the spear, and with it a shield, and gave them to Britomart. When she had thus completed the Princess' attire, she took another suit of armour and put it on herself, that she might attend Britomart and act as her squire. And now, both being fully equipped, they mounted the horses which Glauce had caused to be ready, and under...", "...or four doors beyond Mr. Howell's, whose goods, poor man, his trayes, and dishes, shovells, &c., were flung all along Tower-street in the kennels, and people working therewith from one end to the other; the fire coming on in that narrow streete, on both sides, with infinite fury. Sir W. Batten not knowing how to remove his wine, did dig a pit in the garden, and laid it in there; and I took the opportunity of laying all the papers of my office that I could not otherwise dispose of. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Sir W. Pen and I did dig another, and put our wine in it; and I my Parmazan cheese, as well as my wine and some other things. The Duke of Yorke was at the office this day, at Sir W. Pen's; but I happened not to be within. This afternoon, sitting melancholy with Sir W. Pen in our garden, and thinking of the certain burning of this office, without extraordinary means, I did propose for the sending up of all our workmen from Woolwich and Deptford yards (none whereof yet...", "...bitterly of the conduct of the Allies. All France is now disarmed and no troops are to be seen but those in foreign uniform. The face of the country between Paris and Auxerre is not peculiarly striking; but the soil appears fertile and the road excellent. After breakfast we started from Auxerre and stopped to sup and sleep the same night at Avallon. At Semur, which we passed on the following day, there is a one arched bridge of great boldness across the river Armancon. We arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at Dijon. The country between Auxerre and Dijon is very undulating in gentle hill and dale, but for the want of trees and inclosures it has a bleak appearance. As you leave Avallon and approach Dijon, the hills covered with vines indicate your arrival in a wine country.

It was devastated during...", "...dilapidated, the houses of the town small and unattractive, the streets crooked, narrow, and dirty.

There are several coffee-stalls and a second-rate caravansary in the bazaar. A large open space, not very remarkable for cleanliness, serves in the day as a corn-market; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> several hundred guests are to be seen seated before a large coffee-stall, drinking coffee and smoking nargillies. Modern ruins are abundant in Bassora, the result of the plague which in the year 1832 carried off nearly one half of the inhabitants. Numbers of streets and squares consist only of forsaken and decaying houses.

On Sunday, August 1st,[264] after morning church, I left Greta Hall, crossed the fields to Portinscale, went through Newlands, where \"Great Robinson looks down upon Marden's Bower,\" and drank tea at Buttermere, crossed the mountains to Ennerdale, and slept at a farm-house a little below the foot of the lake, spent the greater part of the next day mountaineering, and went <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> through Egremont to St. Bees, and slept there; returned next day to Egremont, and slept there; went by the sea-coast as far as Gosforth, then turned off and went up Wasdale, and slept at T.

After reaching the summit of the hill, the pursuit ceased. During the day the fight at times was bloody, and many were killed and wounded on both sides. The Confederate wounded were left on the field. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Gen. Ewell, with the larger portion of his command, were cut off and forced to surrender. The Confederates also took several hundred prisoners. The Confederate army, except Longstreet's command, crossed the river during the night, Gordon's troops at the High Bridge going into bivouac on the opposite side, while Longstreet occupied the hills at the river near the town of Farmville.

She gave directions aloud that her maids of honor should accompany her, secretly intending <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to take the most effectual steps to interfere with his majesty's attachment. Then, when she was alone, and at the very moment the poor lover, who had issued orders for the departure, was reveling in the idea that Mademoiselle de la Valliere would form one of the party,--luxuriating in the sad happiness persecuted lovers enjoy of realizing through the sense of sight alone all the transports of possession,--Madame, who was surrounded by her maids of honor, was...", "...his temper and manners very different from what would have been expected. My benevolent companion having already made a preliminary exploration of the hospitals of the place, before sharing my bed with him, as above mentioned, I joined him in a second tour through them.

It was getting late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when we began our rounds. The principal collections of the wounded were in the churches. Boards were laid over the tops of the pews, on these some straw was spread, and on this the wounded lay, with little or no covering other than such scanty clothes as they had on. There were wounds of all degrees of severity, but I heard no groans or murmurs. Most of the sufferers were hurt in the limbs, some had undergone amputation, and all had, I presume, received such...", "...presently returned with a pan of bread crumbs, which they had begged from the cook, and which they now hoped to see the red-breasts eat. But the little creatures were alarmed at seeing so many visitors; or the sun enticed them to extend their flight beyond the green house; for on the entrance of the boys, they all took wing and flew away. 'I am sorry we frightened them,' said Harriet. 'Do you not think they will ever come back again?' asked Elizabeth. 'Oh yes, they will be back <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> or before,' replied Maria Wexford; 'they often fly out in the day-time when it is fine. But perhaps you would like to run round the garden; you will be cold standing still.' The party was preparing for a race when Mr. Mortimer appeared to summon that part of it which belonged to him; and, having arranged a day with Mr. Wexford, for the families to meet at Beech Grove, Mr. Mortimer and his children returned towards the park.

It was one Sunday evening--\"Golden Sunday\" they call it here, though why they _should_ call it so, I know not. I accepted the information, however, without inquiry into first causes, and went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to promenade in the Allee with the rest. The Allee is not all on a level, but descends gradually from the springs to a fountain which is at the opposite end. Rows and rows of Japanese lanterns were festooned across the trees.

You could not see the water till you got close up, and at a distance only the rows of gas jets were apparent. As you...", "...or calling to his mates and her. And once again, in the late afternoon, with him and with the other boys and girls, she went down the road from the little schoolhouse in the edge of the timber on the hill; her sunbonnet hanging by its strings and her dinner basket on her arm. Onward, through the long shadows that lay across their way, they went together, to pause at last before the gate of her home, there to linger for a little, while the others still went on. Farther and farther <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they watched their schoolmates go--up the road past the house where he lived--past the orchard and over the hill--until, in the distance, they seemed to vanish into the sunset sky and she was left with him alone.

At last by inquiry at the police station they learnt that he had hurt himself by falling when climbing to the Dome, and had been taken to St. George's Private Hospital. It was about nine <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the three friends visited him in the ward. \"Hello, what's wrong now?\" Frank cried; \"better than typhoid anyway.\" Alice rose in indignation at the noise and clatter; but seeing John smile, reseated herself.

I soon realized that solitude, instead of curing me, was doing me harm, and so I completely changed my system. I went into the country, and galloped through the woods with the huntsmen; I would ride until I was out of breath, trying to cure myself with fatigue, and when, after a day of sweat in the fields, I reached my bed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> smelling of powder and the stable, I would bury my head in the pillow, roll about under the covers and cry: \"Phantom, phantom! are you not satiated? Will you not leave me for one single night?\" But why these vain efforts? Solitude sent me to nature, and nature to love.

No get scared at--any t'ing.\" mumbled Vita while her own excited manner seemed real cause for alarm. \"I just like to know when my little girl sleep very good, like baby.\" Truth to tell Nora was too sleepy to argue, otherwise she might have demanded an explanation. Vita was plainly excited, and this fact coupled with that of her strange actions earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> was unquestionably enough to cause suspicion; but rest to a girl afflicted with \"nerves\" is a precious thing, and when it came to Nora she had no idea of risking its loss by any sort of argument. But Vita seemed to want to linger longer. First she looked at one window, then at another. She even plumped a cushion--as if that were necessary to a night's comfort! \"Where do you sleep, Vita?\" asked Nora, drowsily. \"Oh, in a good bed, in the little room by kitchen,\"...", "...that I should speak to them. As this was a political club, I felt at liberty, on being introduced by Warner M. Bateman, to make a political speech, mainly devoted to my early friend, General Ewing, and his peculiar notions of finance. This was reported in the papers at the time. If there was too much political feeling manifested in my speeches at this period, it may be partly excused by the extreme violence of denunciation of me by Democratic speakers and newspapers. Later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I visited Wielert's pavilion, on Vine Street, where the usual evening concert was being given. The visitors were mainly German citizens, and, as such, were known to be in favor of a sound currency based upon gold and silver.

They insisted upon a speech, and I said: \"When I came here to-night I did not expect to make a speech, as I...", "...eight.

THE MAINE DISASTER. |On the 25th of January the Maine, an American battleship, entered the harbor of Havana, Cuba, and anchored in her waters at a spot indicated by the harbor-master. The usual exchange of salutes and formal visits expected between two powers, took place, and there was no apparent unfriendliness shown. Just three weeks from that day, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the 15th of February, an explosion took place, which tore the boat to atoms, killing 266 of her crew and two officers. At once treachery was suspected, {368}but the American people was asked to suspend its judgment until the long and searching investigation which was conducted by the naval board of inquiry was ended, when every evidence was produced proving that the awful calamity was due wholly to Spanish treachery. This led to a severing of all diplomatic...", "...end of strife--men united--Marching! Marching! Marching!

This misfortune arrested the movement which the Emperor was preparing to make, and the enemy took courage.

The dance Battey describes evidently began <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of the 18th and continued intermittently to late afternoon of the 21st. Apparently the dancers do not leave the lodge during this entire period. _19th_ [June, 1873.]--Music and dancing continued in the medicine house through the night.

But their bravery saved only their master; the battle of Bouvines was lost for the Anglo-Germano-Flemish coalition. It was still prolonged for several hours; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> it was over, and the prisoners of note were conducted to Philip Augustus. There were five counts, Ferrand of Flanders, Renaud of Boulogne, William of Salisbury, a natural brother of King John, Otho of Tecklemburg, and Conrad of Dartmund; and twenty-five barons \"bearing their own standard to battle.\" Philip Augustus spared all their lives; sent away the Earl of Salisbury to his brother, confined the Count of Boulogne at Peronne, where he was subjected \"to very rigorous...", "...were among the killed.

The British admiral was instructed (July 3) that if this operation were continued, he should immediately destroy the earthworks and silence the batteries. After due formalities he (July 11) opened fire at seven in the morning, and by half-past five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the Alexandria guns were silenced. Incendiaries set the town on fire, the mob pillaged it, and some murders were committed.

The mob had followed them on the road, armed, and with murder in their hearts. Frequently the brethren had to hide themselves in their wagons, their pursuers were so close upon them; and on two or three occasions they were together in the same house. Once they remained all night in the same building with only a partition between them, and the oaths and threats of their enemies could be distinctly heard. Late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> these fiends went into the room where the brethren were and examined them, but although they were very well acquainted with the brethren, they decided it was not them.

This alarm, however, obliged the queen and the royal family of Prussia to remove to Magdeburgh on the twenty-third; and the most valuable records were sent to the fort of Spandau, at the conflux of the Havel and the Sphre.

Laramie, after a long talk, made an appointment to meet him in town <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> and as they reached the foot of the hill where the road climbed to the Sleepy Cat divide, Laramie feeling he had no further excuse for loitering, put spurs to his horse and took a bridle trail, used as a cut-off, to get into safer country.

Then our task was finished, and we decorated Saint Canon's old church with all the wreaths and garlands, the crosses and illuminations, on which we had been so busy in the school-room; making it look quite modern in its festal preparation for the ensuing day, when the result of our handiwork would be displayed to the admiration, we hoped, of the congregation at large. On parting with Min late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at her door--for our work at the church had occupied us longer than usual--I thought it the happiest Christmas Eve I had ever passed; and, as I went to bed that night, I wondered, dreamily, if the morning's sun would rise for another as happy a day, while I prayed to God that He would shape my life in accordance with the fervent desire of my heart.

What has become of him?\" Will Manton was gone! To the anxious inquiries that were made, his friends discovered that he had left Albany <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> boat, on Tuesday, for New York. Though a messenger was immediately sent after him, no trace of him could be discovered. A few months after, they received a letter from him, written from Liverpool, where he had gone in a merchant-ship, as a cabin-boy. His friends were very much grieved and distressed, but hoped that he would soon grow weary of a hard and roving life, and return to his home. There was a romantic interest in all this for young Rodney.

Ebl\u00e9 and Larrey were the two men whom the whole army never ceased to respect and to obey, even when they demanded things which were almost impossible. General Ebl\u00e9 then with his 400 men departed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of November 24th. for Borisow, followed by the clever General Chasseloup who had some sappers with him, but without their tools.

It is a very strongly fortified town, and likewise having the sea to escape by, if necessary, it was by far the safest place; and being only twenty-five miles from Brussels, it added so little to the time of hearing from him, if separated, that I acquiesced cheerfully. After this was arranged, we never thought more about it, and enjoyed each hour as it passed with no more anxiety than was sufficient to render time precious.

On this I spoke to twelve Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the city; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order to finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said nothing more than that the next Friday <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they were to come out stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting for me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately, with orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not to say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that spot. This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step had to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that she might be prepared...", "...in his manners: what other traits they may have had in common, I do not know; perhaps an amiable habit of illusion. He was always going to bring me his discharge papers, but he never did, though he came often and had many a pleasant night's sleep at my cost. If sometimes he did a little work, he spent great part of the time contracted to me in the kitchen, where it was understood, quite upon his own agency, that his wages included board. At other times, he called for money too late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to work it out that day, and it has happened that a new second girl, deceived by his genteel appearance in the uncertain light, has shown him into the parlor, where I have found him to his and my own great amusement, as the gentleman who wanted to see me.

But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the camp was lively. Groups of men in red shirts and corded trousers tied at the knee, in high boots, sat round blazing fires, and talked of their prospects or discussed the news of the luck at other camps.

The wedding was to be in three days' time. On Sunday afternoon Athalie went to pay visits in turn to all her school friends. It is one of the bride's privileges to pay these visits without her...", "...morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have been committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> melancholy; by night it was sinister. In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated at the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old women were fond of begging. However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique air, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing. For the last...", "...cross'd the green; And maids and shepherd-youths were seen, To celebrate the May.

But at last he did resolve to make an attempt at doing so.

The governor was unrelenting. Whoever ventured to oppose his will felt the weight of his chastising hand. New Amsterdam consisted of wooden houses clustered together. The danger from fire was very great. The governor imposed a tax of a beaver skin, or its equivalent upon each householder to pay for two hundred and fifty leather fire buckets and hooks and ladders, to be procured in Holland. He also established a \"rattle watch\" to traverse the streets from nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> until morning drum-beat. Stuyvesant would allow nothing to be done which he did not control. The education of the young was greatly neglected. Jacob Corlaer opened a school. The governor peremptorily closed it, because he had presumed to take the office without governmental permission. To establish a place of amusement the governor formed a village called Haarlem, at the northern extremity of Manhattan island. He also constructed a good road over the island, through...", "...paddle about from Brocas to Lower Hope. Canoes, punting, and sailing are not allowed.

The two black horses, however, seemed to have conceived a horror of the river and could not be induced to cross. They simply made us very wet, and we had to go forward on foot. We were now within easy distance of the end of the Gorge, and had joined the route of Von Plaaten[21] from the south. On December 10 I went out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to shoot something for the pot. On the first ridge I came to I stalked and killed a big guanaco buck, putting a bullet into his lungs. Then I signalled to Barckhausen to come and help to cut him up. As I waited there in the fading light, wondering at the desolation of the place, a little huemul buck came bounding along and \"paid the penalty,\" as the cricket reporters say. I had some trouble to keep off the condors while I went to some distance to call Barckhausen....", "...A Gentle breeze with some flying showers of rain.

In the towns a separate day and evening are set apart for the servant classes to go to the fair, and there is also a day for the _elite_. At the commencement of the reign of King William III. the whole Court, including the King and Queen, used to meet at The Hague Kermis on the Lange Voorhout on Thursday afternoons, between two and four o'clock, and walk up and down between the double row of stalls; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of that day they all visited either the most renowned circus of the season or went to see the 'Kermis stuk,' or special play acted in fan-time. The servants' evening, as it is held in Rotterdam, is the most characteristic. It is an evening shunned by the more respectable people, for the 'Kermisgangers are a very rowdy lot. They amuse themselves chiefly by running along the streets in long rows, arm-in-arm, singing 'Hossen--hossen-hossen!' They also treat each other to...", "...Sir William, and he brought a Mrs ---- to call. She very kindly asked me to go and visit her in the country about a mile. I was much obliged to her, but said I hoped to return to Brussels so soon that I should not have time. She apologised for Mr ----; he would have called on me, but the report I had brought of the marching of the troops had given him a great deal of business. The town was now very bustling, though when I arrived there was nothing but quiet. Captain Mitchell told me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that the battle had taken place; that the English had gained a victory, but he believed there was to be more fighting. He promised to send me any letter, or if he heard of Sir William. I sat up late, but none came.

I left him ostensibly alone, but in reality shadowed him. The consequence was that, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> dusk, he led me to the cemetery, where he took up his watch at Miss Cumberland's grave, as if it were a Mecca and he a passionate devotee. I could hear his groans as he hung to the fence and spoke softly to the dead; and though I was too far away to catch a single word, I felt confident that I had at last struck the right track, and should soon see my way more clearly than at any time since this baffling case opened. \"But before I allowed my fancy to run away with me,...", "...fond of dancing ... the launching of a ship, the raising of a house, the assembling of a county court, and the ordination of a minister were good occasions for dancing.\"[328] They usually danced to the tune of a fiddle but if there was no fiddle that would not keep them from it as they would dance to some one's humming the tune.

The same summer (A.D. 1026) a ship sailed from Norway to the Farey Islands, with messengers carrying a verbal message from King Olaf, that one of his court-men, Leif Ossurson, or Lagman Gille, or Thoralf of Dimun, should come over to him from the Farey Islands. Now when this message came to the Farey Islands, and was delivered to...", "...reserves that had reached the scene.

The village crumbled into a mass of debris. The principal French defense, a redoubt of concrete, was smashed, and some eighty men were buried in the ruins. A number of machine guns were also lost, and the ammunition dump was destroyed. About 5 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> a German battalion attacked Haumont, advancing in three columns. The remnant of French troops manned the trenches. The few remaining machine guns were brought into action and, being well served, wrought havoc in the enemy's ranks, but the deadly advance continued, regardless of the heavy losses incurred. The French then assembled every survivor in some trenches southeast of Haumont, and with three machine guns continued the fight. But the Germans had the advantage of...", "...holy abstraction, where were Govinda and Amra? In a spot fairer than the poet's creative pencil ever wrought into a picture for fancy to dwell on--where, at the extremity of the Brahman's garden, the broad and beautiful stream that bounded it ran swiftly to mingle its waves with those of the thrice-holy Ganges; where mangoes raised their huge twisted roots in a thousand fantastic forms, while from their boughs hung suspended the nests of the little Baya birds, which waved to and fro <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> breeze--there had Amra and Govinda met together, it might be, without design.

Her master was naturally a reserved man who seldom spoke to his servants, which rendered his behavior on this occasion the more remarkable.

Myself, I believe nothing could have been more triumphantly successful, more pregnant with great possibilities for good, than the event of that afternoon. Yet I was assured that fully two thousand five hundred more people crowded into the hall for the evening service than had been there to hear Stairs's address. And I had thought the huge place crowded in the afternoon. As before, the service began and ended with the National Anthem; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the great assembly was thrilled to its heart by the Australian _prima donna's_ splendid singing of Wordsworth's _Ode to Duty_ in the setting specially composed for this occasion by Doctor Elgar. I saw very many faces that I had seen at the first service, but I believe that there was a far greater proportion of poorer folk present than there had been in the afternoon. The President of the Congregational Union presided, and the address was delivered by Arthur...", "...ever seen London; but at that moment I was very near to the vision--the _theoria_--of London. After the astounding glimpse at the Strand we went back to the private hotel in Surrey Street and had something to eat. I am not sure, but I think the meal consisted of tea and ham and eggs, the latter beautifully poached. I know that my mind holds a recollection of this simple dish very admirably done in connection with Smith's, or whatever the place was called; and I believe it was eaten <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> of our arrival. And I may say in passing that the hotel had a pleasant, well-worn, homely look about it; very plain, but extremely comfortable. I think that my bedroom carpet was threadbare and that the bed was a feather bed; at all events one slept sublimely there under the roof, under the London stars.

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> before she found her opportunity. With the arrival of Hippy and Nora the interest soon centered about the piano. Grace, while not a performer, was an ardent lover of music, and her delight in Nora's singing was so patent that Mrs. Gray would not disturb her.

The dog-watch is the short watch between six and eight o'clock in the evening.

Vitoc is surrounded by two rivers, which unite in a sharp angle, called the Tingo, and which separate the...", "...France. Vaudreuil gave them what they hardly required--encouragement to wage war in their own way. The more brutal and ruthless the war on the English, he said, the more quickly would their enemies desire the kind of peace that France must have. The result was that the western frontiers of the English colonies became a hell of ruthless massacre. The savages attacked English settlements whenever they found them undefended. A pioneer might go forth in the morning to his labor and return <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to find his house in ashes and his wife and children lying dead with the scalps torn from their heads as trophies of savage prowess. For years, until the English gained the upper hand over the French, this awful massacre went on. Hundreds of women and children perished. Vaudreuil reported with pride to the French court the number of scalps taken, and in his annals such incidents were written down as victories, He warned Montcalm that he must not be too strict with the...", "...always shown myself for her welfare, in thus encouraging Meyler; and I went home more than usually interested about Lord Worcester; because Julia tried to make me neglect him. In this humour, I sent off a few lines to Mr. Meyler, begging to be excused from my promise of meeting him at Mrs. Johnstone's. \"All this is infinitely amiable of me,\" I reflected with much self-complacency, for I was very dull by myself, and Meyler, as to externals, was much to my taste. Julia informed me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> that Meyler had sat with her for more than two hours, hoping to see me, and had gone away much disappointed. The next day, I received a letter from him begging permission to call on me; and, as I sent no answer, he took the liberty of coming to my house without permission, and I had some difficulty, and so had my servant, in getting him out of it, and which was not till he had made every possible effort to see me, for he went upstairs and tried to open the door of my...", "...shudder! if I could only shudder!\" A carrier who was walking behind him heard these words, and asked him: \"Who are you\" \"I don't know,\" said the youth. \"Where do you hail from?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Who's your father?\" \"I mayn't say.\" \"What are you constantly muttering to yourself?\" \"Oh!\" said the youth, \"I would give worlds to shudder, but no one can teach me.\" \"Stuff and nonsense!\" spoke the carrier; \"come along with me, and I'll soon put that right.\" The youth went with the carrier, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they reached an inn, where they were to spend the night. Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again, quite aloud: \"Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!\" The landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: \"If that's what you're sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here.\" \"Oh! hold your tongue!\" said the landlord's wife; \"so many people have paid for their curiosity with their lives, it were a thousand pities if those beautiful eyes...", "...would have made, she and this Georges Fromont, whose arm was trembling beneath her own. Thereupon, when the blue-lined carriage drove up to the door of the theatre, she began to reflect, for the first time, that, when all was said, Claire had stolen her place and that she would be justified in trying to recover it. CHAPTER VIII THE BREWERY ON THE RUE BLONDEL After his marriage Risler had given up the brewery. Sidonie would have been glad to have him leave the house <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> for a fashionable club, a resort of wealthy, well-dressed men; but the idea of his returning, amid clouds of pipe-smoke, to his friends of earlier days, Sigismond, Delobelle, and her own father, humiliated her and made her unhappy. So he ceased to frequent the place; and that was something of a sacrifice. It was almost a glimpse of his native country, that brewery situated in a remote corner of Paris. The infrequent carriages, the high, barred windows of the ground...", "...it be understood that the invention--the lying invention of Sam Semple, was bearing the fruit which he most desired in the deception of the whole town. There was never, I believe, so great a deception attempted or carried into effect. Meantime, the work of the town continued as usual. The port had nothing to do with the spa. For my own part I was discharging cargo from _The Lady of Lynn_, and making ready to take in a new cargo. All day I was engaged on board: I slept on board: but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I went ashore and looked on at the preparations, and at this new world of fashion and pleasure the like of which I had never seen before. And, as usual, the ships came into port and dropped anchor off the Stath: or they cleared out and went down the river with the current and the tide. There were two kinds of life in the place when there had never before been more than one: and while the people in one part of the town had nothing to think of but amusement, those at the...", "...he had found it. Perhaps the most natural thing Myrtle Hazard could have done would have been to go crazy, and be sent to the nearest asylum, if Providence, which in its wisdom makes use of the most unexpected agencies, had not made a special provision for her mental welfare. She was in that arid household as the prophet in the land where there was no dew nor rain for these long years. But as he had the brook Cherith, and the bread and flesh in the morning and the bread and flesh <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> which the ravens brought him, so she had the river and her secret store of books. The river was light and life and music and companionship to her. She learned to row herself about upon it, to swim boldly in it, for it had sheltered nooks but a little way above The Poplars. But there was more than that in it,--it was infinitely sympathetic. A river is strangely like a human soul. It has its dark and bright days, its troubles from within, and its disturbances from...", "...for the second. If the trapper has no wooden door to his cabin, and in it--instead of caching in a tree--keeps fish or bacon that may attract marauding wolverine, he will very probably leave his dogs on guard while he makes the round of the snares. Finding tracks about the shack when he came back for his noonday meal, Koot shouted sundry instructions into the mongrel's ear, emphasized them with a moccasin kick, picked up the sack in which he carried bait, twine, and traps, and set out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to make the round of his snares, unaccompanied by the dog. Rabbit after rabbit he found, gray and white, hanging stiff and stark, dead from their own weight, strangled in the twine snares. Snares were set anew, the game strung over his shoulder, and Koot was walking through the gray gloaming for the cabin when that strange sense of _feel_ told him that he was being followed. What was it? Could it be the dog? He whistled--he called it by name. In all the world, there is...", "...Pont Saint Esprit, and thence over the mountains to Florac.\" \"That would certainly be the safest plan, always providing that we have not been watched ever since we left Paris. The vicomte might well take this precaution, in case we should deviate from the regular route.\" \"Sapriste! Desmond, you are always full of evil prognostications. Still, as usual, I cannot but allow that there is reason in them.\" \"You see, Philip, we have plenty of time, as we travel at a snail's pace, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when we stop, to think over the affair in every light. I always put myself in the position of the Vicomte de Tulle, and consider what steps I should take to ensure success in my next attempt to carry off Mademoiselle de Pointdexter.\" \"Then I am very glad that you are not in the position of de Tulle, for, if you were, I should consider that all was lost, and that there was not a chink or crevice by which we could escape. It is monstrous that a nobleman cannot travel...", "...left of this pastime, and walking in regular order two by two, with the music before them, came to Mr. Park. They played upon a flute, which they blowed obliquely over the end, and governed the holes on the sides with their fingers. Their airs were plaintive and simple. Mr. Park stopped at Sampaka for the sake of being accompanied by some of the inhabitants, who were going to Goomba; but in order to avoid the crowd of people, whom curiosity had assembled round him, he visited <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> a negro village called Samee, where he was kindly received by the dooty, who killed two fine sheep, and invited his friends to the feast. On the following day his landlord insisted on his staying till the cool of the evening, when he would conduct him to the next village. Mr. Park was now within two days journey of Goomba, and had no further apprehension of being molested by the moors. He therefore accepted the invitation, and passed the forenoon very agreeably with the...", "...only raise a storm that I could not allay; and so great would be the power of the forces they might bring to bear on the child, that her little heart might break and the saints claim her too soon.\" \"Well, then, father, come hither to me to-morrow at this same hour, if I be not too unworthy of your pastoral care.\" \"I shall be too happy, my son,\" said the monk. \"So be it.\" And he turned from the door just as the bell of the cathedral struck the Ave Maria, and all in the street bowed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> act of worship. CHAPTER XIV THE MONK'S STRUGGLE The golden sunshine of the spring morning was deadened to a sombre tone in the shadowy courts of the Capuchin convent. The reddish brown of the walls was flecked with gold and orange spots of lichen; and here and there, in crevices, tufts of grass, or even a little bunch of gold-blooming flowers, looked hardily forth into the shadowy air. A covered walk, with stone arches, inclosed a square filled with...", "...stone. In the north transept you will find a beautiful knight, the finest in chiselling of all these tombs, except one by the same hand in the south aisle just where it enters the south transept. Examine the lines of the Gothic niches traced above them; and what is left of arabesque on their armour. They are far more beautiful and tender in chivalric conception than Donatello's St. George, which is merely a piece of vigorous naturalism founded on these older tombs. If you will drive <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the Chartreuse in Val d'Ema, you may see there an uninjured example of this slab-tomb by Donatello himself; very beautiful; but not so perfect as the earlier ones on which it is founded. And you may see some fading light and shade of monastic life, among which if you stay till the fireflies come out in the twilight, and thus get to sleep when you come home, you will be better prepared for to-morrow morning's walk--if you will take another with me--than if you go to a...", "...on the other hand, you let either of the animals escape you, your last hour is come, and your head shall be stuck on the last spike of my fence. The other spikes, as you see, are already adorned, and the skulls are all those of different servants I have had who have failed to do what I demanded.' Iwanich, who thought he could not be much worse off than he was already, agreed to the witch's proposal. At daybreak next morning he drove his horses to the field, and brought them back <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> without their ever having attempted to break away from him. The witch stood at her door and received him kindly, and set a good meal before him. So it continued for some time, and all went well with the Prince. Early every morning he led the horses out to the fields, and brought them home safe and sound in the evening. One day, while he was watching the horses, he came to the banks of a river, and saw a big fish, which through some mischance had been cast on the...", "...hand is stretched out! And this young Joseph is at his knee the better to interpret his character to the beholder. Moses and Aaron in the chief room of a Roman senator, and he, a Piso! Now, Isaac, thou mayest tie on thy pack, and take thy leave with a merry heart, for God, if never before, now accepteth thy works.' And much more, noble sir, in the same raving way, which was more dark to my understanding than the darkest pages of Aristotle.' I gathered from Solon, that he would return <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> in the hope to see me, for he had that to impart which concerned nearly my welfare. I was watching with Julia, from the portico which fronts the Esquiline and overlooks the city, the last rays of the declining sun, as they gilded the roofs and domes of the vast sea of building before us, lingering last upon, and turning to gold the brazen statues of Antonine and of Trajan, when Milo approached us, saying that Isaac had returned. He was in a moment more with us....", "...every morning, and after luncheon Mr. Grey's carriage was at her service if she chose to drive out. She was quite a little Queen in the house; she had only to express a wish, and it was fulfilled. She had a very skillful maid entirely for herself, her dressing-room was fitted up in a style of elegance that might have served a duchess; in short, her uncle did not quite know, as Mr. Casement told him, how to spoil her enough. It may be supposed that she became exceedingly attached to him, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> she sang to him, or sat on a low stool by his side, telling him all the little pieces of news she might have heard during the day, or relating with equal interest the historic tales that she was reading, or exciting his sympathy, by a detail of the uncomfortable period she had passed at school. It happened one morning that Margaret walked down to the Vicarage with Land to exchange a volume of history she had borrowed, and when she was shown into Mr. Warde's morning...", "...a number of songs--such as Mr. Wise's \"It is not that I love you less\" and his duet \"Go, perjured man!\" of which the words are taken from Herrick's \"Hesperides,\" and of which the music was made by Mr. Wise (who was a gentleman of the Chapel Royal) at His Majesty's express wish. * * * * * I have many very pleasant memories of Hare Street, but I think none more pleasant than of the music in the Great Chamber. I would sit near the window, and see them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> light, with their faces turned to me; or, when it grew late with the candlelight upon them and their dresses or sometimes when the evening was fair and warm I would sit out upon the lawn, and they at the window, and listen to the singing coming out of the candlelight, and see them move against it. My Cousin Dorothy would make herself fine in the evening--not, I mean, like a Court lady, for these dresses of hers were put away in lavender--but with a lace neckerchief on...", "...he could not close his eyes for a moment. Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dantes ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa to starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots. About five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the island was distinct, and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting. Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist passed over his eyes. Never did a gamester, whose whole fortune is staked...", "...nearer; as the composer sang her songs attitudes grew more abandoned, and hands fell pensively. Among the half-seen faces I caught sight of a woman of exceeding fairness; her hair had only a faint tinge of gold in it; and Ninon remembered that she was a cousin of hers, one whom she had not seen for many years. How Clare had discovered her in the Rue la Moine she could not tell. It was whispered that she was the wife of a rich _commercant_ at Tours. This added to the mystery, and later <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the lady told me she had never been in artistic society before, and begged me to point out to her the celebrities present, and to tell her why they were celebrated. \"Who is he--that one slouching towards the pond, that one wearing grey trousers and a black jacket?--oh!\" My companion's exclamation was caused by a new sight of Verlaine; at that moment he had lifted off his hat (the evening was still warm), and the great bald skull, hanging like a cliff over the...", "...take such a course as this to serve ourselves in wronging the King by putting him into a place he is no wise capable of, and that in an Admiral ship. At noon we rose, Sir W.

He found his father at breakfast with the tutor's letter before him. \"Do you know anything about this?\" asked the Duke very calmly. \"Gerald ran up to see the Derby, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> missed the train.\" \"Mr. Harnage tells me that he had been expressly ordered not to go to these races.\" \"I suppose he was, sir.\" Then there was silence between them for some minutes. \"You might as well sit down and eat your breakfast,\" said the father. Then Lord Silverbridge did sit down and poured himself out a cup of tea. There was no servant in the room, and he dreaded to ring the bell. \"Is there anything you want?\" asked the Duke. There was a small dish of...", "...which he promised to read. He introduced me to a Jesuit he had in his household, who was called Adam, and he added, after telling me his name, \"not the first Adam.\" I was told afterwards that Voltaire used to play backgammon with him, and when he lost he would throw the dice and the box at his head.

The improvement lasted but a few minutes. In the course of the day he was given some English powders, which lent him a feverish strength, so that at six in the evening he asked for some cards and pictures to play with, but the fever only gave way to his death agony.

When he arrived, he hastily donned a dressing-gown, and, calling his man, ordered a fire to be lit. A disturbed mind frequently desires the solace of a fire, and Raife's mind was perturbed with a sense of foreboding. A box of...", "...again. Madge nodded. \"Oh, yes,\" she explained. \"We could not very well have come on such a journey without it. Miss Jenny Ann knew that I carried it.\" For twenty-four hours, at odd intervals of time, Miss Jenny Ann, Lillian and Eleanor had walked up and down in front of their lodge, hoping and praying for the return of the wanderers. What did it matter if they stayed all the rest of their lives on the deserted island, if only Madge and Phyllis were with them! About eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Miss Jenny Ann, who was patroling the woods near by, heard a faint halloo. A few minutes later two homesick and footsore girls stumbled into her arms. CHAPTER XVII CAN WE GO TO THE RESCUE? Several days had passed since Madge and Phil had returned. A big fire roared up the chimney. Madge lay on a blanket spread over some hemlock boughs in one corner of the room. Phil sat near her, feeding the fawn from a cup with a spoon. Miss Jenny Ann had an open book...", "...We, therefore, retraced our course, though with much reluctance, to Foggy Island, which the men declared to be an enchanted island. Though our wanderings this day did not exceed seven miles, the crews were employed upwards of two hours in dragging the boats through the mud, when the temperature of the water was at 40 degrees, and that of the air 41 degrees. They endured this fatigue with the greatest cheerfulness, though it was evident they suffered very much from the cold; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we witnessed the ill effects of this kind of labour by finding their legs much swelled and inflamed. The fear of their becoming ill from a frequent repetition of such operations made me resolve not to attempt the passage of these flats again till the weather should be so clear that we might ascertain their extent, and see in what way they might be passed with less risk. Fog is, of all others, the most hazardous state of the atmosphere for navigation in an icy sea,...", "...she had just drawn the glove. It is hardly necessary to say, that Adrienne's letter had not been delivered to the prince, and that he had not gone to pass the day in the country with Marshal Simon. During the three days in which Montbron had not seen Djalma, Faringhea had persuaded him, that, by affecting another passion, he would bring Mdlle. de Cardoville to terms. With regard to Djalma's presence at the theatre, Rodin had learned from her maid, Florine, that her mistress was to go <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to the Porte-Saint Martin. Before Djalma had recognized her, Adrienne, who felt her strength failing her, was on the point of quitting the theatre; the man, whom she had hitherto placed so high, whom she had regarded as a hero and a demi-god and whom she had imagined plunged in such dreadful despair, that, led by the most tender pity, she had written to him with simple frankness, that a sweet hope might calm his grief--replied to a generous mark of sincerity and love, by...", "...joy he had a long sound sleep. Cherry made up her mind she would try it again another day. Then Meg begged a bowl without a handle, which her mother-in-law had done with as useless for washing; this she carried round to Cherry and taught her to wash over her floor, so that if the old boards might not look white, they would at least be fresh. And once Meg put on her oldest dress and scrubbed the room from end to end. She also took home the old shawl one hot August day and returned it <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> clean and sweet. She was rewarded, if reward she needed, by Cherry's brightened face, and by Dickie's creeping off his mattress and up into her arms, where he would lie peacefully while she told him story after story of the little lamb who was lost on the mountains, and was sought by the Good Shepherd, until He carried it home rejoicing. By-and-by Dickie began to run about the bare room with fresh energy; but as he began to revive, so Cherry seemed to get despondent....", "...crimes, an ardent apostolate of abstract ideals, had for him a vivid fascination. A gentle critic of Robespierre, he could see in the execution of Marie Antoinette traces of discriminating statesmanship. Entering on political work with such dispositions, he was early attracted to the seething cauldron of Mr. Gladstone's Irish policy. Having satisfied himself that Ireland was in a state of revolution, he regarded murder and robbery as necessary incidents. When an unfortunate lady driving <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> along a country road was shot dead beside her husband, whose only offence was that of being a landlord, the public were lectured for the inconsequence of their indignation. On the Dublin conspirators, who were watching to murder Mr. Forster, were not lost the lessons which Mr. Morley had been preaching on the vileness of the permanent officials at the Castle. They determined to murder Mr. Burke, and in killing him slew his companion also; and Mr. Morley deprecatingly...", "...Perhaps presenting Alfonso with a gift suggestive of the Magdalene was an intentional bit of irony on the part of the French king. In addition to this he received a written description of a process for casting cannon. A golden shield was likewise presented to Don Ferrante. Lucretia's gift was a string of gold beads filled with musk, while her charming maid of honor, Angela, was honored with a costly chain. Everything was done to flatter the French ambassador. He was invited to dinner <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> by the Marchioness of Mantua, and was placed between his hostess and the Duchess of Urbino. The evening was passed, according to Gagnolo, in gallant and cultivated conversation. On leaving the table the marchioness sang the most beautiful songs to the accompaniment of the lute, for the entertainment of the French ambassador. After this she conducted him to her chamber, where, in the presence of two of her ladies-in-waiting, they held an animated conversation for almost...", "...Tuesday 6. This morning at sunrise I left the hotel and was carried to Mr. Sparling's house, about four miles distant from the city and near the convalescent hospital which at this time had also sick men in it, the whole number of patients amounting to 800. I found everything prepared for my comfort and convenience. Mr. Sparling would suffer me to take no medicine though I had still considerable fever with headache: but I found so much relief from the difference of the air that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> I was able to accompany Mr. Sparling on a visit to the governor-general at one of his country seats, where we found many ladies all dressed in the Malay fashion, some of them richly ornamented with jewels. I had invitations from several gentlemen and some very kindly pressed me to make their country houses my abode till my health should be reestablished. My indisposition increasing, Mr. Sparling advised me to quit Batavia as speedily as possible and represented the...", "...Grace, give him some temporary encouragement, even though it is over-early. For when I consider the past I do think God will forgive me and you for being a little forward. I have another reason for this, my dear.

They were harvesting this as we passed, carting it to the yourts in a rough sort of wooden cart, and stacking it up. This seems to show that the Mongols are not naturally averse to cultivation, when they are favourably circumstanced for carrying it out. Some of their tribes, such as those in Western Toumet, mentioned by Huc, do indeed systematically cultivate the ground. The sun had set before we got to the end of the valley, and we encamped <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> not far from the left bank of the Khara-gol, sending out the lama with a native of the district to survey a crossing for the morning. Early on the 26th we advanced to the river at a place higher up than the usual ford. Carts were unloaded, and the passage effected in the same way as the Tolla, but, the river being much smaller, less time was lost in the operation. There is always a busy scene at these fords, particularly when a drove of cattle have to be got over. One...", "...am I not thy mother, is not thy elder brother to thee as a father?' And he feared, and he beat me to stop me from making report to thee, and if thou lettest him live I shall die.

Now the sun went down, and he loaded himself with herbs in his daily manner. He came, and his foremost cow entered the stable, and she said to her keeper, \"Behold thou thy elder brother standing before thee with his knife to slay thee; flee from before him.\" He heard what his first cow had said; and the next entering, she also said likewise. He looked beneath the door of the stable; he saw the feet of his elder brother; he was...", "...he had thus proved to be of excellent quality.\" This story he told really well. Had Caterna heard it, he would have asked for a Turkestan opera on the subject. The day passed without incident. The train kept on at its moderate speed of forty kilometres an hour, an average that would have been raised to eighty had they listened to Baron Weissschnitzerdoerfer.

As a result the stars appear to shift westward 15 deg. every hour. This is a distance about equal in length to the handle of the Big Dipper, which I am sure we all know, even if we do not know another constellation in the heavens. If, then, we look at the heavens at a later hour than that for which the constellations are given we will find them farther westward and if our time of observation is earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> than the hour mentioned we will find them farther eastward. In the course of a year the earth makes one trip around the sun and faces in turn all parts of the heavens. That is, it turns through an angle of 360 deg. with respect to the heavens in a year or through an angle of 360 deg. / 12 or 30 deg. in one month. So as a result of our revolution around the sun, which is also in a west to east direction, we see that all the constellations are gradually shifting westward...", "...pony.

He did not take the time for reflection which might have been felt necessary by many men in preparation for the interview with May Calthorpe which must come before bedtime. Indeed he was more than usually lively and busy, and as he had a playful wit, he had some difficulty in getting the men at the club to let him go when soon after eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> he set out for May's. He had kept busy from the moment his mother had left him in the morning, and on his way along Beacon street, he hummed to himself as if still resolved to do anything rather than to meditate.

A check was placed upon this habit by imposing a tax of 5_s._ on every gallon of gin. This was in the year 1735 and in 1750 about 1,700 gin shops were closed. Since then the continual efforts made to stop the pernicious habit of dram drinking have greatly reduced the evil. But it was not only the drinking of gin: there was also the rum punch which formed so large a part in the life of the Georgian citizen. Every man had his club to which he resorted <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> after the day's work. Here he sat and for the most part drank what he called a sober glass: that is to say, he did not go home drunk, but he drank every night more than was good for him. The results were the transmission of gout and other disorders to his children. It should be, indeed, a most serious thing to reflect that in every evil habit we are bringing misery and suffering upon our children as well as ourselves.

About the center of the open space was a large box-stove, which in winter was kept full of wood, ofttimes getting red-hot, and around this sat the villagers.

Oscar felt above him, and did not deign to hold any intercourse with his father's drudge, while the housekeeper--Major Norton being a widower--was busy about her own special work, and would have wondered at Joe if he had sought her company. I make this explanation because I do not wish it to be understood that Joe was a common village lounger, or loafer. When Joe entered the store...", "...Lorraine, is so near Metz, the great German fortress town of German Lorraine, that excursion trains used to run to Nancy in the opera season. \"They are not running this winter,\" say the wits of Nancy. \"For one reason, we have no opera--and there are other reasons.\" An aeroplane from the German lines has only to toss a bomb in the course of an average reconnaissance on Nancy if it chooses; for Zeppelins are within easy reach of Nancy. But here was Nancy as brilliantly lighted at nine <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> as any city of its size at home. Our train, too, had run with the windows unshaded. After the darkness of London, and after English trains with every window- shade closely drawn, this was a surprise. It was a threat, an anticipation, that darkened London, while Nancy knew fulfilment. Bombardment and bomb-dropping were nothing new to Nancy.

Then he started. \"Look!\" he cried. \"Look behind you, my lord!\" Lord Harry turned. The second man was upon him. He bent forward and peered in his face. \"Arthur Mountjoy's murderer!\" he cried, and sprang at his throat. One, two, three shots rang out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> air. Those who heard them in the roadside cabin, at the railway-station on the road, shuddered. They knew the meaning of those shots. One more murder to load the soul of Ireland.

We have been reading or writing official papers all day, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> we like to have a little relaxation. When we come together we have very little to talk about, for we have all read the daily papers and nothing more.

It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when we reached Picolata; and with a good deal of uproar, men shouting, steam puffing, and half a dozen blacks gesticulating on shore, we each made a fortunate leap to the dock; and walking up to the camp in a blaze of pitch-pine, we ordered our horses, and at eleven o'clock entered the pine woods for St. Augustine.

Meanwhile Jack, in his little district, had become convinced that the defence could not be maintained for many more days. But he was determined to hold his own to the very end. After his explosion beyond the Casa Vallejo there had been a prolonged silence on the French side, but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> renewed sounds of mining in two quarters showed that though two of the four French galleries had been injured, the other two were still workable. It was only a matter of hours before the wall must fall. All that Jack could do was to ensure that the house should be held as long as possible after the explosion of the French mines, and that this should cause his men the minimum of loss. During the night of the 8th he built a fresh barricade between Vallejo and Tobar, some...", "...three-barred autoharp was to be mine.

From here he paid a visit to Berlin, where he was shown the opera house.\"[52] A newspaper account of the visit to Frederick varies in several details from the above; but as the account of the son, who was with Bach, and perhaps an eye-witness, is the more trustworthy, we have not thought it necessary to trouble our reader with the second account.[53] [Sidenote: _Last Illness_] In the following year the enormous strain he had all his life...", "...run away with it; and little he knew what she was to suffer for him!

The other was \"Saint Patrick, the Apostle of Ireland,\" by William Bullen Morris, Priest of the Oratory. They were both green-covered. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> Mr. Martin settled down by his study fire to his new purchases. First he took up the \"Life and Legends.\" He read the saint's own Confession, and the Letter to Co-roticus, and looked through the translation of the Tripartite Life, with its queer mixture of Latin and English: \"Prima feria venit Patricius ad Talleriam, where the regal assembly was, to Cairpre, the son of Niall.\" \"Interrogat autem Patricius qua causa venit Conall, and Conall related the reason to Patrick.\"...", "...gladiator facing his martyrdom, and all the rest of the obscure yet vivid associations of an historic survival, had carried me beyond the endurance of any of the rest of the party.

The last notion which Rainham took away with him, when they parted late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> (Oswyn having suddenly lapsed from the eloquence to the incoherency of drunkenness), was a wish to see more of him.

The parallelism between this custom of \"hunting the wren\" and some of those which we have considered, especially the Gilyak procession with the bear, and the Indian one with the snake, seems too close to allow us to doubt that they all belong to the same circle of ideas.

Arriving <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> at Kiomitis, I saw the sun set apparently on the summit of a high mountain called Harrevarto, situated over against the house of the parish clerk. This spectacle I considered as not one of the least of Nature's miracles, for what inhabitant of other countries would not wish to behold it? O Lord, how wonderful are thy works! _July 2._ At Kiomitis I rested during the whole of this day, Sunday. Here the beautiful corn was growing in great perfection in valleys...", "...Spohr. Ottetto Spohr. Double Quartet No. 3 Spohr. To commence at 2 o'clock--Dejeuneur at 5-- Second act to commence at 7. This festival, which was in every respect successful, and got up with princely magnificence, must have been the more gratifying to _Spohr_, when he saw how the company, consisting of fifty persons, listened until late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with admirable perseverance and wrapped attention to his tones, without evincing the least sign of weariness. When gratified beyond measure by a festive testimonial so unusual, he felt called upon to express his very great thanks to Mr. _Alsager_, he found to his great surprise on the following day among the mass of letters which he constantly received, one also from him expressing his heartfelt thanks, which concluded as follows: \"May you enjoy all the happiness that...", "...young neophyte. I was nearly bursting into a loud laugh, when I heard M. Dandolo remark that, unless we hurried, we would not have time to hear mass, whereupon Bavois enquired whether it was a festival. M. Dandolo, without passing any remark, answered negatively, and after that, mass was not again mentioned. When Bavois was ready, I left them and went a different way. I met them again at dinner-time, during which the reception given to the young baron by the secretary was discussed, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> my friends introduced him to several ladies who were much pleased with him. In less than a week he was so well known that there was no fear of his time hanging wearily on his hands, but that week was likewise enough to give me a perfect insight into his nature and way of thinking. I should not have required such a long study, if I had not at first begun on a wrong scent, or rather if my intelligence had not been stultified by my fanaticism. Bavois was particularly fond...", "...man who bled for his country. This is gratitude, this is.\" Albert pulled heavily on his pipe, and wiped the rain and spray from his face and smiled. \"Oh, it won't be so bad when we get there,\" he said; \"they say these Southern people are always hospitable, and the whites will be glad to see anyone from the States.\" \"There will be a round of diplomatic dinners,\" said the consul, with an attempt at cheerfulness. \"I have brought two uniforms to wear at them.\" It was seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> when the rain ceased, and one of the black, half-naked fishermen nodded and pointed at a little low line on the horizon. \"Opeki,\" he said. The line grew in length until it proved to be an island with great mountains rising to the clouds, and, as they drew nearer and nearer, showed a level coast running back to the foot of the mountains and covered with a forest of palms. They next made out a village of thatched huts around a grassy square, and at some distance from...", "...of stealthy footsteps near them. It is an eeriesome place this to spend even half-an-hour in after nightfall, but their only chance of safety lies in remaining perfectly still, perfectly mute. At long last light shimmers in through the leafy canopy above them, they know the moon has arisen, and it is time to be going. Once more they are embarked, and once more stealing silently up the unknown river. As the night advances, they are less cautious and talk more freely. Earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> they had heard the beating of the warlike tom-tom and the shouts of savage sentries, but now these are hushed and the beasts and birds of the night alone are left to rend the ear with their wild cries. Hiding by day, and journeying silently onward and upward by night, our heroes are in less than a week far past the country of the dreaded Logobo men. Not that their dangers are over by any means, nor their trials. There are dangers from beasts, from lion or leopard,...", "...of the beautiful Christian doctrine of self-sacrifice. When he finished, Mrs. Lucy Coleman, always keen in pricking bubbles, arose and said: \"Well, Mr. Douglass, all you say may be true; but allow me to ask you why you did not remain a slave in Maryland, and sacrifice yourself, like a Christian, to your master, instead of running off to Canada to secure your liberty, like a man? We shall judge your faith, Frederick, by your deeds.\" An immense audience assembled at Corinthian Hall <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> to listen to the closing speeches[43] of the convention. Mrs. Robinson of Boston gave an exhaustive review of the work in Massachusetts, and her daughter, Mrs. Shattuck, gave many amusing experiences as her father's[44] clerk in the legislature of that State. The resolutions provoked many attacks from the clergy throughout the State, led by Rev. A.H. Strong, D.D., president of the Baptist Theological Seminary in Rochester, Of his sermon the _National Citizen_...", "...the first railway was constructed up in the North the Okebourne folk, like the rest of the world, were with good reason extremely curious about this wonderful invention, and questioned every passer-by eagerly for information. But no one could describe it, till at last a man, born in the village, but who had been away for some years soldiering, returned to his native place. He had been serving in Canada and came through Liverpool, and thus saw the marvel of the age. At the Sun the folk <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> crowded round him, and insisted upon knowing what a steam-engine was like. He did his best to describe it, but in vain; they wanted a familiar illustration, and could not be satisfied till the soldier, by a happy inspiration, said the only thing to which he could compare a locomotive was a great cannon on a timber-carriage. To us who are so accustomed to railways it seems a singular idea; but, upon reflection, it was not so inapt, considering that the audience had seen...", "...of Boswell_, p. 295. [777] This part of this letter was written, as Johnson goes on to say, a considerable time before the conclusion. The Coalition Ministry, which was suddenly dismissed by the King on Dec. 19, was therefore still in power. Among Boswell's 'friends' was Burke. See _ante_, p. 223. [778] On Nov. 22 he wrote to Dr. Taylor:-'I feel the weight of solitude very pressing; after a night of broken and uncomfortable slumber I rise to a solitary breakfast, and sit down <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> with no companion. Sometimes, however, I try to read more and more.' _Notes and Queries_, 6th S. v. 482. On Dec. 27 he wrote to Mrs. Thrale:--'You have more than once wondered at my complaint of solitude, when you hear that I am crowded with visits. _Inopem me copia fecit_. Visitors are no proper companions in the chamber of sickness. They come when I could sleep or read, they stay till I am weary.... The amusements and consolations of langour and depression are...", "...but rather that here is the consummate workman who, gladly recognising the measure of his freedom within the four walls of his limitations, illustrates for you that fine old statement, \"Whose service is perfect freedom.\" _C. W. Furse._ CCXXI ON GAINSBOROUGH We must not forget, whilst we are on this subject, to make some remarks on his custom of painting by night, which confirms what I have already mentioned,--his great affection to his art; since he could not amuse himself <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> by any other means so agreeable to himself. I am indeed much inclined to believe that it is a practice very advantageous and improving to an artist: for by this means he will acquire a new and a higher perception of what is great and beautiful in nature. By candlelight not only objects appear more beautiful, but from their being in a greater breadth of light and shadow, as well as having a greater breadth and uniformity of colour, nature appears in a higher style; and...", "...buys all Nicholas's things, and keeps a lodging-house in the Passage de la Brasserie?\" \"A fat cripple?\" \"Why, yes, who came here the end of last autumn from Father Micou, with a man who had monkeys and two women.\" \"Ah, yes, a stout, lame man, who spent such a deal of money.\" \"I believe you; he paid for everybody. Don't you recollect the rows on the water when I pulled them, and the man with the monkeys brought his organ, that they might have music in the boat?\" \"Yes; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the evening</span> the beautiful fireworks they let off, Francois?\" \"And the fat cripple was not stingy, either. He gave me ten sous for myself. He drank nothing but our best wine, and they had chickens at every meal. He spent full eighty francs.\" \"So much as that, Francois?\" \"Oh, yes!\" \"How rich he must be!\" \"Not at all. What he spent was money he had gained in prison, from which he had just come.\" \"Gained all that money in prison?\" \"Yes; he said he had seven hundred..."]
