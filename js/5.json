The first or pre-fermentation period is that when the yeast mixed into the mash is growing; the temperature should then be kept at about 63 to 68 deg. F. during which time the yeast is propagated. The growth of the yeast is manifested by the development of carbonic acid gas and by a slight motion of the mash. When alcohol is produced to an extent of say <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> per cent. the growth of the yeast stops. The second period of chief fermentation then begins. Carbonic acid is freely developed and the sugar is converted into alcohol. The temperature at this time should not exceed 81.5 deg. F. The second period of fermentation continues about 12 hours, when the last period commences. During the third period or after fermentation there is a lessening of the formation of carbonic acid and a lowering of the temperature. In this stage the mash...", "...the jackal, to scour the country. Driven to bay, they turn upon the assailant and fight desperately.

This was the stipulation between Gilbert and himself. The book-keeper had not promised any definite sum, but Micky, in speculating upon the proper compensation for his service, fixed upon <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> dollars as about what he ought to receive.

In the reckless pride and unbridled passions of military despotism, he disdained to temporize, or endeavour to sooth the irritated feelings of the people, or to conciliate their confidence, or calm their fears. He had been accustomed to rely upon no power but that of the sword, and to respect no authority but a military commission. To him the _law_ was a subject of scorn, and the civil rights of citizens or subjects an idle tale. He looked upon his <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand troops, with their arms and ammunition, and he saw there the only power be respected, or would condescend to use to maintain his government. Such principles led or drove him to a course of desperate violence, having then no parallel in any country pretending to a government of laws, or any civil rights.

She opened her bag slowly, in spite of the terrified and ever-louder protestations of the doctor, and took from it a slender gold necklace set simply with seven pearls in front; but the pearls were of wonderful brilliancy--flawless, and perfect in shape.

Philological conjecture may assure us that Helen, like most of the characters of old romance, is \"merely the Dawn,\" or Light, or some other bright being carried away by Paris, who represents Night, or Winter, or the Cloud, or some other power of darkness. Without discussing these ideas, it may be said that the Greek poets (at all events before allegorical explanations of mythology came in, about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred years before Christ) regarded Helen simply as a woman of wonderful beauty. Homer was not thinking of the Dawn, or the Cloud when he described Helen among the Elders on the Ilian walls, or repeated her lament over the dead body of Hector. The Homeric poems are our oldest literary documents about Helen, but it is probable enough that the poet has modified and purified more ancient traditions which still survive in various fragments of Greek legend. In Homer Helen is...", "...of Mr Estcourt, who put letter after letter into the hands of Timothy, who of course put them into the usual place.

You may go now, thought I, I feel quite safe. It was about five days after his departure, as I was sauntering, arm in arm with the Major, who generally dined with me about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> days in the week, that I perceived the carriage of Lord Windermear, with his lordship in it. He saw us, and pulling his check-string, alighted, and coming up to us, with the colour mounting to his forehead with emotion, returned the salute of the Major and me. \"Major,\" said he, \"you will excuse me, but I am anxious to have some conversation with Mr Newland; perhaps,\" continued his lordship, addressing me, \"you will do me the favour to take a seat in my carriage?\" Fully...", "...voice could be heard, showing that he was even then advancing toward the open door. \"I guess I ought to be back again inside an hour, Kimball; an' if so be you kin wait thet long, p'raps Dick, he mout be in trim to tell you what to do 'bout thet leg o' yourn.

Half a century later there was a railroad in operation near the river Tyne which has been described by Roger North as being made of \"rails of timber placed end to end and exactly straight, and in two parallel lines to each other. On these rails bulky cars were made to run on four rollers fitting the rails, whereby the carriage was made so easy that one horse would draw four or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> chaldrons of coal to a load.\" At this time the use of iron rails had not been thought of, or at least had not been tried, probably from the fact that iron was then very expensive. Even the wooden rails in use, and the wheels that ran upon them, were of no fixed pattern. Some of these rails were in the form of depressed grooves into which an ordinary wheel fitted. But these were very unsatisfactory because they became filled so easily with dirt and other obstructions, and a more...", "...fond of Yun-men and suggests he may have had the keenest intellect of any Ch'an master--and even goes so far as to declare him the greatest man China has produced.21 At the very least Yun-men was in the great tradition of the iconoclastic T'ang masters, with a touch that bears comparison to Huang-po. And he probably was wise in attempting to stop copyists, for his teachings eventually were reduced to yet another abominable system, as seemed irresistible to the Chinese followers of the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> houses. A later disciple produced what is known as the \"Three propositions of the house of Yun-men.\" It is not difficult to imagine the barnyard response Yun-men would have had to this \"systematization\" of his thought.22 The school of this \"most eloquent of Ch'an masters\" lasted through the Sung dynasty, but its failure to find a transplant in Japan eventually meant that history would pass it by.

And at tea, tired physically and mentally after breathing the exhausted air of the Rotunda for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hours, my mind suddenly delivered up its original impression, vivid and clear-cut; no proof accompanied the revelation; it was mere presentiment, but convincing.

He helped them both to mount, arranged their dresses with great care and then left them. \"So we are not to have the honour of your company,\" Harriet called after him. He replied by a shake of the head, and went into the house. They paid their visit. Mrs. Vesey was a young married woman, with four or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> small children, who very much occupied her time and thoughts. The conversation was chiefly made up of things which Johnny and Matilda had said; of the quarrel which Harry had with the nurse, and the beautiful cake which uncle Richard had sent to Mary on her birthday. Then the children were produced, in velvet frocks, and long trained ringlets of white hair, and these having been kissed and praised enough, the two friends took their leave. \"Ah, that is over!\" said Harriet, when...", "...yellow water, running like a tail race between the lodging rooms and the little eating house. \"My Lord!\" groaned Huldah. \"I might 'a' knowed 'twa'n't engines.

The red gash which through nine-tenths of the year lay dry and yawning beside the tracks of the little Magdalena Branch railway was brimmed with the same tide which swept the street. And down it, as they looked, came a wall of writhing, tormented water, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> feet high. There had been a cloudburst in the mountains above, whence came such trickle as fed the arroyo in the dry season. Twice before had this thing happened, and the little eating house stood upon stilts of cottonwood logs to be above the flood line, while the lodging house was on higher ground.

It came from the sea, and going to the door they saw the schooner's two whaleboats, packed as full of natives as they could carry, close in to the shore. Instead of oars they were propelled by canoe paddles, and at each stroke the native rowers fairly made the boats leap and surge like steam launches in a sea-way. But the most noticeable thing to the eyes of the traders was the glitter of rifle barrels that appeared between the double row of paddlers. In another <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes the leading boat was close enough for the traders to see that the paddlers who lined the gunwales from stem to stern had their faces daubed with red and blue, and their fighting ornaments on. In the body of the boats, crouching on their hams, with elbows on knees, and upright rifles, were the others, packed as tightly as sardines. \"Mein Gott!\" gasped Muller, \"they have killed all hands on the schooner and are coming for us.

Poor Luther was never tempted to put on airs; he was too hard-worked and too anxious about his prospects. He and Alice were to get married when he and the _Globe_ were out of debt; for his father had left him a mortgage on the office building, as well as an unpaid-for press. When Luther was particularly low-spirited, he used to tell Alice it would take him <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years to pay his debts; and, to tell the truth, that was an optimistic estimate, for the _Globe_ and the printing-office together did very little more than pay the interest on the notes and Luther's board.

In another <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes she could reach that deserted shed in the lane behind Gypsy Nan's house where her own clothes were hidden, and it would take her but a very few minutes more to effect the transformation from Gypsy Nan to the White Moll.

He felt the benefit next springtime. This second little run out is not worth describing; we sighted Bowers's party coming back with the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> ponies whilst we were camped one night, and we noted that they were travelling very quickly, which proved all was well with these animals. On arrival at Corner Camp Scott left us in order to get back and see the five ponies safely conducted to Hut Point.

We saw veiled women and semi-veiled children everywhere, thickly latticed windows with curious eyes peeping through, and yards with high wooden palings above to prevent the possible young men on the houses opposite from catching a glimpse of the fair ladies in the gardens. Plenty of long-legged Montenegrin officers--with flat caps bearing the King's initials, and <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> rings representing the dynasties of the ruling house--filled the streets, and also the inevitable ragged soldiers with gorgeous bags on their backs. Some of the women, too, were wearing these caps, but theirs were yet smaller and tipped over their noses, like the pork pie hat of our grandmothers. One closely veiled woman showed the silhouette sticking up through her veil just like a blacking tin.

Colonel Bartlemy could speak French after a fashion, and so could his excellent wife. Between them they entertained the wanderers hospitably for the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> days, at the end of which the Dutchman went his way before a clear north wind, and in charge of an Island pilot. But before departing he presented his hosts--it was all that either he could give or they would permit themselves to accept--with a quantity of remarkably fine bulbs from his cargo. Now, possibly, being a Dutchman, he took it for granted that anyone could recognise these bulbs for what they were. But Mrs. Bartlemy did not; for she had spent the most of her life in...", "...I do not think Mademoiselle Duval would have thus compromised her honour and sacrificed her future.

There is an impression, derived from the experience of passengers on board ocean steamers, that naval officers have an abundance of spare time. The ship, it seems assumed, runs itself; the officers have only to look on and enjoy. As a matter of fact, sea officers under normal conditions are as busy as the busiest house-keeper, with the care to boot of two, three, four, or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred children, to be kept continually doing as they should; the old woman who lived in the shoe had a good thing in comparison. Thus occupied, the leisure habit of self-improvement, other than in the practice of the calling, is not formed.

Alarmed at this indication of gratitude his friends immediately told him that that would never do; that all hands would be betrayed; that he was far from being safe in Philadelphia. He suppressed his emotion. After being delivered into the hands of the Acting Committee, where he was in more private quarters, he gave full vent to the joy he experienced on reaching this city. He said that he had been trying earnestly for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years to obtain his freedom. For this special object he had saved up sixty-eight dollars and fifteen cents, all of which but the fifteen cents he willingly paid for his passage on the boat.

A price varying from <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> to twenty rupees is usually paid to the bride's parents, or in lieu of this the prospective husband serves his father-in-law for a period of about two years, the marriage being celebrated after the first year if his conduct is satisfactory.

The poems of this early date were composed of a first line of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> syllables, followed by a second of seven, followed by a third of five, and so on, always ending with a line of seven syllables followed by another of equal number. Thus the whole poem, of whatever length (a poem of as many as forty-nine lines was scarce, even at that day) always was composed of an odd number of lines, alternating in length of syllables from five to seven, until the close, which was an extra seven syllable line. Other rules there were none.

I remember her, as a pale, gentle being, with a sweet smile, and a voice soft and cheerful when she praised me; and when I had erred, (for I was a wild, thoughtless child,) there was a mild and tender earnestness in her reproofs, that always went to my little heart. 2. Methinks I can now see her large, blue eyes moist with sorrow, because...", "...them. Attached to John Carver's certificate of the particulars of this will, filed at Somerset House, London, are the names, \"Giles Heale\" and \"Christopher Joanes.\" As Mr Mullens died Wednesday, February 21, 1620, on board the MAY-FLOWER in Plymouth harbor, on which day we know from Bradford' that \"the Master [Jones, whose name was Thomas] came on shore with many of his sailors,\" to land and mount the cannon on the fort, and as they had a full day's work to draw up the hill and mount <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> guns, and moreover brought the materials for, and stayed to eat, a considerable dinner with the Pilgrims, they were doubtless ashore all day. It is rational to interpret the known facts to indicate that in this absence of the Captain and most of his crew ashore, Mr. Mullens, finding himself failing fast, sent for Governor Carver and--unable to do more than speak --dictated to him the disposition of his property which he desired to make. Carver, noting this down from his...", "...worker, equally careful, intelligent, and willing to do anything honest and reputable for a living, finds no such chances proffered her. No agent meets her on the dock to persuade her to accept a passage to Illinois or Upper Canada, there to be employed on fair work at a dollar per day and expectations. On the contrary, she may think herself fortunate if a week's search opens to her a place where by the devotion of all her waking hours she can earn <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> to six dollars per month, with a chance of its increase, after several years' faithful service, to seven or eight dollars at most.

When they reached the station the sun was already low over the steppe. They said nothing all the way from the station to the farm: the jolting prevented conversation. The trap bounded up and down, squeaked, and seemed to be sobbing, and the lawyer, who was sitting very uncomfortably, stared before him, miserably hoping to see the farm. After they had driven <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> or six miles there came into view in the distance a low-pitched house and a yard enclosed by a fence made of dark, flat stones standing on end; the roof was green, the stucco was peeling off, and the windows were little narrow slits like screwed-up eyes. The farm stood in the full sunshine, and there was no sign either of water or trees anywhere round. Among the neighbouring landowners and the peasants it was known as the Petchenyegs' farm. Many years before, a land surveyor, who...", "...on his face with a happy smile.

Phillip had been <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> weeks in his new home: in another week, he was to enter on his articles of apprenticeship. With a stern, unbending gloom of manner, he had commenced the duties of his novitiate. He submitted to all that was enjoined him. He seemed to have lost for ever the wild and unruly waywardness that had stamped his boyhood; but he was never seen to smile--he scarcely ever opened his lips. His very soul seemed to have quitted him with its faults; and he performed all the functions of his...", "...months, with the additional amount, for expenses, of twenty-five thousand maravedis for each auditor. In the time of the former royal Audiencia this was done; and they named an accountant each year, to whom they gave fifty thousand maravedis beside. Since that time, what has happened is as follows: Governor Gomez Perez Dasmarinas, at the beginning of the year ninety-five, without an order from your Majesty, created an accountant-in-ordinary of accounts for this purpose, with a salary of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred pesos, and a secretary with two hundred and fifty pesos, for which they were to secure the approval of your Majesty--which they have not done in the past. The accounts were audited in two months--or at the most, in three. Accordingly it is not necessary, for so small an account as we have here, to incur a thousand pesos of expense each year to audit them. It could be done for a hundred thousand maravedis, as was formerly done. Your Majesty will command in this as is most...", "...two girls fell on one another's necks, and good Angelica's voice was so stifled by suppressed tears that it was a long time before she could speak. \"Of course I have come too soon,\" she said at last; \"but when wouldn't it have been too soon? A thousand congratulations, my dear Felix--pardon me, the Herr Baron doesn't come glibly to me to-day--and now, make haste, so as to see a little of the illumination--it is magnificent--we have just come from it, and Irene certainly didn't travel <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred miles just to sit here in the dark while all Munich swims in a sea of light.

Then I take you'll come to Ireland? We'll spend a perfectly quiet week, and be back in time for the meeting of Parliament.\" Monsignor made a small movement of assent with his head. (He had had Ireland explained to him before.) \"Then I'll leave you quietly here for a little. Call me up if you want me. I'll tell the secretaries to work in the next room. I'll see the Cardinal at once, and we'll go by the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> o'clock boat. I'll arrange everything. You needn't give it a thought.\" A curious process seemed to have been at work upon the mind of the man who had lost his memory, since his interview with the monk immediately after the trial. At first a kind of numbness had descended upon him. He had gone back to his business, his correspondence, his interviews, his daily consultation with the Cardinal, and had conducted all these things efficiently enough. Yet, underneath, the situation...", "...that I should go with him, whether I would or not. This intelligence was far from being agreeable to me, and I knew not what to think of it. I trusted in the goodness of God, and I had a reliance on the generosity of the King my husband; yet I passed the time I waited for his return but uncomfortably, and often thought I shed more tears than they drank water. The Catholic nobility of the neighbourhood of Baviere used their utmost endeavours to divert my chagrin, for the month or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> weeks that the King my husband and Fosseuse stayed at Aigues-Caudes. On his return, a certain nobleman acquainted the King my husband with the concern I was under lest he should go to Pau, whereupon he did not press me on the subject, but only said he should have been glad if I had consented to go with him. Perceiving, by my tears and the expressions I made use of, that I should prefer even death to such a journey, he altered his intentions and we returned to Nerac. The...", "...Mr. Washington was the kind of leader who kept very close to the plain people. He knew their every-day lives, their weaknesses, their temptations. To use a slang phrase, he knew exactly what they \"were up against\" whether they lived in country or city. Within a comparatively short period before his death he addressed two audiences as widely separated by distance and environment as the farmers gathered together for the first Negro Fair of southwestern Georgia at Albany, Georgia, and <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand Negro residents of New York City assembled in the Harlem Casino. He told those Georgia farmers how much land they owned and to what extent it was mortgaged, how much land they leased, how much cotton they raised, and how much of other crops they raised, or, rather, did not raise; how many mules and hogs they owned, and how they could with profit increase their ownership in mules and hogs; he told them how many drug stores, grocery stores, and banks in the State and county...", "...prepared, because it had been resolved, for good reasons without doubt, as in case of a flood of specie, &c. that the bank would not receive the monies, which they would deposit, but at five per cent below the current value; so that to have one thousand florins in bank to one's credit, it was necessary to deposit one thousand and fifty florins in current cash. Behold thus this agio establishment, and the money of the bank, worth five per cent more than the current money. This value of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> per cent soon varied, because some one, who found that he had too much money in bank, and was in want of current, sought to sell the first for the second, found a purchaser, who would not give him more than four seveneighths per cent; that is to say, one thousand and fortyeight florins and fifteen stivers, for one thousand in bank.

A Thibet bear and three performing leopards were knocked down to Mr. Jamrach for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> guineas and sixty pounds respectively. Another leopard, advanced in years, realised only six guineas.

In his history we behold the fac-simile of the history of the whole Burschenschaft to which he belonged.

So painted themselves wrath and...", "...for, to start with, they have no imagination, and to most of them their mental horizon stops at the walls of the boat. Secondly, they have the consolation of mechanical activities; they make and break switches and open and close valves--they work with their hands.

As we attacked the steamer, all one heard was murmurs from Alten, such as: \"Raise!\" \"Lower!\" \"Take her down to ten metres!\" \"Half speed!\" \"Slow!\" \"Bring her up to <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> metres!\" \"Raise!\" \"Lower!\" I endeavoured to simulate an air of unconcern which I was far from feeling. Not that I was a prey to physical fear; I flatter myself it is so far unknown to me, and there was no great danger, but simply that I longed to know what was happening. At length I heard the welcome order: \"Starboard tube. Stand by!\" Which was followed almost immediately by the order: \"Fire!\" There was a kind of coughing grunt, and the starboard torpedo proceeded on...", "...wait there until I come. There's no danger of the Germans reaching Barbizon, I fancy!\" And that is how from nine in the morning until late in the afternoon I sat perched on the front of a British Army Supply truck, much to the amusement of the other Tommy Atkins we encountered in Melun and the neighboring villages.

As we jolted down the hill towards the railway crossing our attention was attracted by a huge gathering of citizens and soldiers, and above the roar of our motor, we could hear the rolling of a drum.

(See map, p. 275.) This phenomenon is the more extraordinary, since the depression runs north to within <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles of the line of shoals; and not only do the waters charged with sediment pass over it continually, but, during the monsoons, the sea, loaded with mud and sand, is beaten back in that direction towards the delta.

It was that of a man of great muscular strength, but lightly built; about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> feet ten inches in height, with uncommon breadth of chest; florid, and wearing a profusion of hair, and enormous whiskers--the latter being in those days very unusual.

Senor Romero estimated that if the system of paying debts by means of debts is generally a ruinous one, it was especially so in this case, where the transaction was being effected by means of bonds so badly depreciated as those of this loan. The first important act of this Presidency was to make an arrangement with the representatives of the bearers of the foreign debt, by which they consented to a reduced interest for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years--that is, until 1898--the redemption charge being suspended simultaneously. In the following years, from 12th July 1898 to 12th January 1901, the full interest alone was to be resumed, and from 1901 the payment of the redemption charge would also be resumed. As a consequence of this arrangement, it was decided to issue no further stock of the loan, even in cases where the issue was authorised: as, for example, in the effective guarantee of railway stock.

Bouillon escaped to Amiens with <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred men; this was all that was left of the expedition. The horse of Villars was shot under him and the admiral's leg was broken as he fell.

The last time we saw her, was about two years ago--in Bristol--at her brother's, Dr. Porter's, house in Portland Square: then she could hardly stand without assistance, yet she never complained of her own suffering or feebleness, all her anxiety was about the brother--then dangerously ill, and now the last of \"his race.\" Major Porter, it will be remembered, left <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> children, and these have left only one descendant--the daughter of Sir Robert Ker Porter and the Russian Princess whom he married, a young Russian lady, whose present name we do not even know.

Every one who knew Mr. Lamb, knew that his humor was not affected. It was a style--a habit; generated by reading and loving the ancient writers, but adopted in perfect sincerity, and used towards all persons and upon all occasions. He was the same in 1810 as in 1834--when he died. A man cannot go on \"affecting\" for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> and twenty years. He must be sometimes sincere.

He has called attention particularly to the work of the great German Fathers of modern botany during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> of them who deserve a prominent place in the history of botany. Otho Brunfelsius (1464-1534), Leonhardus Fuchsius (1506-1566), Hieronymus Tragus (1498-1554), Euricius Cordus (1486-1535) and Valerius Cordus (1515-1544). The four first named represent two distinct {376} kinds of botanical work. Brunfels and Fuchs busy themselves almost wholly with medical botany. Their one idea was to describe plants that could be used in medicine or make special additions to the diet. Most of their...", "...different, yet the main facts will be common to all. The \"Canterbury Tales\" are great creations, from the humor, the wit, the naturalness, the vividness of description, and the beauty of the sentiments displayed in them, although sullied by occasional vulgarities and impurities, which, however, in all their coarseness do not corrupt the mind. Byron complained of their coarseness, but Byron's poetry is far more demoralizing. The age was coarse, not the mind of the author. And after <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred years, with all the obscurity of language and obsolete modes of spelling, they still give pleasure to the true lovers of poetry when they have once mastered the language, which is not, after all, very difficult. It is true that most people prefer to read the great masters of poetry, in later times; but the \"Canterbury Tales\" are interesting and instructive to those who study the history of language and literature. They are links in the civilization of England. They...", "...the respirations of hoisting- engines and the roar of stamps; I can see the \"camels\" after midnight packing in salt; I can see again the jam of teams on C Street and hear the anathemas of the drivers--all the mighty work that went on in order to lure the treasures from the deep chambers of the great lode and to bring enlightenment to the desert. Those were lively times. In the midst of one of his letters home Mark Twain interrupts himself to say: \"I have just heard <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> pistol-shots down the street--as such things are in my line, I will go and see about it,\" and in a postscript added a few hours later: 5 A.M. The pistol-shot did its work well. One man, a Jackson County Missourian, shot two of my friends (police officers) through the heart--both died within three minutes.

Vienna seemed to me specially suitable for this purpose, as at that, time it had <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> theatres, all totally different in character, which were dragging on a miserable existence. I quickly worked out a plan, according to which these various theatres might be formed into a sort of co-operative organisation, and placed under one administration composed not only of active members, but also of all those having any literary connection with the theatre. With a view to submitting my plan to them, I then made inquiries about persons with such capacities as seemed most...", "...plane. On the physical plane the mind of man receives only the sense impressions of the physical organs of sense; but when the mind functions and vibrates on the astral plane, it requires astral senses in order to receive the impressions of that plane, and these, as we shall see, are present.

Thus man has, in latency, the power of seeing, feeling, tasting, smelling, and hearing, on the astral plane, by means of his <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> astral senses. More than this, the best occultists know that man really has seven physical senses instead of but five, though these two additional senses are not unfolded in the case of the average person (though occultists who have reached a certain stage are able to use them effectively). Even these two extra physical senses have their counterparts on the astral plane. Persons who have developed the use of their astral senses are able to receive the sense impressions of the...", "...sentiment.

The morning was cool and crisp; it was conducive to lively marching and we stepped along at a fast clip, passing three companies of infantry on the way to Brest. The march was an eight mile \"hike\" and we made it without a stop until we reached the railroad yards at Brest. We were then assigned to compartments in French railroad coaches. Most of them were second and third class coaches, although there were a few first class cars for the officers. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> compartments to a car and eight men were assigned to each compartment; as we also had to make room for our luggage, we were crowded and uncomfortable.

These ample dimensions soon contract, and after following the main or south passage about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred yards, we found our further entrance barred, by masses of fallen rock, at the foot of which a small stream trickled through the broken fragments, and found its way to the mouth.

Now I will not assert that in modern civilized society these tendencies have been wholly overcome; but there has been a much more successful effort to overcome them than was the case in the early civilizations. This is curiously shown by the military history of the Graeco-Roman period as compared with the history of the last four or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> centuries here in Europe and among nations of European descent. In the Grecian and Roman military history the change was steadily from a citizen army to an army of mercenaries. In the days of the early greatness of Athens, Thebes, and Sparta, in the days when the Roman Republic conquered what world it knew, the armies were filled with citizen soldiers. But gradually the citizens refused to serve in the armies, or became unable to render good service.

Here, in the year 1808, lived an industrious farmer and his wife named George and Sarah Green, with their six children, the youngest a baby, and the eldest a girl of nine or ten. On the morning of a day long to be remembered George Green and his wife started off over the mountains--a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> or six miles--to Langdale, to attend a sale of furniture (on which occasions these scattered neighbours used to meet) intending to return the same evening. Notwithstanding that some of their friends endeavoured to dissuade them from returning by the mountains, they, in the afternoon, started on their return journey.

A few facts about the shipping, gaols and houses will serve to illustrate this statement. The fleet which sailed from Plymouth to make war on Spain in the autumn of 1625 consisted of 90 sail, and carried 10,000 men. Whether there was overcrowding would depend, of course, on the size of the ships; and it may be safely said that the largest ship of the fleet was not a fourth part the size of a transport that would be allowed to carry <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred men today. The expedition came back in a few weeks broken by sickness and mutiny, just as the expedition of Mansfeld for the relief of the Palatinate had fared. The wretched state of the thirty ships which arrived at Plymouth in November, 1625, has been mentioned already. At the same date we read of French ships of war also throwing overboard two or three dead men every day.

'Snotties' over eighteen were allowed to expend fifteen shillings a month on wine, and those under this age <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> shillings less; but nobody under twenty was permitted to touch spirits. The mess fund--for newspapers, breakages, washing, and other small incidental expenses--came to a nominal five shillings a month, but generally exceeded it; servant's wages were ten shillings; personal washing, say, ten shillings; and tobacco--if the officer was over eighteen, and allowed to smoke--about seven shillings and sixpence or half-a-sovereign.

The autumnal laying of the China and of the common goose is very valuable for this purpose. Turkey-hens frequently have this fit of unseasonable incubation.

We are spending over $100,000,000 a year on a standing army of less than 100,000 enlisted men. That amounts to a billion dollars in ten years. It is five billion dollars in fifty years. And we may be certain that <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> billion dollars will be spent, and probably much more, in the next fifty years on a standing army.

At least ten other peaks all round the walls of the valley rose to heights varying from eight to twelve thousand feet. The centre of the valley was occupied by an irregularly shaped lake, plentifully dotted with islands about its shores, but quite clear of them in the middle. In its greatest length it would be about twelve miles long, while its breadth varied from <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles to a few hundred yards. Its sloping shores were covered with the most luxuriant vegetation, which reached upwards almost unbroken, but changing in character with the altitude, until there was a regular series of transitions, from the palms and bananas on the shores of the lake, to the sparse and scanty pines and firs that clung to the upper slopes of the mountains. The lake received about a score of streams, many of which began as waterfalls far up the mountains, while...", "...they had all gone out, I had such a longing to play a little that I muted my strings and played to myself in a whisper what I could remember of a very beautiful thing of Ravel's that Kloster showed me the other day,--the most haunting, exquisite thing; and I hummed the weird harmonies as I went along, because they are what is so particularly wonderful about it. Well, it really was a whisper, and I had to bend my head right over the violin to hear it at all whenever a tram passed, yet in <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes Frau Berg appeared, unbuttoned and heated from her _Mittagsruhe_, and requested me to have some consideration for others as well as for the day. I was very much ashamed of myself, besides feeling as though I were fifteen and caught at school doing something wicked. I didn't mind not having consideration for the day, because I think Ravel being played on it can't do Sunday anything but good, but I did mind having disturbed the other people in the flat.

He reckoned it would save him a couple of miles, let alone the long hill from Farley Row up to Spendle Flats, if on his way back from Grimshott he went by Brockhurst House. It is stretching a point, he admitted, to drive under even your neighbour's back windows at <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> o'clock in the morning. But the doctor being himself in an unusually amiable attitude, was inclined to accredit others with a like share of good temper. Moreover, the natural man in him cried increasingly loudly for food and bed. John Knott was not given to sentimental rhapsodies over the beauties of nature. Like other beauties she had her dirty enough moods, he thought. Still, in his own half-snarling fashion, he dearly loved this forest country in which he had been born and...", "...temples. Colonel A. De Rochas, in an interesting work, _Les Origines de la Science_, has given in detail Heron's accounts of these wonderful automata and experiments in natural magic. St. Hippolytus, one of the Fathers of the early Christian Church, also described and exposed in his works many of these wonders. Magic is divided, according to old writers on the occult, into: _White magic_, _Black magic_, and _Necromancy_. Modern magic, or conjuring, is divided by Robert-Houdin into <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> classes, as follows: 1. FEATS OF DEXTERITY. The hands and tongue being the only means used for the production of these illusions. 2. EXPERIMENTS IN NATURAL MAGIC. Expedients derived from the sciences, and which are worked in combination with feats of dexterity, the combined result constituting \"conjuring tricks.\" 3. MENTAL CONJURING. A control acquired over the will of the spectator; secret thought read by an ingenious system of diagnosis, and sometimes...", "...from afar the doleful \"who, who, hum, hee\" of the loon. We had considerable difficulty determining the direction of the sound, but finally made a bee-line for the lake. No sooner had we put in an appearance than from a small grassy island in the middle of the lake a dozen or more herring gulls (_Larus argentatus smithsonianus_) rose into the air, uttering their distressed, plaintive cries as they soared round and round. After getting a cup of tea and a bite to eat, we cut down four or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> old tree stubs, bone dry from years and years of exposure to the elements. Lashing them together with redwood twisted into a \"gad\" and propelling the impromptu raft with a pole, we landed safely on the island.

The poems included in this volume consist of thirteen longer or more important works, written at various periods between June, 1816, and October, 1821; of eight occasional pieces (_Poems of July-September_, 1816), written in 1816; and of another collection of occasional pieces (_Poems_ 1816-1823), written at intervals between November, 1816, and September, 1823. Of this second group of minor poems <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> are now printed and published for the first time. The volume is not co-extensive with the work of the period.

This recommendation failed in consequence of the pressure of business at the close of the session. But notwithstanding the surprise and admiration which this achievement excited in the scientific world, the speed attained was not sufficient to meet the practical exigencies of commerce; and the repetition of the engines on this large scale could not be undertaken at the charge of individuals. Ericsson accordingly wisely devoted himself to perfecting the...", "...from huts and tents or the bare hillside, and wearily and weakly go to work clearing away this mass, and at the rate they are now proceeding it will actually be months before the debris is cleared away and the last body found.

He assumed the _magistratura morum_ (censorship), 19; and became _pontifex maximus_ (high priest), 13. To avoid all appearances of usurpation, Augustus at first accepted the sovereign power only for ten years, and afterwards had it renewed from time to time, for ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years, which, at a later period, gave rise to the _sacra decennalia_. 2. The senate, indeed, remained a permanent council of state, and Augustus himself endeavoured to increase its authority by more than one purification (_lectio_); but the connection between him and that assembly seemed of a very fragile nature, as it was undetermined, and could not at this time be settled, whether Augustus was over the senate, or the senate over Augustus. All matters of state could not be...", "...settled down with her sister, Mrs. Fitzgerald, to her daily life in England, which was mostly a record of work--arduous and unceasing work, which began at 10.30 in the morning, and lasted till 6.30 at night.

I do not doubt that we would have been overhauled but for this favorable contingency.

In 1915 a man well known to the Submarine Service--a Submarine Flotilla Chaplain--went out in \"E 4,\" under Commander Leir, to see for himself how his messmates spent their time on patrol. It is usual in patrol submarines to have as few hands on deck as possible--in fact, nobody is allowed on deck beyond the officer on watch, a look-out, and perhaps one other. On this occasion \"E 4,\"...", "...on that road only.

As soon as the Parliament met, a Bill for Regulating Elections, differing little in substance from the bill which the King had refused to pass in the preceding session, was brought into the House of Commons, was eagerly welcomed by the country gentlemen, and was pushed through every stage. On the report it was moved that <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand pounds in personal estate should be a sufficient qualification for the representative of a city or borough. But this amendment was rejected. On the third reading a rider was added, which permitted a merchant possessed of five thousand pounds to represent the town in which he resided; but it was provided that no person should be considered as a merchant because he was a proprietor of Bank Stock or East India Stock.

During the early evening a light snow had fallen, not driving fiercely after the Manitoba manner, but gently, and so lay like a fleecy, shimmering mantle over all things. Under this fleecy mantle, shimmering with myriad gems, lay Winnipeg asleep. Up from five thousand chimneys rose straight into the still frosty air <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand columns of smoke, in token that, though frost was king outside, the good folk of Winnipeg lay snug and warm in their virtuous beds. Everywhere the white streets lay in silence except for the passing of a belated cab with creaking runners and jingling bells, and of a sleighing party returning from Silver Heights, their four-horse team smoking, their sleigh bells ringing out, carrying with them hoarse laughter and hoarser songs, for the frosty air works mischief with the...", "...to see this child put down on the parairar for nuthin'.

While Birge's column countermarched, and Carter's brigade filed into the rear of it, the cannonade became lively in the front, the crashes of the guns alternating rapidly with the crashes of the shells, as Closson went in with all his six pieces, and a Rebel battery of seven responded.

Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with-- \"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about...", "...the practice is not so dangerous as has been represented. MANNER OF USING FININGS. Put the finings, when ready, into a pail, with a little of what you are going to fine; whisk them together till they are perfectly mixed, and then nearly fill up the pail with the liquor, whisking it well about again, after which, if the cask be full, take out four or five gallons to make room; take a staff and stir it well; next whisk the finings up, and put them in, stirring well together for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes; then drive in the bung, leaving the vent-peg loose for three or four days, after which drive it in tight.

He could not eat them all, of course, so he buried <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> in the ground, meaning no doubt, to come and fetch them away on the following evening. But apparently he thought that if he buried them entirely he might not be able to find them again. So he carefully left one wing of each bird sticking up above the surface to serve as a guide, and never seemed to reflect that others would be able to see it as well as himself!

Dr. Lalanne, in the intervals of a large medical practice at La Teste, a little place on the margin of the Basin, observed that oysters were often found attached to a piece of a wreck floating in the middle of the water far remote from the beds. This led him to study more closely the reproductive habits of the oyster. He discovered that the eggs after incubation remained suspended in the water for a space of from three to <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> days. Thus, for some time after the _frai_ season, practically the whole of the water in the Basin d'Arcachon was thick with oysters' eggs. Dr. Lalanne conceived the idea of providing this vast wealth with other means of establishing itself than were offered by a casual piece of wreck. What was wanted was something to which the eggs, floating in the water, could attach themselves, and remain till they were developed beyond the state of _ova_. After various experiments Dr. Lalanne...", "...which is that where the King and Queen go to see the fetes that take place. We perceived no light in descending or in ascending the staircase.

The children form a ring, and move around in a kind of shuffling dance, singing all the time.

These are the musicians, to whose performance the shouters keep perfect time. The grown people on this plantation did not shout, but they do on some of the other plantations.

The assumption of the two recensions therefore has the advantage of preserving the section for Q, without the disadvantage of ascribing to Luke a wholly unwarrantable amount of re-working. Sections 4-11 in Matthew and 4-6 in Luke contain their different versions of the beatitudes. Those who assign indiscriminately to Q all the verses contained in these sections have to assume that Luke omitted <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> of the beatitudes. No reason can be assigned for his doing so, and it is wholly improbable that he would have deliberately mutilated a passage so liturgically complete and impressive. The five omitted beatitudes are additions to the teachings of Jesus, manufactured on the basis of Old Testament exemplars.

Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GNP, employs about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has no known significant mineral or petroleum resources, but does have a large hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual rate of nearly 11%. During 1982-86 real GDP fell three out of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy experienced a modest recovery because of improved weather conditions and stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery continued through 1988, with a bumper soybean...", "...again.

Manning Walker, who at that time had been minister of the chapel for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years, changed his mind, became \"more evangelical,\" could not agree with the doctrines he had previously preached, got into water somewhat warm with the members, and left the place. He took with him a few sympathisers, and through their instrumentality a new chapel was built for him in Grimshaw-street, and opened on the 12th of April, 1808. It was a small edifice, would accommodate about 850 persons, and was the original ancestor of the Independent Chapel in that street. In 1817...", "...it went out at half-past three in the afternoon; and, more than this, the diversion to York, which it had cost such pains to get rid of some thirty years before, had been revived.

At all events the mails might start from Edinburgh at eight o'clock as before, and from London at ten, and yet arrive at their destination no later than now.

Much of this, Chalmers added, he had pointed out to Palmer some time before, and the only result was...", "...\"It will be seen that the wheelers may be drawn back together at any time in making the turn.

The tiger appeared surprised at such rough treatment, he leaped over all the dogs, and would have run off, if he could have got away; but the dogs followed him up, and now a regular `rough-and-tumble' fight ensued, the black again fastening on the flank of the tiger. The fight had lasted about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes, and the tiger began to show signs of giving up. He lay down apparently exhausted, the white dog was disabled, but the black was busily engaged worrying the tiger's flank, and the brindle was tearing away at his neck and shoulders, but presently he rallied, and gave the brindle a crushing blow with his paw, which, although it did not kill the dog outright, so disabled him that he had nothing more to do with the fight.

To these may or may not be added another high and much larger detached island situated about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles to the North-West, about midway between the remainder of the group and the mainland.

Cato[715] got together nearly seven thousand talents of silver, and being afraid of the length of the voyage, he had many vessels made, each of which contained two talents and <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred drachmae, and he fastened to each vessel a long rope, to the end of which was attached a very large piece of cork, with the view, that if the ship were wrecked, the cork holding the vessels suspended in the deep sea might indicate the place.

But how can he that is poor answer him that is rich? So Israel put his twitching hands behind him, remembering Naomi and the poor people of Absalam, and when at length Reuben tendered him for the casket one half what he had paid for it, he took the money in silence and went his way. \"Five hundred dollars--I can give no more,\" Reuben had said. \"Do you say <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred--five?\" \"Five--take it or leave it.\" It was market morning, and the market-square as Israel passed through was a busy and noisy place.

It was a small, but an effective, and determined, and well-appointed little body, not likely to be deterred by difficulties. A small native force of about forty men accompanied them, making, with our own, between eighty and ninety people.

The evening set in with rain and hazy weather. Our native skirmishing parties were returning to their boats and evening meals; our advancing party had been absent about an hour and a half, and I had just commenced a supper in the Jolly Bachelor on ham and poached eggs, when the sound of the pinnace's twelve-pounder carronade broke through the stillness of the night.

If the building weighed less than <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand tons it would be lifted by the gas; if much less it would be thrown high into the air as the gas expanded.

Of one thing there can be no doubt; namely, that the abstraction of these precious monuments of art from the Italian collections was deeply and permanently resented by the Italian people. This sacrilege, as those enthusiastic and intelligent lovers of all the elegant arts considered it, turned back many a half-made convert from the principles of the French Revolution.

On the new issues five per cent interest was paid, and even excises and imposts were set aside as security for their payment. The year 1709 saw a new expedition to Canada, and saw also the broken promises of the province, when L20,000 more notes were put out; the collection of the taxes with which to pay the notes was deferred in 1707 for two years; in 1709 deferred for four years; in 1710 for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years; in 1711 for six years. By 1712 they had depreciated thirty per cent, when the charm of legal tender was thrown around them, but to no purpose. The idea of value was not associated with them in people's minds, and they put no faith in promises. The usual result took place. People divided politically on the money question, and parties began to agitate for banks which should issue notes based on real estate, or for loans from the state to private...", "...Never have I felt the weather so cold in July.

This however usually \"goes\" without thought, asserting itself by its own interest. Figures which are less interesting than this and still less, such as will combine with the subject proper, are what the painter and illustrator long for.

He is very much depressed by the loss of the 2,000 quarts of wine by the Asiatic shell. Since Gouraud and Girodon have left them the French seem to be less confident.

She looked inquiringly at Moultrie, and he answered briefly: \"In another mile.\" But there was a look in his eyes which made Carolina's heart beat, for it was the glance of comprehension which one soul flings to another in passing,--sometimes never to meet again, sometimes which leads to mating. In another <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes Moultrie raised his arm. \"There!\" Carolina reined in and Araby stood, tossing her slim head, raising her hoofs, champing her bit, and snuffing at the breeze which came to her red nostrils, laden with the breath of piny woods and balsam.

Nurse persuaded her to let <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> of the cats sleep outside in the barn; but she begged so hard to have Fotchen and Silverpaws that nurse sent for a bundle of hay, and the two pussies slept in a corner of the room to keep her from feeling homesick.

Many of the tombs and tablets in the aisles bore dates of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred years ago, but none interested us so much as that of Linnaeus the great disciple of Nature. This humble shoemaker by force of his genius alone rose to be a prince in the kingdom of Science.

Then the bells rang for half an hour, but after the guns they sounded like a mere tinkling.

Even those held in the highest esteem contained undeniable errors. Thus the Septuagint made Methuselah live until after the Deluge.

At the time of the Deluge, so many theologians declared, the motion of the sun was altered, and the year became <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> days and six hours longer. There was a prevalent opinion that that stupendous event occurred on November 2d, in the year of the world 1656. Dr. Whiston, however, disposed to greater precision, inclined to postpone it to November 28th.

Thorne caught the remark. \"You hit that <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> out of five, and I'll forgive you,\" said he curtly. \"Hicks, you begin.\" The contest went forward with varying success. Not over half of the men were practised with the smaller arm. Some very wild work was done. On the other hand, eight or ten performed very creditably, placing their bullets in or near the black. Indeed, two succeeded in hitting the bullseye four times out of five. Every man took the utmost pains with every shot. \"Now, Ware,\" said Thorne, at last, \"step up....", "...Fisher minor?

It seems that occasionally sporadic forms appear in mushroom beds, persist for a day or two, and then disappear. These are generally manure-inhabiting species and may be observed shortly after the beds have been cased. In the instance cited, however, these fungi appeared in considerable numbers at the time the edible _Agaricus campestris_ should have been ready for the market, and the dealer supposed it was probably a new brown variety and tried it in his own family. As a result, <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> persons were rendered absolutely helpless and were saved after several hours only through the assistance of a second physician who had had experience with this type of poisoning. In the opinion of the Department, this case is peculiarly significant and demonstrates that the grower must be able to distinguish _Agaricus campestris_ from any of the wild forms of mushrooms that may appear in the beds. Under the circumstances, the Department strongly urges every grower to make...", "...for which he would pay five dollars an acre cash.

In 2004, the average was 300-400 proofreaders participating each day, and finishing 4,000-7,000 pages per day, the equivalent of four pages a minute. The number of books that have been processed through Distributed Proofreaders has grown fast, with a total of 3,000 books in February 2004, 5,000 books in October 2004 and 7,000 books in May 2005, 8,000 books in February 2006 and 10,000 books in March 2007, with <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> books produced per day and 52,000 volunteers in December 2007. From the website one can access a program that allows several proofreaders to be working on the same book at the same time, each proofreading on different pages. This significantly speeds up the proofreading process. Volunteers register and receive detailed instructions. For example, words in bold, italic or underlined, or footnotes are always treated the same way for any book.

Toward evening Crook and Wright covered the passes, while Emory crossed the Catoctin and at one in the morning of the 31st halted near Jefferson after a hard day's march of thirteen miles, during which the men and animals of all the corps suffered terribly from the heat and dust, added to the accumulated fatigue they had already undergone from a succession of long days and short nights.

Before an hour's out, ye'll laugh upon the other side.

CHAPTER XXI THE ATTACK As soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely watching him, turned towards the interior of the house, and found not a man of us at his post but Gray. It was the first time we had ever seen him angry. \"Quarters!\" he roared. And then, as we all slunk back to our places, \"Gray,\" he said, \"I'll put your name in the log;...", "...Dangerfield, darkening, and speaking with a strange snarl; 'I know what I'm about.

Then there was a pause. Dangerfield knew the man's character as well as his skill. There were things said about him darker than we have hinted at. The surgeon looked very queer and gloomy down upon the table, and scratched his head, and he mumbled gruffly-- 'You see--you know--'tis a large fee, to be sure; but then--' 'Come, Sir,' said Dangerfield, looking as though he'd pull him by the ear; 'it...", "...an hundred and fifty leagues in length.

At last the hour arrived for counting the ballots. The town had gone overwhelmingly for suffrage for women, but the returns were slow in coming from the country precincts, and great anxiety was felt about the issues there. The rumour was current that the farmers were determined not to vote at all. About seven o'clock some one came swiftly down the courthouse steps, and rushed across to the National Bank Building. In <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes the square was in an uproar. Men shouted to men: \"We've put 'em in!

The law ordains that the conscript shall serve for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years; but since its establishment, as I have been informed, there has not been a single instance of discharge. It amounts, therefore, to lifelong servitude, and there is little wonder that these independent sons of the mountains, as well as the tribes inhabiting the Syrian Desert, should rebel rather than submit.

The reindeer formed by far the greater portion of the food, and must have lived in enormous herds at that time in the centre of France. From this, as well as from the presence of the most arctic of the herbivores, the musk sheep, we may infer the severe climate of that portion of France at that time. Besides these animals the cave bear and lion have been met with in one, and the mammoth in <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> localities, and their remains bear marks of cutting or scraping which showed they fell a prey to the hunters.

Baker[1436] and Sir W. Watson[1437]. All three writers agree that the true epidemic prevalence occurred in London in the autumn of 1762. It is clear, however, that Akenside had been treating in St Thomas's Hospital since 1759 many cases of true dysentery (which he defines as a bowel complaint with gripes, tenesmus and bloody or mucous evacuations). He had more than one hundred and thirty cases of it described in his ward-books in the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> or six years previous to his writing (1764); he had proved the good effects of ipecacuanha on many in 1759; and he had remarked that the autumnal dysenteries of 1760, 1761 and 1762 in each case lasted the whole winter, not abating until the spring. Perhaps this may have been a special experience of the Surrey side of the Thames; for both Watson and Baker are clear that dysentery was something of a novelty to them in the early autumn of 1762.

The winter having passed quietly over, the armies again took the field. To produce the greater impression upon the enemy, the League united their whole force, and would easily have deprived the Venetians of all they possessed in Lombardy, if the war had been conducted in the same manner as during the preceding year; for by the departure of the duke of Lorraine, whose term of service had expired, they were reduced to six thousand horse and <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand foot, while the allies had thirteen thousand horse and five thousand foot at their disposal. But, as is often the case where several of equal authority are joined in command, their want of unity decided the victory to their enemies.

At five o'clock next morning, or a little before, Mr. Trapp and I started for the house. The Barbican had not yet awaked to business. Its frowzy blinds were down, and out on the Pool nothing moved but a fishing-boat sweeping in upon the first of the flood. At the entrance of Southside Street, however, we almost overtook a soldier walking towards the town. He...", "...to his mind that phrase in Margaret's letter about financial trouble at Blandford. It had not impressed him particularly when he read it; now he found himself wondering. . . . \"Isn't it glorious?\" The girl was speaking very low, as if unconscious that she had a listener. Then she turned on Vane swiftly. \"Look at that!\" she cried, and her arm swept the whole perfect vista. \"Isn't it worth while doing anything--anything at all--to keep that as one's own? That has belonged to us for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred years--and now! . . .

Evidently there was something gravely the matter; equally evidently it was nothing to do with him. . . . \"I hope...", "...he sat in the Chair and after his retirement. Sir Edward Coke was Solicitor-General as well as Speaker; Harley occupied the office of Secretary of State and the Chair simultaneously. Spencer Compton was Paymaster-General as well as Speaker, and, as Lord Wilmington, became Prime Minister in 1742. Nor was he the only Speaker to exchange the Chair for the Premiership. Addington succeeded Pitt in that office in 1801; Grenville became Prime Minister in the Government of \"All the Talents,\" <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years later; and Manners Sutton is said to have been urged by the Duke of Wellington to form a Ministry in 1831-2.[205] [204] Townsend's \"History of the House of Commons.\" [205] \"Croker Papers,\" vol. ii. p. 164.

Addington did so, but soon realized the difficulty of his position, and requested that he...", "...court subscribed an ignominious and oppressive treaty. The senate had already declared, that it was necessary to choose a party among the Goths, since the public was unequal to the support of their united forces; a subsidy of two thousand pounds of gold, with the ample pay of thirteen thousand men, were required for the least considerable of their armies; and the Isaurians, who guarded not the empire but the emperor, enjoyed, besides the privilege of rapine, an annual pension of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand pounds. The sagacious mind of Theodoric soon perceived that he was odious to the Romans, and suspected by the Barbarians: he understood the popular murmur, that his subjects were exposed in their frozen huts to intolerable hardships, while their king was dissolved in the luxury of Greece, and he prevented the painful alternative of encountering the Goths, as the champion, or of leading them to the field, as the enemy, of Zeno. Embracing an enterprise worthy of his courage...", "...the whole earth with her seven islands under his sway. And, O monarch, having subjugated the whole earth with her mountains, forests, and woods, he made preparations for the great sacrifice called the Rajasuya. And all the kings of the earth brought at his command wealth unto that sacrifice. All of them consented to become distributors of food and gifts unto the Brahmanas that were fed on the occasion. At that sacrifice king Harishchandra gave away unto all who asked, wealth that was <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> times what each had solicited. At the conclusion of the sacrifice, the king gratified the Brahmanas that came from various countries with large presents of various kinds of wealth. The Brahmanas gratified with various kinds of food and enjoyable articles, given away unto them to the extent of their desires, and with the heaps of jewels distributed amongst them, began to say,--King Harischandra is superior to all kings in energy and renown.--And know, O monarch, O bull of the...", "...lost it too! What thieves this world has got! Dear, dear, now.\" The lady paused, possibly overcome by her sympathy with the lad's misfortune. Behind his back she interchanged a glance with Mr. Jenkins. Mr. Jenkins, apparently wishing to say something, but not being able to find the words to say it with, put his hand to his mouth and coughed.

As the whole postal service had to be reorganized, the government offered Rowland Hill the task of introducing the new system, and proposed to give him <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred pounds a year for two years. He spurned the proposal, and offered to do the work for nothing. He was then offered fifteen hundred pounds a year for two years, and this he accepted rather than see his plan mismanaged by persons who did not believe in it. After many difficulties, the new system was set in motion, and was a triumphant success from the first year. A Tory ministry coming in, they had the incredible folly to dismiss the reformer, and he retired from the...", "...short, and getting into and out of the harbor and docks being so easy, the vessel does large execution at little expense. The two most essential benefits, however, of her short voyage are, that she is not compelled to carry much fuel, and consequently occupies nearly all of her space with freight; and that the prices of freight on these short voyages are much larger in proportion than they are on long voyages. Sailing vessels charge very little more for a thousand miles than they do for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred; but a steamer may have to charge nearly three times as much; especially if she run fast, consume much fuel, and occupy her cargo-room with coal. There are distances at which steamers, however large, can not carry a pound of freight; but occupy all their available space with the power that drives them. In these long voyages sail becomes much cheaper. It is by no means essential that these small coasting vessels shall be propellers; for to acquire the same speed they...", "...met and fought. Both were good swordsmen; and my father killed his adversary on the spot. He was much wounded in the encounter, however, and died some four-and-twenty hours after.

There a scene took place which I shall never think of without pain. My brother's whole thoughts were of the rich succession which had fallen to him. He had four or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> lawyers with him, some from the country, others brought post-haste from London. He claimed the whole estates,--Buckley, and all that it contained; and his lawyers showed that, the estate having fallen to my mother after her marriage, without any deed of settlement having reserved it to herself and her heirs, it had passed in pure possession to my father, and descended to his eldest son. There was some dispute between him and Dr. Winthorne, who, with the village attorney, advocated...", "...dismissed this paltry excuse with one remark,--a remark made in the deep tones referred to once before. \"I should scarcely have expected,\" she observed, \"that a granddaughter of mine would have spent half an hour conversing on the public road with the proprietor of Slowbridge Mills.\" \"O grandmamma!\" exclaimed Lucia, the tears rising in her eyes: \"it was not half an hour.\" \"I should scarcely have expected,\" replied her ladyship, \"that a granddaughter of mine would have spent <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes conversing on the public road with the proprietor of Slowbridge Mills.\" To this assault there seemed to be no reply to make. Lady Theobald had her granddaughter under excellent control. Under her rigorous rule, the girl--whose mother had died at her birth--had been brought up. At nineteen she was simple, sensitive, shy. She had been permitted to have no companions, and the greatest excitements of her life had been the Slowbridge tea-parties.

The southern shore of this lake presents one continuous low ridge, separating its waters from the head of the Yass river which would otherwise receive them. The water was slightly brackish in 1828 but quite fit for use, and the lake was then surrounded by dead trees of the eucalyptus measuring about two feet in diameter, which also extended into it until wholly covered by the water.

The United States at once agreed to take its share, in cooperation with the Great Powers, in whatever measures should be judged necessary.

The United States therefore bore its full proportion of the task. The largest contingent of the land forces was, indeed, from Germany, and the command of the whole undertaking was by agreement given to the German commander, Graf von Waldersee. Owing, however, to his remoteness from the scene of action, he did not arrive until after Pekin had been reached and the relief of the legations, which was the first if not the...", "...slight variations from the usual dentil type, of which No. 21, from the tomb of Pietro Cornaro, may serve as an example.

Anyone who has any kind of passion for observation must have discovered long ago that a side line has ever so much more charm and appeal about it than a main line. A main line is scornful of the station in whose heart it consents for a moment to linger, its eyes are staring forward towards the vast cities who are impatiently awaiting it; but a side line has its very home here. So much gossip passes from day to day above its rails (and gossip that has for its circumference <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> green fields, a country road, and a babbling brook), that it knows all its passengers by heart. To the people who travel on a side line, the train itself is still something of a wonder. How much more was that true thirty years ago. On this especial line there were only two stations-Liskane and St. Lowe, and, of a certainty, these stations would not even now be in existence were it not that St. Lowe was a fishing centre of very great importance.

In a moment or two, five or six rolls of coin were produced, nicely enveloped in paper. \"This is my sub-treasury,\" said she, with a smile. \"I took an account of the deposits to-day, and find just <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred and fifty dollars.

All the rest were not only ignoble, but not even men; nothing but mere Irish, whom any one might kill, even though serving under the English crown, at a risk of being fined <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> marks, to be paid to the treasury of the King of England, for having deprived his majesty of a serviceable tool. This (to modern eyes) astounding social state demands a closer examination in order to see if, at least, it had the merit of finally procuring for the English the possession of the land they coveted.

The population of the great Kongo River was much overestimated after the opening of that river by Stanley. Its people were massed on the river banks, and gave an impression of density which subsequent interior travel has not verified.

In this way he wrote his /Sophismes/, his article on the French and English tariffs, etc. It was this literary friendship, which lasted for more than twenty years, without being once clouded by the slightest disagreement, which prepared the mind of Bastiat for the gigantic efforts he was destined afterwards to make, and enabled him, during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years of his life, amid disease and distraction, to give to the world that mass of original and varied ideas which compose the six volumes of his collected works.[2] In the events to which the expulsion of the elder branch of the Bourbons gave rise in 1830, Bastiat took an active interest.

He had bought and fitted up the cottage, and had put savings in the bank, though Mrs. Kincaid was sick much of the time, so that money was spent that would have been laid by \"for a rainy day\" if she had been strong and well. Unfortunately, the rain came sooner than any one thought for. One day, about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years before the beginning of our little history, papa was brought home hurt by falling from a scaffold at the top of a house. He was not dead, and all thought he would be well again in a few weeks at most; but instead he grew slowly worse, and after a time died. Then the poor mother, always weak, did the best she could, and Kate tried to help her, while Aleck stopped his school-going, and went to work in the brass foundry.

The subway would be built by private capital; it would pay the city a percentage of its gross receipts, and be open to the cars of other companies on reasonable terms. There would be four stations in the business district, but none beyond, except one at East Liberty. The westbound cars would thus make no stops after leaving the surface, till they arrived downtown; and the longest run of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles would be covered in ten minutes, at an average speed of thirty miles an hour. The object of the Pittsburgh Subway Company is obviously to force the Pittsburgh Railways Company to use the tunnels, under the fear of seeing a rival surface system grow up, with faster service, and superior downtown facilities. Another aim is to divert traffic from the Pennsylvania Railroad, which does a large suburban business along its main line. The whole scheme as outlined is very attractive...", "...\"All you fellers keep mum on this subject, for we don't want to miss de fun ner be cotched in it.\" Now it happened that Mose Williams, Judge LeMonde's most faithful negro servant, was attending to an affair of his own that Sunday evening not strictly demanded by his obligations to his master.

She applied the process, after earnest examination, to her only son, <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years old; and on her return to England, the experiment was tried, at her suggestion, on five persons under sentence of death. The success of the trial did not prevent the most violent clamors against the innovation. The faculty predicted unknown disastrous consequences, the clergy regarded it as an interference with Divine Providence, and the common people were taught to look upon her as an unnatural mother, who had imperiled the safety of her own child. Although she soon gained...", "...weight on a point of such magnitude if standing alone; but coming as it does to confirm deductions drawn from whole classes of the higher animals, it must be admitted to have considerable value.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> species found at Mysol were all New Guinea species. Mysol, therefore, has closer relations to New Guinea than the other islands; and this is corroborated by the distribution of the birds, of which I will only now give one instance. The Paradise Bird found in Mysol is the common New Guinea species, while the Aru Islands and Waigiou have each a species peculiar to themselves.

But Jonson's idea of a play on classical history, on the one hand, and Shakespeare's and the elder popular dramatists, on the other, were very different. Heywood some years before had put <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> straggling plays on the stage in quick succession, all derived from stories in Ovid and dramatised with little taste or discrimination.

And the lesson taught by the whole history of the revolution of 1840 is the momentous value of conciliation, friendship, sympathy, and union. Gentlemen, if I understand the matter, there were four or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> great objects in that revolution. And, in the first place, one great object was that of attempting to secure permanent peace between this country and England. For although, as I have said, we were not actually at war, we were subjected to perpetual agitations, which disturb the interests of the country almost as much as war.

They elected a phylarch (phularchos), who commanded the cavalry; a taxiarch (taxiarchos), who commanded the foot-soldiers, and a general (strategos), who commanded both; and as each district was required to furnish five triremes, they probably elected as many trierarchs (trierarchos) to command them. Cleisthenes increased the senate to <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred, and assigned fifty to each district. They were elected by its inhabitants. Other functions of this larger body politic doubtless existed, but they have been imperfectly explained.

Why on earth did Broadwood camp the wrong side of that ditch? That is exactly the sort of question that a \"blooming civilian\" would ask. And then came Reddersberg and the loss of another <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred. Christian De Wet again! And all this within hearing, as you may say, of the main British army. These disasters come most inopportunely for us. Many of the Orange Free State Burghers, when their capital was taken, seem to have thought it was all up and some of them took the oath.

He was no sailor himself; and, if the thought had occurred to him that the Yankee had passed from this window to the roof of the house, he would have been willing to take his Bible oath that not a man in the Southern Confederacy could have accomplished such an impossible feat.

A small tributary of the Youghiogheny, now known as Indian Creek, was, it is true, formerly called Salt Lick Creek, whence came the name of Salt Lick township; but the well-known salt licks and Painter's Salt Works were located along the banks of Sewickley Creek near Hunkers. Here salt wells used to be drilled to a depth of about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred feet; and to these wells stock was driven from miles around, and people came from far and near to boil down the salt water in order to secure salt for domestic use. In the absence, therefore, of any authoritative evidence that the Salt Lick Creek mentioned by Orme is Jacob's Creek, it seems to the writer that the most probable location of Salt Lick Camp is on the Edward Stoner farm, about two miles east from the fording of Sewickley Creek.

The number of the tricks to be won is variable, and it depends on the value of the cards in each player's hand to decide what number he will endeavour to secure. The greatest possible achievement is to win the whole of the tricks (which are five in number), and the player who succeeds in doing this scores a \"Nap,\" and receives double stakes from each of his companions; if however, after declaring his intention to try for Nap he fails, he only pays a single, _i.e._, for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> tricks; and, as will be shown later on, this condition attaching to a Nap becomes an important feature in deciding on the number of tricks to be played for, when a good hand is secured. The only safe and perfect Nap is ace, king, queen, knave, and ten of the same suit, but as this combination of cards does not often occur in actual practice, it remains for the player to speculate on his chances with the cards he holds.

Standing by myself all the time while this unhappy man was severally instructed by N.C.O., Lieutenant, Major, Adjutant, Brigadier, General and Permanent Staff, I was a little amused to note that even so he failed to pass his test! And they all told him on no account to be nervous about it. You know the...", "...you cannot fail to see much of the other. \"Very good, ma'am; you may make your mind easy,\" answered the detective, as coolly as if he had just received the most common-place order.

Valentine Jernam's younger brother, George, had journeyed to and fro on the high seas <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years since the murder of the brave and generous-hearted sea-captain. Things had gone well with Captain George Jernam, and in the whole of the trading navy there were few richer men than the owner of the 'Pizarro', 'Stormy Petrel', and 'Albatross'. With these three vessels constantly afloat. George Jernam was on the high road to fortune. His life had not been by any means uneventful since the death of his brother, though that mysterious calamity had taken away the zest...", "...pinched it. When they found that my shoulders and other parts of my body which had been protected from the sun were quite white, whereas the exposed parts were by this time quite as dark as their own skins, there was no limit to their amazement and delight. I thought that the women-folk seemed rather well disposed toward me, I therefore did the best I could to strengthen this feeling by smiling at them and speaking to them in a gentle tone of voice, with the result that before another <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes had passed we were all gabbling and laughing together like so many children, although neither side understood a word of what was said by the other. In the midst of it all Mafuta sprang from his chair in a towering rage, and, addressing a few remarks to the king which seemed to make the latter feel rather uncomfortable, took himself off to his fetish-house, within which he vanished. Then the king shouted something to his women-folk which caused them to scuttle back into...", "...Miss Valdes stiffly, \"it is not my fault that you will have to go to the penitentiary and leave your children without support.\" Manuel tried to stop her, but Valencia brushed past and left the room. She went straight to a telephone and was connected with the office of the sheriff. After asking that an officer be sent at once to arrest a man whom she was holding as prisoner, she hung up the receiver and returned to the parlor. In all she could not have been absent more than <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes, but when she reached the parlor it was empty. Both Manuel and his prisoner had gone. CHAPTER XVII AN OBSTINATE MAN When Richard Gordon came back from unconsciousness to a world of haziness and headaches he was quite at a loss to account for his situation. He knew vaguely that he was lying flat on his back and that he was being jolted uncomfortably to and fro. His dazed brain registered sensations of pain both dull and sharp from a score of bruised nerve...", "...rich!\" \"I wish we could be rich now, then,\" said Ben, taking another generous slice of the brown bread; \"in time for mamsie's birthday,\" and he cast a sorrowful glance at Polly. \"I know,\" said Polly; \"oh dear! if we only could celebrate it!\" \"I don't want any other celebration,\" said Mrs. Pepper, beaming on them so that a little flash of sunshine seemed to hop right down on the table, \"than to look round on you all; I'm rich now, and that's a fact!\" \"Mamsie don't mind her <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> bothers,\" cried Polly, jumping up and running to hug her mother; thereby producing a like desire in all the others, who immediately left their seats and followed her example. \"Mother's rich enough,\" ejaculated Mrs. Pepper; her bright, black eyes glistening with delight, as the noisy troop filed back to their bread and potatoes; \"if we can only keep together, dears, and grow up good, so that the little brown house won't be ashamed of us, that's all I ask.\" \"Well,\" said Polly,...", "...no symptoms at all attributable to this fact. The condition is well known and is called _achylia gastrica_, that is, failure of the stomach to manufacture chyle, the scientific term for food changed by stomach secretions. Our stomachs are only meant, apparently, to provide a reservoir for food that will save us the necessity of eating frequently during the day, as the herbivorous and graminivorous animals have to do, and enable us to store away enough food to provide nutrition for <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> or six hours. We thus have the leisure to occupy ourselves with other things besides eating and drinking. This conclusion as to the relative {217} significance of the stomach and digestion is confirmed by the fact that removal of the whole stomach or practically all of it for cancer has in a number of well known cases been followed by gain in weight and general improvement in health. Schlatter's case, the very first one in which nearly the whole stomach was removed, proved a...", "...Behaviour so little consonant with his letters of introduction naturally awoke misgivings. He was taken to the cells, where he broke down, and with crapulous tears confessed the imposture; which so incensed His Holiness that my uncle only bought himself off excommunication by payment of a crippling sum down, and an annual tribute of his own weight (sixteen stone twelve) in candles of pure spermaceti.

We went about the city openly, no man suspecting us. On the day after our arrival we discovered the Prince Camillo's quarters. The Republic had lodged him, with a small retinue, in the...", "...believe you are right; but I know it's in the Company's service. But the old gentleman hates my husband, and will not have anything to say to him.

Nevertheless, as it was supposed that the answer had miscarried, the young lady was sent out to her relative with a decent equipment, and a letter of introduction.

The land between this and Cape Grafton is high, and towards the north has several remarkable peaks. The land of Cape Grafton may be readily known, when seen from the southward, by appearing like three lofty islands; the outermost is Fitzroy Island, but the others are hills upon the main.

Some few, indeed, like General Arnold, to whom I recounted the affair a fortnight later when he marched up the Valley, frankly said that I was a fool for my pains, and doubtless many others dissembled the same opinion.

Thomas (1888_a_:155) described adults of _atrata_. Sanborn (1931:21) examined the one additional specimen known to me and reported that it agreed with Thomas' description. Andersen (1909_b_:266) used a subadult female (\"nearly fully grown\") as the holotype of _anceps_. At least <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> additional specimens, all adults, of _anceps_ now are housed in various collections. Judging from these individuals, the holotype of _anceps_ was only four-fifths grown and because he used an immature individual, Andersen's (1912:437) criteria for distinguishing the two subspecies mostly are invalid.

The Constitution of the Argentine Republic was voted on 25th May 1853; but the end of the civil war and the definite reunion of Buenos Ayres to the other Provinces did not take place until 1860, the year of the revision of the Constitution. War and confusion are not usually propitious to progress. However, the population in 1861 was estimated approximately at 1,375,000; it had increased to almost <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> times what it was at the beginning of the century. Buenos Ayres became definitely the capital of the Republic in 1882, upon ceasing to be the capital of the State of Buenos Ayres. The third period is that of _economic development_. This is the period of which our authors write. We may mention it as beginning with the re-entrance of Buenos Ayres into the Argentine Concert, and the revision of the Constitution of October 1860.

St Mary's, Winchester, had let out the whole of its demesne in 1537, and the inventory drawn up by Henry VIII's commissioners therefore contains no list of farm labourers.

In February an intercepted letter had given a clue to his hiding place. Funston, in spite of his new rank, determined personally to undertake the capture. The signature of Lacuna, one of the insurgent leaders, was forged and letters were sent to Aguinaldo informing him of the capture of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> Americans, who were being sent to headquarters. Among the five was Funston himself. The \"insurgent\" guard, clad in captured uniforms, consisted for the most part of Macabebes, hereditary enemies of the Tagalogs--for the Americans had now learned the Roman trick of using one people against another. The ruse succeeded perfectly. The guard and its supposed prisoners were joyfully received by Aguinaldo, but the tables were quickly turned and Aguinaldo's capture was promptly...", "...and Fort Keogh in the valley below.

The incubator was a modern machine of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred egg capacity. After a conference, they decided to send to two well-known poultry farms specializing in white Leghorns and white Plymouth Rocks for additional settings of eggs, in order to have new blood for the next year.

Their eyes were starting out; all their muscles, rendered painfully visible by their leanness, were quivering; rills of blood from the bite of insects, which they cannot drive away, were literally running all over their naked bodies, washed away here and there by copious perspiration. Truly \"in the sweat of their brows\" they were eating bread and earning an honest living for their families!

With his stock selling at over one hundred and twenty-seven, a recession to one hundred and twenty seemed impossible, and by signing the stop loss order he would be enabled to hold the whole of his <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand shares. Accordingly, since it was no time for delay, he made up his mind at once and promptly answered, \"Very well, I'll do it.\" At once Mr. Holt selected a \"sell order\" from the printed slips upon the table, filled in the figures agreed upon, and Atherton, hastily signing his name, hurried back to the board room to find, to his delight, that Steel had advanced to one hundred and twenty-eight. This, however, appeared to be a critical point in the struggle, and while...", "...sprawled down also, and because she lighted on her wounded paw, she squealed with pain. It was possibly three seconds before she had forgotten the stabbing pain in her paw and had gathered herself to spring on the unconscious form of the native.

Warwick knew tigers, and he had kept the rifle always ready for just such a need as this. The distance was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred yards, and the bullet went wide of its mark. Nevertheless, it saved the native's life. The great cat remembered this same far-off explosion from another day, in a dry creek-bed of months before, and the sing of the bullet was a remembered thing, too.

I at once perceived that the people thus employed were Baris! We were only <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> guns, now separated from our vessels by about a mile, and the troops under Major Abdullah had evidently evacuated their position! Where upon earth had they gone? and for what reason? Certainly we had the river on our right flank, but we might have been attacked and cut off from our vessels, had the Baris the pluck to assume the offensive.

Scammony, however, is a costly drug, and therefore the caution given with reference to German liquorice powder applies here also. There is a preparation of scammony, the so-called scammony mixture, which consists of the resin or extract of scammony dissolved in milk, which is extremely useful when the stomach is irritable, or there is much difficulty in inducing the child to take medicine. It is almost tasteless, and a tablespoonful, which would be a proper dose for a child of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years old, can be given without being detected. Much of the difficulty experienced in giving powders arises from their being mixed with the arrowroot or jam in which they are administered. A very small quantity of arrowroot, bread and milk, or jam, should be put in a tea-spoon; the powder then laid upon it, and covered over with the arrowroot or jelly, so, in short, as to make a kind of sandwich, with the powder, which would thus be untasted, in the middle.

With these <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> they were soon led to class the Moon, which was easily observed to be a wandering luminary, changing her place among the fixed stars with remarkable rapidity. Ultimately, it came to be perceived that the Sun too rose and set at different parts of the year in the neighborhood of different constellations, and that consequently the great luminary was itself also a wanderer, having a path in the sky which it was possible, by means of careful observation, to mark out.

A few probably fell, or were thrown, into some of the deep holes, through which the pursuit had been carried. Some of the dead had acquaintances and friends about Ballarat, who afterwards removed their bodies, for the purpose of burial. I saw several corpses that had been collected in one place, and were waiting for recognition. Amongst them was that of a young Austrian, whom I had known. His body had been pierced with <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> gun shot wounds-- any one of which would have proved fatal. There was one corpse so mutilated and disfigured with sabre cuts, that the features could not be recognised by any with whom, when alive, the man had been acquainted. It was that of a miner who had a family in Ballarat. His body was afterwards identified by his wife, but only through some articles that were found in the pockets of his coat.

To any one who is acquainted with the morphology [comparative forms] of vertebrated animals, they show that the horse deviates widely from the general structure of mammals; and that the horse type is, in many respects, an extreme modification of the general mammalian plan. The least modified mammals, in fact, have the radius and ulna, the tibia and fibula, distinct and separate. They have <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> distinct and complete digits on each foot, and no one of these digits is very much larger than the rest. Moreover, in the least modified mammals the total number of the teeth is very generally forty-four, while in horses the usual number is forty, and in the absence of the canines it may be reduced to thirty-six; the incisor teeth are devoid of the fold seen in those of the horse: the grinders regularly diminish in size from the middle of the series to its front end; while their...", "...this through the fear that strangers should attempt to settle here, and divide with them the profits which they enjoy.

Throughout the entire afternoon the Seaforths had made strenuous efforts to capture the German trenches to the right and left of their position. Upon the arrival of the Fifty-eighth the fighting redoubled in ferocity, but no advance was made. Finally word was given to retreat. The Allies lost heavily in killed, wounded, and prisoners. The First Brigade was detached, and by midnight it had reached Bethune, about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles west of Givenchy. Sir Douglas Haig was ordered to move also, the entire First Division in support of the exhausted Indian troops.

The next morning General Haig in person took the command, but little ground was gained. While this contest was in progress around Givenchy, the Germans took possession of the city of Arras, ten...", "...supremely had given him much of the Indian feeling.

How they sent the news of the completion of the Erie Canal to New York City; Franklin and Morse.--The Erie Canal, in the state of New York, connects the Hudson River at Albany with Lake Erie at Buffalo. It is the greatest work of the kind in America, and was completed many years ago. When the water was let into the canal from the lake, the news was flashed from Buffalo to New York City by a row of cannon, about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles apart, which were fired as rapidly as possible one after the other. The first cannon was fired at Buffalo at ten o'clock in the morning; the last was fired at New York at half-past eleven. In an hour and a half the sound had travelled over five hundred miles. Everybody said that was wonderfully quick work; but to-day we could send the news in less than a minute. The man who found out how to do this was Samuel F. B. Morse.

On two trips, the tank passed over ground zero; on the others, it approached to within about 90 meters of ground zero. The men scooped up soil samples through a trap door in the bottom of the tank. One driver who made three trips into the ground zero area received the highest exposure, 15 roentgens (1). This lead-lined tank was also used by ten men to observe the radiation area.

Sargon turned his attention to where danger was most urgent; he made a descent on the territory of the Mannai, and laid it waste \"as a swarm of locusts might have done;\" he burnt their capital, Izirtu, demolished the fortifications of Zibia and Armaid, and took Ullusunu captive, but, instead of...", "...times of the tide.\" \"That's so,\" said Josh, who had overheard the remark. \"The cave we know, Master Dick,\" said Will, \"is one where you can row right in.\" \"Can't we go now?\" cried Dick excitedly. \"Wait, wait,\" said Mr Temple, \"don't be impatient, my lad.

Though imperfectly armed and equipped, and, of course, no match for regular troops, the Mormons were not to be held in contempt. In July, 1857,[19] the Nauvoo Legion had been reorganized, the two cohorts, now termed divisions, having each a nominal strength of two thousand.

The Moor received the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred maravedis with that good will with which money is always received, and told Maria to bring Juan Lanas to his house to stay there so long as there was any risk in the cure. Maria went to fetch the old man, and kept silence as to her shorn head so as not to grieve him, and while Juan remained the physician's guest, Maria dared not leave her home except after nightfall and then well enveloped; this, however, did not hinder her being followed by the muffled-up man.

They were only captured at last by hoops being thrown over their horns, and even when thrown down required the efforts of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> or six men to tie them. They were finally got to the wharf by two men each: one went ahead with the rope attached to the animal's horn, the other kept behind, holding a rope fastened to one of the hind legs.

Her decision to go, and her preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that there would be a sort of deception in her voluntarily allowing any further intercourse between herself and Will which she was unable to mention to her husband, and already her errand in seeking Lydgate was a matter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her mind; but she...", "...the following day, on returning from my work in Hospital 105, the people with whom I was living told me of the terrible spectacle they had witnessed when they had gone to get news of some relations living near the gate where the fight had taken place.

He first gave them a figure of the Blessed Sacrament in the multiplication of the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> loaves of bread by which He fed five thousand persons. After this miracle He told them that He would give them bread superior to that which they had eaten, and that this bread was His own flesh and blood. \"The bread that I will give is My flesh, for the life of the world.\" It is almost impossible to understand these words of Our Lord in any other than a literal sense. He was so understood by those who heard Him. \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" they said, and many...", "...near the old Boardman house, which was standing in 1856, the oldest house in Wethersfield. The second generation of Boardmans, of course occupied more \"new lands.\" Daniel, the fifth son of Samuel, owned land in Litchfield and New Milford, then new settlements, as well as in Wethersfield. Jonathan married in Hatfield, Mass. The third generation, the grandchildren of Samuel, the names of twenty-nine of whom (seventeen grandsons and twelve grand-daughters), all children of Samuel's <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> sons, are preserved; went out to occupy territory still further from home. We have little account however, except of the nine sons of Daniel, the seventh child of Samuel. Daniel the great-grandfather of Timothy, the author of the Log-Book, was married to Hannah Wright just a hundred years before the marriage of that great-grandson, June 8, 1683, while the war-whoop of King Phillip's Narraganset savages was still resounding through the forest. Of his twelve children, two sons, John...", "...silk, fastened with colored cords (very fine) to high palmettos at the four corners of the green, sat half a dozen gentlemen and a lady about a table, on which was spread a repast that set my mouth watering. The gentlemen were all very handsomely dressed in the Spanish mode, and the lady (who was the governor's wife) was also very richly arrayed in a lace farthingale, but as ugly a woman of fifty or thereabouts as ever I did see; and particularly insolent, for ere we had got near her by <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> yards she held up her hand to bid us stay; and, clapping a scent-bottle to her hooky nose, put on an expression of loathing and disgust, as though we had been dirty dogs. This disdain, however, was by no means obvious in the rest of the company, who, taking but slight notice of me, did gaze at Lady Biddy as though they would stare her out of countenance; so that I know not if I was better pleased with their impudence than with the old tabby's insolence. The governor, who was...", "...in the different sciences had equal reason to be satisfied with him? What I have above stated, together with the report of M. de Keralio, bear evidence of his backwardness in almost every branch of education except mathematics. Neither was it, as Sir Walter affirms, his precocious progress in mathematics that occasioned him to be removed to Paris. He had attained the proper age, and the report of him was favourable, therefore he was very naturally included among the number of the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> who were chosen in 1784. In a biographical account of Bonaparte I have read the following anecdote:--When he was fourteen years of age he happened to be at a party where some one pronounced a high eulogium on Turenne; and a lady in the company observed that he certainly was a great man, but that she should like him better if he had not burned the Palatinate. \"What signifies that,\" replied Bonaparte, \"if it was necessary to the object he had in view?\" This is either an...", "...less suspicious. _I'm coming out.

Maybe they'll believe me anyway. Bob and Jim and Dave and Reg and Willy....\" Walt shrugged. He crossed to the doorway. He left the laboratory. Just outside he waited. One of the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> saucer ships approached. He could see Julia's face at the window. It was drawn and pathetic. He wanted to go back and comfort her and tell her everything was going to be all right. How sweet she was! Now that she was no longer infinitely wise and superior, now that she was dependent and helpless: how sweet she was! He wanted to protect her. His heart swelled with sadness and with joy. The saucer ship hovered. He motioned it closer. It drew in toward him like a nervous...", "...the Station. And then the revulsion of feeling when we found the cosiest of homes awaiting us! The hearty welcome of Eggert, the quarantine master and lighthouse keeper; the motherly smile of his wife; the cheery welcome of his daughter, Thyra; the bright little faces of Thorwald, his son, and of the baby, Ingeborg; even the rough growl of \"Laps,\" the Danish hound, had no surliness about it. Then the comfortable beds in the little rooms, curtained from all obnoxious insects; the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> o'clock sea baths in the morning, inside the high station fence that we must not pass; the meals an epicure need not have scoffed at; our first acquaintance with a dozen varieties of the luscious fish that abound in that part of the Caribbean.

Carmen did the same, as, indeed, everyone else was doing. The sun had been very slow about going to bed. Over on the opposite side of the arena, the poor people sat in the sun, because those seats were cheaper. There was an air of excitement. The band played the \"Toreador's (t[)o]r'[+e]-ae-dor') Song\" from \"Carmen,\" and then the fight began. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> toreros and five bulls before Pedro's turn came. Pedro was to be last on the program. Everything seemed to swim before Carmen's eyes during the performances of these other men and bulls. The whole thing was a sea of fluttering fans, sickly blue light, and waving red cloaks. Then at last Pedro entered the ring. How big and handsome he looked in his colorful costume! He carried the red cape with which he was going to tease the bull. But before that time, the bull would first...", "...EXTORTION _See_ Dressmakers.

For awhile they got along fairly well but one day after <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> years of it John hung himself in the attic, where Susan used to dry the wash on rainy days, and a carpenter, who went up to the roof to do some repairs, found him there. He told Susan, and Susan hurried up to see about it, and, sure enough, the carpenter was right. She stood looking at her late husband for about a minute--kind of dazed, the carpenter thought--then she spoke. \"Well, I declare!\" she exclaimed. \"If he hasn't used my new clothes-line, and the old would have done...", "...now each of the two in the middle touches the other three. Take away one of the outsiders, Isabel: now you have three in a triangle--the smallest triangle you can make out of the beads. Now put a rod of three beads on at one side. So, you have a triangle of six beads; but just the shape of the first one. Next a rod of four on the side of that; and you have a triangle of ten beads: then a rod of five on the side of that; and you have a triangle of fifteen. Thus you have a square with <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> beads on the side, and a triangle with five beads on the side; equal-sided, therefore, like the square. So, however few or many you may be, you may soon learn how to crystallize quickly into these two figures, which are the foundation of form in the commonest, and therefore actually the most important, as well as in the rarest, and therefore, by our esteem, the most important, minerals of the world.

What the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> young Galileans of Bethsaida saw and heard of these events must have made a deep impression on them. They were old enough to be young patriots interested in their nation. Their sympathies would be with those trying to free their people from Roman power. Perhaps their thoughts concerning Messiah became confused by the false claims of Judas, the pretender, and his deluded followers. But this did not destroy their confidence in the Scriptures. They believed the prophecy it...", "...as he hastily glanced over the letter. Yes, his aunt intended the money for him.

When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries and all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and to remember. Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their attendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places; these were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and these again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.

Accordingly, the whole of Leclerc's policy henceforth proceeded on the supposed fact of Toussaint L'Ouverture being the prince of dissemblers. CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR. RECEDING. Leclerc was eager to receive proposals of peace,--to owe a respite to dissimulation itself, rather than continue the war, under his present difficulties. It was weary work, keeping up a show before the eyes of the blacks, when, of the twelve thousand soldiers whom he had brought with him, <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand had fallen in battle, and five thousand more were in the hospitals. Twenty thousand had arrived within a few weeks, from France; and, of these, scarcely eleven thousand remained fit for service. Happy indeed was Leclerc to receive replies to his overtures of peace; and anxious was he to testify every respect to the generals whom he had lately insulted and defied. He revoked their outlawry, commending them to the esteem and good offices of those to whom he had desired...", "...carried behind them, leapt at the same instant to the earth, and began, some to bend their bows, and others to break into and secure the houses upon either hand. Surprised at this sudden change of direction, and daunted by the firm front of the rear-guard, the few Lancastrians, after a momentary consultation, turned and rode farther into town to seek for reinforcements. The quarter of the town upon which, by the advice of Dick, Richard of Gloucester had now seized, consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> small streets of poor and ill-inhabited houses, occupying a very gentle eminence, and lying open towards the back. The five streets being each secured by a good guard, the reserve would thus occupy the centre, out of shot, and yet ready to carry aid wherever it was needed. Such was the poorness of the neighbourhood that none of the Lancastrian lords, and but few of their retainers, had been lodged therein; and the inhabitants, with one accord, deserted their houses and fled,...", "...Over one hundred men were now engaged with the Tehuas. The remainder moved, as Tyope confidently hoped, upon the cave-dwellings of the unprotected Puye by a detour which would enable the Queres to avoid the rather exposed site of Tzirege. A tremendous noise from the south indicated that a hand-to-hand encounter was going on there. The noise lasted but a short time, then it subsided. Shortly afterward a warrior rushed panting up to Tyope. \"Nashtio,\" he said, \"the Moshome have taken <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> scalps.\" \"Where?\" Tyope snorted. \"There;\" he pointed southward. \"And we?\" \"Three.\" \"Have the people gone back?\" \"A little.\" \"It is well.

Mr. Dryce knew that it was a cunningly-made lock, and thought that no key but his would open it. It opened easily with Jaggers's key, however; and from the lower drawer was missing all the property which in those days were often kept in such places--bills, gold, and notes to the value of four thousand <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred pounds. With feverish haste the old man unlocked the desk and the brass-bound box within it. The latter contained all the missing property, evidently placed there for immediate removal. In the desk were found bills, letters, and correspondence, a glance at which disclosed a long system of fraud and peculation. Above all, amongst the loose papers were the letters that Robert sent to his father, and those which had been written by himself in repentance of the harsh parting...", "...center of the building. His blows shook the roof. \"Send me a big one, Gus.\" The squealing of the pigs had by this time become terrific.

We'd better get going. It's lighting up in the east.\" Just as the edge of the sun appeared, sparkling like red fire across <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> miles of frozen lake, Gus lifted the narrow sliding door and booted a sow through the opening. \"Crack, crack\" went the big sledge on the sow's skull. The pigs screamed and plunged about in their pens. Quickly, now, they hooked the gambrels through the tenons of her hind legs, heaved and sweat on the big pulley, lifted the sow clear of the floor and snubbed the rope around a post. Stud reached for his sticking knife, slit the sow's throat; the blood poured into the trough beneath....", "...make an observation to some one; but still the smooth thread of his speech goes on to the committee: but it is smooth, and says as plainly as possible, 'My dear friend, I am not to be hurried, understand that if you please.'

There was a slight twinkle as he said to the committee, 'Now I come to the question of gradients.' It was amusing to see the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> M.P.s twist in their chairs, and how readily the chairman told Mr. Scott the committee required to hear nothing further about gradients.

In addition to the five senses above enumerated, some physiologists and psychologists have held that there were several others in evidence. For instance, the sense by which the inner organs revealed their presence and condition, The muscular system reports to the mind through some sense that is not that of \"touch,\" although closely allied to it. And the feelings of hunger, thirst, etc., seem to come to us through an unnamed sense. Bernstein has distinguished between the <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> senses and the one just referred to as follows: \"The characteristic distinction between these common sensations and the sensations of the senses is that by the latter we gain knowledge of the occurrences and objects which belong to the external world (and which sensations we refer to external objects), whilst by the former we only feel conditions of our own body.\" A sensation is the internal, mental conception, resulting from an external object or fact exciting the sense organs...", "...away as much of the rigging as I could, as also all the small ropes and rope-twines I could get, with a piece of spare canvas, which was to mend the sails upon occasion, and the barrel of wet gunpowder.

But that which comforted me more still was that last of all, after I had made <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> or six such voyages as these, and thought I had nothing more to expect from the ship that was worth my meddling with--I say, after all this, I found a great hogshead of bread, three large runlets of rum, or spirits, a box of sugar, and a barrel of fine flour; this was surprising to me, because I had given over expecting any more provisions, except what was spoiled by the water. I soon emptied the hogshead of the bread, and wrapped it up, parcel by parcel, in pieces of the sails,...", "...so before.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> murders were so much alike that there was only a single investigation, embracing all the five enquiries and, for that matter, leading to no result. A woman disappeared; a week later, to a day, her body was discovered; and that was all.

About half past two the weather looked a little more favorable and orders were given to move on. We started at <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> minutes to three, about which time it again rained heavily. We traveled two miles and then formed our encampment in a semi-circle on the banks of the river, having traveled two miles and through the day, eight miles.

The owner in these cases is compelled not only to go on the market and do much fictitious buying, thus creating a fictitious demand, but once this fictitious demand has deceived the public and he has been able to unload a considerable quantity of his wares, he is, unless he rids himself of all his stock, compelled to stand behind it. If, for instance, he sold five thousand shares, as was done in this instance, and retained <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> thousand, he must see that the public price of the outstanding five thousand shares did not fall below a certain point, because the value of his private shares would fall with it.

He gave us to understand that it was impossible for us to travel down to East Cape this season of the year, and that the distance to the cape was very great, and it was therefore impossible to get there. Not knowing our precise locality upon the coast, we could not tell whether the cape was three or <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> hundred miles from us. We concluded it would be safer to remain where we were than to venture upon such an uncertainty. It was afterwards ascertained that we were distant from East Cape about two hundred and fifty miles.

Among the crowds who thronged the shore to stare at the English fleet came the old Dowager Countess of Hamilton, riding on horseback, with pistols at her saddle, and vowing, in a spirit worthy of her ancestor, the grim old Reforming Earl of Glencairn, to shoot her son dead with her own hand should he dare to set a hostile foot on Scottish soil. A...", "...seen me before, or, if he had, that he had forgotten both my name and the circumstances under which we had last met. I accordingly bade him call his employer to me. \"Good gracious, can it be you, Mr. Collon?\" exclaimed the latter as he entered the room and saw me standing before him; \"I thought you were in China. Leastways, Bill Smith, of the _Coral Queen_, was only saying yesterday that the mate of the _Chang Tung_ saw you at Foochow the last time he was up there, which was about <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> months ago.\" \"Five months is a long time,\" I said, with a laugh. \"It is possible for a good deal to happen in that time. Five months ago, if you had told any of the people who went down in the _Monarch of Macedonia_ what was before them, they would not have believed you.\" \"That was a bad thing, wasn't it?\" he replied, shaking his head. \"I suppose you know that the only persons who escaped were brought on here. As a matter of fact, I took them in.\" \"I guessed as much,\" I...", "...scientifically. Hence, steam has received no mechanical advancements since 1858; and the efforts of 1872 are as positive and determinate failures as those of 1862. THE TRIALS OF STEAM IN 1872 LESS ECONOMICAL THAN IN 1858 TO 1862. It should be observed that the first trials of steam in 1858 were made during a season of low water, and when the Canal Board had limited the loading of boats to four and three-fourths feet draught of water, which, later in the season, was increased to <span class=\"clocktext\">five</span> feet, and in subsequent years to six feet, as continued to the present time. Among the most successful trials of the first era of steam on the canals, may be mentioned the _H. K. Viele_, _P. L. Sternburg_, and _S. B. Ruggles_. Each could carry three-fourths cargo and tow a full cargo, and each exceed the speed of horse-boats. Among the most successful trials of the present era may be mentioned the _Port Byron_, _Baxter_, and _Newman_. Each can carry five-sixths of a common..."]
