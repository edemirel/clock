Here the guide leaves you in absolute darkness for a while, until from his vantage ground he so illuminates the high ceiling that when you look upward, the heavens seem studded with stars; a comet with its blazing tail appears, clouds cross over, midnight with its utter darkness comes, and finally day begins to dawn. HOW REELFOOT LAKE WAS FORMED About two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of December 16, 1811, the inhabitants of southwestern Kentucky, especially those in Fulton County, were aroused and alarmed by a most destructive earthquake shock that shook the Mississippi Valley throughout. It extended all along the Ohio beyond Pittsburgh, passed the Alleghenies, and died on the far-away coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The first sign of the catastrophe was distant, rumbling sounds, succeeded by continued discharges as of unnumbered pieces of artillery....", "...from the Hills\" delighted first Anglo-Indian, and then English society. There was nothing of permanent value in that book, and in my extremest youth I never imagined otherwise. But \"The Story of the Gadsbys\" impressed me. So did \"Barrack-room Ballads.\" So did pieces of \"Soldiers Three.\" So did \"Life's Handicap\" and \"Many Inventions.\" So did \"The Jungle Book,\" despite its wild natural history. And I remember my eagerness for the publication of \"The Seven Seas.\" I remember going early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to Denny's bookshop to buy it. I remember the crimson piles of it in every bookshop in London. And I remember that I perused it, gulped it down, with deep joy. And I remember the personal anxiety which I felt when Kipling lay very dangerously ill in New York. For a fortnight, then, Kipling's temperature was the most important news of the day. I remember giving a party with a programme of music, in that fortnight, and I began the proceedings by reading aloud the...", "...THE BRIDE ONLY one memory in the ten days that followed before her school began ever stood out clearly and distinctly with Kate. That was the morning of the day after she married George Holt. She saw Nancy Ellen and Robert at the gate so she went out to speak with them. Nancy Ellen was driving, she held the lines and the whip in her hands. Kate in dull apathy wondered why they seemed so deeply agitated. Both of them stared at her as if she might be a maniac. \"Is this thing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> paper true?\" cried Nancy Ellen in a high, shrill voice that made Kate start in wonder. She did not take the trouble to evade by asking \"what thing?\" she merely made assent with her head. \"You are married to that--that--\" Nancy Ellen choked until she could not say what. \"It's TIME to stop, since I am married to him,\" said Kate, gravely. \"You rushed in and married him without giving Robert time to find out and tell you what everybody knows about him?\" demanded...", "...There's the guv'nor ringing.\" He hurried into Brown's room, received a brief order, and was about to go back when the publisher spoke again. \"Simmonds!\" \"Sir.\" \"If M. De Bac calls, show him in at once.\" \"Sir,\" and the clerk went out. Left to himself, Brown tried to go on with the manuscript; but was not able to do so. He was impatient for the coming of De Bac, and kept watching the hands of the clock as they slowly travelled towards twelve. When he came to the office <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Brown had looked with a nervous fear in the fireplace, half expecting to find the black paper still there; and it was a considerable relief to his mind to find it was not. He could do nothing, not even open the envelopes of the letters that lay on his table. He made an effort to find occupation in the morning's paper. It was full of some absurd correspondence on a trivial subject, and he wondered at the thousands of fools who could waste time in writing and in reading...", "...was so hard to enter that after Jesup's death it was deserted. There was only one possible answer to such an offer--they stayed. In spare moments Quonab brought the canoe up to the barn, stripped off some weighty patches of bark and canvas and some massive timber thwarts, repaired the ribs, and when dry and gummed, its weight was below one hundred pounds; a saving of at least forty pounds on the soggy thing he crossed the lake in that first day on the farm. September came. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Quonab went alone to the lakeside; there on a hill top he sat, looking toward the sunrise, and sang a song of the new dawn, beating, not with a tom-tom--he had none--but with one stick on another. And when the sunrise possessed the earth he sang again the hunter's song: \"Father, guide our feet, Lead us to the good hunting.\" Then he danced to the sound, his face skyward, his eyes closed, his feet barely raised, but rythmically moved. So went he three times round to...", "...train--it should be here now--it leaves at 7.30.\" \"Ah!\" the man said, and he seemed to understand. \"I fear you have lost _that_ train by several days; it went last Sunday.\" \"What!\" screamed mademoiselle. \"How dare you mock me! I will report you.\" \"That must be as madame wishes,\" returned the man with horrible calmness; \"but the train madame wishes to get only runs on Sundays, and, therefore, she must wait several days for the next. If any other train will do, there is one <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> at 9.30.\" Barbara wanted to laugh, but consideration--or fear--of Mademoiselle Therese--kept her quiet, and they stood gazing at one another in sorrowful silence. A ten-mile walk at 7.30 in the evening, unless with very choice companions, is not an unmitigated pleasure, especially when one has been walking during the day. However, there was nothing for it but to walk, as a conveyance, if obtainable, would have been too expensive for Mademoiselle Therese's economical...", "...ill omen? Esperance thought of all these things and was infinitely tortured by them, but, one by one, he succeeded in dismissing them from his mind. Giovanni was certainly under a potent spell that might lead him to the commission of any indiscretion, but he was at bottom a man of honor, and there was some chance that his better feelings might obtain the mastery of his mere physical inclinations. At any rate, Esperance felt that he could trust him for one night more at least. Perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he would awaken to a true sense of his position and acknowledge his error; he might even implore his friend's pardon, admit that he was right and consent to return to Rome, leaving the bewitching Annunziata in all her innocence and purity. Upon reflection Esperance decided that the stranger could be in nowise the associate or accomplice of the Viscount, for the latter had communicated with no one, had not even gone a dozen steps from the Solara cabin during his entire...", "...then, you won't see him if you can help it, or read his letters, if he writes?

Good-by, I won't be up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when you start.

That night she slept with Amba Bye. Her sleep was at first broken, and full of fearful dreams; but wearied nature and youth in the end obtained their mastery over her, and she sank into a deep slumber,--so deep, that the sun was high <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> ere she awoke. It had been a weary time to Zyna, Lurlee, and the Khan's household, and even the Khan and the priest sat up far into the night, speaking of Tara. No one had slept. As to Fazil, he, with Shere Khan, Lukshmun, and a body of horse, rode round the country for miles, all through the night, seeking Tara. No one dared speak to him, and the men had never seen him so excited before. He and Lukshmun, whose activity even surpassed his own, had stopped every...", "...that they did not deserve the rebuke, that the complaints ought to be laid against a certain farrier who had come over from Jerusalem, etc., etc. My servant ended the affair by shouting at them, \"Take my last word with you and feed upon it--'God send you a strong government.'\" This at least they deserved, for they are often in arms against the Turkish government: and although so prosperous in trade and agriculture, are many years in arrear with their taxes. _Tuesday_, 15_th_.--Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> there were Saltiyeh people reaping harvest near us, chiefly in the Christian fields; for here the case is not as in Palestine, where Christians generally sow and reap in partnership with Moslems, for their own safety; but the Moslems have their fields, and the Christians have theirs apart, which shows that their influence is more considerable here; indeed, the Christians carry arms, and go out to war against the Bedaween, quite like the Moslems. Before we left, the day...", "...about noon to sundown. On the 1st of November we were in the saddle at early dawn, pushed towards Cadotte's Pass, between the Crown Butte and Rattlers, passed by the Bird Tail Rock, crossed the Dearborn, and went into camp four miles before reaching the divide, at a point which was the camp of Lieutenant Grover and Mr. Robie in their winter trip of 1854. This evening a snow came on about an hour before sundown, or we should have crossed the divide that night. The weather <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> was clear and beautiful, but as we had no tent, we built up a large fire in order to dry ourselves, and got breakfast before leaving camp, and at half past eight we were on the road. There were some six or seven inches of snow on the ground, but the weather was extremely mild, and the snow was rapidly passing away. I went up the divide on the ravine north of the usual trail, and was able to find a very good route for our animals. There was little or no snow...", "...the garrison, believing their story, were thrown off their guard, and allowed a number of the Indians to come into their fort, while others were distributed about the company's warehouse. Then, after a little, the Great Sun gave a signal, and the Indians at once drew out their weapons and began a furious massacre of the garrison and all who were in or near the warehouse. And the same bloody work was carried on in the houses of the settlers outside of the fort. \"It was at nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the dreadful slaughter began, and before noon the whole male population of that French colony--seven hundred souls--were sleeping the sleep of death.

Also two mechanics, a tailor and a carpenter, were permitted to live, that they might be of use to their captors.

Fortunately, they generally passed early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when we were indoors, but one day, returning home to lunch, we heard distant strains dying away upon the Hythe Road. We hurried in. Ethelbertha ran down into the kitchen; it was empty!--up into Amenda's bedroom; it was vacant! We called.

She wrote to Hortense, on the 28th of March: \"To-morrow I shall leave for Navarre. I have but sixteen men for a guard, and all wounded. I shall take care of them; but in truth I have no need of them. I am so unhappy in being separated from my children that I am indifferent respecting my fate.\" At eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 29th Josephine took her carriage for Navarre. The Allies were rapidly approaching Paris, and a state of indescribable consternation filled the streets of the metropolis. Several times on the route the Empress was alarmed by the cry that the Cossacks were coming. The day was dark and stormy, and the rain fell in torrents. The pole of the carriage broke as the wheels sunk in a rut. Just at that moment a troop of horsemen appeared in the distance. The Empress, in her...", "...more. The tortoise, when he had thanked the king for his generosity, went home to his wife and told her to bring her calabashes to the tree. She did so, and they gathered plenty of foo-foo and soup quite sufficient for the whole family for that day, and went back to their house very happy. That night they all feasted and enjoyed themselves. But one of the sons, who was very greedy, thought to himself-- \"I wonder where my father gets all this good food from? I must ask him.\" So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he said to his father-- \"Tell me where do you get all this foo-foo and soup from?\" But his father refused to tell him, as his wife, who was a cunning woman, said-- \"If we let our children know the secret of the foo-foo tree, some day when they are hungry, after we have got our daily supply, one of them may go to the tree and gather more, which will break the Ju Ju.\" But the envious son, being determined to get plenty of food for himself, decided to track his...", "...separated to be fattened in the irrigated fields.

The mayor-domo of the Hacienda was good enough to give me a guide and fresh horses; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we set out to ascend the Campana, or Bell Mountain, which is 6400 feet high. The paths were very bad, but both the geology and scenery amply repaid the trouble. We reached, by the evening, a spring called the Agua del Guanaco, which is situated at a great height. This must be an old name, for it is very many years since a guanaco drank its waters. During the ascent I noticed that nothing but bushes grew on the northern slope, whilst on the southern slope there was a...", "...rough bumps, caused by eight or ten cattle which lay there across the lines: and when I picked myself up, and leapt, some seconds before the impact, the speed must have considerably slackened, for I received no fracture, but lay in semi-coma in a patch of yellow-flowered whin on level ground, and was even conscious of a fire on the lines forty yards away, and, all the night, of vague thunder sounding from somewhere. * * * * * About five, or half-past, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I was sitting up, rubbing my eyes, in a dim light mixed with drizzle.

A five-barred gate on my left opened into a hedge, and swung with creaks: two yards from my feet lay a little shaggy pony with swollen wan abdomen, the very picture of death, and also about me a number of dead wet birds. I picked myself up, passed through the gate, and walked up a...", "...Mr. Damant and his party, and felt sure that some trouble was at hand.

She was better, though still very weak, when an event occurred that shook the whole frontier.

Our Regiment took 16 officers and 34 men as prisoners, in this engagement. We lost Captain Richmond, one of the best officers in the Regiment, and a brave, noble fellow.

You know how Thorwaldsen loves music, and I sometimes play to him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> while he is at work. He has an excellent instrument in his studio, and when I look at the old gentleman and see him kneading his brown clay, and delicately fining off an arm, or a fold of drapery,--in short, when he is creating what we must all admire when completed, as an enduring work,--then I do indeed rejoice that I have the means of bestowing any enjoyment on him. Nevertheless, I have not fallen into arrear with my own tasks. The \"Hebrides\" is completed at last, and...", "...a plan. As Captain Burke announced that he would stop at Nassau for a day to take in some fresh stores, especially of fruit and vegetables, and to give Mrs. Cliff and Willy Croup an opportunity to see the place, the _Summer Shelter_ was soon deserted. But in the evening, everybody returned on board, as the company wished to keep together as long as possible, and there would be plenty of time in the morning for the members of the Synod to disembark and go to the hotel. Very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Captain Burke was aroused by the entrance of the sailing-master, Mr. Portman, into his state-room. \"'Morning, sir,\" said Mr. Portman. \"I want you to come out here and look at something!\" Perceiving by the manner and tones of the other that there was something important to be looked at, Captain Burke jumped up, quickly dressed himself, and went out on deck. There, fastened against the fore-mast, was a large piece of paper on which were written these words:-- \"We...", "...lashes in the world; in regarding her you felt yourself drawn to her by an irresistible power. It must have been difficult for the Empress to give severity to that seductive look; but she could do this, and well knew how to render it imposing when necessary. Her hair was very beautiful, long and silken, its nut-brown tint contrasting exquisitely with the dazzling whiteness of her fine fresh complexion. At the commencement of her supreme power, the Empress still liked to adorn her head <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with a red madras handkerchief, which gave her a most piquant Creole air, and rendered her still more charming. But what more than all else constituted the inexpressible charm of the Empress's presence were the ravishing tones of her voice. How many times have I, like many others, stopped suddenly on hearing that voice; simply to enjoy the pleasure of listening to it. It cannot perhaps be said that the Empress was a strictly beautiful woman; but her lovely...", "...the Boma Law Courts. I shall now give the experience of Rev. Mr. Scrivener, an English missionary, who in July, August and September, 1903, traversed a section of the Crown Domain, that same region specially assigned to King Leopold in person, in which Mr. Clark had spent so many nightmare years. We shall see how far the independent testimony of the Englishman and the American, the one extracted from a diary, the other from a succession of letters, corroborate each other: \"At six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> woke up to find it still raining. It kept on till nine, and we managed to get off by eleven. All the cassava bread was finished the day previous, so a little rice was cooked, but it was a hungry crowd that left the little village.

It was quite chilly, and we were very thinly clad and had brought no blankets, but all we could get after another hour's talk was a native mat and pillow, and a few old curtains to hang round three sides of the open shed and protect us a little from the cold breeze. We passed the rest of the night very uncomfortably, and determined to return <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and not submit any longer to such shabby treatment. We rose at daybreak, but it was near an hour before the interpreter made his appearance. We then asked to have some coffee and to see the Pumbuckle, as we wanted a horse for Ali, who was lame, and wished to bid him adieu.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the man loaded the table on his back and hurried home to his wife and children. \"We'll never be hungry again!\" he cried as he embraced his wife. \"Never again shall our children call for food when we have nothing to give them!\" \"How much did the king pay you?\" asked his wife in surprise. The good woman well knew how much it cost to buy food enough to keep all their children from going hungry. \"The king did not pay me in money. He gave me something better than...", "...him at home, and then we home.

On such occasions she would sweetly ask him to drop her at a certain place and to fetch her at a certain time; then she would disappear and Bobby would be left to spend the interval kicking his heels. She dressed modestly in a taste that was quiet and restrained.

His head ached a little, and when he moved there was a smarting sensation, but he felt disturbed mentally more than in body. He turned out of his hammock and dressed as quickly as the new stiff buttonholes of his uniform would allow, all the time suffering from a sensation of misery and discomfort which made his temper anything but amiable. \"How's your head?\" said Roylance, who was one of the last to wake....", "...opera now running in town was very funny. \"Paul, listen to me!\" she was crying desperately as these thoughts went through his head. \"Listen to me, and look honestly at the way we've been living since we were married, and you _must_ see that something's all wrong.

Betty was faithful to both her employers, which is extraordinary, considering the greatness of the temptation and her utter ignorance of good and evil. One day she ventured to ask Mrs. Sponge, if she could not assist her to get into a more settled way of life. She told her that when she rose <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she never knew where she should lie at night, nor was she ever sure of a meal beforehand. Mrs. Sponge asked her what she thought herself fit for. Betty, with fear and trembling, said there was one trade for which she thought herself qualified, but she had not the ambition to look so high--it was far above her humble views--that was, to have a barrow, and sell fruit, as several other of Mrs. Sponge's customers did, whom she had often looked up to with envy, little...", "...most strikingly positively heliotropic. Marine copepods can be made positively heliotropic by the lowering of the temperature alone, or by a sudden increase in the concentration of the sea-water. These data have a bearing upon the depth-migrations of pelagic animals, as was pointed out years ago by Theo. T. Groom and the writer. It is well known that many animals living near the surface of the ocean or freshwater lakes, have a tendency to migrate upwards towards evening and downwards <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and during the day. These periodic motions are determined to a large extent, if not exclusively, by the heliotropism of these animals. Since the consumption of carbon-dioxide by the green plants ceases towards evening, the tension of this gas in the water must rise and this must have the effect of inducing positive heliotropism or increasing its intensity. At the same time the temperature of the water near the surface is lowered and this also increases the positive...", "...to a single load; dumps had therefore been formed at a number of selected places in the surrounding districts, where the arms were temporarily deposited so as to allow the cars to return and perform the same duty several times during the night.

Crawford refused to leave the ship at either Larne or Bangor, feeling himself bound in honour to remain with the crew until they were safe from arrest by the naval authorities.

Suffice it to say that the need for fuel was urgent, that a number of the stronger captives would lay aside their tattered remnants of clothing, wade into the slimy muck of the swamp, and, sinking to their armpits, would pull up fragments of wood that had long been submerged. This was mostly pitch pine and when broken up would quickly burn. The work of exhuming fuel under such repulsive conditions was chiefly done at night. It was noticed that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the partially remaining foot-prints and depression, from which the stick had been drawn, were filled with clear water. This fact was a mystery until after the spring was opened; then the conclusion was reached that the spring water followed a deep seam in the clay and oozed into the swamp some distance below the surface and rose up through the openings made by the wood-diggers. Therefore Providence Spring was not especially created to order. Like Topsy, it had \"allus\"...", "...and showing every road and bypath.

Probably from want of ammunition, the cannonade had been suspended from seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until about eleven, and I took advantage of this lull to attempt my visit to the fortifications. I was about half-way up the hill when a shell burst a few score yards in front of me; another and another followed.

Once or twice I felt a strong inclination to commit it, a strange kind of fear, however, prevented me; at last I determined not to commit it, and, having said my prayers, I fell asleep. \"When I awoke <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the first thing I thought of was the mysterious sin, and a voice within me seemed to say, 'Commit it'; and I felt a strong temptation to do so, even stronger than in the night. I was just about to yield, when the same dread, of which I have already spoken, came over me, and, springing out of bed, I went down on my knees. I slept in a small room alone, to which I ascended by a wooden stair, open to the sky. I have often thought since that it is not a good thing for...", "...Mary had to take care of the home. But the wages Mrs. Slessor received were very small. Somehow they had to find ways of getting more money. When she was eleven years old Mary went to work in the factory, too. Would she ever get a chance to be a missionary or must she give up that dream? \"Mary, Mary,\" called Mrs. Slessor, \"it's five o'clock.

I don't want to be late!\" At six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Mary was at work. She had to tend to the shuttles on the weaving machines. The weaving sheds where Mary worked were damp and dark. All morning long she heard the whirring of the belts and the clacking of the looms. In the afternoon she went to school. By the time she was fourteen years old she was an expert weaver. She now began to work full time. The hours were long. Twelve hours every day for six days a week the fourteen-year-old girl worked in the factory. And the...", "...ten days. Their picket post was on the Shelbyville Pike, about two miles south of Stone River. On the 23d of June orders were received at camp to strike tents, and move out with the train on the 24th. Consequently, on the morning of the 24th, the train moved down the pike to where the regiment had been standing picket. The regiment was already gone, and the train followed after, taking the direction of Liberty Gap. The day was very disagreeable; a drizzling rain had set in early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and continued all day, wetting everything and everybody completely. In this plight the men lay on their arms all night. They were now in the neighborhood of the Gap, and it was reported that the enemy had a strong force there. The morning of the 25th was dark and cloudy, but the troops were early astir, and soon on the advance towards the Gap. About noon the enemy were observed in force immediately in front. A disposition was speedily made of our forces, and the...", "...open. To this the object of his solicitude was also opposed, so Mr. Newton bade him farewell. Katherine, however, waylaid him in the hall, and they held a short conference. \"He really ought not to be left alone at night.\" \"No, he must not,\" said Katherine. \"I will make our servant spend the night in the parlor. She can easily open the door after the lights are out, without his being vexed by knowing she is there. I could not sleep if I thought he was alone.

The hour and mode of rising should be inquired into. Practically all nervous people, and nearly all those beyond middle life, feel less fit <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> hours than at any other time in the day. Apparently as a consequence of their will having been allowed to lose its hold during sleep, it does not secure thorough command over the organism for some time. Nervous people, as a rule, wake up with a tired feeling, a dread of the day, wondering whether life is worth living. They dread--for it is a real dread--to get up and tackle the daily round of life once more. If they have nothing very definite to do, then slight tired...", "...THE WITCH OF FIFE In the Kingdom of Fife, in the days of long ago, there lived an old man and his wife. The old man was a douce, quiet body, but the old woman was lightsome and flighty, and some of the neighbours were wont to look at her askance, and whisper to each other that they sorely feared that she was a Witch. And her husband was afraid of it, too, for she had a curious habit of disappearing in the gloaming and staying out all night; and when she returned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she looked quite white and tired, as if she had been travelling far, or working hard. He used to try and watch her carefully, in order to find out where she went, or what she did, but he never managed to do so, for she always slipped out of the door when he was not looking, and before he could reach it to follow her, she had vanished utterly. At last, one day, when he could stand the uncertainty no longer, he asked her to tell him straight out whether she were a...", "...Parson Christian remained with him the weary night through. The wind moaned and howled outside. It licked the walls as with the tongues of serpents. The parson prayed fervently, but Hugh Ritson's voice never once rose with his. To and fro, to and fro, the dying man continued his direful walk. At one moment he paused and said with a ghastly smile, \"This dying is an old story. It has been going on every day for six thousand years, and yet we find it as terrible as ever.\" Toward three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he threw open the shutters. The windows were still dark; it seemed as if the dawn were far away. \"It is coming,\" he said calmly. \"I knew it must come soon. Let us go out to meet it.\" With infinite effort he pulled his ulster over his shoulders, put on his hat, and opened the door. \"Where are you going?\" said the parson, and his voice broke. \"To the top of the fell.\" \"Why there?\" Hugh Ritson turned his heavy eyes upon him. \"To see the new day dawn,\" he said,...", "...when the litter came she turned very pale and, if she had had even ten francs in her pocket, would have kept him at home. She walked to the hospital by the side of the litter and went into the ward where he was placed. The room looked to her like a miniature Pere-Lachaise, with its rows of beds on either side and its path down the middle. She went slowly away, and in the street she turned and looked up. How well she remembered when Coupeau was at work on those gutters, cheerily singing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> air! He did not drink in those days, and she, at her window in the Hotel Boncoeur, had watched his athletic form against the sky, and both had waved their handkerchiefs. Yes, Coupeau had worked more than a year on this hospital, little thinking that he was preparing a place for himself. Now he was no longer on the roof--he had built a dismal nest within.

The result is that the temperature of the soil is soon reduced below the temperature of the air, and the moisture, present in the air in the form of vapour, coming in contact with the cold surface of the earth, is condensed into dew, which is deposited, and is seen best early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> before the sun has had time to evaporate it again.

As we worked with hoes, I had no difficulty in learning how the work was to be performed. The fields of cotton at this season of the year are very beautiful. The plants, among which we worked this day, were about three feet high, and in full bloom, with branches so numerous that they nearly covered the whole ground--leaving scarcely space enough between them to permit us to move about, and work with our hoes. About seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the overseer sounded his horn; and we all repaired to the shade of some persimmon trees, which grew in a corner of the field, to get our breakfast. I here saw a cart drawn by a yoke of oxen, driven by an old black man, nearly blind. The cart contained three barrels, filled with water, and several large baskets full of corn bread that had been baked in the ashes. The water was for us to drink, and the bread was our breakfast.

For three years past he had never got up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> without hoping that by night time he would be sleeping in the cemetery.

Suddenly they were gone, and Joe felt that tingling sense of pride which never comes from the sensation of sharing in mere power or splendor or pompous might, but is so certain when the human touch modifies magnificence. And then the roaring of the pushpot engines achieved an utterly impossible volume. The whole interior of the Shed was misty now, but shining <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> light. And the Platform moved. At first it was a mere stirring. It turned ever so slightly to one side, pivoting on the ways that had supported it during building. It turned back and to the other side. The vapor thickened. From each jet motor a blast of blue-white flame poured down, and the moisture in the earth was turning into steam and stray wood-blocks into acrid smoke. The Platform turned precisely and exactly back to its original position, and Joe's heart...", "...and after a hurried meal, crossing the stream on the stones that were not submerged, I set off along the east bank.

I encamped for the night in the edge of a thicket, and made a fire to roast the bird which I plucked while waiting for a bed of coals. At daylight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I continued my course down the stream which was now much wider and deeper. Its edge was thickly fringed with bamboo, and the idea came to me that I might construct a raft from them, and float down stream to the coast; but then, the stream was apt to become suddenly shallow in places, and it contained many large stones, and after delaying for several days while constructing the raft, it might prove to be time and labor lost.

It is well for my poor turkeys that their tails contain no moisture; for on a night like this they would freeze stiff, and the least incautious movement of a fowl <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> would serve to crack its tail off--up to the pope's-nose. As I set my foot on the door-step, I went back to see whether the two snow-birds were in their nightly places under the roof of the porch--the guardian spirits of our portal.

A serious company, the flower of the different corps and associations, tried fellows of daring aspect, were assembled at early dawn in the hall of a tavern some distance from the town--an impressive sight for every student heart. On this day most of the sanguinary agreements of the memorable evening were to be settled in their proper order. The first matter in hand concerned the academic honor of the Hereditary Prince. The...", "...more--coming up again the third time as it seemed to Wayne--and his lips moved slowly. The preacher threw himself despairingly on the ground beside him. \"Speak, brother!

The most stirring of travelers was yet abed, the most enterprising of first-train catchers had not yet come down; there was a breath of midsummer sleep still in the air; through the half-opened windows that seemed to be yawning, the pinkish blue Atlantic beyond heaved gently and slumberously, and drowsy early...", "...at night, a slight breath from the land, and, by day, in the afternoon, a fresh breeze from the sea. In the forenoon of this day, we saw eight sail to the southward of us, and three between us and the land, besides two sallies and ten frigates. In the afternoon of the 28th, the Francis and the Bee being near the shore abreast of Calicut, the Zamorin sent off a boat desiring to speak with me, but I was too far shot to the southwards before the message reached me. The 2d April we got <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> into the bay of _Brinjan_, where we anchored in fourteen fathoms, within half a league of the town, a high peaked hill, like a sugar-loaf; bearing N.E. by E. by the compass, which is the best mark to know this place by, when the weather is clear. This is a good place for refreshments, having hens, cocoa-nuts, and goats in abundance, and plenty offish, together with excellent water springing from the rock; but we had to pay seventy dollars, a cloth vest, a fowling-piece,...", "...and thousands of them think differently as soon as they've got some sense.

There were certain dates which Doctor Johnson almost always commemorated in his private notebook--his birthday, the date of his wife's death, the Easter season and New Year's. In these pathetic little entries one sees the spirit that was dogmatic and proud among men abasing itself in humility and pouring out the generous tenderness of an affectionate nature. In these moments of contrition small peccadilloes took on tragic importance in his mind. Rising late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and the untidy state of his papers seemed unforgivable sins. There is hardly any more moving picture in the history of mankind than that of the rugged old doctor pouring out his innocent petitions for greater strength in ordering his life and bewailing his faults of sluggishness, indulgence at table and disorderly thoughts. Let us begin with his entry on September 18, 1760, his fifty-second birthday: RESOLVED, D.j. To combat notions of obligation.

At three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I strolled up the Embankment. It was a gala night for the homeless, for the police were elsewhere; and each bench was jammed with sleeping occupants. There were as many women as men, and the great majority of them, male and female, were old. Occasionally a boy was to be seen. On one bench I noticed a family, a man sitting upright with a sleeping babe in his arms, his wife asleep, her head on his shoulder, and in her lap the head of a sleeping youngster. The man's...", "...in her bed; she neither spoke nor breathed, yet her face was pink. \"I will go with you.\" He did not need to learn more. That rosy color, which has been observed in those asphyxiated by oxide of carbon, decided it. However, he questioned the maid. Nothing had occurred; she had talked with the cook in the kitchen, who, near midnight, went to her room in the fifth story, and then she went to bed in a small room contiguous to that of her mistress. During the night she heard nothing; <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she found her mistress in the state she mentioned, and immediately went for Monsieur Balzajette. Continuing his questions, Saniel asked her what Madame Dammauville did after the consultation with Monsieur Balzajette. \"She dined as usual, but less than usual, eating almost nothing; then she received a visit from one of her friends, who remained only a few minutes, before starting on a voyage.\" This was what he dreaded: Madame Dammauville might have told this...", "...of the recent journey of the King, our Sovereign, to Dresden. Since I had the honor to accompany His Majesty, I give myself the pleasure of seizing the moment of my return to inform you about them. On receipt of a letter from His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon, brought to the King May 24, by the Count of Saint Marsan, which contained the most obliging and friendly invitation to visit that monarch at Dresden, His Majesty resolved to depart at once; and having set forth very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 25th, he arrived that evening at Grossenhain, whither His Majesty the King of Saxony had sent Lieutenant von Zeschaud and Colonel von Reisky to meet him. His entrance into Dresden took place on the 28th, at ten in the morning. It was desired to make this a formal occasion, but His Majesty deemed it better to decline the profound honors. Nevertheless, a squadron of the mounted body-guard had awaited His Majesty at a good quarter of a league from the city, and...", "...the summer, we saw this bay where the Nascaupee River comes out from, from a distance; but we thought it was just only a bay, and high mountains all round, and we never thought a river came out from there. So we did not go in there at all. We saw also from a distance, where Beaver River run out from; but we thought it was only an island. So we still just went on and followed the map.

Monday, November 2nd.--Donald and Allan meeting Mr. Wallace, they arrived at Donald's in the evening. Mr. Wallace then told me of his trip after I left him; but he couldn't remember all, as he at last lost track of every thing.

He made Duncan a present of...", "...found me again in life. I came and your heart heaved; pain came to you and joy. You touched me and tingled into love.

To those who implored her with tears to put it on, she replied: \"If seditious persons assassinate me, so much the better; they will deliver me from a most sorrowful life.\" The fete of the Federation was celebrated in 1792 amidst extremely tragical preoccupations. Things had changed very greatly since the fete which had excited such enthusiasm two years earlier. On July 14, 1790, the Champ-de-Mars was filled at four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> by a crowd delirious with joy. At eight o'clock in the morning of July 14, 1792, it was still empty. The people were said to be at the Bastille witnessing the laying of the first stone of the column to be erected on the ruins of the famous fortress. On the Champ-de-Mars there was no magnificent altar served by three hundred priests, no side benches covered by an innumerable crowd, none of that sincere and ardent joy which throbbed in every heart two years before. For...", "...take his blood pressure to-morrow just to be on the safe side. Call me any time during the night if anything out of the ordinary happens. Keep him perfectly quiet.

In Cicero's \"Treatise on Old Age,\" we find Cato admiring Caius Sulpitius Gallus, who, when he sat down to write in the morning, was surprised by the evening; and when he took up his pen in the evening, was surprised by the appearance of the morning. SOCRATES sometimes remained a whole day in immovable meditation, his eyes and countenance directed to one spot, as if in the stillness of death. LA FONTAINE, when writing his comic tales, has been observed early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and late in the evening in the same recumbent posture under the same tree. This quiescent state is a sort of enthusiasm, and renders everything that surrounds us as distant as if an immense interval separated us from the scene. Poggius has told us of DANTE, that he indulged his meditations more strongly than any man he knew; for when deeply busied in reading, he seemed to live only in his ideas.

Philippina opened the door, but she did not wish to let Dorothea in. She forced an entrance, however, and, standing in the door, she inspected Philippina with the eye of arrogance, always a clear-sighted organ. \"Look out, Philippin', there's something rotten here,\" murmured Philippina to herself. Daniel was at work. He got up and looked at Dorothea, who carefully closed the door. \"Here I am, Daniel,\" she said, and breathed a sigh...", "...tongue, save from those few who are dear to me.

A voice, at any time of the day, is the rarest thing. But there is the rustle of branches <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> breeze; there is the music of a sunny shower against the window; there is the matin song of birds.

The total want of unity of action on the part of the Italians assured to the Austrians, not the victory, but the chance of rendering impossible Lamarmora's attempt to break through the quadrilateral. This no one can deny; but, on the other hand, if the Italian army failed in attaining its object, the failure-owing to the bravery displayed both by the soldiers and by the generals-was far from being a disastrous or irreparable one. The Italians fought from three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until nine in the evening like lions, showing to their enemies and to Europe that they know how to defend their country, and that they are worthy of the noble enterprise they have undertaken.

But I was anxious about the poor child; for her pallor during the evening had frightened me.

German artillery fire cleared the allied trenches, burying many of the British soldiers alive under mountains of earth and debris. This forced the line to retreat a full mile to Klein Zillebeke to the north. The kaiser witnessed this engagement and by his presence cheered the German soldiers on to the most desperate fighting. On the following day October 31, 1914, the crisis came. The fighting began along the Menin-Ypres road early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and advanced with great violence upon the village of Gheluvelt. The First and Third Brigades or the First Division were swept back and the First Coldstream Guards were wiped out as a unit. The whole division was driven back from Gheluvelt to the woods between Veldhoek and Hooge. The allied headquarters at Hooge were shelled. General Lomas was wounded and six or the staff officers were killed. The Royal Fusiliers who desperately stuck to their trenches fighting...", "...to put an end at once to his sufferings and life.

He remained himself at Verona until he could learn with certainty by which of these generals the first grand assault was to be made. On the evening of the 13th of January, tidings were brought him that Joubert had all that day been maintaining his ground with difficulty; and he instantly hastened to what now appeared to be the proper scene of action for himself. Arriving about two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> (by another of his almost incredible forced marches) on the heights of Rivoli, he, the moonlight being clear, could distinguish five separate encampments, with innumerable watch-fires, in the valley below.

It is not good for him to lie in bed after he wishes to rise, for nature is calling him to get up and exercise. The nervous individual not only should exercise systematically out of doors but he should play some game. You remember when we were children how much we loved to play? Well, to give up play when we grow up is all nonsense. And just because people quit playing is the reason they have wrinkles and frowns.

As soon as daylight came, the fact that the anticipated lynching had been successfully accomplished was noised through the town, and hundreds of men, women and children went to the scene to view the terrible but significant sight. Old women and young girls stood in the bright sunlight, and gazed at the murderer's body swaying slightly <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> breeze, without a shudder, and if their looks could be relied upon they, too, had given Witherill a mental trial and found him guilty.

Three nights later I was awakened about one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> by the report of a gun, and, running over instinctively to Seyyid Badshah, found the enemy had indeed come and shot him through the stomach.

These occasions are, when Miss Pupford finds an old pupil coming out under the head of Births, or Marriages. Affectionate tears are invariably seen in Miss Pupford's meek little eyes when this is the case; and the pupil-mind, perceiving that its order has distinguished itself--though the fact is never mentioned by Miss Pupford--becomes elevated, and feels that it likewise is reserved for greatness. Miss Pupford's assistant with the Parisian accent has a little...", "...Oblomof's servant Zakhar, the appearance of the room, if it were examined rather more critically, was amazing because of the neglect and carelessness which held sway there. On the walls, around the pictures, spiders' webs, loaded with dust, hung like festoons; the mirrors, instead of reflecting objects, would have served better as tablets for scribbling memoranda in the dust that covered them. The rugs were rags. On the sofa lay a forgotten towel; on the table you would generally find <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> a plate or two with the remains of the evening meal, the salt-cellar, gnawed bones, and crusts of bread. Were it not for these plates, and the pipe half smoked out and flung down on the bed, or even the master himself stretched out on it, it might easily have been supposed that the room was uninhabited, it was so dusty, so lacking in all traces of human care. On the etageres, to be sure, lay two or three opened books or a crumpled newspaper; on the bureau stood an...", "...saying to an applauding group: \"Now we hope for a chance to pepper these devilish Dutch traders. They have salted us too long. We know where their booty is stored. And we know also where the young girls live who wear gold chains.\" Under these circumstances the governor was compelled to yield. He appointed six commissioners to confer with the same number of the English. The parties met at Governor Stuyvesant's residence on his farm or bouwerie, at eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of August 27th. The terms were speedily settled, for the English would enforce any demands which they were disposed to make. There were twenty-three articles of agreement, entering into many details. The substance was that New Netherland passed over entirely to the English. The Dutch retained their property. If any chose to leave the country they could do so. The ships of the Dutch merchants could, for the six months next ensuing, trade freely with the Netherlands, as...", "...I succeeded in getting in the rear of the fire to save my brig. I ordered the men to hoist anchor and put out further in the bay, which saved it. These unfortunate events destroyed and marred the fortune of many. On the day before I called on a private banker, G., on the plaza, and presented my check for $800. He said to me, if it made no difference, it being steamer day (once a month they went East when the gold was shipped to the mint in Philadelphia by them), and if I would call <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for it, it would be an accommodation to him. I said I wanted to use it. He commenced weighing it out. I then thought it would make no difference to me and it was mean not to accommodate him, for I might want some favor of him. I said, if I can have it in three days without fail it would answer my purpose. He said, you can have it now, pouring the gold in the scales to weigh it. I said never mind, I don't want it now.

According to His custom, pitying their narrow-minded and short-sighted folly, the natural result of the long servitude to which they had been subject, the Lord promised to send both bread and flesh-meat. \"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, \"I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.

The bridge thrown up at Follonica was still intact up to seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> on the 10th, but the troops and the military and the civil train that remained followed the Po without crossing to Stellata, in the supposed direction of Ponte Lagoscura. Yesterday guns were heard here at seven o'clock in the morning, and up to eleven o'clock, in the direction of Legnano, towards, I think, the Adige.

When they returned to the camp for a hasty breakfast <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they reported that they had had a very busy night, as the beavers seemed to have become possessed with the idea that an attack was soon to be made upon them in their house. The result was they were very active all night, and persistent in their efforts to break through the new ice as it formed, and thus, if possible, keep some of their kitchens available in case of need. Some were so bold that if the Indians had been so inclined they could easily have speared them, as...", "...friendship is almost a passion. You see it constantly in girls and boys at school. It is the first vague craving of the heart after the master food of human life--Love. It has its jealousies, and humours, and caprices, like love itself.

The foreman dashed his hand upon the desk. 'Go it, Mister, go it,' he cried; 'anything else? Tell me Gladstone's dead next.' Sometimes about two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Penny would get sociable, and the sub-editor was always glad to respond. On those occasions they talked with bated breath of the amount of copy that would come in should anything happen to Mr. Gladstone; and the sub-editor, if he was in a despondent mood, predicted that it would occur at midnight. Thinking of this had made him a Conservative.

The body of the Visayan woman, or rather what had been a body, lay on the floor in the center of the room, a shapeless mass of crushed bones and flesh. An enormous python lay coiled in one corner. His mottled skin glistened <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> light, but he did not move, and his eyes were tight shut, as were those of the \"green devil\" after I had seen him feed. I looked backward, across the court yard. The door of the big bamboo cage beneath the trees was open. I turned to the room again and looked once more.

The close of the day saw him several miles away from the Hall, dubious whether he would not round his numerous adventures by sleeping at an inn; for he had lots of money, and the idea of jumping up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> in a strange place was thrilling. Besides, when he was shaken out of sleep by Sir Willoughby, he had been told that he was to go, and not to show his face at Patterne again. On the other hand, Miss Middleton had bidden him come back. There was little question with him which person he should obey: he followed his heart. Supper at an inn, where he found a company to listen to his adventures, delayed him, and a short cut, intended to make up for it, lost him his road. He...", "...Nann paused and stared at the one window in the loft that faced the sea. Her expression was more puzzled than fearful. For one brief second she had seen a white object pass that window. Dories turned to ask why her friend had delayed. Nann, not wishing to frighten the more timid girl, stooped to pick up a piece of driftwood that had slipped from her arms. \"I'm coming, dear,\" she said. On reaching the cabin, Nann went at once to the room of the elderly woman, who had told them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that she intended to remain in bed for one week and be waited on. There she was, her deeply-set dark eyes watching the door when Nann opened it and instantly she began to complain: \"I do wish you girls wouldn't go up and down those outside stairs any oftener than you have to.

Throughout the night of October 4, 1914, and the day and night of October 5, the battle raged about Lierre with savage ferocity. The British marines had by this time relieved the Belgians. The German fire, however, compelled the defenders to draw back a considerable distance. At four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of October 6, 1914, the Germans succeeded in crossing the river in force, and now the defenders were obliged to give way, as the outer forts had ceased to afford them any protection. Late in the afternoon the members of the Belgian Cabinet and their official families went aboard one steamer, while the French and British Legations boarded another, both sailing early on October 7. The Belgian troops had begun to withdraw the evening before. All the defending forces now...", "...were dozens of critical moments when it all but stopped, and not a few when it brought up altogether. The latter were very trying and tiring.\"[225] Altogether it was an encouraging day and we reckoned we had made seven miles. Generally it was not Scott's team which made the heaviest weather these days but on December 12 they were in greater difficulties than any of us. It was indeed a gruelling day, for the surface was worse than ever and many men were snow-blind. After five hours' work <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we were about half a mile forward. We were in a sea of pressure, the waves coming at us from our starboard bow, the distance between the crests not being very great. We could not have advanced at all had it not been for our ski: \"on foot one sinks to the knees, and if pulling on a sledge to half way between knee and thigh.\"[226] On December 13, \"the sledges sank in over twelve inches, and all the gear, as well as the thwartship pieces, were acting as breaks.

They did not, and every morning and afternoon Grace was ready in good season for her drive to Oakdale. The other children were glad of her company, and as by common consent always gave her the seat next to Lulu. For two weeks those short drives yielded the sisters all the intercourse they had. They met with a warm embrace <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> just before stepping into the carriage, and parted in the same way on their return to Viamede in the afternoon. Then Lulu went directly to her own room, shut herself in, and was seen no more by the other children till the next day. During that fortnight the confinement and solitude were her only punishment; her meals were brought to her and consisted of whatever she desired from the table where the family were seated; also books and toys were allowed her. Every...", "...air here was very mild. For some time we only listened to the sound of the waters. 'There are three things,' said Falconer at last, taking his pipe out of his mouth with a smile, 'that give a peculiarly perfect feeling of abandonment: the laughter of a child; a snake lying across a fallen branch; and the rush of a stream like this beneath us, whose only thought is to get to the sea.' We did not talk much that night, however, but went soon to bed. None of us slept well. We agreed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that the noise of the stream had been too much for us all, and that the place felt close and torpid. Andrew complained that the ceaseless sound wearied him, and Robert that he felt the aimless endlessness of it more than was good for him. I confess it irritated me like an anodyne unable to soothe. We were clearly all in want of something different. The air between the hills clung to them, hot and moveless. We would climb those hills, and breathe the air that flitted...", "...and were impudent fellows and seemed determined to get into everything. Mr. H. W. Henshaw was with us that summer collecting natural history specimens for the Smithsonian Institute. He was quite anxious to find the nest and eggs of this bird. I supposed from their abundance this would be a matter requiring little effort, but I found I was mistaken. I made it my special part that summer to locate a nest of these birds and was constantly on the lookout. I often went out with Mr. Henshaw <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when he would start on his day's round but generally lost out after the first hour. He was an athlete in size and finely proportioned and hardened to the work by constant practice, and could walk the legs off me in an hour's travel. I would then strike out for myself but was always looking for the Nut-cracker and trying to locate his nest. One day I saw him fly away from a hole some fifteen feet up in an old tree stump, the limbs having fallen away. This looked...", "...prepared for him an elegant lace stock, which all my entreaties could not induce him to put on. The Emperor's vest and breeches were always of white cassimere; he changed them every morning, and they were washed only three or four times. Two hours after he had left his room, it often happened that his breeches were all stained with ink, owing to his habit of wiping his pen on them, and scattering ink all around him by knocking his pen against the table. Nevertheless, as he dressed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for the whole day, he did not change his clothes on that account, and remained in that condition the remainder of the day. I have already said that he wore none but white silk stockings, his shoes, which were very light and thin, being lined with silk, and his boots lined throughout inside with white fustian; and when he felt an itching on one of his legs, he rubbed it with the heel of his shoe or the boot on the other leg, which added still more to the effect of the ink...", "...the sea; accordingly, the air over the land becomes heated and ascends, the fine cool breeze from the sea taking its place. Towards evening there is the equilibrium of temperature which produces a temporary calm. Soon the earth chills, and the sea is counterbalancingly warm--as sea-water is steadier as to temperature than is land--the air over the sea becomes warmer, and ascends, the current from the land rushing in to take its place. Hence during the night the wind is reversed, until <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> again the equilibrium is restored and there is a calm, so far as these are concerned. These are therefore called the \"land and sea breezes.\" Of course, it is within the tropics that these breezes are most marked.

Symptoms.--The onset is usually sudden; often the child is put to bed at night seemingly well and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> is found paralyzed in one or more limbs. High fever or chills, general feeling of illness, pain all over the body, decided brain symptoms, like delirium or convulsions and intermittent contractions of the muscles may usher in the disease.

I thought of her nearly the whole night, and by degrees the wish to see her again seized me, a confused desire at first, which gradually grew stronger and more intense. At last I made up my mind to spend the next day in Genoa to try to find her, and if I should not succeed, to take the evening train. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I set out on my search. I remembered the directions she had given me when she left me, perfectly--Victor-Emmanuel Street, house of the furniture-dealer, at the bottom of the yard on the right.

He was calm, his heart beat regularly, like that of a man resolved upon a dangerous but inevitable undertaking.

The carriage drew near and stopped. He heard the sound of the carriage steps being let down. All was bustle within the house.

That was all except when they chanced to meet during Bannon's irregular nightly wanderings about the elevator. As the days had gone by these conversations had been confined more and more rigidly to necessary business, and though this result was Peterson's own fringing about, still he charged it up as another of his grievances against Bannon.

Once they came to a gully six to eight feet wide, without a bridge, and it took a good deal of urging to get Tom's horse to make the leap across. \"If a fellow should tumble in there where would he go to?\" asked Sam, with a shudder. \"He'd go out of sight forever,\" replied Wumble solemnly. \"Some of those cuts are a thousand feet deep.\" \"What a mighty upheaval of nature there must have been here at one time,\" said Dick. By three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Tom was completely fagged out and could scarcely keep his eyes open. Gradually he dragged behind the others, his eyes closing every few minutes in spite of his efforts to keep them open. \"I wish I had a cup of strong coffee to keep me awake,\" he murmured. \"How much further are you going, Jack?\" \"A couple of miles or so,\" answered the old miner. \"Want a smoke? You can have my pipe.\" \"Thank you, but I don't smoke, and I guess it would only make me feel worse,\"...", "...years since, one Jane Wyatt, my wife's sister, being nurse to Baronet Rud's three eldest children and (the lady being deceased) the lady controller of that house, going late into a chamber where the maidservants lay, saw there no less than five of these lights together.

But at present, the courts of justice are scarce opened in Westminster Hall at the time when William Rufus used to go to dinner in it. All business is driven forward. The landmarks of our fathers, if I may so call them, are removed, and planted farther up into the day; insomuch, that I am afraid our clergy will be obliged, if they expect full congregations, not to look any more upon ten o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> as a canonical hour. In my own memory, the dinner has crept by degrees from twelve o'clock to three, and where it will fix nobody knows. I have sometimes thought to draw up a memorial in the behalf of Supper against Dinner, setting forth, that the said Dinner has made several encroachments upon the said Supper, and entered very far upon his frontiers; that he has banished him out of several families, and in all has driven him from his headquarters, and forced him to...", "...to your supper, for I mean to take this watch myself.\" They left me on the bridge.

We put off from the ship at six bells <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> watch. Dolly Venn, who was rated as fourth officer, was with me in the launch, and Harry Doe, the boatswain, at the tiller.

The colonel thanked him, and then drifted into the wider field of domestic delicacies,--the preserving of fruits, the making of pickles as practiced on the plantations by the old Virginia cooks,--the colonel waxing eloquent over each production, and the future wine merchant becoming more and more enchanted as the colonel flowed on. When he rose to go the grocer had a mental list of the things he would send the colonel <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> all arranged in his commercial head, and so great was his delight that, after shaking hands with me once and with the colonel three times, he would also have extended that courtesy to Chad had not that perfectly trained servant checkmated him by filling his extended palm with the rim of his own hat.

When turned out, it may be salted to taste. After the four hours' cooking, the grain and water are a kind of barley pudding. A dessertspoonful of this every half-hour, from eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till eight at night, will help wonderfully a weak stomach, if taken as the _only diet_. This is what is meant when \"barley pudding\" is prescribed in these articles.

This was about half-past three o'clock P.M. Here we met with Col. Vandever of Iowa, who gave us a very clear account of the battle. He had been with Gen. McDowell and Gen. Hunter, who with the strongest part of the army, had gone early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> a few miles north of the main road and crossed the creek to take the enemy in the flank. His division had very serious fighting, but had driven the enemy back and taken three of his batteries. At the hospital we were about one and a half miles from Generals Tyler and Schenck, Col. Sherman, etc., who were down the road in the woods and out of sight, with several regiments and a number of guns. Their troops, Vandever told us, were a good...", "...was not there, and in this his consciousness of David's essential rectitude helped him. David could not do a wrong thing, or an unworthy one. He wished he were more like David. The new humility extended to his love for Elizabeth. Sometimes, in his room or shaving before the bathroom mirror, he wondered what she could see in him to care about. He shaved twice a day now, and his face was so sore that he had to put cream on it at night, to his secret humiliation. When he was dressed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he found himself once or twice taking a final survey of the ensemble, and at those times he wished very earnestly that he had some outstanding quality of appearance that she might admire. He refused to think. He was content for a time simply to feel, to be supremely happy, to live each day as it came and not to look ahead. And the old house seemed to brighten with him.

That night, after the igloo was closed and we were eating our evening meal, we heard a sled drive up to the door and supposed our fish had arrived; but what was our joy when we recognized Koumania's voice driving the dogs, and then heard Henry at the door of our igloo. We then learned that they had reached the Dangerous Rapids only that afternoon, and while building the igloos the three young men we had seen <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> returned and reported having seen us up the river. As soon as Henry heard this he had the load dumped from one of the sleds, and took Koumania to drive and an Ooqueesiksillik native as guide, and came at once to report. He said it had been very difficult to get his party of natives away from the camps that they met daily, and that they had moved by portages, which doubled the distance.

The size of the auger and spile should be the same and the latter should be forced in tightly, and not fall out when the pail is full. Pure sap makes the clearest sirup and the lightest-coloured sugar. Every bit of dust, leaves, twigs, or bark that gets into the pail leaves its mark on the sugar even though strained out. So covers on the pails are preferred if one can afford them. Most of the sap runs between nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and noon. It has been found by tests that this morning sap has more sugar in it than that which runs later in the day. It is the custom in some places to throw away the ice if the sap freezes. This is very wasteful, for this ice contains about thirty per cent. of the sugar. Of course, melting ice is expensive business so one must try not to let his sap freeze. The sap in the storage jar or tank must not be allowed to get warm, though, as it may sour. It should be boiled...", "...never stops, because he wants to get it over.

If this move is made the trains should be thrown forward early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to the Ny River.

He was not in the least aware that so simple, so practical and so obviously essential a thing as his daily ride--as simple, practical and obviously essential as getting out of bed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and returning to bed at night--was moulding a mind always prone to develop meditative grooves. But it did develop his mind in the extraordinary way in which minds are moulded by the most simple habits.

There was no gap in the sky. 'It is a good sign--a shooting star,' he said to himself. 'It is a good sign for me. I know I am right. That was my sign.'

He lay for a little while with his head bending forwards, looking from his pillow out at the stars, then he went to sleep. At half past six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he suddenly opened his eyes. 'What is it?' he asked, and almost without interruption answered: 'Well, I've got to go through it.' His sleep had shaped him perfect premonition, which, like a dream, he forgot when he awoke. Only this naive question and answer betrayed what had taken place in his sleep. Immediately he awoke this subordinate knowledge vanished. Another fine day was striding in triumphant.

There the horses would be in readiness, and they would mount and ride off. Guy then went round to the Rue des Fosses and warned the men of the hour at which they were to assemble at the count's.

The fellow at the door was an exciseman--a race everywhere detested and with good cause, for besides the insolence of their manners nothing makes a man feel more like a slave than the inquisitorial search they are accustomed to make through one's clothes and most secret possessions. He asked me if I had anything contraband; and being in a bad temper at being deprived of my...", "...Leone S. 73 deg. E. 173 miles.

As he went along he thought of the stories he had heard, but most of all he thought of Prince Tasmir and wondered if he were still alive.

The force with which he started, at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 3rd, consisted of the five hundred and sixty sailors, who drew with them six guns, six hundred and fifty European infantry, a hundred European artillery, and eight hundred Sepoys. Half the Sepoys led the advance, the remainder covered the rear. Soon after daybreak, the Sepoys came in contact with the enemy's advanced guard, placed in ditches along a road leading from the head of the lake to the Mahratta Ditch.

When she was alone Drusilla sat before the fire and tried to feel that it all was true, that it was not some beautiful dream from which she would waken. She went in retrospect over her past life from the time when, a little girl, her father dying, she and her mother were left with no...", "...done when the water came through the thatch. He said if the water lies all about on the top of the ceiling it breaks it down, but if you make holes the water will only come through the holes and you can put pails under the holes to catch it.\" So we made nine holes in the ceiling with the poker, and put pails, baths, and tubs under, and now there was not so much water on the floor. But we had to keep on working like niggers, and Mrs. Pettigrew and Alice worked the same. About five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the rain stopped; about seven the water did not come in so fast, and presently it only dripped slowly. Our task was done. This is the only time I was ever up all night. I wish it happened oftener. We did not go back to bed then, but dressed and went down. We all went to sleep in the afternoon, though.

I had been advised to shave my moustache off and to change my dress, but I left myself to fate. I stayed overnight at Tientsin, and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> went on board the _Chungking_. I had to go as an ordinary Chinese passenger, because I was afraid if I asked for a cabin I should again be refused a passage on account of the absence of baggage.

For instance I have...", "...with the boating company. We were alongside a French vessel, the Notre Dame de la Garde, taking in boxes of Gossage's blue mottled soap. Before we had received more than a quarter of our appointed cargo, the wind and the sea rose suddenly together. We had to cast off from the vessel, and in getting clear the lighter shipped some water. Before we got the hatches fixed, a number of the boxes had broken up, and the fragments, mixed with bars of soap, were awash. It was about eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when we cast loose and dropped our anchor. The wind increased to a gale; this brought a bitterly cold rain. We bobbed and curtsied at the end of our cable until about four in the afternoon, listening to Gossage's products churning and lathering down below. It grew colder and colder; we were wet to the skin and almost numbed.

Just as I was wrapping myself in my blanket for the night, Joe turned abruptly to me and said: \"Look here, I ain't your sort; you'll get a better mate. We'll shake hands <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and say goodbye.\" When I awoke in the grey dawn Joe had already risen, lit the fire, packed his swag, and brewed our last pinch of tea in the billy.

After breakfast Mrs. Tracy, who was suffering from a sick headache, declared her inability to sit up a moment longer and returned to her bed, leaving her husband and the servants to bring what order they could out of the confusion reigning everywhere, and nowhere to a greater extent than in Arthur's room, or rather the rooms which he had appropriated to himself, and...", "...a nod, and the affair was over. My Yankee friend collected one franc for that part of the business.

A few stars were shining, but the general heavens were overcast, and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds.

Indeed, having succeeded in the main point, the Archbishop judged it wise to concede every inferior consideration to a person of the Constable's rank and character, whose good-will to the proposed expedition was perhaps as essential to its success as his bodily presence. In short, the Constable returned to his pavilion highly satisfied with the manner in which he had extricated himself from those difficulties which <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> seemed almost insuperable; and when his officers assembled to disrobe him, (for great feudal lords had their levees and couchees, in imitation of sovereign princes,) he distributed gratuities amongst them, and jested and laughed in a much gayer humour than they had ever before witnessed. \"For thee,\" he said, turning to Vidal the minstrel, who, sumptuously dressed, stood to pay his respects among the other attendants, \"I will give thee nought at present; but do thou...", "...the beauteous lady. \"And thou shalt saddle ten steeds so free And ride away like gallant noble, Heading our house's chivalry To stand by Valborg in her trouble. \"Full seven sons, my lord, have we, They all are counts so bold and sprightly; It is our joy and pride to see They bear themselves so well and knightly. \"Two cousins I and Julli were-- The peace of God attend upon her!

As usual, a way out began to appear when things had become almost as gloomy as seemed possible. As for Dick, he eagerly seized upon the chance to be doing something. Like most pioneer boys, these Armstrong lads had been brought up to strive to the utmost when there was anything worth while to be attained. \"Oh, thank you, Captain Clark, and you, too, Captain Lewis!\" he hastened to say, \"that is the kindest thing you could do for us.

But by the middle of the second week,--'t was horrible! the hours seemed to roll over me like mill-stones. When I awoke <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I felt like an Indian devotee, the day coming upon me like the great temple of Juggernaut; cracking of my bones beginning after breakfast; and if I had any respite, it was seldom for more than half an hour, when a newspaper seemed to stop the wheels;--then away they went, crack, crack, noon and afternoon, till I found myself by night reduced to a perfect jelly,--good for nothing but to be ladled into bed, with a greater horror than ever at the thought of sunrise.

Soon after daybreak on the 30th October the population began streaming in from all parishes, under the mild splendour of a cloudless heaven. The scene was on the sands of S. Aubin's Bay, between the Mont Patibulaire and Millbrook. On the right wing stood two squadrons of mounted infantry, with their standards displayed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> breeze. On the left were the parish batteries, with their guns, caissons, and tumbrils. In the centre were the Cornish body guard and the militia infantry in battalion six deep, while the reserve and recruits brought up the rear. All but the last-named carried matches for their firearms, which were loaded with blank cartridge. The supports carried pikes. The drums beat, the colours flew, as Charles and his staff, surrounded by an escort of the mounted infantry, emerging...", "...wants you to come over there,\" Mrs. Carrick said to her daughter. \"Then I'll have to read my paper myself,\" Mr. Carrick complained. Grandad wanted her to go over some papers. They were all right, he knew, but two heads were better than one, if one was a pin's head. Then she must gossip awhile with Norah, while grandad leaned back in his chair and snored. Her father came for her, and she went to bed to the music of the dainty poems read in an impressive voice. And when she awoke <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> there seemed a strange music surging in her ears, and in her heart, and she listened to it like one entranced. But she had gone past the days of fairy lore, she was no longer a little girl to build wonderful magic haunts, and people them. Yet what was it, this new anticipation of something to come that would exceed all that had gone before? It came on to rain at noon, a sort of sullen autumn storm, with not much wind at first, but it would gain power at nightfall....", "...know about that,\" said Grace dubiously. \"I saw him with Eleanor in the run-about the other day.

She understood Anne's growing despair as time went on, and the prospect of earning enough money to defray her college expenses grew less. \"I'm afraid I'll have to give it all up for next year at least, Grace,\" Anne's voice trembled a little. \"But perhaps I can enter the year...", "...remains, by the side of which lay his sword, at the same time pronouncing with the deepest emotion a glowing eulogium of the worth and character of him who, frozen stiff and cold, had been found half buried in his winding-sheet--a Canadian snow-drift.

The latter was heading up for the Straits from the southward, and the officer judged her to be not more than three or four miles on the port bow. Captain Brown, who meant business, was sleeping in his clothes in the chart-room, and was on the bridge in ten seconds, peering over the search-light with his big binocular. At two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> even the largest yachts do not show such a blaze of lights as passenger steamers generally do all night, and the one Captain Brown was watching had only two or three, besides the regulation ones. She might be white, too, though she might be a light grey, but he thought on the whole that she was painted white. She was rigged as a two-masted fore-and-aft schooner.

She was also of about the...", "...burdock wive; And if thou wouldst keep thy son, See that bine and gith have none.\" So we were compelled to go down the field and up it, striking in and out with care where the green blades hung together, so that each had space to move in and to spread its roots abroad.

For, instead of keeping the good ash moving, they would for ever be finding something to look at or to speak of, or at any rate, to stop with; blaming the shape of their tools perhaps, or talking about other people's affairs; or, what was most irksome of all to me, taking advantage as married men, and whispering jokes of no excellence about my having, or having not, or being ashamed of a sweetheart. And this went so far at last...", "...quite low, not two ells above the ground, so that they might be easily caught.

Jock sat up till three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and finished it, but he could not pain his mother by letting her know that her son had again failed, so Allen had the money, and really believed, as he said, that all Jock had done was to put the extreme end to it, and correct the medical lingo of which he could not be expected to know anything.

It was long ago observed that the shadows are more opaque <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> than in the evening; the struggle between the light and the darkness more marked, the gloom more solid, the contrasts more sharp, etc. The rays of the morning sun chisel out and cut down the shadows in a way those of the setting sun do not.

Then, as it chanced, I looked across at the statue of Liberty, and saw that the great bronze was gleaming green <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> light. I had made all the obvious jokes about the statue of Liberty. I found it had a soothing effect on earnest Prohibitionists on the boat to urge, as a point of dignity and delicacy, that it ought to be given back to the French, a vicious race abandoned to the culture of the vine. I proposed that the last liquors on board should be poured out in a pagan libation before it. And then I suddenly remembered that this Liberty was still in some sense enlightening the world,...", "...journey, the wellknown voices of our friends still ring in our ears, the parting kiss feels still warm uppon our lips, & that last seperating word _Farewell!_ sinks deeply into the heart.

As they talked, steps were heard outside; and then, without waiting to knock, a sergeant of the King's guard forced open the door, and, followed by a handful of soldiers, entered the wretched room and took the merchant and his son prisoners. They spent the night on the straw in the royal dungeons, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> were led before the King. On seeing the merchant, the irate King scowled more angrily than ever,--for the loss of the Emerald of the Sea had never ceased from troubling him,--and said:-- \"Well, have you found the Emerald of the Sea?\" \"No,\" said the poor merchant. \"Summon the executioner!\" cried the King. And now the poor man would certainly have bade farewell to earth, had not the youngest son, like his brothers, interceded with the King. At first the King...", "...neck.

After the delightful evening at the Craig's, part of which I have tried to describe here, because there was a short, sweet interview at the garden gate after most of the guests had retired, in which the readers are not at all interested, I went to bed, determined in my own mind that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I should make the final break for home. I do not remember now whether I dreamed of the girl I was to leave behind me there, or that my visions were of \"Home, sweet home.\" Of course, it was cruel to be obliged to tear myself away from them so ruthlessly, just when it was becoming interesting, but I consoled myself with the reflection that I had survived these heart-troubles before--several times. In the first place I had deliberately separated from my really and truly...", "...Gaw wrote to Mr. Maitland in Philadelphia, to whom he referred, and received an answer that Mr. Maitland was dead and none of the family knew him. He remained in that prison nearly two months. He then had a trial in court before a Judge Grier (most unfortunate name), who sentenced him to be sold to pay his fine and expenses, amounting to fifty dollars. After a few days and _without being offered at public sale_, he was taken out of jail at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and carried to Campbell's slave pen, in Baltimore, where he remained several months. While there, he was employed to cook for some fifty or sixty slaves, being told that he was working out his fine and jail fees. After being there about six months, he was taken out of prison, handcuffed by one Winters, who took him and two or three others to Washington and thence to Charleston, S.C. Here Winters left them, and they were taken by steamboat to...", "...was prepared to overwhelm him with a relation of my symptoms in detail.

Pugasceff did not lose his presence of mind, but, gently lifting the woman up, he said to his officers:--\"Look after this woman; her husband was a great friend of mine and I owe him much.\" But every one knew that the sham-Czar was no other than the husband of Marianka, and no doubt the appearance of the peasant woman told on the spirits of the insurgent troops. The most bitter and decisive battle of the insurrection awaited them. The night divided the two armies, and it was only <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that Michelson could force his way into the town, whence he sent word to the people of Kazan to come to his assistance. Pugasceff again attacked him with embittered fury, and as he could not dislodge him he withdrew the remainder of his troops from Kazan and encamped on the plain. The third day of the battle, fortune turned to the side of Pugasceff.

The Russian Minister at Seoul at this time, M. Waeber, was a man of very fine type, and he was backed by a wife as gifted and benevolent as himself. He had done his best to keep in touch with and help the King. Now a further move was made. The Russian Legation guard was increased to 160 men, and almost immediately afterwards it was announced that the King had escaped from his jailers at the palace, and had taken refuge with the Russians. A little before seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the King and Crown Prince left the palace secretly, in closed chairs, such as women use. Their escape was carefully planned. For more than a week before, the ladies of the palace had caused a number of chairs to go in and out by the several gates in order to familiarize the guards with the idea that they were paying many visits. So when, early in the morning, two women's chairs were carried out by the attendants, the guards took no special notice. The King and his son...", "...\"Jove! what a detective you will make.

This house for more than a year had been known to be occupied only by one Captain Burbage, a retired seaman of advanced years, his elderly...", "...and Captain Arthur. In his \"True Relation,\" Smith gives some account of his exploration of the Pamunkey River, which he sometimes calls the \"Youghtamand,\" upon which, where the water is salt, is the town of Werowocomoco. It can serve no purpose in elucidating the character of our hero to attempt to identify all the places he visited. It was at Werowocomoco that Smith observed certain conjurations of the medicine men, which he supposed had reference to his fate. From ten o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till six at night, seven of the savages, with rattles in their hands, sang and danced about the fire, laying down grains of corn in circles, and with vehement actions, casting cakes of deer suet, deer, and tobacco into the fire, howling without ceasing. One of them was \"disfigured with a great skin, his head hung around with little skins of weasels and other vermin, with a crownlet of feathers on his head, painted as ugly as the devil.\" So fat they fed him that he much...", "...UP TO THE TIRED DOGS] Another dog played out that day and was shot, leaving me with thirty. At the end of this march we could see the mountains of Grant Land in the far distance to the south, and the sight thrilled us. It was like a vision of the shores of the home land to sea-worn mariners. Again, the next day, we made a double march. Starting late in the afternoon we reached the sixth outward camp, \"boiled the kettle,\" and had a light lunch; then plunged on again until early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 20th, when we reached the fifth outward camp. So far we had seemed to bear a charm which protected us from all difficulties and dangers. While Bartlett and Marvin and, as I found out later, Borup had been delayed by open leads, at no single lead had we been delayed more than a couple of hours. Sometimes the ice had been firm enough to carry us across; sometimes we had made a short detour; sometimes we halted for the lead to close; sometimes we used an ice-cake...", "...even told Pop.\" \"Does it have anything to do with Sweeper Joe?\" Sally's expression became blank. \"I don't know much about him,\" she dismissed the subject. \"My information concerns a certain house upriver.

The roads were impassable for wheels by reason of the hailstones, so they walked or rode on horseback. The mail came late with ill tidings from all over the province.

Not so, however, Dobbs. \"Werry sorry, sir, but there's no heggs,\" he replied to this somewhat imperative order from Master Tommy, looking absolutely crestfallen at having thus to confess the shortcomings of his commissariat. \"The...", "...could you, dear, with your heart so full of other things?\" Sir William replied, tenderly; \"and I want no thanks other than to see you looking like a bride,\" he concluded, smiling. \"I did this chiefly to gratify my own pride in my love.\" He led her to the foot of the stairs, and then, with a lingering clasp, let her go. It was quite late, and Virgie thought that she would only allow herself a peep into the mysterious trunk that night; but she resolved that she would rise very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and lay out everything in readiness for the wedding. She wondered how Sir William could have managed it all, and was somewhat anxious regarding the fit of her bridal dress; but she was set at rest upon that point when she lifted the lid of the trunk and found a waist of one of her own dresses lying upon the top of various packages, and she knew that he had sent it as a measure and guide. Everything else was wrapped in fine packing paper, and she concluded not to...", "...only one mine is entrusted to one foreman, nay, rather sometimes two or three foremen are set over one mine.

The three remaining hours are intermediate between the shifts, and form an interval during which the workmen enter and leave the mines. The first shift begins at the fourth hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and lasts till the eleventh hour; the second begins at the twelfth and is finished at the seventh; these two are day shifts in the morning and afternoon. The third is the night shift, and commences at the eighth hour in the evening and finishes at the third in the morning.

It is not easy to read either series, or to disentangle one from the other. In the West the Setting Sun is just alighting, with folding wings. The luminary, which <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> was male, to represent the essentially masculine spirit, the upwardness and onwardness of opening day, has now become female in its quality of brooding evening. In fact, this same figure, which the sculptor shows in the Palace of Fine Arts, is there called by him \"Descending Night.\" The frieze at the base of the shaft of the Setting Sun is as difficult to interpret as the other.

And so as the years passed on he was much esteemed for his feats as a hunter, and his strength and endurance were by-words among the Illinois. He had been fifteen years among them when he heard them speak of an expedition against the Senecas. He begged to join, and they listened with delight when he declared that he, Ga-geh-djo-wa, would bring home more scalps than any. \"He is one of us,\" they said, and gave him the permission he craved. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the warriors started, and, delighted with his eloquence and readiness to go against his own tribe, they elected him chief of the expedition. They marched on and on for many days, little guessing how his heart beat as they approached the wigwams of the Seneca settlement. He began to issue orders for the attack. \"Send scouts,\" he said, \"to the sugar camp, and let them hide in a bush, and return and tell us what they have seen.\" Two warriors obeyed his directions, but...", "...for a short time along a deeply-beaten road made by the reindeer which turned suddenly off to the south-west, a direction so wide of our course that we could not venture upon following it.

Wheat has nearly twice the quantity of sugar and starch that rye contains, and it is besides easier to digest. And as it is our principal duty in the morning to replace as quickly as possible what we have lost during the night, it is a matter of importance to give the stomach such food as is both nutritive and quickly digested. CHAPTER VI. BREAKFAST. Workmen, even those who must perform hard labor, are sufficiently strengthened by coffee and wheat bread <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to begin their work. But to be able to continue it, a more substantial breakfast is necessary, since coffee and bread alone would only replace what was lost during the night. On the continent of Europe it is therefore the custom to take coffee, or milk, and bread very early, and, at about nine or ten o'clock a more substantial meal, a kind of lunch. Breakfast is with but few the principal meal of the day; for those, however, who rise early it is the one taken with the...", "...at a depth of only fifty meters.

It had been decided to tow the vessel into the nearest port, using her as a prison ship in the meantime.

The first thing that recalled the actual position of affairs to his mind was feeling under the pillow for his watch: a fruitless search that ended in recalling something of the overnight's proceedings. Pacey liked a cheap flash, and when elated with wine might be betrayed into indiscretions that his soberer moments were proof against. Indeed, among youths of his own age he...", "...ready to start to Mombasa to catch a ship for Bombay. A telegram unexpectedly arrived, saying that the boat would not sail until three days later, so we decided to put in two or three more mornings of shooting out beyond the limits of the city.

Into this vehicle we placed our guns, and at seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> drove out of the town. In fifteen or twenty minutes we had passed through the streets and had reached the pleasant roads of the open plains. Soon we passed the race-track and then bowled merrily along between peaceful barbed-wire fences. Occasional groups of Kikuyus were tramping along the road, bringing in eggs or milk to Nairobi. A farm-house or two lay off to either side, and once or twice we passed boys herding little bunches of ostriches. At about a quarter to...", "...while I made a rapid drawing of the place. The quick chimes of the monastery, through which we fancied we could hear the warning boat-bell, suddenly pierced through the forest, recalling us. The Valamo had her steam up, when we arrived, and was only waiting for her rival, the Letuchie (Flyer), to get out of our way. As we moved from the shore, a puff of wind blew away the fog, and the stately white monastery, crowned with its bunch of green domes, stood for a moment clear and bright <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> sun. Our pilgrims bent, bareheaded, in devotional farewell; the golden crosses sparkled an answer, and, the fog rushed down again like a falling curtain. We steered nearly due north, making for Kexholm, formerly a frontier Swedish town, at the mouth of the River Wuoxen. For four hours it was a tantalizing struggle between mist and sunshine,--a fair blue sky overhead, and a dense cloud sticking to the surface of the lake. The western shore, though near at hand, was not...", "...a bed in it.

All this while he drank freely too, and about one <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we went into the coach again. The air and the shaking of the coach made the drink he had get more up in his head than it was before, and he grew uneasy in the coach, and was for acting over again what he had been doing before; but as I thought my game now secure, I resisted him, and brought him to be a little still, which had not lasted five minutes but he fell fast asleep. I took this opportunity to search him to a nicety. I took a gold watch, with a silk purse of...", "...Mithridates again pursues the Greeks, but is repulsed.

It was not till they had got over, however, that Mithridates again made his appearance, having now with him a thousand horse, and archers and slingers to the number of four thousand; for he had solicited and obtained that number from Tissaphernes, promising that, if he received them, he would deliver the Greeks into his...", "...to beg his forgiveness for all the harm he had done him.

But it was harder for him to write a letter than a score of music: and after he had cursed and cursed the pen and ink of the hotel--which were, in fact, horrible--after he had blotted, criss-crossed, and torn up five or six sheets of paper, he lost patience and dropped it. The rest of the day dragged wearily: but Christophe was so worn out by his sleepless night and his excursions <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that at length he dozed off in his chair. He only woke up in the evening, and then he went to bed: and he slept for twelve hours on end. * * * * * Next day from eight o'clock on he sat waiting for the promised letter.

One of the party, however, pursued and came up with a woman and child, whom he detained, from an opinion that the men might be thereby induced to return; but, although she remained with them the whole of the night, which she passed in tears and lamentations, not knowing what fate might await her, the men did not appear. They, therefore, made her a present of a small hatchet, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> sent her back to her friends. Wilson, understanding something of the language of these mountain natives, hoped to have gained some information of the country from this woman; but she could not comprehend him.

Out of six years campaigning it is probable that I slept at least half the period under the open canopy of heaven, (barring latterly a sheet of canvas,) and though more than twenty years have since rolled over my head, I think I could still point out my every resting place. On the night of the 1st of May I was sent from Alameda with thirty riflemen and six dragoons to watch a ford of the Agueda. The French held a post on the opposite side--but at daylight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I found they had disappeared. Seeing a Spanish peasant descending on the opposite bank--and the river not being fordable to a person on foot, while its continuous roaring through its rugged course drowned every other voice--I detached one of the dragoons, who brought him over behind him, and as he told me that the French were, at that moment, on the move to the left, I immediately transmitted the information to head quarters. I was soon after ordered to join my...", "...said Leslie, hurriedly; \"but there was the vein of natural sin within.\" \"Natural nonsense, sir!\" cried Uncle Luke, angrily. \"How dare you!

I suppose I deserve it.\" \"Yes,\" cried the old man, \"if only for daring to judge her, when I tell you, that with all my knowledge of her and her life, I dare not. No, my lad, I'm going to sleep on it, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> see if I can't find out the end of the thread, of the clue which will lead us to the truth.\" \"There is no need,\" groaned Leslie. \"We know the truth.\" \"And don't even know who this man is. No, indeed, we do not know the truth. All right, my lad, I can read your looks. I'm a trusting, blind, old fool, am I?

Plato taught that music is as essential to the mind as air is to the body, and that children should be familiarized with harmonies and rhythms that they might be more gentle, harmonious and rhythmical, consequently better fitted for speech and action. \"Song brings of itself a cheerfulness that wakes the heart to joy,\" exclaimed Euripides, and certain it is a large measure of joy surrounds those who live in an atmosphere of music. It has a magic...", "...nor will the stoutest heart meditate unappalled upon the dreadful anecdotes connected with the spot.\"[4] Scenes of this description frequently give rise to marvellous stories; and Lydford Bridge has furnished many themes for the gossip's tongue. It is related, that a London rider was benighted on this road, in a heavy storm, and, wishing to get to some place of shelter, spurred his horse forward with more than common speed. The tempest had been tremendous during the night; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the rider was informed that Lydford Bridge had been swept away with the current. He shuddered to reflect on his narrow escape; his horse having cleared the chasm by a great sudden leap in the middle of his course, though the occasion of his making it at the time was unknown. Two or three persons have chosen this spot for self-destruction; and in a moment of desperation, have dashed themselves from the bridge into the murky chasm. [1] Dartmoor appears the...", "...one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We have provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game. Forward!\" The reporter's proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received general approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest, and by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would be ended. But there was not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they could not hope to reach Granite House before night. At six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the little band set out. As a precaution the guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received orders to beat about the edge of the forest. From the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which was rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations bringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no debris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a...", "...have appetites just like wolves.\" \"Well, I'll certainly do my best to see that they get enough. They'll have earned it. What else?\" \"They'll want people to hand them their tools, and run little errands for them. And if the weather is very hot, they'll be terribly thirsty, too, and we'll be able to keep busy seeing that they have plenty of cooling drinks. Oh, we'll be busy, all right! Come on, let's go to bed.\" CHAPTER VII THE HOUSE RAISING The sun was scarcely up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when Eleanor turned out and aroused the girls. \"We've got to get our own breakfast out of the way in a hurry, girls,\" she said, \"When country people say early, they mean early--EARLY! And we want to have coffee and cakes ready for these good friends of ours when they do come. A good many of them will come from a long way off and I think they'll all be glad to have a little something extra before they start work. It won't hurt us a bit to think so, and act accordingly...", "...design and beauty. It was the same cup made anew. So, my young friends, our bodies may dissolve in the grave and entirely disappear, but God is able to raise them up again. He tells us in the Bible that these bodies which are buried in corruption shall be raised in incorruption, and that these mortal bodies shall put on immortality. I trust that I have illustrated to you how the soul and the body are separated when we die, and God's Word assures us that they shall be reunited again <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the resurrection, for all these dead bodies \"shall hear the voice of the Son of God and shall come forth.\" It matters not whether they were buried in the ground, or in the water, they shall arise from every sea and from every cemetery, and every grave in all the world, and shall live anew and forever, either in happiness with God in heaven, or in misery with Satan in eternal banishment from God's presence. QUESTIONS.--What are the principal parts of...", "...an hour of enjoyment after his own heart; and with all the depth of his love for Luciana, he was evidently suffering from her present behavior. The monkeys had to give place to a collation. Round games followed, and then more dancing; at last, a general uneasy vacancy, with fruitless attempts at resuscitating exhausted amusements, which lasted this time, as indeed they usually did, far beyond midnight. It had already become a habit with Luciana to be never able to get out of bed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> or into it at night. About this time, the incidents noticed in Ottilie's diary become more rare, while we find a larger number of maxims and sentences drawn from life and relating to life. It is not conceivable that the larger proportion of these could have arisen from her own reflection, and most likely some one had shown her varieties of them, and she had written out what took her fancy. Many, however, with an internal bearing, can be easily recognized by the red...", "...19_.--I asked the women to come early this afternoon to have their voices tried with a view to their taking parts in the hymns. A good many came and seemed to enjoy the novelty. Several will sing alto, which they very quickly picked up. I asked them because I thought they might feel a little out in the cold if the men learnt part-singing and they did not. [Illustration: A PENGUIN ROOKERY] About five o'clock the children ran in to say that Graham and the men, who had gone early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to the Penguin Rookery, were returning. They always light a fire on the mountain side to show they are coming back. I started off immediately for Big Beach, Mrs, Repetto and Mrs. Swain coming behind with tea for their husbands. In front were the children leading a donkey to carry the eggs. Before long the men appeared, each with a big box of eggs on his back. The box is enclosed in a sack to which are attached arm-straps. Each box contains about one hundred and fifty...", "...an affectionate troubadour, who looked on at the combat and chanted it, often with friendly irony. He was much like a dependent and devoted younger brother. Geoffrey did not argue about him, and was fonder of him than of anything else in the world. He was glad of the restful week after a fatiguing session, and looked to see Maurice's future settled, the arabesque engraved upon a good, solid blade of prosperity, before he left Trensome Hall. CHAPTER VII Felicia was up early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> after her arrival, and while she made a leisurely toilet she was thinking, smiling as she thought, about the last evening. An altogether novel one in her experience. She had never before been conscious of being interested in so many people, and, especially, she had never before been conscious of interesting anybody. Now she was almost sure that last night she had much interested one person. The brightest spot in this consciousness had been after her own performance at...", "...outside, had built one, and hot-water pipes had been put in; and her love of flowers was so great that she would run down the garden even when the ground was covered with snow to stoke up the fire, if she thought she had forgotten to do so, saying that they would have no tulips, or lily of the valley, or azaleas for the altar, if the temperature were allowed to drop. Her talk was all about her garden, and when the spring returned she was working there constantly with Sister Mary John <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till the Angelus rang at twelve; then they went into dinner, and as soon as dinner was over Evelyn returned with Sister Mary John to the garden and worked till it was time to go into church for Benediction. Or sometimes they left the garden when the other nuns went there for recreation, having music to try over, for now, since she had recovered her health, Evelyn sang every day at Benediction. \"There is no reason why she should remain any longer with us,\" the Prioress...", "...\"Exactly, my dear; your personal instinct. That instigates you all. And none are so easily conciliated as these Austrians. Conciliate them, and you have them.\" Count Serabiglione diverged into a repetition of his theory of the policy and mission of superior intelligences, as regarded his system for dealing with the Austrians. Nurse Assunta's jealousy was worked upon to separate the children from Vittoria. They ran down with her no more to meet the vast bowls of grapes <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and feather their hats with vine leaves. Deprived of her darlings, the loneliness of her days made her look to Wilfrid for commiseration. Father Bernardus was too continually exhortative, and fenced too much to \"hit the eyeball of her conscience,\" as he phrased it, to afford her repose. Wilfrid could tell himself that he had already done much for her; for if what he had done were known, his career, social and military, was ended. This idea being accompanied by a sense...", "...porch where he sat down to watch the peaceful twilight as it crept slowly over the mountain peaks. Here, the rest of the family soon joined him, and the wonderful western night, as the brilliant stars sparkled seemingly so near to earth, had its soothing effect on the perturbed hearts and minds of all present. When Mrs. Brewster finally mentioned that it was bed-time the individuals in the group felt more amiably disposed towards each other. Anne Stewart was awake bright and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and, finding the sisters sleeping soundly, crept out to enjoy the invigorating breezes blowing down from the mountain-peaks. Some time later, Eleanor sat up and rubbed her eyes, at a loss to remember where she was. After a moment, however, she saw the sofa and laughed merrily. \"Oh, won't you be quiet! What is the matter with you?\" complained Barbara, sleepily. \"Nothing--I feel so alive! Get up and hear the birds sing,\" replied Eleanor, springing out of bed and...", "...off that fierce animal. As the neighbourhood looked suspicious, and also as it was their first encampment, they, like all travellers at setting out, of course were more timid and cautious. To Leon was assigned the first watch; for Leon was a courageous boy, and it was not the first time he had taken his turn in this way. He was to sit up for about two hours, and then wake Guapo, who would keep the midnight-watch; after which Don Pablo's turn would come, and that would terminate <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> at daybreak. Leon was instructed to rouse the others in case any danger might threaten the camp. Leon from choice had seated himself by the head of the hammock in which slept the little Leona; in order, no doubt, to be nearer her, as she was the most helpless of the party, and therefore required more immediate protection. He had both the pistols by him--ready to his hand and loaded--and in case of danger he knew very well how to use them. He had been seated for...", "...They were eager to make the attempt, and soon the yacht was unmoored, and moved slowly out to sea in the direction of Needle Island. A light breeze still blew fitfully, but promised at any moment to stop; yet while it lasted they passed onward under its gentle impulse, and so gradually reached Needle Island, and went on into the sea beyond. Before they had come to the spot which they wished to attain the breeze had died out, and they were compelled to take to the oars. Although early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the sun was burning hot, the work was laborious, and the progress was slow. Yet not a murmur was heard, nor did a single thought of fatigue enter the minds of any of them. One idea only was present--one so overwhelming that all lesser thoughts and all ordinary feelings were completely obliterated. After two hours of steady labor they at last reached a place which seemed to them to be exactly one league due north of Needle Islet. Looking back they saw that the rocks on...", "...imperturbability the particulars of the loss he had just experienced, but nevertheless repeatedly expressed his astonishment at the deplorable recklessness of Vandamme, and said he could not comprehend how this experienced general could have allowed himself to be drawn away from his position.

But this defeat, the first we had sustained since the resumption of hostilities, became the forerunner of the long series of reverses which awaited us. It might have been said that victory, having made one last effort in our...", "...the walls, when prisoners informed Caesar that Vercingetorix, from want of forage, had quitted his camp, leaving in it the mass of his army, and had advanced nearer to Avaricum with his cavalry and light infantry, with the intention of laying an ambush on the spot where he expected that the Romans would go to forage the following day.[473] Upon this information, Caesar, seeking to take advantage of the absence of Vercingetorix, started silently in the middle of the night, and came <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> near the camp of the enemies. As soon as they were acquainted with his march, they hid their baggage and wagons in the forests, and drew up their troops on an open height. Caesar immediately ordered his soldiers to lay down their bundles in one spot, and to keep their arms ready for combat.

It was useless, because my feelings towards Miss Russell could not change on account of a few kind words in which I had no faith. It was unnecessary, because not hatred, but jealousy, was what I felt against her; nothing could and did mollify me so much as her absence. So long as she stayed away, I did not envy her in the least the acknowledged preference of Cornelius. Every evening when he sat down to write, I brought him of my own accord pen, ink, and paper, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I ran unbidden to fetch him his letter. I could even, when I saw him read it with evident delight, participate in his pleasure, little as I loved her from whom it came. My love was very ardent, but it was very pure; from my dawning youth it caught perhaps something of passion, but it also kept all the innocence of my childhood, scarcely left behind. Cornelius, I believe, felt this, and as there is nothing more delightful than to inspire or feel a pure affection,...", "...fancy himself going about, not on his tired rheumatic legs, but in a little ramshackle cart, with fern at the bottom for Ju to lie on, and a bit of board at the side bearing in white letters the inscription: \"A.

There were many guerrillas through the country, and it was unsafe to send the train without a strong guard.

The next morning, while eating their breakfasts by the dim light of a candle, Mikail passed close to Godfrey and slipped two long knives into his hand; these he hid instantly inside his shirt. \"I have got the bread,\" Mikail said; \"it was better for me to buy it than you.

And he knew that if Gerald were ever driven into hopeless exile with Austin's knowledge of his disgrace rankling, the boy's utter ruin must result inevitably. Yet--yet--how could he afford to do this--unoccupied, earning nothing, bereft of his profession, with only the chance in view that his Chaosite might turn out stable enough to be marketable? How could he dare so strip himself? Yet, there was no other way; it had to be done; and done at once--the very first thing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> before it became too late. And at first, in the bitter resentment of the necessity, his impulse was to turn on Gerald and bind him to good conduct by every pledge the boy could give. At least there would be compensation. Yet, with the thought came the clear conviction of its futility. The boy had brushed too close to dishonour not to recognise it. And if this were not a lifelong lesson to him, no promises forced from him in his dire need and distress, no oaths, no...", "...six beds. Enough fuel to start a fire in the morning was also brought in. \"And now, what did we come out here in the woods for?\" inquired Dick smilingly. \"To get our fill of sleep,\" yawned Tom. \"To eat,\" suggested Hazelton hopefully. \"To fish,\" added Dave Darrin promptly. \"Just to lie down and take things easy,\" declared Danny Grin. \"As for me,\" piped up Greg Holmes, \"I'm not going to bother my head, to-night, as to why we came here.

On the twenty-fourth night, they thought all the wood of the King's oak was violently thrown down by their bed-sides; they counted sixty-four billets that fell, and some hit and shook the beds in which they lay: but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> none were found there, nor had the door been opened where the billet-wood was kept. The next night, the candles were put out, the curtains rattled, and a dreadful crack like thunder was heard; and one of the servants, running to see if his master was not killed, found three dozen of trenchers laid smoothly under the quilt by him. But all this was nothing to what succeeded afterwards.

Anton called the forester to his side, and got much information from him. Certainly, he had nothing very cheering to tell. Of wood fit for cutting there was hardly enough for the use of the family and tenants. The old system of plunder had done its worst here. As they reached the carriage, the forester respectfully touched his hat, and asked at what hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he should come to the castle. Anton rejoiced to have succeeded so well in concealing the feeling of insecurity which made his present position an irksome one to him. \"You see,\" said he to his faithful ally, as they both sat over the green tile stove at evening, \"what disturbs me most is that I feel more ignorant and helpless than any of the servants about, and yet I have got to maintain their respect.

Wang would not part with his at a loss, and held on for some ten days, when his expenses for board and lodging were added to his present distress. The landlord urged him to sell even at a loss, and turn his attention to something else, which he ultimately did, losing over ten ounces of silver on his venture. Next day he rose <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to depart, but on looking in his purse found all his money gone. He rushed away to tell the landlord, who, however, could do nothing for him. Some one then advised him to take out a summons and make the landlord reimburse him; but he only sighed, and said, \"It is my destiny, and no fault of the landlord's.\" Thereupon the landlord was very grateful to him, and gave him five ounces of silver to enable him to go home.

The men made their rounds very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to make quite sure that all lights were out. At two o'clock a night-light was still burning in the parsonage, and this was of course a hindrance to the need-fire. The peasants knocked at the window and earnestly entreated that the night-light might be extinguished. But the parson's wife refused to put the light out; it still glimmered at the window; and in the darkness outside the angry rustics vowed that the parson's pigs should get no benefit of the need-fire.

He left _The Church Quarterly Review_ and numbers of _The Expositor_, _The Guardian_, and _The Pilot_ in the hall with his great coat, and on the whole his entry was very well staged. Duncan Mackay occupied a room at the keeper's, who had only eight children. Mr. Williams asked if he might see Mr. Blake; he could impart religious consolation.

There were...", "...demand for a physician \"to come at once\" if there is no urgent need for his services, and if you have just been inspired for aid after a week's blindness, there is no urgency in the matter. A call in an hour would do just as well. Take the following case: A mother discovers a small quantity of blood in the diaper of her two months old baby. There is a larger quantity in the afternoon and she decides to give the baby a dose of castor oil. During the night it slept fitfully and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> it has a large stool as a result of the castor oil and there is a large quantity of blood in the stool. She sends a \"rush\" call for a physician. The physician discovers the following facts: The baby is being artificially fed; it has been vomiting its food for a week; its stools have been green, foul and contained mucus; it had a fever for a number of days; it has lost much weight and looked pale and sickly. The physician obtained this history from the mother--she...", "...from a newly-arrived steamer. From that hour a nameless longing for that undefined something, which the other lad had gotten from that gentle lady, haunted his love-lorn days. Sometimes he actually found himself crying for it. Of this--and all other crying--Jack, being a manly little fellow, was so heartily ashamed that (to use his own words) he \"swowed never to let on to his folks.\" Jack's \"folks\" were--a reputed uncle, by trade a shipwright. A creature habitually red of face; cross <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and nasty at night; chronically glum on week-days, and invariably sprightly on Sundays; for then it was the shipwright's prerogative to get superbly drunk! During these Sabbath celebrations, the man (having no children of his own body to maltreat) often diverted himself by belabouring his ragged little nephew; who, more or less battered, wriggled dexterously from his clutch, and, seeking his familiar haunt, the wharf, there wore out the weary day. Jack's other \"folk\"...", "...curious lucky stroke, and from a schoolroom, too--would you have believed----\" the voice broke off in a laugh. \"Be careful----\" said another voice, and two figures passed Miss Gray in the fog and were swallowed up again immediately. \"Is it possible,\" she exclaimed, \"robbers in West Haven High School? What does it mean? And I have been blaming that innocent child. What an imbecile I have been!\" Her last resolution before sleep came to her that night was to notify the town police <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and hire a detective to stay about the High School day and night. Imagine the surprise of the bewildered Principal, when, next morning bright and early, Mary Price, after a timid knock on the office door, came hesitatingly into the room. \"Miss Gray,\" she said, \"I found this money yesterday afternoon in my desk. I don't know how it came there nor whose it is. But it would be better for you to take charge of it until the owner asks for it.\" Mary spoke quickly, as if...", "...to be excellent eating. Cytherea shells were again found, which showed that the salt water was not very far off. Charley gave a characteristic description of this country, when he returned from a ride in search of game: \"It is a miserable country! nothing to shoot at, nothing to look at, but box trees and anthills.\" The box-forest was, however, very open and the grass was good; and the squatter would probably form a very different opinion of its merits.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I set out for Bammakoo, at which place I arrived about five o'clock in the afternoon. I had heard Bammakoo much talked of as a great market for salt, and I felt rather disappointed to find it only a middling town, not quite so large as Maraboo; however, the smallness of its size is more than compensated by the riches of its inhabitants; for, when the Moors bring their salt through Kaarta or Bambarra, they constantly rest a few days at this place; and the Negro merchants...", "...cannot be too strongly condemned. We can and must at once put ourselves in a positive attitude of mind. We must begin our day with a song, with a smile. We must look upward, not downward. We must reject every discordant thought and accept accordant ones regarding the coming day. It is a new day which brings new life, new joys, new duties, it may be new trials, but these, instead of being accepted as obstacles, may be turned into opportunities. The indulgence of negative thoughts <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> may become a habit. A great battle may have to be fought at first, but perseverance and promptness can correct such evil tendencies.

And as the fire glowed and the shadows of evening came on, the figures of the men stood out as if made of bronze, till they had done and came down to the boat. An hour later the men were on board, the rope paid out so that they were a dozen yards from the shore, where a little grapnel had been dropped to hold the boat from drifting in, and once more Rob lay beneath the awning watching the glow of the fire as it lit up the canvas, which was...", "...draped in the long blue cloak she used for covering her circus attire.

Luck favoured the black. When Jack Redland got up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the schooner was entering Shark's Bay. He fastened the belt, pushing the case into its place without examining it; he was not likely to suspect the pearl had been abstracted while he slept.

We may have a visible sign of Spavin, swelling and hardness of the part, without lameness. If there be heat and tenderness on pressure, lameness will almost always be present. A careful comparison should be made of the hocks. TREATMENT: An important factor in treating...", "...distension, and fringed with small feathers, which have a very curious appearance. The Goatsucker is pretty common throughout the whole of England, but more so in the south than the north; it is a migratory bird, arriving towards the middle or end of May and departing in September. It chiefly inhabits woods, moors, heaths, and commons, especially where fern and brushwood abound. Its food consists chiefly of moths, beetles, and such insects as are most frequently met with on the wing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and evening twilight. The nest consists of a few dead leaves huddled together in some hollow in the ground, among the heath, long grass, or fern; it is frequently found at the foot of a furze or other bush. The eggs, two or three in number, are of a perfect oval shape, beautifully clouded and streaked with grey and light brown on a white ground; they are laid in the beginning of July, in about the middle of which month the young are generally hatched.

By the time that she had reached the house she had in some degree reconciled herself to the dangerous step that her mistress had taken, partly by perceiving that in face Dorothy Stanbury was very like her brother Hugh, and partly, perhaps, by finding that the young woman's manner to herself was both gentle and sprightly. She knew well that gentleness alone, without some back-bone of strength...", "...myself, he knew not exactly why. There was hardly a breath of air when we left the harbour, but a breath was enough to fill our little sail. The wind, though of the gentlest, was fair; and as we crawled from under the lee of the island, in a short time it became a fine sailing breeze. We sat on the deck till a late hour, and turned in with every prospect of being at Padras in the morning. Before daylight, however, the wind chopped about, and set in dead ahead, and when I went on deck <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> it was blowing a hurricane. We had passed the point of Padras; the wind was driving down the Gulf of Corinth as if old AEolus had determined on thwarting our purpose; and our little cutter, dancing like a gull upon the angry waters, was driven into the harbour of Missilonghi.

She does not see the twelve and fourteen hour days of work in that rosy dream of good wages and leisured evenings in town. On the farm it is from five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till nine at night; the work is not only too heavy for her, but it is closely confining. She has not the strength for it; and the enforced toil exhausts her energy prematurely.

Every day a good many of us took exercise by running round and round the small court, to the astonishment of the sentries. Mueller's exercises were introduced, and Medlicott and Gaskell, Buckley and I, and many other Englishmen and Frenchmen, did them regularly every day for the rest of the time we were in Germany. As a result of this strenuous life, though we were often very cold and...", "...as he was out of the town he turned the horses' heads backwards towards the Garibaldian lines. He was still accompanied by Commander Forbes, to whom, during their midnight drive, he related his performance on the telegraph wires.

The 30,000 men recalled from Salerno and the adjacent districts marched towards Capua.

On the 5th of September the King and Queen with the Austrian, Prussian, Bavarian and Spanish ministers, left Naples for Gaeta on board a Spanish man-of-war. The King issued a proclamation of...", "...better give me most of your money, and I'll take care of it for you, and when you're twenty-one you'll have quite a little sum.\" \"I am much obliged to you, sir, but I won't put you to the trouble of taking care of my money,\" answered Philip coldly. Squire Pope continued to argue with Philip, but made no impression. At length he was obliged to say good night. \"I will call round in the morning,\" he said, at parting. \"Perhaps you'll listen to reason then.\" When he called round <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he learned to his disappointment that Philip was gone.

After his interview with Squire Pope, Philip came down to the office, where he saw Professor Riccabocca, apparently waiting for him. \"Well, Mr. Gray, where shall we go next?\" asked the professor, with suavity. \"I haven't decided where to go--have you?\" asked Philip coolly. \"I suppose we had better go to Raymond. That is a good-sized place. I think we can get...", "...different a leave-taking would it be, if we were indeed assured that they and we would meet no more upon this side the grave!

It was <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that Sir Massingberd paid his visit--a morning of early November, when the first sharp frost had just set in. He came about money matters, as usual. We were surprised to see him, because, as I have said, he had relapsed into his accustomed stern unsociable habits, and had seemed to have given up all attempts to gain any furtherance of his plans from Mr. Long. He had called he said, about a matter that affected the parson himself, or he would not have troubled him....", "...The mode of nidification is unknown; but the natives told me that the nest was formed of leaves placed on an ant's nest, or on some projecting limb of a very lofty tree, and they believe that it contains only one young bird.

They moult about January or February, and in May, when they are in full plumage, the males assemble early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to exhibit themselves in the singular manner already described at p. 252. This habit enables the natives to obtain specimens with comparative ease.

They had examined and convinced themselves that, as regards the destitute poor, their workhouses were free from blame. Not only so, but the workhouse tramp ward chosen had been frequently mentioned in the public Press. A large \"sleeping-out\" problem existed in the town. It was suggested that it might be desirable to relax regulations so as to make it easier for destitute persons staying there to go out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to look for work. \"It was thought that in this way men who shunned the casual ward might be induced to enter it in preference to sleeping out.\" So said the public Press. The experiment of slightly relaxing the rules was tried. Very few availed themselves of it.[87] The Guardians also opened the wards early, but very few men came. The applicants were mostly men \"tramping in search of work,\" but all who applied had slept in the neighbourhood the night previously.

I finished my last letter on the night of my arrival at Mahkan, very tired, very hungry, and a good deal out of temper. We halted at Mahkan on the 17th, as the animals imperatively needed a day's rest. There can be no question that these very long marches are a mistake in every way. Many of the animals which started at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> did not get in until ten or eleven o'clock next day; and fatigue of this sort, together with an almost starvation diet, is too much for any animals. The number which actually died upon the road was very small--only three or four, I am told; but then the animals have had a rest at Antalo, and have still some little strength left. I have no hesitation, however, in saying that three or four such marches as this would find the great majority of the transport-train animals...", "...be considered _vulgar_, it will hardly subsist another generation.

It was an idyllic life that we led during our stay at Vranjina, though every comfort known to civilisation was lacking. We lived as did the hardy fishermen of the island, and a hard life it proved to be. The heat, however, was something tremendous, quite precluding any exertion from ten <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till the late afternoon. We had even in the early morning to use the greatest care to keep our necks and arms covered from the scorching rays of the sun, for bad blisters and burns were the sure reward of carelessness. The concussion of rapid shooting combined with the heat often brought on headaches so violent that to fire another cartridge was exquisite torture. One thing we did not suffer from, and that was loneliness.

On the 2nd of September 1666 the fire broke out at one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> at a house in Pudding Lane. A violent east wind fomented the flames, which raged during the whole of Monday and great part of Tuesday. On Tuesday night the wind fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally mastered. Many interesting details of the fire are given in Pepys's _Diary_....", "...and that she would find some light sewing for her to do, so that she should not want. She talked a good deal more, and I felt inclined to do as she wanted me, but then I thought how wicked it would be, and at last I told her I would think about it. When I got home and saw my sister so sick as she was, and wanting many little things that we had no money to buy, and no friends to help us to, my heart almost broke. However, I said nothing to her then. I laid awake all night thinking, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I made up my mind to come here. I told her what I was going to do, and she begged me not, but my mind was made up. She said it would be sin, and I told her that I should have to answer for that, and that I was forced to do it because there was no other way to keep myself and help her, and I knew she could not work much for herself, and I was sure she would not live a day if we were turned into the streets.

Often she intended to fly, but it seemed to her that she could not get away; she was kept in one constant whirl of excitement so that she could not reason with herself long enough to determine what to do. What deterred her most, was that she had nowhere to go to, no friend to call upon for counsel or assistance, and thus she went on from day to day, adopting one plan <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to discard it at night. Frank was very kind to her in a certain measure. He liked her, but it was a very selfish liking. He did not like to hear her talk about leaving. He liked her there, and he was almost as much her jailer as Mrs. Laylor.

It is as if a father were to say <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to his little one: \"Look at me, see how tall I am; when I return this evening, I shall expect you to have grown a foot.\" Education is greatly simplified by this method.

About twice a week we were told <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that bread would be distributed at four o'clock. It was another errand to run. Every one produced his card, and received an allowance for several days. If the _Feldwebel_ announced: \"In the afternoon at three the emigrants will be passed in review,\" the whole village was in a flutter. It was no trifle to drag the old people and the babies out from their heaps of straw, to hold up the lame, to lead the blind, and to persuade the idiots. The ragged army, every day more...", "...of being hurled to the bottom of the precipice. When he put his hand out as usual for his whip, it was not there, and he remembered that he had broken it, and threw away the useless pieces on the road. In spite of his mad haste he reached the Volga too late for the ferry. He had to stay in the town with a friend, and drove next morning to his home in the forest.

The mistress of the house herself was unusually silent and sad when she let Marfinka go with her future mother-in-law. She had no instructions or advice to give, and hardly listened to Marfinka's questions about what she ought to take with her. \"What you like,\" she said absently, and gave orders to Vassilissa and the maid who was going with Marfinka to Kolchino to put everything in order and pack up what was necessary. She handed over her dear child...", "...to be suspected that it is a branch of the Columbia. This I heard from some soldier, and it may be true. We went upstream today four leagues north and northwest. At four o'clock in the afternoon we began to descend, and at sunset we stopped on the west bank opposite the place where we stopped on the 18th, having gone fourteen leagues in three or four hours on account of the great force of the current. The direction is south and southeast.[30] _21st day._ We set out at seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and in a little while encountered on the right hand the slough through which on the 18th we entered the main river. Leaving the latter and following the former [i.e., the main river, to the left], after one league we came to a rancheria called that of the Ochejamnes, which had forty houses but no people. A little while thereafter we passed the head of the Island of the Quenemsias.[31] Here we left the main Sacramento River, which runs to the southwest, on the right hand...", "...They halted, and said they would camp for the night, but the Indian demurred, and offered to carry Washington's gun, as he was fatigued. This was declined, when the Indian grew sullen, hurried forward, and, when fifteen paces ahead, levelled his gun and fired at Washington. Gist at once seized the savage, took his gun from him, and would have killed him on the spot had not the humane Washington prevented. He was sent home to his cabin with a loaf of bread, and told to come to them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with meat. Probably he expected to return before morning, and, with some other braves, scalp the two Americans; but Washington and Gist travelled all night, and reached the Alleghany River opposite the site of Pittsburg. Unfortunately, the river was not frozen as they had hoped, but was full of broken ice. All day long they worked to construct a raft, with but one hatchet between them.

I doubt not we shall see him <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> more tractable.\" Elizabeth, to whom this speech was addressed, did not reply, but moved slowly up the hall by herself, fixing her eyes on the little figure of the English ingrain carpet that covered the floor; while, on the other hand, Richard gave a loud crack with his whip, as the stranger disappeared, and cried: \"Well, 'Duke, you are your own master, but I would have tried law for the saddle before I would have given it to the fellow.

It was murdering a spirit--that was! My father sat in a corner one whole week, moping like such an old man! I was nearly dead with my mother's voice. By-and-by we were all silent, for there was nothing to eat. So I said to my mother, 'I will earn money.' My mother cried. I proposed to take a lodging for myself, all by myself; go there <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and return at night, and give lessons, and get money for them. My landlady's good son gave me the brass-plate again. Emilia Alessandra Belloni! I was glad to see my name. I got two pupils very quickly one, an old lady, and one, a young one. The old lady--I mean, she was not grey--wanted a gentleman to marry her, and the landlady told me--I mean my pupil--it makes me laugh--asked him what he thought of her voice: for I had been singing.

This communication is very much in substance what Mr. Bulwer's note had led us to expect. It is a strong condemnation of the act of the Porte depriving Mehemet Ali of the Government of Egypt, an expression of satisfaction at having already learned from Lord Palmerston and Count Apponyi[46] that Austria and England are not prepared to consider this act as irrevocable, and a threat on the part of France that he considers the power of...", "...just as the Indians did. Behind the mounted men were men and boys on foot, nearly as many as had passed on horseback. These kept up with the others, silently but swiftly maintaining the same pace that the mounted fellows did. It was a picturesque and novel sight to the young settlers. The Indians were dressed in the true frontier style, with hunting-shirt and leggings of dressed deerskin, a blanket slung loosely over the shoulder, all bareheaded, and with coarse black hair flowing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> breeze, except for the loose knot in which it was twisted behind.

They sing, too,--a sweet little song, but not very loud. It is charming to hear them in a barn when five or six of them sing together. But one may often hear the little song from a single bird flying over. They are friendly among themselves, and they like to alight on a roof and chatter away a long time. In one place where I was staying, they liked to gather on a piazza roof right under my window. They often woke me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with their sweet little voices. One morning the sound was so near, it seemed as if they must be in the room, and I opened my eyes to see. There on the sill close to the screen was one of the pretty fellows. He was looking in at the open window, and evidently keeping watch of me. When I moved a little, he gave the alarm, and the whole party flew away.

The calm was succeeded by a wind at east, with which we stood to the north. The wind increased and blew in squalls, attended with rain, which at last brought us under our courses; and at two o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, we were obliged to lie-to under the foresail, having a very hard gale from E.N.E., and a great sea from the same direction.[3] At seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 25th, the gale being more moderate, we made sail under the courses, and in the afternoon set the top-sails close-reefed.

Brahms did not usually sit in the music-room, but would remain in a smaller apartment smoking and chatting sociably with friends of either sex. His arrival always became known at once to the assembled company, 'Brahms is here; Brahms is come!' being passed eagerly from mouth to mouth. His old love of open-air exercise had not diminished with increasing years, and the Sunday custom of a long walk in the country was still kept up. A few friends used to meet <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> outside the Cafe Bauer, opposite the Opera House, and, taking train or tram to the outskirts of the city, would thence proceed on foot, returning in the late afternoon.

We stayed there the next day and found a family, in the immediate vicinity who cooked and provided for us. We found that the ice was running very strong in the Missouri River, and that it was impossible to ferry across. The succeeding was one of the most severely cold nights I ever experienced, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> some of our party went down to the river and found that the floating ice had lodged and formed a bridge across. A company was selected to see if it was safe, and they returned and stated that they thought the ice, though very thin, would bear us.

One of my uncles, a slave of Colonel Burwell, lost a pair of ploughlines, and when the loss was made known the master gave him a new pair, and told him that if he did not take care of them he would punish him severely. In a few weeks the second pair of lines was stolen, and my uncle hung himself rather than meet the displeasure of his master.

He traveled by night, wherever possible, and interviewed all those who wished to see him upon business from seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until twelve or one at night. Sometimes, in a day, he went a hundred and fifty miles in an automobile, spoke to many groups of farmers in different places, heard their complaints against the Department, and told them what the Government was trying to do for them.

We passed through a tolerably good country, but the soil was a little sandy, and it was three o'clock in the afternoon when we reached the plantation. There were no persons there except some servants and negroes, the commander being a Parisian. The dwellings were very badly appointed, especially for such a man as Mons. Moll. There was no place to retire to, nor a chair to sit on, or a bed to sleep on. For their usual food the...", "...as if it were a third leg. Some birds, like the crows, sleep in great flocks.

[Illustration: AMERICAN ROBIN] Audubon, who has told us so much about birds, once found a hollow tree which was the sleeping-room of chimney swifts. The noise they made going out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> was like the roar of a great mill-wheel. He wanted to see the birds asleep. So in the daytime, when they were away, he had a piece cut out at the foot of the tree, big enough to let him in, and then put back, so the birds would not notice anything unusual. At night, after the swifts were abed, he took a dark lantern and went in. He turned the light upon them little by little, so as not to startle them. Then he saw the whole inside of the tree full of birds. They...", "...they say of men who steal their way--from the South.

He had a little \"false motion,\" the foreman said, and clattered his types too audibly in the steel stick, but as he got up a good string of type at the end of the day and furnished his own chewing tobacco, he created no unfavourable comment in the office.

Surely that handful of men are not going to charge an army in position? Alas! it was but too true; their desperate valour knew no bounds, and far indeed was it removed from its so-called better part--discretion. They advanced in two lines, quickening their pace as they closed towards the enemy.

True, it had cost him nothing, Kelly having carried him from one club to another, cashing a cheque at each, and spending the proceeds with such freedom as to evoke a protest from his guest. \"I want to impress you,\" Kelly had retorted. \"I want to show you how well I've done.

A GRIZZLY BEAR. Ebenezer Onthank was an early riser. He had been brought up on a farm, where, during a part of the year it was the custom for the \"menfolks\" to rise between four and five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to begin the labors of the day. His old habit clung to him, and at five o'clock, when Tom and Ferguson were yet asleep, Mr. Onthank sprang from his leafy couch refreshed and vigorous. Seeing his companions yet sleeping, he concluded to take a walk. \"It'll give me an appetite for breakfast,\" thought he, \"and a chance to see something of the country.\" As to the appetite, Ebenezer was generally well provided. Indeed, latterly his appetite had exceeded his means of...", "...a very good one we voted it. When we were done I went outside and found, to my surprise, that the dogs had not yet been fed. I remonstrated with Chrisoffsky, but he answered that they had not yet finished their evening toilet. Then I saw that the dogs were busy licking themselves and biting the pieces of frozen snow out from between their toes. My driver explained that if they were fed before performing this very necessary task, they would immediately lie down to sleep and wake up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with sore feet and rheumatism, and then they would be useless for several days. It takes the dogs a good hour before they have groomed themselves fit for dinner. They seem to know that they can get nothing to eat before this work is done, but the minute they have finished they sit up and begin to howl for their meal. Each dog receives two or three salmon backs and heads. This is a fairly good amount considering that the salmon were originally eighteen- or twenty-pound...", "...and I _must_ know about Eagle.\" Concerning Captain March, the papers had very little to say. They understood that he had been on the spot when the explosion had occurred, and that he had received slight injuries which would prevent him from carrying on his military duties for some time to come.

His private automobile, which had followed him from Alvarado to El Paso, had brought him from new Fort Bliss to old Fort Bliss on official business: and he was on his way back when, hearing sounds which resembled gunfire, he had stopped his chauffeur on the instant, and dashed on fast up the artillery hill, near which he happened to be.

In his letter he requested a reply by telegram first thing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> saying to what price he was to go, as he had reason to believe that other persons beside himself were aware of the circumstance. There was no time for explanations, so the wire was sent, though the word 'book' came with a very suspicious ring.

She was awakened <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> by a touch on her shoulder. Maddalena hung over her with a frightened face, and implored her to come and look at the signora, who seemed not at all well. Clementina ran into her room, and found her dead. She must have died some hours before without a struggle, for the face was that of sleep, and it had a dignity and beauty which it had not worn in her life of self-indulgent wilfulness for so many years that the girl had never seen it look so before.

He must remember that, remember it even when his pent-up passions stormed the citadel of his conscience,...", "...woods seemed more open and soon reached a stretch of dry, open prairie. On the border of it stood a tall mastic tree with a lightning-blasted top and many branches which made it easy to climb. Ned was soon in the top of the tree making a mental map of the country round about. \"It is all right now,\" said he as he climbed down. \"I can see the open Everglades within four or five miles, and there is something that looks like a slough that is only half as far away. We'll leave the creek <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and cut our path this way, instead of around those trees. It won't be as much work, either. We can do some of that work to-night and camp right here. Then in the morning, at daylight, we will start out with the canoe on our shoulders and tramp till we find water to float it.\" \"But how about water to drink? I need it worse than the canoe.\" \"Where there's water for the canoe, there will be water for you.

The principal business seems to be the sale of liquor, which can be purchased at thirty-three places within this little town of eight hundred people, as advertised by the sign boards. And they all look as if they were doing a good trade. There is considerable fishing at Cleggan, a neighboring village, which has been encouraged and assisted by the government, and large shipments of fish are made to Dublin every day. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> several ancient fishwives appear in a triangular space between the rows of houses in the center of the village with baskets of fish, and from our windows in the comfortable Railway Hotel we can see the inhabitants come strolling along in an indolent and indifferent manner to buy their breakfasts. They have the choice of a variety of fish, and the prices are remarkably low. A fine, fat mackerel costs a penny, a codfish sixpence, and for a shilling one can get a haddock...", "...court. Her physician's opinions, her mirror also, grieved her far less than the inexorable warnings which the society of the courtiers afforded, who, like rats in a ship, abandon the hold into which on the very next voyage the water will infallibly penetrate, owing to the ravages of decay. Anne of Austria did not feel satisfied with the time her eldest son devoted to her. The king, a good son, more from affectation than from affection, had at first been in the habit of passing an hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and one in the evening with his mother; but, since he had himself undertaken the conduct of state affairs, the duration of the morning and evening's visit had been reduced by one half; and then, by degrees, the morning visit had been suppressed altogether. They met at mass; the evening visit was replaced by a meeting, either at the king's assembly or at Madame's, which the queen attended obligingly enough, out of regard to her two sons. The result of this was, that...", "...I entreat, gentlemen, that you will not regard what he urged in my behalf. I repeat, on the contrary, and with most justice, if one of us must fall a sacrifice, if there be yet time, save him, restore him to the tears of his wife; I have no tie like him, I can meet death unappalled;--too young to have tasted the pleasures of the world, I cannot regret their loss.\"--\" No, no,\" exclaimed his brother, \"you are still in the outset of your career; it is I who ought to fall.\" At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the members of the Tribunal withdrew to the council-chamber. Since the commencement of the proceedings the crowd, far from diminishing, seemed each day to increase; this morning it was immense, and, though the sentence was not expected to be pronounced till a late hour, no one quitted the Court for fear of not being able to find a place when the Tribunal should resume its sitting. Sentence of death was passed upon Georges Caudoudal, Bouvet de Lozier, Rusillon,...", "...and most part of the neck; cut off the pinions and pull out the tail feathers, make a plastic cake of clay or tenacious earth an inch thick and large enough to envelop the bird and cover him with it snugly. Dig an oval pit under the fore-stick, large enough to hold him, and fill it with hot coals, keeping up a strong heat. Just before turning in for the night, clean out the pit, put in the bird, cover with hot embers and coals, keeping up a brisk fire over it all night. When taken out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> you will have an oval, oblong mass of baked clay, with a well roasted bird inside. Let the mass cool until it can be handled, break off the clay, and feathers and skin will come with it, leaving the bird clean and skinless.

He therefore went downstairs and smiled on observing that the balustrade of the staircase became a bar of burnished gold as his hand passed over it in the descent. He lifted the door latch (it was brass only a moment ago, but golden when his fingers quitted it) and went into the garden. Here, as it happened, he found a great number of beautiful roses in full bloom, and others in all the stages of lovely bud and blossom. Very delicious was their fragrance <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> breeze. Their delicate blush was one of the fairest sights in the world--so gentle, so modest, and so full of erect composure did these roses seem to be. But Midas knew a way to make them far more precious, according to his way of thinking, than roses had ever been before. So he took great pains in going from bush to bush, and exercised his magic touch most freely; until every individual flower and bud, and even the worms at the heart of some of them, were changed to...", "...herds of cattle graze on the beautiful grassy meadows; the Saeter-maiden, with fresh-colour, blue eyes, and bright plaits of hair, tends them and sings the while the simple, the gentle melancholy airs of the country; and like a mirror for that charming picture, there lies in the middle of the valley a little lake (kjoern), deep, still, and of a clear blue colour, as is generally peculiar to the glacier water. All breathes an idyllian peace.\" But a presentiment of death appears, even <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> hour of creation, to have impressed its seal upon this country. The vast shadows of the dark mountain masses fall upon valleys where nothing but moss grows; upon lakes whose still waters are full of never-melted ice--thus the Cold Valley, the Cold Lake (Koledal and Koldesjoe), with their dead, grey-yellow shores. The stillness of death reigns in this wilderness, interrupted only by the thunderings of the avalanche and by the noise which occasions the motion of the...", "...masses which were not clouds, but which they took for smoke and were not sure but they might be intended for signals. We replied that if it were smoke that they saw it was probably caused by forest fires, but if we ever reached the earth again we would organize a company and try to make some electric signals which they could see. CHAPTER XV. A NIGHT ADVENTURE It was late when the conversation closed, and Proctor said we were to spend the night with him of course, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he would take pleasure in introducing to us the other members of his household. The residence buildings, beautiful and commodious structures, adjoined the observatory, and to each of us was given a separate apartment. After Proctor had left us, Thorwald came into my room a moment and I said to him: \"Proctor is a friend of yours, is he not?\" \"Certainly,\" answered Thorwald, \"what could he be but a friend? But then I never saw him before today.\" \"Is it possible?...", "...carried on in the rest room itself where a demonstrator from \"the beauty counter\" made up the faces of the patrons of the rest room with the powder and paint procurable in her department below. The out-of-work girls especially availed themselves of this privilege and hoped that their search would be easier when their pale, woe-begone faces were \"made beautiful.\" The poor girls could not know that a face thus made up enormously increased their risks. A number of girls also came early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> as soon as the rest rooms were open. They washed their faces and arranged their hair and then settled to sleep in the largest and easiest chairs the room afforded. Some of these were out-of-work girls also determined to take home their wages at the end of the week, each pretending to her mother that she had spent the night with a girl friend and was working all day as usual. How much of this deception is due to parental tyranny and how much to a sense of responsibility...", "...while our friends were trying to \"make the best of it,\" and then, after putting by the remnants of the lunch for future use, the boys fairly exhausted themselves doing \"stunts\" calculated to amuse the girls and make them forget the terrors around them. \"Now, I'll just tell you,\" declared Nat. \"There's a sort of couch under each of those posts in the parlor. Tavia take one and Dorothy the other, Tom and I will stand guard. You may as well rest, even if you cannot sleep, for even <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> it's going to be heavy traveling.\" At first the girls declared they, too, would stand guard, but when Tom added his reasoning to that of Nat's and the tired ones realised that if they had to walk through the snow in the morning they surely would have to rest their weary muscles, they finally consented to \"stretch out\" on the low seat that marked the archway from parlor to parlor. CHAPTER XXIII THE GHOST THAT REALLY WALKED It did seem absurd, in spite of...", "...would have been sufficient for me during my whole life, in which I should not have had one weary moment. I was there in a terrestrial paradise; I lived in innocence and tasted of happiness. At the journey of July, M. and Madam de Luxembourg showed me so much attention, and were so extremely kind, that, lodged in their house, and overwhelmed with their goodness, I could not do less than make them a proper return in assiduous respect near their persons; I scarcely quitted them; I went <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to pay my court to Madam la Marechale; after dinner I walked with the marechal; but did not sup at the castle on account of the numerous guests, and because they supped too late for me. Thus far everything was as it should be, and no harm would have been done could I have remained at this point. But I have never known how to preserve a medium in my attachments, and simply fulfil the duties of society. I have ever been everything or nothing. I was soon everything; and...", "...sucked. In my cell was another man. We were to be cell-mates. He was a young, manly fellow, not talkative, but very capable, indeed as splendid a fellow as one could meet with in a day's ride, and this in spite of the fact that he had just recently finished a two-year term in some Ohio penitentiary. Hardly had we been in our cell half an hour, when a convict sauntered down the gallery and looked in. It was my pal. He had the freedom of the hall, he explained. He was unlocked at six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and not locked up again till nine at night. He was in with the \"push\" in that hall, and had been promptly appointed a trusty of the kind technically known as \"hall-man.\" The man who had appointed him was also a prisoner and a trusty, and was known as \"First Hall-man.\" There were thirteen hall-men in that hall. Ten of them had charge each of a gallery of cells, and over them were the First, Second, and Third Hall-men. We newcomers were to stay in our cells for the rest...", "...\"There's Pink-eye!\" exclaimed Ned Rector. \"Is it possible?\" answered the Professor. \"Then something has happened to Tad.\" \"Mebby--mebby the bear's got him,\" suggested Stacy Brown, his face blanching. All through the night the little party had sat up anxiously awaiting the return of their companion, who had set out after the bear. The tent had been ruined, but they found that the rifles had not been harmed at all, having been stacked in front of the small tents. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the three boys and Professor Zepplin had followed Tad's trail for some distance into the foothills, but feared to penetrate too far for fear of getting lost. The Professor reasoned that it would be much better to return to camp and give Tad a chance to find his way in in case he himself should prove to have been lost. This the boys had done, but they were impatient to be doing something more active. Ned Rector was fairly fuming, because their guardian would not...", "...bad ones are so hard to follow out. KATHRYN. I quite approve so far, Jack. JACK. I never vote. GLORIA. I have yet to know the man who did. That's why they don't want us to. JACK. And I am proud to say that I have never done even a single stroke of work. KATHRYN. Oh! But you really must take up some useful occupation, Jack, and go downtown very early in the morning and come back very late every night. Married life would be impracticable otherwise. One could stand a husband <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and evening, but a whole day added to each night would be out of the question. JACK. You don't understand. Business today is done under very bad principles. The proper way, in truth, the only way that a young man of my temperament could be induced to begin work, would be to start right up at the top and go right down to the bottom. It takes so much less time and trouble than the old way of beginning at the bottom and stealing one's way up to the top. Besides, one is...", "...of St. Mark, since this was supposed to be the chief haunt of the freethinkers and revolutionists. Here he was promptly recognized by an elderly musician who had at one time been conductor of the orchestra in the San Samueli Theatre, where Casanova had been a violinist thirty years before. By this old acquaintance, and without any advances on his own part, he was introduced to the company. Most of them were young men, and many of their names were those which Bragadino had mentioned <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> as belonging to persons of suspicious character. But the name of Casanova did not produce upon his new acquaintances the effect which he felt himself entitled to anticipate. It was plain that most of them knew nothing more of Casanova than that, a great many years ago, he had for one reason or another, and perhaps for no reason at all, been imprisoned in The Leads; and that, surmounting all possible dangers, he had made his escape. The booklet wherein, some years...", "...pacification was possible. All explanations were refused. The duel was arranged to take place in the early morning, and swords were the weapons to be used. When Don Rudesindo heard it, he cursed the day he saw the light, and his adversary threw himself onto a sofa and asked for a cup of lime juice. However, there was nothing to be done but to obey the call of honor, and we dare not say whether they were impelled thereto by their own free will or by extraneous circumstances. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Pena and Don Feliciano on one side, and Maza and Delaunay on the other, dragged them from their homes to the old cemetery. What lugubrious fancies passed through Don Pedro Miranda's head as he journeyed thither! They were only comparable to those that assailed Don Rudesindo on the same journey. Before arriving, Pena said to him: \"I am quite sure, Don Rudesindo, that you will settle him, and I feel primed with courage. Don't push yourself, but you have a difficult part...", "...his eyes backwards down the road. At daybreak the snow stopped; the carriage rolled on high among the mountains under a grey sky; and here and there, at a wind of the road, Wogan caught a glimpse of the towers and chimney-tops of Innspruck, or had within his view a stretch of the slope they had climbed. But there was never a black speck visible upon the white of the snow; as yet no courier was overtaking them, as yet Innspruck did not know its captive had escaped. At eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they came to Nazareth, and found their own berlin ready harnessed at the post-house door, the postillion already in his saddle, and Misset waiting with an uncovered head. \"Her Highness will breakfast here, no doubt?\" said Gaydon. \"Misset will have seen to it,\" cried Wogan, \"that the berlin is furnished. We can breakfast as we go.\" They waited no more than ten minutes at Nazareth. The order of travelling was now changed. Wogan and Gaydon now travelled in the...", "...I didn't send up any provisions.\" Nora appeared uneasy.

I'm sure the cook could spare that.\" \"Out of her own breakfast?\" \"I--I beg your pardon, sir,\" stammered Nora; \"but it's all part of the house, isn't it?\" \"No,\" he answered firmly. \"We must play the game fair, Nora.\" \"And dinner, sir?\" \"Dinner?

Better write that down.\" \"I will, sir.\" \"Good-day, Nora.\" Don took the Subway this morning, in company with several hundred thousand others for whom this was as much a routine part of their daily lives as the putting on of a hat. He had seen all these people coming and going often enough before, but...", "...country and explore it on foot. But in the evenings when Rachel was gone to bed, and when, alone at last, he would try to concentrate his mind on the study or the writing to which he had been used so eagerly to turn, another thought that he had been keeping at bay by a conscious effort would rush at him again and overwhelm him. In the meantime, at the other side of Bad-Schleppenheim, the hours were flying fast and gaily. From the moment when the visitors met together at an early hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to drink their glasses of Schleppenheim water, and onwards through the luncheon parties, excursions, walking up and down, listening to the band, seeing theatricals, or playing Bridge in the evening, there was never a moment in which they were not industriously engaged in the pursuit of something. It was mostly pleasure, though many of them imagined it was health.

Amalia, instead of delighting as formerly in her infantile ways, appeared to avoid them, she gave orders she was not to be brought to her bed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> as usual.

What had he meant by saying that his mission would be no more dangerous...", "...bed an hour earlier than the others. Extreme cases of wickedness were punished by sending boys to bed in the daytime. When two were in a room, and thus confined, they used to relieve the monotony of their imprisonment by fighting with pillows. Those who had bad marks were also confined within certain bounds. Good boys, or those especially favoured, were allowed to chop kindling wood, or do other light work, for which they were paid three cents per hour. The boy who was first down <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> had an apple given to him. This apple was greatly despised by the bolder spirits, who taunted those who arose promptly with a desire to obtain it. Candour compels me to admit that, as a teacher of learning, Mr. Greene was not pre-eminent. He had two schoolrooms, and employed for each as good a teacher as he could hire. But we were not at all thoroughly well taught, although we were kept longer in the schoolroom than was really good for us; for in summer we had an...", "...lurks in i without a dot. I should find it hard to account for myself during our two short stays in London in the month of August, separated by the week we passed in Paris. The ferment of continued over-excitement, calmed very much by our rest in the various places I have mentioned, had not yet wholly worked itself off. There was some of that everlasting shopping to be done. There were photographs to be taken, a call here and there to be made, a stray visitor now and then, a walk <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to get back the use of the limbs which had been too little exercised, and a drive every afternoon to one of the parks, or the Thames Embankment, or other locality. After all this, an honest night's sleep served to round out the day, in which little had been effected besides making a few purchases, writing a few letters, reading the papers, the Boston \"Weekly Advertiser\" among the rest, and making arrangements for our passage homeward. The sights we saw were looked upon...", "...of the troops. Late in the afternoon the division of General Clinchamp marched down on the Rue Faubourg St. Honore, came out upon the Boulevard and took possession of the Madeleine and the Grand Opera House.

So they both lay down and went to sleep. It was late <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when she awoke and heard the birds singing all around her. Their song pleased her very much, and the fox, noticing this, remarked: 'Ah, if you could only understand what they are saying you would be much more pleased.'

Half a mile or so away, through a break in the chain of low islets, we could see the tumbling blue of the ocean, and over the tree-tops the white spume of the breakers as they leapt upon the iron-bound coast.

ONE DAY AT CHRISTMASTIME One day at Christmastime Alzugaray went <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to look for Caesar. He knew where to find him and walked direct to the Calle de Galileo. At the house, they told him that Caesar was eating in a tavern close at hand. Alzugaray went into the place and found his friend the Deputy seated in a coner eating.

She strips. She rubs her naked body with ointment from a little box. Gradually she is transformed into an owl and flies away to her lover. Lucius then prevails upon Palaestra to let him attempt the same transformation. By ill luck the maid brings him the wrong box of ointment so that he is changed not into a bird, but into an ass. Palaestra soothingly assures him that the antidote is simple, just a meal of roses, and if her dearest will pass the night quietly in the stable, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she will gather the flowers and recover her Lucius. But this simple plan gangs a-gley, for in the night robbers raid the house, secure much booty and to carry it steal also the horse and the real ass of Hipparchus and Lucius.

I purchased of the Clatsops this morning about half a bushel of Small fish which they had cought about 40 miles up the Columbia in their scooping nets. as this is an uncommon...", "...the two physicians. \"Will you wait till to-morrow before reporting?\" Doctor Eberly considered a moment. \"If you insist, Mrs. Joyce, and if it is Mr. Ollnee's wish--\" \"Yes, yes,\" Victor cried, \"I've heard of people being buried alive. It is too horrible to think about! Leave us alone till to-morrow.\" The physicians conferred apart, and at last Eberly turned to say: \"It seems to us a perfectly harmless concession. We will not report the case till to-morrow. Doctor Sill will call <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and decide what further course to take.\" \"Thank you,\" repeated Mrs. Joyce. After the doctors had gone she turned to Victor, saying: \"There is nothing for us to do now but to wait. If Lucy has gone out of her body forever she will manifest to us here in some familiar way. If she intends to return she will revive the body and speak from it sometime between now and dawn.\" \"She seems to sleep,\" he said; and now that his awe and terror were lessened by his hope, he...", "...away all notion of pulling one rein or the other.

And he will carry a twelve-stone man, with a saddle weighing nearly twenty pounds, and a pack of fifteen pounds behind the saddle, from eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till six in the evening, with an hour's rest in the middle of the day, and be ready to do it again to-morrow, and the next day, and the day after that. The saddle is in the Mexican shape, with a high pommel in front, handy for a rope or gun-sling, and a high cantle behind; it has a deep, smooth seat, and a leather flap behind and attached to the cantle on which the pack rests; huge wooden stirrups, broad enough to give full support to the foot, and wide enough for the...", "...about the clumps of yellow ragwort, doubtful whether to perch or not. Here, hidden behind the trees, among the leaves of overgrown rubble, was a one-story cottage of wood and clay, covered with thatch, in which lived Roger Gale, the postman. Roger Gale had ten miles to walk every morning, delivering letters, and the same number of miles every evening, for which twenty miles he received the liberal pay of six shillings a week. He had to be at the post office at half-past six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to receive the letters, and at seven in the evening to deliver them. His work took him about six hours. The middle of the day he had to himself. Roger Gale was an old soldier, and enjoyed a pension. He occupied himself, when at home, as a shoemaker; but the walks took so much out of him, being an old man, that he had not the strength and energy to do much cobbling when at home. Therefore he idled a good deal, and he amused his idle hours with a violin. Now, when Joe...", "...1. And Jesus went unto mount montem Oliveti: Olivet. 1. In contrast to those who retired to their homes (vii. 53), Jesus retired to Mount Olivet, where He often spent the night in prayer (Luke xxi. 37; vi. 12). Mount Olivet, separated from Jerusalem by the brook of Cedron, was a Sabbath day's journey from the City (Acts i. 12); that is to say, about seven and a-half stadia, and therefore less than an English mile. 2.

The great opera houses in all our cities and towns were thronged. There were none to criticise or carp. Her young, rich, grand voice was beyond compare. Its glorious tones are remembered with an enthusiasm like that which greeted her when she sung. Her company played in New York during the Easter holidays, and I, as an old friend, claimed some of her leisure hours. We were friends in Italy, and this Easter day was to be spent with me. At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she sang at one of the large churches; I waited for her, and at last we two were alone in my snug little room. At noon the sky was overcast and gray. Down came the snow, whitening the streets and roofs. The wind swept icy breaths from the water as it came up from the bay and rushed past the city spires and over tall buildings, whirling around us the snow and storm. We had hurried home, shut and fastened our blinds, drawn close the curtains, and piled coal higher on the...", "...her identity with Anne Catherick systematically asserted, and her sanity, from first to last, practically denied. Faculties less delicately balanced, constitutions less tenderly organised, must have suffered under such an ordeal as this. No man could have gone through it and come out of it unchanged. Arriving at Limmeridge late on the evening of the fifteenth, Miss Halcombe wisely resolved not to attempt the assertion of Lady Glyde's identity until the next day. The first thing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she went to Mr. Fairlie's room, and using all possible cautions and preparations beforehand, at last told him in so many words what had happened. As soon as his first astonishment and alarm had subsided, he angrily declared that Miss Halcombe had allowed herself to be duped by Anne Catherick. He referred her to Count Fosco's letter, and to what she had herself told him of the personal resemblance between Anne and his deceased niece, and he positively declined to admit...", "...With his gospel of true humanity the North German poet supplements and brings to its full fruition the religious austerity of the doctrines and precepts of Jeremias Gotthelf, the preacher on the Alpine heights of Switzerland. * * * * BERTHOLD AUERBACH LITTLE BAREFOOT[2] (1856) A TALE OF VILLAGE LIFE TRANSLATED BY H.W. DULCKEN, PH.D. REVISED AND ABRIDGED BY PAUL BERNARD THOMAS CHAPTER I THE CHILDREN KNOCK AT THE DOOR Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> through the autumnal mist two children of six or seven years are wending their way, hand in hand, along the garden-paths outside the village. The girl, evidently the elder of the two, carries a slate, school-books, and writing materials under her arm; the boy has a similar equipment, which he carries in an open gray linen bag slung across his shoulder. The girl wears a cap of white twill, that reaches almost to her forehead, and from beneath it the outline of her broad...", "...You must want your dinner, I am sure; and then Miss Packingham is to go to her grandmamma's house. Your box was taken there, my dear, and so I cannot give you fresh things, but I must brush your frock and bend your hat straight.\" The children were ready in a few minutes, and presented a strong contrast, as usual. Dorothy was a little _too_ smart in her pale blue cashmere with grebe trimming, and it was hard to believe she had been in the train all night; for they had left Paris <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the preceding day, and had reached San Remo at half-past ten. Irene, on the contrary, looked travel-worn, and she was a good deal more tired than Dorothy, who had slept off her fatigue and her sorrow for poor Nino's loss, and looked--so Ingleby said to herself--\"as fresh as any daisy.\" When the two little girls reached the sitting-room, which, like Lady Burnside's, opened on a verandah, they heard voices outside, and presently a boy and a girl stepped into the...", "...territory was gained to a depth of two and a half miles, the Germans being forced back on both sides of the Avre River. By encircling tactics the French smashed the numerous machine-gun nests that were the backbone of the defense. One after another heavily fortified positions were turned and the Germans were forced to surrender the first and then the second line of defenses of 1914, to which they had retreated after being driven out of Montdidier. The second German line was broken <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of August 26, 1918, when the French infantry, after repulsing a counterattack at St. Mard, encircled Roye and drove the enemy back some miles east of the town. The British continued their attacks eastward along the southern bank of the Scarpe, occupying a considerable portion of the Hindenburg line and Cherisy, Vis-en-Artois, and the Bois du Sart, an advance of nearly four miles. In the night Canadians and Scottish troops carried Roeux and Fontaine-les-Croisilles, and...", "...The scraps which M. Roustan left. Yes, the wretch took a notion to eat half of my chicken.\" Roustan entered at that moment. \"Come here, you idiot,\" continued the Emperor; \"and the next time this happens, be sure you will pay for it.\" Saying this, he seized him by the ears and laughed heartily. CHAPTER XVIII. On the 22d of May, ten days after the triumphant entry of the Emperor into the Austrian capital, the battle of Essling took place, a bloody combat lasting from four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till six in the evening. This battle was sadly memorable to all the old soldiers of the Empire, since it cost the life of perhaps the bravest of them all,--the Duke of Montebello, the devoted friend of the Emperor, the only one who shared with Marshal Augereau the right to speak to him frankly face to face. The evening before the battle the marshal entered his Majesty's residence, and found him surrounded by several persons. The Duke of---- always undertook to place...", "...Russ confidently. \"How can we?\" she asked, in surprise. \"We can write a sign and stick it up on a pole down there by the burned cabin. We'll make a sign saying that Mammy June is up here at the big house and for Sneezer to come and see her.\" \"Oh, goody!\" cried Rose, but still under her breath. \"That's a fine idea, Russ.\" \"Don't say anything about it to anybody,\" warned her brother, eager to make a secret of the plan that had popped into his head. \"We'll write that sign early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and go down there and stick it up. Want to?\" \"Of course I do,\" said Rose, with a glad little jump in her bed. \"I think you're just the smartest boy, Russ, to think of it. I won't say a word about it, not even to Philly and Alice.\" With this plan dancing in her head Rose soon fell asleep while Russ stole back to the room where he slept with the smaller boys. After that the big house on the Meiggs Plantation became quiet for the rest of the long night....", "...the first. Tonine was glad that I said no more about speaking to her mother, and drew the conclusion that her services were agreeable to me. Feeling tired and weak, and fearing that I should not wake early enough to send the letter to the convent, but not wishing to rouse Tonine if she were asleep, I called her softly. She rose immediately and came into my room with nothing on but a slight petticoat. Pretending to see nothing, I gave her my letter, and told her to take it to her mother <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> before she came into my room. She went out, saying that my instructions should be carried out, but as soon as she was gone I could not resist saying to myself that she was very pretty; and I felt both sad and ashamed at the reflection that this girl could very easily console me. I hugged my grief, and I determined to separate myself from a being who made me forget it. \"In the morning,\" I said, \"I will tell Laura to get me something less seducing;\" but the night brought...", "...... now. Oh, never no more ... they made me drunk ... when I woke ... ah, don't look at me ... I wish the sun 'ud go out for ever ... If I could only die!... I fought them as long as I could....

Afar, across the meadows, I spied the chimneys of the \"Soaring...", "...out to the keys. The man smiled again a big, floating smile, and his hands came to rest. The boy looked up wistfully. \"They'll all get there before we do,\" he said quickly. \"Come!\" The man looked down absently and kindly. \"Nein, S'bastian.\" He patted the round head beside him. \"There is no need that we should hurry.\" They passed out of the chapel, across the courtyard and into the open road. For half an hour they trudged on in silence, their broad backs swinging from side to side <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> light. Across the man's back was slung a large violin, in its bag; and across the back of the boy hung a violin like that of the father, only shorter and fatter and squarer, and on his head was a huge woollen cap. He took it off and wiped the perspiration from his white forehead. The man looked down at him once more and halted. \"Now, but we will rest here,\" he said gently. He removed the violin-bag carefully from his back and threw himself on the ground and took from...", "...them blow themselfs up with sentiments of pride or anger, and travel around a red flannel petticoat hung onto a clothes line just az tho they waz mad at the petticoat for sumthing it had, did, or sed tew them.

Mr. Bosman was almost overcome. \"It's just terrible to see him that way, he was such a good man. Poor old La Monte, trouble has sure driven him crazy. How on earth he ever got here beats me. There ain't a thing we can do tonight. We couldn't handle him if he got violent. There never was a stronger man in this country than Jean La Monte. My God! It's awful!\" So it was arranged that the Bosmans should go back to their ranch and send word to the Sheriff to be up there early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and that Owen should have some of our men guard the place during the night. \"Poor devil, I don't believe he'll go away. He seemed so suspicious he wouldn't touch the bread, and I believe he's been here two or three days. See you in the morning,\" and the Bosmans disappeared in the darkness.

Long after we had left...", "...dog, and took as much care of Beppo as Beppo took of him. Often while standing on the corner with his basket on his arm, waiting for a customer, Beppo would feel inclined to cry from very loneliness; but Tony seemed to know when the \"blues\" came, and would lick his master's hand, as much as to say: \"You've got me for a friend. Cheer up! I'm better than nobody; I'll stand by you.\" But one day it happened that when the other boys who shared the dark cellar home with Beppo went out early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> as usual, Beppo was so ill that he could hardly lift his head from the straw on which he slept. He felt that he would be unable to sell flowers that day. What to do he did not know. Tony did his best to comfort him, but the tears would gather in his eyes, and it was with the greatest difficulty that he at last forced himself to get up and go to the florist, who lived near by, for the usual supply of buds.

The length of the grove was nearly diagonal to the river, the north-west angle being little more than 50 yards from the bank, whilst at the south-west corner it was more than 200 yards distant. A little in advance, on the bank of the river, stood a hunting-box belonging to the Nawab, encompassed by a wall of masonry. In this, during the night, Clive placed 200 Europeans and 300 natives, with two field-pieces. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he withdrew the greater part of them.[3] He had with him 950 European infantry and artillery, 200 topasses, men of mixed race, armed and equipped as Europeans, 50 sailors with seven midshipmen attached, 2100 sipahis, a detail of lascars, and the field-pieces already mentioned.

From these considerations it is easy to understand how put out I was to find Mass over on this first morning of my pilgrimage. And I went along the burning road in...", "...that life yet lingered, but, receiving none, with a cry he fell forward to the floor and burst into uncontrollable sobs. Doctor Medjora, wise physician that he was, made no futile effort to restrain these tears, knowing them to be the best outlet for natural grief.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the same day upon which Leon had offered himself to Agnes, Madame Medjora, reading her _Herald_, had at last found the long-awaited personal, \"Come,\" the signal which she had arranged with the detective.

Arrived at the agency, she was at once ushered into the presence of Mr. Barnes. \"Well,\" said she, scarcely waiting to be seated, \"what have you found out?\" \"I have...", "...was at the mouth of the Blue Earth River, called Mankato, where a tempting grove of young ash trees were cut for fuel.

Millions of mosquitoes invaded the boat. Sleep was impossible. A smudge was kept up in the cabin which gave little relief and in the morning all were anxious to return. I stationed myself on the upper deck of the boat with watch and compass open before me and tried to map the very irregular course of the river. It was approximately correct and was turned over to a map publisher in New York or Philadelphia and published in my Year Book. Some time during...", "...and waited for an answer. But he still received none. The American was staring at him across an unfathomable chasm of differences. Monsieur Requine continued: \"And as for me personally, I am almost as astonished that you propose it. For nothing in all the world would I enter upon such a life as you depict, owing great sums of money to begin with, for no matter how 'easy' your business credit may be made in the modern world, the fact remains that I should lie down at night and rise up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> conscious that thousands of men had intrusted their money to me, that I might easily, by one false step or piece of bad judgment, lose forever money which means life to poor women or old men. Such a fiery trial would shrivel me up. It would be my death, I who have never owed a penny in my life. And then what? Even with the utmost success which you hold out, I should have a life which, compared with what I now have, would be infernal; rushing to and fro over the face of...", "...that Andrey walked with rather wambling steps to church that morning; the truth o't was that his nearest neighbour's child had been christened the day before, and Andrey, having stood godfather, had stayed all night keeping up the christening, for he had said to himself, \"Not if I live to be thousand shall I again be made a godfather one day, and a husband the next, and perhaps a father the next, and therefore I'll make the most of the blessing.\" So that when he started from home <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he had not been in bed at all. The result was, as I say, that when he and his bride-to-he walked up the church to get married, the pa'son (who was a very strict man inside the church, whatever he was outside) looked hard at Andrey, and said, very sharp: '\"How's this, my man? You are in liquor. And so early, too. I'm ashamed of you!\" '\"Well, that's true, sir,\" says Andrey. \"But I can walk straight enough for practical purposes. I can walk a chalk line,\" he says...", "...a Manual of Preparation for Holy Communion, which was given me when I was confirmed. I stood a long time reading it, and little ghosts seemed to rustle in its pages. How well I remember using it, diligently and carefully, trying to force myself into the attitude of mind that it inculcated, and humbly and sincerely believing myself wicked, reprobate, stony-hearted, because I could not do it successfully. Shall I make a curious confession? From quite early days, the time of first waking <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> has been apt to be for me a time of mental agitation; any unpleasant and humiliating incident, any disagreeable prospect, have always tended to dart into my brain, which, unstrung and weakened by sleep, has often been disposed to view things with a certain poignancy of distress at that hour--a distress which I always knew would vanish the moment I felt my feet on the carpet. I used to take advantage of this to use my Manual at that hour, because by that I secured a...", "...from the wind or remained ensconced in the more complete shelter of a form or burrow, not emerging at all. Open areas of various kinds were used as basking sites. Level ground--such as on roads, cattle pathways, and bare areas surrounding farm ponds--having unobstructed morning sunlight, nearby dense vegetation, and choice opportunities for feeding (cow dung, mulberry trees) was preferred. Basking was frequently combined with feeding; in several instances box turtles were noted early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> at suboptimum body temperatures eating grasshoppers, berries, or dung insects. The predilection of box turtles for open areas is probably important in permitting extended activity at suboptimum temperatures. _T. ornata_ probably carries on more nearly normal activity on cool days than do reptilian species with more sharply delimited thermal tolerances. Collared lizards (_Crotaphytus collaris_), for example, are chiefly inactive on days when the sky is overcast, although...", "...into the king's room. As he entered the alcove in which stood the king's bed, the duke presented him, saying: \"Sir, I bring you a man who once saved your life; he now comes to save your soul.\" Charles replied, in a weak voice, \"He is welcome.\" At the conclusion of the Romish rites the company were readmitted; and Kean, an English minister, prayed with the king. During the night the dying man spoke affectionately to his brother, and asked forgiveness of his wife. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he asked the time, and said: \"Draw the cur- {233} [Illustration: 0239] tain, {235}and open the window, that I may behold the light of the sun for the last time.\" Before noon Charles II. expired, in the fifty-fourth year of his age.

He was deeply mourned by his subjects; for no sovereign ever had the attributes of popularity more fully developed than King Charles...", "...gentleman; for then he wore a great sword.' PETERS--I never wore a great sword in my life. _Starkey_ deposed that in the December before the King's death, and up to the 12th of the following January, the headquarters of the army were at Windsor, and General Ireton was quartered at his father's house. The Council of War was held there, and Cromwell, Ireton, Peters, Col. Rich, and another gentleman, whose name he forgot, would meet and consult there, and sit up till two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> very privately together. The witness was often in Ireton's company, and Peters would often come in to meals in the evening. Mr. Ireton being civil in carriage, would usually entertain discourses with Mr. Peters, likewise would favor me sometimes with discourse; and in that discourse I did many times take occasion to assert the laws in point of the king; and discoursing about the king as being a capital instrument in the late inconveniences, as...", "...was barely light enough to see our way, and we floundered slowly along through deep drifts for a mile, when we met the snow-plows, after which our road became easier. These plows are wooden frames, shaped somewhat like the bow of a ship--in fact, I have seen very fair clipper models among them--about fifteen feet long by ten feet wide at the base, and so light that, if the snow is not too deep, one horse can manage them. The farmers along the road are obliged to turn out at six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> whenever the snow falls or drifts, and open a passage for travellers. Thus, in spite of the rigorous winter, communication is never interrupted, and the snow-road, at last, from frequent plowing, becomes the finest sleighing track in the world. The wind blew so violently, however, that the furrows were soon filled up, and even the track of the baggage-sled, fifty yards in advance, was covered. There was one hollow where the drifts of loose snow were five or six feet...", "...caused more ill feeling and resentment against him and Rushton than had ever existed previously. What led up to it was something that was done by Bundy's mate, Ted Dawson. This poor wretch was scarcely ever seen without a load of some sort or other: carrying a sack of cement or plaster, a heavy ladder, a big bucket of mortar, or dragging a load of scaffolding on a cart. He must have been nearly as strong as a horse, because after working in this manner for Rushton & Co. from six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till half past five at night, he usually went to work in his garden for two or three hours after tea, and frequently went there for an hour or so in the morning before going to work. The poor devil needed the produce of his garden to supplement his wages, for he had a wife and three children to provide for and he earned only--or rather, to be correct, he was paid only--fourpence an hour. There was an old house to which they were making some alterations and repairs,...", "...set along the cement paths. The grass had recently been cut and in a pile which lay on the edge of the street, half a dozen little chaps were turning somersaults and revelling in the coolness. For them, the park with its set flower beds and well-kept lawn offered few inducements. They would prefer a real playground. The chief obstacle to the development of amusements is, doubtless, the hours and nature of mill work. Every other week the men work on night turn. Then they get home early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and are ready, right after breakfast, for the much needed sleep; at four o'clock in the afternoon they must be called, and after an early supper they are off to the mill for the long night. That week there is no chance for outside festivities, nor chance even for the family to have quiet evenings together. Sometimes when sons who are also in the mill are on the opposite shift, the family is not able to meet even for meals. This irregularity not only tends to break into...", "...were the doors shut, when the monks began to sing nocturns fervently, in the dark church; they intoned the deep B, which vibrated splendidly, and could be heard far down the valley. August 24th. This has been another splendid day--the weather bright and enjoyable, and the bluest sky that I have seen since I left Chamouni; it was a holiday in the village, and in all the mountains. After long-continued fogs, and every variety of bad weather, once more to see from the window <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the clear range of mountains and their pinnacles, is indeed a grand spectacle. They are acknowledged to be finest after rain, and to-day they looked as fresh as if newly created. This valley is not surpassed by any in Switzerland. If I ever return here this shall be my head-quarters, for it is even more lovely, and more spacious and unconfined than Chamouni, and more free than Interlaken. The Spann-oerter are incredibly grand peaks, and the round Titlis heavily laden...", "...laborious. We reached the edge of the glacier where we had come on to it at 5.30 p.m. But the march from there to our lower camp was both long and rough. Major Morshead, who had not been trained with Bullock and me to the pace of such expeditions, had kept up so far in the gamest fashion; but he was now much exhausted. The day ended with a series of little spurts, balancing over the snow-sprinkled boulders along and along the valley, in the dim misty moonlit scene, until at 2 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we reached our lower camp, twenty-three hours after the early start. On August 20 we went down to Kharta for ten days' rest and reorganisation. The party was gathering there for the assault, in which all were to help to the best of their powers. Col. Howard-Bury and Mr. Wollaston were there; Dr. Heron came in on the following day, and a little later Major Wheeler. A conversation with this officer, who had been working in the Rongbuk Valley since Bullock and I had left...", "...would never have a fair wind to return with. Notwithstanding every encouragement that the admiral could devise, the men grew mutinous and slighted him, railing against the king for sending them on such a voyage; while he sometimes endeavoured to sooth them with hopes, and at other times threatened them with the punishment they might look for from the king, for their cowardice and disobedience. On the 23d, the wind sprung up at W.

Next day another gull was seen, and turtle-doves came from the westwards; some small fishes also were seen, which were killed with harpoons, as they would not take bait. All these tokens of land proving vain, the fears of the men increased, and they now began to mutter openly that the admiral proposed to make himself great at the expence of...", "...heart-ache and despair of youth had but sweetened that most noble nature till it grew well nigh divine. But one sorrow came to us, the death of our infant child--for it was fated that I should die childless--and in that sorrow, as I have told, Lily shewed that she was still a woman. For the rest no shadow lay between us. Hand in hand we passed down the hill of life, till at length in the fulness of her days my wife was taken from me. One Christmas night she lay down to sleep at my side, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she was dead. I grieved indeed and bitterly, but the sorrow was not as the sorrows of my youth had been, since age and use dull the edge of mortal griefs and I knew and know that we are no long space apart. Very soon I shall join Lily where she is, and I do not fear that journey. For the dread of death has left me at length, as it departs from all who live long enough and strive to repent them of their sins, and I am well content to leave my safety at the Gates and my...", "...her happy among the flowers and the woods. We will turn her captivity into a holiday: we will think of nothing in the world but to make her happy. I have told you. Will, what is in my mind. And, my dear, I verily believe the Lord Himself has put it there.' I reflected for a little. Then I kissed her. 'I am content, my dear,' I said. 'As you desire, so shall it be. We will go with Jenny and become her servants as long as the duty shall be laid upon us.' And so we fell asleep. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> this thing seemed a dream. But it was no dream. Then we had to begin our preparations. It would be close on three weeks, we learned, before the ship, the _Pride of Ratcliffe_, would be ready to drop down the river. I went on board and saw the Captain. He told us that Lord Brockenhurst had already engaged the best cabin for Madame, that although one of the convicts she was to be treated differently: to be separated from the rest: not to mix with them: wherein, he said...", "...is an emergency. Those readily serviceable clothes were of more value than the most superbly tailored garments that could possibly have been made up for him in any reasonable length of time. For to-morrow night it might, and as Lanyard held surely would, be too late to accomplish what he hoped to accomplish to-night, and for whose accomplishment evening dress was indispensable. Since Wertheimer had passed the word on, the name of the Comte de Lorgnes would be published to the world <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> papers, and by evening the birds, if they were wise, would be in full flight. Whereas to-night, while still that poor mutilated body lay nameless in the Morgue... Mademoiselle Athenais Reneaux lived up in most gratifying fashion to the tone of her note.

At one end a platform was raised, covered with rich carpeting, on which were ranged the seats of the inquisitors, emblazoned with the arms of the Holy Office. Near to this was the royal gallery, a private entrance to which secured the inmates from molestation by the crowd. Opposite to this gallery a large scaffold was erected, so as to be visible from all parts of the arena, and was appropriated to the unhappy martyrs who were to suffer in the _auto_. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> all the bells in the capital began to toll, and a solemn procession was seen to move from the dismal fortress of the Inquisition. In the van marched a body of troops, to secure a free passage for the procession. Then came the condemned, each attended by two familiars of the Holy Office, and those who were to suffer at the stake by two friars, in addition, exhorting the heretic to abjure his errors. Those admitted to penitence wore a sable dress; while the unfortunate...", "...buried yet, and you've been figuring all the evening.

In a way, this was the truth. The Juffrouw merely neglected to add why he was taking a walk, and at what hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he had gone out. Leentje, suspecting nothing, asked no questions. For her it was a \"matter of course\" that he would not go out in the middle of the night. The family now regarded the incident as fresh evidence of Walter's objectionable habit of roving, and nothing more. They felt no anxiety for his personal safety. \"There it is again!\" said the mother. \"The trouble and vexation I have with that boy.

'Ver' strong, signorina.' 'He can't escape and get over into Austria? We are very near the frontier, you know.' 'No, signorina, it is impossible.' He shook his head hopelessly. Constance laughed and slipped her hand through her father's arm. 'Come, Dad. The first thing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we'll go down to the jail and cheer him up.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the day last mentioned, the Sea Lion of Oyster Pond was visible, standing to the northward, with the wind light but freshening from the westward, and in smooth water. Land was not only in sight, but was quite near, less than a league distant. Towards this land the head of the schooner had been laid, and she was approaching it at the rate of some four or five knots.

He was up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> early, and again attempted to pass the guard, with no better success, however. It was now becoming light, and the uniform of the soldiers at the door attracted his attention.

Then, replacing it upon the table, he drew his white hand across his brow, as though to clear his troubled brain. Afterwards he crossed to...", "...were there, enough to keep the men off the track.

After a twelve days' sojourn among the clan, Glenlyon received orders from his superior officer to proceed to his bloody work, and at five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 13th of February the soldiers fell upon their unsuspecting hosts in their sleep. The massacre, however, was less skilfully executed than it had been cunningly planned. The greater portion of the Macdonalds, including the sons of the chief, effected their escape; but MacIan himself, with his wife and thirty-eight of his clansmen, including some women and children, were ruthlessly murdered. As many more, in all probability, fell victims to the rigours of a Highland...", "...in a previous letter, I cannot leave England till after the 11th, and the affair will no doubt be decided before that time.

Equally convincing were the clues that led to the arrest of Courvoisier in 1840, for the murder of Lord William Russell, who was then seventy-five years of age. The prisoner had only been in the service of the murdered man for a short time. He stated that on the night before the murder he had left his master reading in bed, as was his frequent custom, and a fact in support of this was that the candle had burned down to the socket.

On a door were marks which indicated that it had been broken in by the supposed burglars, but closer examination showed...", "...with the addition that men had been killed in the meeting-house. In the afternoon people began to watch from the hills for the return of the troops, and before sunset the noise of firing was heard. Of the three British commanders, Lord Percy was the only one who displayed any military ability. He showed it in the route which he chose for his retreat. From Cambridge Common, where at last he arrived, the road to Boston was long, and was broken by the bridge whose difficult passage <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he remembered. Therefore he avoided it--and wisely, for the planks of the bridge were up again, and this time in use as barricades, while the militia were ready for him. Instead, Percy shook off many of his waylayers, and saved some miles of march, by taking the direct road to Charlestown. Yet even this route was hard beset. \"I stood upon the hills in town,\" says Andrews, \"and saw the engagement very plain.\" Many a Whig exulted as he watched, many a Tory cursed, at the...", "...exerting herself with gratification, giving immeasurable gratification to the Germans.

He glanced at the young woman, when an eye far less keen than his could not have failed to remark a strangely excited expression on her countenance. \"Where is the boy?\" he asked. \"Just run to the doctor's, sir,\" she answered. Then first he remembered that when he left <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> his wife had not been feeling altogether well, but he had never thought of her since. \"How is your mistress?\" he said. \"She's rather poorly, sir, but--but--she's as well as could be expected.\" \"What does the fool mean?\" said Dempster to himself, and very nearly said it aloud, for he was not over polite to any in his service. But he did not say it aloud. He advanced into the hall with deliberation, and made for the stair. \"Oh, please sir,\" the maid cried in a...", "...in dreams--in mine, anyhow, though I never have any except in Egypt. This one about the red-faced man and the closed door in the deep recess is getting a bit on my nerves. Excited as I was over the patchwork of news, I laughed scornfully at Anthony's dream. For the man he described might be Colonel Corkran. CHAPTER X THE SECRET MONNY KEPT Cairo at last! My watch said that the journey took only three hours; but my nerves said six. I had telegraphed Biddy first thing <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the hour of my arrival with the \"_Candace crowd_,\" and I half expected to see her at the big white and red station, but there was no familiar form in the throng, the gay throng which excited my charges. Everything interested them; the black face of the Sudanese engine driver who looked down from his huge British locomotive, the display of English, French and German literature mingled with Greek, Italian, Arab, or Turkish papers on the bookstall; the ebony and...", "...disappeared without informing us whither he was going. We saw Logarh, a fortress which was captured by Sivaji from the Moguls in 1670, and the ruins of the hall, where the widow of Nana Farnavese, under the pretext of an English protectorate, became de facto the captive of General Wellesley in 1804, with a yearly pension of 12,000 rupees. We then started for the village of Vargaon, once fortified and still very rich. We were to spend the hottest hours of the day there, from nine <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until four in the afternoon, and proceed afterwards to the historical caves of Birsa and Badjah, about three miles from Karli. At about two P.M. when, in spite of the huge punkahs waving to and fro, we were grumbling at the heat, appeared our friend the Mahratta Brahman, whom we thought we had lost on the way. Accompanied by half-a-dozen Daknis (inhabitants of the Dekhan plateau) he was slowly advancing, seated almost on the ears of his horse, which snorted and seemed...", "...big and well-built, without suggesting the athlete, of an old and honored American family, and the only son of a rich--and eccentric--old doctor whom Mrs. Carr-Bolt chanced to know. He was frankly delighted at the chance that had brought him in contact with these charming people; and as Mrs. Carr-Bolt took an instant fancy to him, and as he was staying at their own hotel, they saw him after that every day, and several times a day. Margaret would come down the great sun-bathed stairway <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to find him patiently waiting in a porch chair. Her heart would give a great leap--half joy, half new strange pain, as she recognized him. There would be time for a chat over their fruit and eggs before Mr. Carr-Bolt came down, all ready for a motor-trip, or Mrs. Carr-Bolt, swathed in cream-colored coat and flying veils, joined them with an approving \"Good-morning.\" Margaret would remember these breakfasts all her life; the sun splashed little table in a corner of the...", "...life said, \"Oh that we had the like of that which hath been bestowed on Korah! Truly he is possessed of great good fortune.\" But they to whom knowledge had been given said, \"Woe to you! the reward of God is better for him who believeth and worketh righteousness, and none shall win it but those who have patiently endured.\" And we clave the earth for him and for his palace, and he had no forces, in the place of God,24 to help him, nor was he among those who are succoured. And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> those who the day before had coveted his lot said, \"Aha! God enlargeth supplies to whom he pleaseth of his servants, or is sparing. Had not God been gracious to us, He had caused it to cleave for us. Aha! the ungrateful can never prosper.\" As to this future mansion, we will bestow it on those who seek not to exalt them in the earth or to do wrong: And there is a happy issue for the God- fearing.

This glimpse into what seemed to be really truly grown-up society was bewildering and very enjoyable, and Patty found it quite easy to adapt herself to its requirements.

It was to be an evening wedding, but from early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> there was a constant succession of exciting events. The last touches were being put to the decorations, belated presents were coming in, house guests were arriving, messengers coming and going, and through it all Mrs. Allen bustled about, supremely happy in watching the culminating success of her elaborate plans. Patty looked at her with a wondering admiration, for she always admired capability, and Mrs. Allen was exhibiting what might almost be called generalship in her...", "...father's wheat-field, and I, at the King's council. One day he will give our Philip tit-for-tat--that is, if he live so long!\" \"Which God forbid!\" said the inquisitor. \"Amen!\" assented Frey Tullio. \"Well,\" smiled Mariana, \"there is no pleasing you. For me, there are many sorts of gallant men, but with you, a man must either swallow all the Council of Trent, or be food for flames.\" The inquisitors were silent. Discussion was not their business. They worked honestly from ten <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till five in the afternoon. Therefore, they deserved their rest, and if Mariana persisted in talking they would not get it. Still, they were eager to hear what the servant of Raphael Llorient had to say. Mariana made Jean a signal to go on with his tale. He continued: \"So being used to run on the mountains, I outstripped the crowd and came to the door of the chapel where the Other King, he in the cloak of blue and gold, was at his prayers. The crowd pressed and...", "...when he was under the influence of Ella's gentle presence, and when he could watch her clear and candid eyes, he found all doubt and suspicion melting away like snow beneath warm sunshine. But in the silence of the night they returned, returned very dreadfully, so dreadfully that often as he lay awake in the darkness beads of sweat stood upon his forehead and he would drive his great hands one against the other in his passionate effort to still the thoughts that tormented him. Then, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> again, the sound of Ella's voice, the merest glimpse of her grave and gracious personality, would bring back once more his instinctive belief in her. The morning after Deede Dawson had paid his visit to the attic there was news, however, that disturbed him greatly, for Mrs. Barker, the charwoman who came each morning to Bittermeads, told them that two men in the village--notorious poachers--had been arrested by the police on a charge of being concerned in Mr. Clive's...", "...in the waking state, will relieve our organism of all its \"fatigue\" and that, by complete relaxation in the waking state, we can liberate almost as many of our unconscious cravings as in the unconsciousness of sleep; if we were as careful not to waste uselessly our inner secretions as we are not to touch live wires, we would lie down as motionlessly as possible, and would consign to the scrap heap all the absurd notions as to the dire results of a sleepless night; we would then awaken <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> as refreshed by the two or three hours of sleep that would finally be vouchsafed us as by the usual eight or ten. The amount of sleep one needs varies with every individual and increases or decreases according to unconscious requirements. Hence, statements to the effect that one needs eight or ten hours' sleep are absurd and dangerous. Many people are worried over the fact that their sleep is irregular, that is, that they sleep six hours one night and ten the next...", "...what might be termed _gusto_. They have a local truth and freshness, which gives the very feeling of the air, the coolness or moisture of the ground. Inanimate objects are thus made to have a fellow-feeling in the interest of the story; and render back the sentiment of the speaker's mind. One of the finest parts of Chaucer is of this mixed kind. It is the beginning of the Flower and the Leaf, where he describes the delight of that young beauty, shrowded in her bower, and listening, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the year, to the singing of the nightingale; while her joy rises with the rising song, and gushes out afresh at every pause, and is borne along with the full tide of pleasure, and still increases, and repeats, and prolongs itself, and knows no ebb. The coolness of the arbour, its retirement, the early time of the day, the sudden starting up of the birds in the neighbouring bushes, the eager delight with which they devour and rend the opening buds and flowers, are...", "...by the Huns, and for a time they made it hot for us. But our superiority began to show after about an hour's firing. The men in the Flash Division worked hard to give our gunners the correct location of the German batteries. We worked hard and fast and the accuracy of our effort was shown by the silencing of the German guns. One by one they ceased firing, as the American artillery, with the data we supplied them, dropped shells on the Hun batteries. It was just about 5:45 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when our artillery ceased firing and our boys advanced again. This time our objectives were only about two kilometers in back of the German front trenches. We met with stubborn resistance at first, but with the usual American determination and pluck, we soon forced the Boche back. It was here that I first saw the German minnewafers and trench mortars at work. The shells thrown from the minnewafers are as much feared as any German weapon of war. They are thrown from a...", "...spent by the couple in watching, in order to avert subsequent unhappiness, and the next day they repair to a mosque and are married according to Muhammadan rites and customs.

And the markets?--well, one is certain to find John Chinaman in charge. As a matter of fact, there are more than half a million Chinese in the island, and they have the control of the trade with the natives. But the native Javanese trudges along, balancing two baskets on a long bamboo pole. Women and girls help to make up the throng, and they, too, are laden.

There was no answer. All remained quiet. Mike leapt to his feet and opened the door. \"What is it?\" he asked the sentry. \"I saw two or three men at the end of the corridor.

The Bible teaches that all who have ever left this earth are waiting yet--from King Alfred to King Edward; from St. Paul to Bishop Westcott; from the poor struggler of the ancient days <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of history to the other poor struggler who died last night. We are now to study this next stage of our history, beginning at what we call death which is really birth into the next stage of life, just as the death of the caterpillar is the birth of the butterfly. In this next stage are living to-day our dear children and brothers and sisters and wives and husbands within the veil. In a very few years we shall all have gone through--each of us just the same \"I.\" The...", "...away, and many parts of the ship were tied together with rope. The five French officers on board each had a cabin to himself; Russian officers, American Red Cross, and myself, slept where we could. The French also had their meals served to them separately. Nevertheless, we were a jolly company on board, and played an absurd wild game of solitaire each night, and the only tedium was the slow way we splashed like a lame duck up the narrow seas. In the harbour in Constantinople <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> a bright sun shone on four hulks packed from stem to stern with Georgians, the latest comers to Imperial City. They waited and stared whilst we slowly steamed to the French base. Then in a short while we were in the great capital again amid the surging masses of humanity.

She told us, that after her husband's departure she was in such terrible trouble that she got up to pray, and that while she was on her knees she saw a vision on the bed-cover. Before her was printed, in large visible letters, \"Thy sins be forgiven thee;\" she could...", "...This was to be a memorable day in the history of our adventures, for troubles began that we did not see the end of for many a long month afterwards.

We had even noticed some wild horses in the distance, but they had evidently sniffed danger from afar, for they speedily drew off, and disappeared to the nor'ard in a cloud of dust.

A terrific gale had swept over the country the night before, and strewn the coasts of England with wreckage. It had done great damage at Abington, and when Caroline looked out of her bedroom window <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she saw evidence of it in great trees lying prone here and there in the park, and the drift of leaves and branches scattered everywhere. The wind was still raging, though it had abated some of its fury, and even as she looked she saw a high elm that had towered above the beeches with which the slopes of the park were mostly planted come crashing to the earth. After breakfast she went out to see what damage had been done. The wind was blowing over the house to the...", "...lived beyond the pale too long. \"You have indeed been a friend to me,\" she said. \"God bless you, you good Samaritan!

Two hours later, in the midst of my dressing, I looked out of the window again, and I saw the St. Mawes packet reaching across towards Falmouth merrily, quite as if nothing had happened.

The Copenhagen Academy enjoyed a holiday that day, for Captain Branscome failed to present himself, and Mr. Stimcoe lay under the influence of sedatives. At eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he awoke, and began to discuss the character of Talleyrand at the pitch of his voice. Its echoes reached me where I sat disconsolate in the deserted schoolroom, and I went upstairs to the bedroom door to offer my services.

Neither could they, with all the skill they had, get again to the stile that night. Wherefore, at last, lighting under a little shelter, they sat down there until the daybreak, but, being weary, they fell asleep. Now there was not far from the place where they lay, a castle called Doubting Castle, the owner whereof was Giant Despair; and it was in his grounds they were now sleeping. Wherefore he, getting up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> early, and walking up and down in his fields, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in his grounds. Then, with a grim and surly voice, he bid them awake; and asked them whence they were, and what they did in his grounds. They told him they were pilgrims, and that they had lost their way. Then said the Giant, \"You have this night trespassed on me, by trampling in and lying on my grounds, and therefore you must go along with me.\" So they were forced to go, because he...", "...to take place at _two hours and a half after_ the moon passed the meridian.

The western shore had been followed in going up, and for that reason I proposed to keep close to the east side in returning; but before eight o'clock the water shoaled suddenly from 4 to 2 fathoms, and the ship hung upon a mud bank covered with grass, two or three miles from the shore.

My elder uncle, James, added to a clear head and much native sagacity, a singularly retentive memory, and great thirst of information. He was a harness-maker, and wrought for the farmers of an extensive district of country; and as he never engaged either journeyman or apprentice, but executed all his work with his own hands, his hours of labour, save that he indulged in a brief pause as the twilight came on, and took a mile's walk or so, were usually protracted from six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till ten at night. Such incessant occupation left him little time for reading; but he often found some one to read beside him during the day; and in the winter evenings his portable bench used to be brought from his shop at the other end of the dwelling, into the family sitting-room, and placed beside the circle round the hearth, where his brother Alexander, my younger uncle, whose occupation left his evenings free, would read aloud from some interesting volume for the...", "...surrounded by a rim, the water dropping through the wheel, reacting when reflected from the obliquely set vanes.

A few shots were exchanged at extreme range and one German destroyer was observed to have been hit. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of April 23, 1918, British naval forces made a successful attack against Ostend and Zeebrugge, both of them important German submarine bases. The raid was undertaken under the command of Vice Admiral Roger Keyes, commanding at Dover French destroyers cooperating with the British forces.

Surprised at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> by two Austrian divisions, which, concealed by the village of San Gervasio, had reached the right bank of the Adda without their being discovered, the soldiers defending the castle of Trezzo abandoned it and beat a retreat.

He would wake up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> tired out with the pleasures of the night; the girl would be driven away and the procuress imprisoned. He then dressed, confessed, said mass, and after an excellent breakfast with plenty of good wine he would send out for another girl, and this would go on day after day.

On examination the chest revealed chronic bronchial catarrh, and there was also a harassing cough, with very little expectoration after repeated exertion. I prescribed _Blatta orientalis_ IX trit., one grain every two hours. He passed...", "...cabin to all who were inclined to be present.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS The reader who has accompanied me thus far, will not need to be informed that I have designedly omitted many of those remarks on scenery, manners, and institutions, which were naturally suggested to my own mind by a retrospect of my sojourn in the United States. On various subjects of great interest and importance, it would be difficult for me to add anything new or valuable to the information...", "...things at all,\" said Rollo. \"Then,\" said Mr. George, \"you must write down what comes the nearest to being a careless thing. And neither of you must know what the other writes until you have shown the papers to me.\" After some hesitation the boys agreed to both these terms, and so it was decided that they were to go down the river. The steamer which they were to take was to sail at nine o'clock, and so they ordered breakfast at eight. Mr. George said that he would go down with them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to the Broomielaw, and see them sail. CHAPTER V. DOWN THE CLYDE. The boys returned in safety from their excursion about three o'clock in the afternoon. In fulfilment of their promise they immediately went to their room, and wrote their several accounts of the expedition.

When about one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the sounds ceased altogether; then we knew they had discovered us, and meant mischief. The last sounds appeared to be about 300 yards distant. This was an exciting time, for at any moment we might expect them in our midst, and to seize some of the oxen or the horse.

He would be back in Richmond in about a fortnight. While talking, he took up a handsome malacca sword-cane belonging to Dr. Carter and absently played with it. He looked grave and preoccupied; several times inquired the hour,...", "...* It was exasperating; seven precious days of fine weather lost; and fine weather is the exception, not the rule, in the Arctic.

On this account, the steam laundry will be obliged to rush all of its work for the 'hand' laundry through in one or two days. I found some steam laundries in which no work at all is done on Monday or Saturday, but in the busy season the place keeps running regularly on the other four days from seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till half past eleven and twelve at night. Very seldom is there any compensation for these long hours. Few of the laundries pay overtime. Of these, some dock the girls proportionately for every hour less than sixty a week they work.

So expeditiously was the change in the line of march managed, and so complete the surprise, that by seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the troops were drawn round Tournay, and the investment complete, while a half of the garrison was still absent in the lines of Marshal Villars, and it was thereby rendered incapable of making any effectual defence.

Freed from his own fetters, he was able to give efficient service to the others, and before morning nearly the whole of them were free.

This path was to take us in a very few miles to the Shangani, so, after supping at this spot, we started with light hearts to follow the track as it turned deep into the forest again.

The male took no part in the work, but regaled his busy partner by singing to her all day long. At one period of the day she brought in bundles of leaves four, five, and even six times in the space of ten minutes. At other times, when greater care was needed in the selection of materials, she was sometimes absent for eight or ten minutes, but such was...", "...across the bridge, along the river-side, and then up into the straight ugly streets of the New Town. The distance from her father's house was nearly two miles, and yet the journey was made in half an hour. She had never walked so quickly through the streets of Prague before; and when she reached the end of the Windberg-gasse, she had to pause a moment to collect her thoughts and her breath. But it was only for a moment, and then the bell was rung. Yes; her aunt was at home. At ten <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that was a matter of course. She was shown, not into the grand drawing-room, which was only used on grand occasions, but into a little back parlour which, in spite of the wealth and magnificence of the Zamenoys, was not so clean as the room in the Kleinseite, and certainly not so comfortable as the Jew's apartment. There was no carpet; but that was not much, as carpets in Prague were not in common use. There were two tables crowded with things needed for household...", "...and Hayes air with him.

The report of Lawrence that he could not find Warren, and that Thompson would join Coffee <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> troubled Foster. \"The whole combined force will be down on us in the morning,\" he said. \"Where can Warren be? Surely he cannot fail, for his orders were positive, and mine were positive to stay here and wait for him. And stay I will, if all the devils in Missouri are around me.\" Lawrence looked at him with admiration. \"Major, you are a man after my own heart,\" he said. \"I will make one more attempt to find Warren. This time I will only take Sherman with me, as I do...", "...flooded. The water rose two ells yesterday above that stone. Judge! For this last month we have passed our time but dully, all diversions silenced on the Emperor's death, and everybody out of town. I have seen nothing but cards and dull pairs of cicisbeos.

I don't believe I should know seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> again if I was to see it. But I am returning to England, and shall grow very solemn and wise! Are you wise?

Standing on a height, at two miles from Biarritz, whence the eye commanded the magnificent circle of hills, and buried in the midst of luxuriant and fragrant gardens, intersected by shady and silent walks, it formed an appropriately poetic setting for the romance of the royal betrothal. The King came every day. Wrapped in a huge cloak, with a motoring-cap and goggles, he would arrive at ten o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> from San Sebastian in his double Panhard, which he drove himself, except on the rare occasions when he entrusted the steering-wheel to his excellent French chauffeur, Antonin, who accompanied him on all his excursions.

It was himself,--the petty nature he revealed in every act. For women like Margaret Pole can endure vice and folly and disappointment, but not a petty, trivial, chattering biped that masquerades as Man.

The engineer would come up the hill to the old house late in the afternoon after his work, or ride up on his bicycle <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> on his way to the dam he was building. Ned--\"the Little Man\" as Falkner called him--came to expect this daily visit as one of his invalid rights. Several times Falkner stayed to dinner; but he bored Larry, who called him \"a Western bounder,\" and grumbled, \"He hasn't anything to say for himself.\" It was true that Falkner developed chronic dumbness in Larry's conversational presence. But Margaret seemed to like the \"bounder.\" She discovered that he carried in his pocket a...", "...it was not sin for him to be in debt, and he might partake of the Sacrament with a clear conscience. I was rather glad, however, to see him turn away at the end of the service. It is the first time that he has done so, and I trust he is really beginning to think more of what it all means. CHAPTER XX. A WEDDING AND A DEATH. _Feb_. 3, 1873.--To-day William Buhkwujjenene, the Chief's only son, was married to Philemon Atoosa. The wedding was appointed for 10 a.m., and early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> William was off to fetch his bride and her party, their house being about four miles off, on Sugar Island. It was long past the hour when Buhkwujjenene, Atoosa, and several other Indians came to me in a rather excited state, and Buhkwujjenene, as spokesman, explained that, although Atoosa, the father, was willing for his daughter to be married in our church, the mother and brother were opposed, and wanted the priest to marry them. I replied briefly that there were two...", "...in these latitudes.\" Two or three people, awakened by the doctor's voice, inquired what was the matter. \"Only a few squids come on board to be cooked for breakfast,\" answered Willy. Those who had spoken, satisfied with the reply, were quickly again asleep. Silence once more reigned on board, broken only by the snores of the sleepers, though the blowing of whales or other cetacea could be heard every now and then, now in the distance, now somewhat nearer; and Willy hoped that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they might be successful in catching some of the smaller ones, and obtain a supply of oil. Some time thus passed away; the first watch was nearly over, when he was startled by hearing a loud hail astern. Unwilling to awaken the ladies, he refrained from replying. He could just then distinguish the splash of oars; and straining his eyes through the darkness, he at last made out a boat approaching. He had no doubt she was the cutter, and he hoped to receive good...", "...the ice, where two long kennels were set up for them.\" [49] They were made out of boxes, and really consist of only a wall and a roof.

There is the same daily routine for the dogs as in the winter. We let them loose <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> about half-past eight, and as the time for their release draws near they begin to get very impatient. Every time any one shows himself on deck a wild chorus of howls issues from twenty-six throats, clamoring for food and freedom. After being let loose they get their breakfast, consisting of half a dried fish or three biscuits apiece. The rest of the forenoon is spent in rooting round among all the refuse heaps they can find; and they gnaw and lick all the empty tin...", "...or below--they penetrate the deep burrows of rabbit or Bee-eater, and scale the loftiest fortresses of tree-nesting species. Equally at home on the ground or amongst the topmost branches, nothing can well escape the larger serpents and saurians. Were they not held in check by nature's counterpoise, hardly a young rabbit could survive, or a Partridge, Quail, or Wild Duck succeed in rearing their broods. Neither ground nor tree-nesting birds are safe: we have seen a Cushat's nest which <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> had contained its two eggs, occupied towards evening by the sleeping coils of a green Eyed Lizard (_Lacerta ocellata_), measuring nearly a yard in length, and thousands of promising families are yearly called into existence only to provide sustenance for cold-blooded, scaly saurians.

Now one evening, before going out to visit certain friends, the confectioner gave the bird strict injunctions to watch all night and bade his wife make all fast, as he should not return until morning. Hardly had he left the door than the woman went for her old lover, who returned with her and they passed the night together in mirth and merriment, while the parrot observed all. Betimes <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the lover fared forth and the husband, returning, was informed by the parrot of what had taken place; whereupon he hastened to his wife's room and beat her with a painful beating. She thought in herself, \"Who could have informed against me?\" and she asked a woman that was in her confidence whether it was she. The woman protested by the worlds visible and invisible that she had not betrayed her mistress; but informed her that on the morning of his return home, the husband...", "...the King. Henry having relieved Rochester, marched also into the south, doubtless intent upon the reduction of the Cinque ports; for this, however, Simon gave him no time. He came thundering down, half London weltering behind him, across the Weald, and Henry, wheeling to meet him, came upon the 12th of May up the vale of Glynde and occupied Lewes. On the following day Simon appeared at Fletching in the vale of the Weald, some nine miles north of Lewes; there he encamped. Very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 14th May, Simon arrayed his troops and began his march southward upon the royal army. Dawn was just breaking when his first troopers came over the high Down and saw Lewes in the morning mist, the royal banners floating from the Castle--all still asleep. Slowly and at his ease Simon ordered his men. Upon the north, conspicuously, he set his litter with his standard above it and about it massed the raw levies of London. Upon the south he gathered the knights and...", "...the most intense colors upon all the objects in view. The snowy peaks turned to gaudy prisms as of crystal, the wooded summits became impurpled, the nearer hills turned a deep green, and the tranquil lake assumed a bright pea-color. Above all else, the sky was gorgeous. Around its western edge it took on a rose-red blush that blended at the zenith with a deep blue, in which were floating little clouds of amber and of flame-lit pearl. A moonless night soon closed around the boat, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we were at Sproat's Landing, a place two months old. The village consisted of a tiny cluster of frame-houses and tents perched on the edge of the steep bank of the Columbia. One building was the office and storehouse of the projected railroad, two others were general trading stores, one was the hotel, and the other habitations were mainly tents. I firmly believe there never was a hotel like the hostlery there. In a general way its design was an adaptation of the plan...", "...gaudy ray, Simple, yet grand, the mountain scene display; The lake where sober evening seems to sleep, Hills far retiring into umbrage deep; Blend all with classic, pure, poetic taste, And strike the more with forms and colours chaste!

Saturday, _July 3, 1915._ Dr. and Mrs. Berry went to Kragujevatz <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for a conference. We went into the town, did some shopping and had some raspberry drink and cakes at a cafe; we had a glorious walk back. This afternoon we heard that there was a funeral; then we heard a lot of wailing in the distance, so we put on our things and went to the cemetery. We met the procession of about twenty women with a lot of banners and baskets of food. It seems that the corpse they were mourning for had been dead some time, forty days, so it was just...", "...of it and come back.\" So I went with the slave, till we came to a place where stood three houses, side by side, new and shut up.

For this reason, my master has abandoned the house and says, 'I will never again give it to any one.'\" Quoth I, \"Open it, that I may view it;\" and I said in myself, \"This is what I seek. I will pass the night there and in the morning be a dead man and be at peace from this miserable plight of mine.\" So he opened it and I...", "...held the door fast loosened and the door flew open! Needless to say, the girls lost little time in getting out of their prison. Before the \"saloon\" had topped the other bank, they jumped out and ran into the alder bushes that bordered the stream. Their captor was evidently not aware of their escape, for the \"saloon\" kept on its course.

She had no other curiosity on her journey, than after all possible means of expense; and was every moment taking occasion to mention some delicacy, which I knew it my duty upon such notices to procure. After our return, being now more familiar, she told me, whenever we met, of some new diversion; at night she had notice of a charming company that would breakfast in the gardens; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> had been informed of some new song in the opera, some new dress at the playhouse, or some performer at a concert whom she longed to hear. Her intelligence was such, that there never was a show, to which she did not summon me on the second day; and as she hated a crowd, and could not go alone, I was obliged to attend at some intermediate hour, and pay the price of a whole company. When we passed the streets, she was often charmed with some trinket in the toy-shops; and...", "...in piety. The first ambition of the boy who is learning shorthand is to \"report\" a sermon by the preacher whose ministry he attends. Mr. Thomas Allen Reed has given an amusing account of his first exploit in this direction, when he was still struggling with the early difficulties of the system he soon after abandoned for phonography. He says, \"I did not, however, relinquish my practice, and in a few weeks I resolved on making a grand attempt to take down the Sunday sermon. I rose early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with the sense of a weighty responsibility resting upon me.

They were to fix their eyes upon the Regent, and when he made any of the above signals, immediately to act upon it according to their written instructions.

CHAPTER VIII Towards half-past five <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Mr. Johnson was awakened from a heavy slumber by the clamorous and increasing twitter of birds in the shrubberies and gardens outside. He woke with the sensation of being exceedingly uncomfortable and of being in an entirely unaccustomed spot. He sat up, looking around him. He was on the floor of the library, his revolver, with one barrel discharged, by his side, a dried but painful cut upon his cheek bone, and with the haunting remains of a most unpleasant odour still...", "...soft couches of rushes and heather, and dug cooking-places[24]; for they intended the hill to be the resting-place of all who chose to rest, till the chase was ended. After Finn and his companions had sat for some time on the hill, they saw a tall warrior coming towards them, armed in full battle array. He wore a splendid coat of mail of Lochlann workmanship, and over it a mantle of fine satin dyed in divers colours. A broad shield hung on his left shoulder, and his helmet glittered <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> sun like polished silver. At his left side hung a long sword, with golden hilt and enamelled sheath; and he held in his right hand his two long, polished, death-dealing spears. His figure and gait were wonderfully majestic, and as he came near, he saluted the king in stately and courteous words. Finn returned the salutation, and spoke with him for a while; and at length he asked him whence he had come, and if he had brought any tidings. \"As to the place I came...", "...which the town was divided. The incompetence of the military in civil affairs added to the grievances of the people; complaint against the administration of the \"Law\" was as loud as the clamour against the \"Law\" itself. The bother entailed in the procuring of authority to purchase food, and in the purchase of it, was extreme. The food was not worth it; but life is precious (or was then), and one had in a very literal sense to live. A man had sometimes to stand from six to eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to buy his paltry bit of offal, hoof, or fat, as the case might be, and after he had rested on his feet for two hours his turn would come to draw his miserable allowance--if somebody else had not drawn it for him. Such accidents happened often enough to make a good many foreswear meat altogether. Usually, however, the unfortunate would be consoled with a \"precedence ticket\"--for next day! so that he could live on the certainty of a succulent morrow. From ten o'clock to...", "...and whether it would have a roof of thatch or of corrugated iron--I prayed against corrugated iron. I confess these my preoccupations.

I smiled across the years at the raptures of my first vision of the place at twenty-one, just Cecily's age. Would I now sit under Arjamand's cypresses till two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to see the wonder of her tomb at a particular angle of the moon? Would I climb one of her tall white ministering minarets to see anything whatever? I very greatly feared that I would not. Alas for the aging of sentiment, of interest!

Then, turning to Harold, he said: 'And so you work in the furnace?' 'Yes, sir, during vacation, when I can get a job there,' Harold answered, and Mr. Tracy continued: 'How much do you get a day?' 'Fifty cents in dull times,' was the reply, and Arthur went on: 'Fifty cents from seven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to six at night, and board yourself. A magnificent sum truly. Pray, how do you manage to spend so much? You must be getting rich.' The words were sarcastic, but the tone belied the words, and Harold was about to speak, when his grandmother interrupted him, and said, 'What he does not spend for us he puts aside. He is trying to save enough to go to the High School, but it's slow work. I can do but little myself, and it all falls upon Harold.'

Reluctantly she acquiesced; the others were rather relieved--not because they objected to a fight, but because eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> was rather early to start one. Breakfast at the Grange was at nine-thirty, and, though the men generally went down for a dip, they went much later than Lord Lynborough proposed to go. \"He shall have one chance of withdrawing gracefully,\" the Marchesa finally decided.

Curran saw little hope for himself and his wife in the stern face of Dillon. \"At the start I would like to hear your explanation,\" Arthur began coldly. \"You were in my employ and in hers.\" \"In hers only to hinder what evil I could, and to protect her from herself,\" the detective answered steadily and frankly. \"I make no excuse, because there isn't any to make.

It has been McDowell's intention to push forward, from Centreville along the Warrenton Pike a few miles, on the evening of this Military conference; but he makes his first mistake, in allowing himself to be dissuaded from that, by those, who, in his own words, \"have the greatest distance to go,\" and who prefer \"starting early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and making but one move.\" The attacking divisions now have orders to march at 2:30 A. M., in order \"to avoid the heat,\" which is excessive. Tyler's three immediate brigades--or some of them--are slow in starting Westward, along the Warrenton Pike, to the Stone Bridge; and this leads to a two or three hours delay of the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman, before they can follow that Pike beyond Centreville, and commence the secret detour to their right, along the...", "...eight cups of sifted flour into a deep bread bowl, add one teaspoon of salt; make a depression in the centre, pour in the risen yeast and one cup of lukewarm milk or water.

Sir Charles McCarthy was a brave man, and worthy of old England; but in this instance his courage was foolhardy. He crossed the Prah River to meet a wily and desperate foe.

But let us a little lengthen this chapter, and add another anecdote concerning blindness. Pliny reports of one who, dreaming he was blind, found himself so indeed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> without any preceding infirmity in his eyes. The force of imagination might assist in this case, as I have said elsewhere, and Pliny seems to be of the same opinion; but it is more likely that the motions which the body felt within, of which physicians, if they please, may find out the cause, taking away his sight, were the occasion of his dream.

I remember when he was dying, a friend of his, one Cooney, came in to see him, and said: \"Well, Raftery, the time is not up yet that death gave you to live.\"...", "...was completed. Here were men with mackinaws and green elk boots; here were cook-houses in which the only difference was that a soldier did the cooking instead of a Chinaman; and above all, here were fir and pines growing out of a golden soil, with a soft wind blowing overhead. And here, in an extraordinary way, the democracy of a lumber-camp had been reproduced: every one from the Colonel down was a worker; it was difficult, apart from their efficiency, to tell their rank. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I started out on a gasolene-speeder to make the tour. At an astonishing rate, for the work had only been in hand three months, the vast acreage was being tracked and covered with the sheds. The sheds were not the kind I had been used to on my own front; they were built out of anything that came handy, commenced with one sort of material and finished with another. Sometimes the cross-pieces in the roofs were still sweating, proving that it was only yesterday they had been...", "...their long Pikes or Lances, against which we have no weapon that is an equal match except a Loaded Musquet.

The Long boat at the same time return'd out of the River Loaded as deep as she could swim with Oysters. And now I intended to put to Sea <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> if wind and weather will permit.

It is therefore difficult for the historian to determine whether Melechsala left the _Mushirumi_ which she had accepted of to wither on her dressing-table; or put it in fresh water, to preserve it for the solace of her eyes as long as possible. In like manner, it is difficult to discover whether this fair Princess spent the night asleep, with gay dreams dancing round her, or awake, a victim to the wasting cares of love. The latter is more probable, since early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> there arose great dole and lamentation in the Palace, as the Princess made her appearance with pale cheeks and languid eyes; so that her female council dreaded the approach of grievous sickness. The Court Physician was called in; the same bearded Hebrew who had floated off the Count's fever in his sweat-bath; he was now to examine the pulse of a more delicate patient. According to the custom of the country, she was lying on a sofa, with a large screen in front of it,...", "...believe it--almost always--except when I'm so sad that I can't believe anything.

That's the finest of all the virtues! I dare say Jim will be here for two or three weeks yet.\" For what was left of the evening Peter was so angelic that Bobbie feared he was going to be ill. She was quite relieved <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to find him plaiting Phyllis's hair on to the back of her chair in quite his old manner. It was soon after breakfast that a knock came at the door. The children were hard at work cleaning the brass candlesticks in honour of Jim's visit. \"That'll be the Doctor,\" said Mother; \"I'll go. Shut the kitchen door--you're not fit to be seen.\" But it wasn't the Doctor. They knew that by the voice and by the sound of the boots that went upstairs. They did not recognise the...", "...covered with basi. Each also carried a chicken in an open-work basket, while tucked into the basket was a round stick about 14 inches long and half an inch in diameter. This stick, \"lo'-lo,\" is kept in the family from generation to generation.

She placed her olla of basi and pork over a tiny fire, kindled by the first pilgrim to the mountain <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and fed by each arrival. Then she took the chicken from her basket and faced the west, pointing before her with the chicken in one hand and the lo'-lo in the other. There she stood, a solitary figure, performing her sacred mission alone. Those preceding her were slowly descending the hot mountain side in groups as they came; those to follow her were awaiting their turn at a distance beneath a shady tree. The fire beside her sent up its thin line of smoke, bearing through...", "...sky, but its light still flooded the deserted courtyard beneath.

No one has been near me since Deborah came in to lay the fire. Call the girl Danny; I want to get up.\" \"All right, mother. She has probably overslept; she had a long walk yesterday.\" \"But that is no excuse for sleeping till this time of day. Tell her to hurry.\" \"It is only seven, mother.\" \"Yes, Danny, dear, but I...", "...\"I don't mind travelling all night for half a dozen nights if I can track my lost property,\" she said lugubriously. \"You're dead sure it's no use stopping here?--that the robbery didn't take place here?\" \"Sure!\" answered Fullaway. \"We must get off. That French damsel's got to be found--somehow.\" The supper-party came to an end--the prima donna and her temporary maid began to bustle with garments and trunks, the two men attended to all other necessary matters, and at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the three sped out of Edinburgh for the South, each secretly wondering what was going to come of their journey. Allerdyke, preparing to go to sleep in the compartment which he and Fullaway occupied by themselves, dropped one grim remark to his companion as he settled himself. \"Seems like a wild-goose chase this, my lad, but it's one we've got to go through with! What'll the next stage be?\" The next stage was an arrival in London in the middle of a lovely May...", "...a foot high.

The children of the property at any rate thought it was grand, and picked out the last remains of panelling for kindling-wood, and would sit calling to one another for hours from the high ledges above the brick pillars, upon which there had once stood busts of famous men. Now and again a party of Russian or Polish emigrants hired the room and took possession of it for a few nights. They slept side by side upon the bare floor, each using his bundle for a pillow; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they would knock at the door of Ellen's room, and ask by gestures to be allowed to come to the water-tap. At first she was afraid of them and barricaded the door with her wardrobe cupboard; but the thought of Pelle in prison made her sympathetic and helpful. They were poor, needy beings, whom misery and misfortune had driven from their homes. They could not speak the language and knew nothing about the world; but they seemed, like birds of passage, to find their way by...", "...Women have odd tastes, Aminta thought, and examined the gentleman's handwriting. It pleased her better. She studied it till the conventional phrases took a fiery hue, and came at her with an invasive rush. The letter was cast back into the box, locked up; there an end to it, or no interdiction of sleep. Sleep was a triumph. Aminta's healthy frame rode her over petty agitations of a blood uninflamed, as lightly as she swam the troubled sea-waters her body gloried to cleave. She woke <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> peaceful and mildly reflective, like one who walks across green meadows. Only by degrees, by glimpses, was she drawn to remember the trotting, cantering, galloping, leaping of an active heart during night. We cannot, men or woman, control the heart in sleep at night. There had been wild leapings. Night will lead an unsatisfied heart of a woman, by way of sleep, to scale black mountains, jump jagged chasms. Sleep is a horse that laughs at precipices and abysses.

One long telegram to her father, another to Lord Fairholme, caused heart-burning and dismay not alone in certain apartments of the Savoy Hotel, but in the aristocratic aloofness of Cavendish Square and Curzon Street. As a result, two elderly men, a younger one, in the person of the Marquis of Scarland, and two tearful women--Lady St. Maur and Mrs. Leland--met at Charing Cross about one o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to travel by special train and steamer. Another woman telegraphed from Shropshire saying that baby was better, and that she would follow by the first steamer on Sunday. Mrs. Devar did not await developments. She fled, dinnerless, to some burrow in Bayswater. These alarums and excursions were accompanied by the ringing of telephones and the flight of carriages back and forth through muddy London, and Cynthia was called on to deal with a whole sheaf of telegrams which...", "...Foote, and is the cause of introducing the negress into the _Cozeners_,[192] though no express allusion to Charles Fox was admitted.

In memory of the event the stone image of the king was erected in the temple of Ptah with a field-mouse in his hand. The statue must have been that of Horus, to whom alone, along with Uaz, the field-mouse was sacred. But it was apparently only in a few localities that such was the case. The figure of the animal is found on coins of Ekhmim, and a bronze image of it discovered at Thebes, and now...", "...he did not hear him blow his French horn at eight or nine o'clock on the Monday morning, which I shall prove to you he could not do, for that Mr. De Berenger went out to Lord Cochrane's at eight o'clock.

Now, Gentlemen, upon the subject upon which I am about to address you, I do not think it absolutely necessary to go into it; and I should not at this hour <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> call evidence, but in a matter so highly penal as this is, and where I am placed in so delicate a situation, and in which, thank God, I can very seldom be placed, I do not think it right to act on my own judgment, where my client assures me that he was not the man, and is an innocent person; and that he is determined (because he knows perfectly well that what he says is the truth) to have his witnesses called; he shall have those witnesses called, for I chuse to have no...", "...but only that he saw such or such a thing, and lays it down for a maxime that a Hector can have no courage.

I still hoped for a letter from Monica, with some hints as to her mother's plans, but nothing came; and when we had had a blank day, with no news of activity in the enemy's camp, it was a relief to have Ropes arrive at the hotel <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> just as I was dressed.

Yet the great city cast a spell over her, with its countless opportunities for adventure. She could not leave it, but had taken a suite in a quiet boarding house overlooking the bay from the Heights in Brooklyn. One guest in particular had interested her. He was a Latin American, Ramon Santos. She noticed that he seldom appeared at breakfast or luncheon. But at dinner he often, ordered much as if it were seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> instead of the evening. He was a mystery and mysteries interested her.

She was astonished a few nights after her arrival to receive a call from the mysterious evening breakfaster. \"Pardon--I intrude,\" he began gracefully, presenting his card. \"But I have heard how clever you are, Senora Dunlap.

Even when elevated to the episcopal dignity, he never exempted himself from the rigid discipline of the cloister. He wore a haircloth shirt by night as well as by day. He measured out his food and drink by an exact rule. He chanted a fixed number of Psalms, alike when he arose <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and when he retired to rest at night. His charity knew no bounds. Not only did he erect a hospital at Bremen for the sick and needy, distribute a tenth of his income among the poor, and divide amongst them any presents he might receive, but every five years he tithed his income afresh, that he might be quite sure the poor had their proper share. Whenever he went on a tour of visitation through his diocese, he would never sit down to dinner, without first ordering some of...", "...Britling, please.\" Mrs. Britling became attentive. \"If I could leave much of my luggage, my clothes, some of them, and particularly my violin, it would be much more to my convenience. I do not care to be mobilised with my violin. There may be much crowding. Then I would but just take my rucksack....\" \"If you will leave your things packed up.\" \"And afterwards they could be sent.\" But he did not leave them packed up. The taxi-cab, to order which he had gone to the junction <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> on Teddy's complaisant machine, came presently to carry him off, and the whole family and the first contingent of the usual hockey players gathered about it to see him off. The elder boy of the two juniors put a distended rucksack upon the seat.

Mackerel will bite at any very small object, almost, that they can see, and sometimes fishermen fasten a small silver coin to their hooks, which will do duty as bait for days. They wish to catch as many fish as they possibly can, while they are biting, for mackerel are very notional. Sometimes they will bite so fast as to tire their captors, and, ten minutes after, not one can be felt or seen. Usually, they can be caught best <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and toward evening. I suppose they have but two meals a day, breakfast and supper, going without their dinner. In this respect, they resemble trout and many other kinds of fish. They are caught in great numbers off the coast of Maine and Massachusetts in the months of August and September.

Before midday Babbitts and O'Mally were gathered in, and while I was waiting on pins and needles in Ninety-fifth Street and Jack Reddy was off unsuspecting in Buffalo, the two of them were planted by Tony Ford's bedside, hearing the story that lifted the Harland case one peg higher in its surprise and...", "...nobleman with self-conscious dignity; and Anton was keenly alive to the true nobility of the words, though too thoroughly a man of business to give himself up to the impression they made, his budding enthusiasm being frostbitten by a very matter-of-fact thought: \"He promises to help us, and yet he is not quite convinced that the property we wish to carry off is of right our own.\" \"I am not, alas! so absolute,\" continued the chief, \"as to be able to gratify you at once. However, I hope <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to furnish you with a pass for your wagons. First of all, try to find out where your property now is, and I will send one of my officers with you as a protection. The rest to-morrow.\" With these words the travelers were courteously dismissed; and as Anton went out he saw the officer wearily throw himself back into an easy-chair, and with bent head begin to play with the trigger of his pistols.

I had at any rate given Jennie something else to think of. And that was something. Contrary to my expectations, I slept immediately and deeply that night. It was nine o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> before I awoke, half-past when I descended. I found Madge in the salon. \"I say, what's become of Julia?\" she asked. \"Though I don't see how you could very well know seeing you've only just this moment come down.\" A maid was clearing away the _petit dejeuner_. \"Madam,\" she said. \"What is it, Ellen?\" \"Miss Oliphant left word she'd be back at half-past eleven.\" \"Has she gone out?

It may take its chance.

As soon as his wounds would permit, Dieskau was carried on a litter, strongly escorted, to Fort Lyman, whence he was sent to Albany, and afterwards to New York. He is profuse in expressions of gratitude for the kindness shown him by the colonial officers, and especially by Johnson. Of the provincial soldiers he remarked soon after the battle that <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they fought like good boys, about noon like men, and in the afternoon like devils. In the spring of 1757 he sailed for England, and was for a time at Falmouth; whence Colonel Matthew Sewell, fearing that he might see and learn too much, wrote to the Earl of Holdernesse: \"The Baron has great penetration and quickness of apprehension.

An instance remains on record of the disturbance caused by any unusual pressure.

On this occasion the mails which should have gone out before three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> could not be despatched until between six and seven. Once clear of London, the letters passed into the hands of the postmasters, who were alone concerned in their transmission and distribution. At the present time, multifarious as the duties of a postmaster are, it is not one of them to transport the mails from town to town. But such was not the case in 1690. The post roads were then divided into sections or, as they were commonly called, stages; and these stages were...", "...was asked if there were any good bells in England. \"Very fine,\" he replied, \"but there is not a man there who knows how to ring them.\" Foreign machinery is sprinkled with holy water to neutralize the inherent heresy; but a miller, for example, will charge more for his flour after the baptism.

Now it so happened that all the hovelling smacks belonging to that and adjacent places had themselves been driven into port by the violence of the gale and the heavy sea, and that the only available means of communication was, therefore, by signals from the light-ships. It appears from the evidence of the officers in charge of those vessels at the Board of Trade inquiry, although the _Deutschland_ had been on shore since five and six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> on Monday, the 6th of December, and had immediately commenced to throw up rockets, and continued to do so until daylight, none of them were seen even from the nearest light-ship--the Kentish Knock--no doubt, owing to the thickness of the weather and almost continuous snow-storms, the master of that vessel first perceiving the unfortunate steamer at 9.30 a.m. He then fired guns, sounded the fog-horn, and continued to do so at half-hour intervals during the day, and at...", "...intelligent communication from the spirit world came through the raps; how the family had been annoyed by the manifestations, and by the notoriety that followed; how the younger sisters, Catherine and Margaret, were taken to Rochester, where she lived, by their mother, hoping that this great and apparent calamity might pass from them; how their father and mother prayed that this cup might be taken away, but the phenomena became more marked and violent; how <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they would find four coffins drawn with an artistic hand on the door of the dining-room of her home in Rochester, of different sizes, approximating to the ages and sizes of the family, and these were lined with a pink color, and they were told that unless they made this great fact known, they would all speedily die, and enter the spirit-world. \"Gladly would they all have accepted this penalty for their disobedience in not making this...", "...battle.\" This account says, \"The first men, so far as remembered, that took stations in the battery, were four, William Lord, Asa Lee, George Fellows, and Amos Denison.

They had not ridden more than six miles when they came up with one of the detachments sent out in pursuit of the liberated criminals. Our hero recognised the commanding officer as an old acquaintance, and imparting to him the release of Don Silvio, and his fears upon Don Rebiera's account, begged him to direct his attention that way. \"Corpo di Bacco--you are right, Signor Mid,\" replied the officer,...", "...My husband had then just got through his B.A. examination and was reading for his M.A. degree; so he had to stay in Calcutta to attend college.

I kept his letters in a sandalwood box and covered them every day with the flowers I gathered in the garden. At that time the Prince of the fairy tale had faded, like the moon <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> light. I had the Prince of my real world enthroned in my heart. I was his queen.

In irrigating our meadows, we were frequently forced to protect ourselves against the tricks of the meadow farmer. The traps are set in the evening, and at night or early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they are drawn up; for the meadows need cool water, that which the sun has warmed being injurious. As the meadow farmer did not sleep well, he used to go out to the ditch and turn our water into his meadows. Rothfuss found this out, and I caught the meadow farmer stealing the water. He feared the French, and yet he tried to rob his neighbors.

The justice of the peace who heard the case, Joseph Chamberlain, was a man of fair mind and a lover of justice. Many witnesses were heard, but among those who testified were Josiah Stowel, Jonathan Thompson and the two daughters of Mr. Stowel, all of whom gave evidence of his good character. Other testimony was proved to be false. The trial lasted from ten o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until midnight, when a verdict of \"not guilty\" was rendered. The Second Arrest No sooner was Joseph freed by the court than he was again arrested on a second warrant from Broome County, a distance of about fifteen miles.

But, alas for the astute Jim's calculations!

The evening sermon was preached by the Rev. C. T. Woods, who was out in the morning at a mission station. The archdeacon occupied a pew at the evening service. When the text was given out he pricked up his ears and sat up very straight. The opening sentence was the same as that of the morning; and so was the next and the next, even to the last! Some of those who had been present <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and had complimented the Ven. Archdeacon upon his eloquence, began to smile and nudged each other. At last the end came. The Ven. Archdeacon went into the vestry, where some of the morning flatterers were repeating their forenoon praises! At length they left, bursting with laughter.

He attempted to take hold of a white hand which he had seen some time near him, as it leant on the back of a chair. Some hesitation was shewn, but eventually the hand was withdrawn in a manner which indicated displeasure. Julien was inclined to give up the attempt as a bad job, and to continue his conversation quite gaily, when he heard M. de Renal approaching. The coarse words he had uttered <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> were still ringing in Julien's ears. \"Would not taking possession of his wife's hand in his very presence,\" he said to himself, \"be a good way of scoring off that creature who has all that life can give him.

Then the column was halted, and the weary men lay down in the road where they were halted, and went to sleep.

The result of the shortening of the pace due to fatigue or going over a slope, is to make the map larger than it should be for a given scale. This is apparent when we consider that we take more paces in covering a given distance than we would were it on a horizontal plane and we were taking our normal pace.

About 6 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we heard a few shots in our rear. One of our men was sent back to find out the cause of it. He had not been gone many minutes when we heard other shots, which forced us to the conclusion that the enemy in some way had gotten behind us. Our pickets had also heard the firing, and came in to find out what the trouble was. We followed the direction of the shots, and had not gone far before we saw through the heavy fog quite a large body of cavalry. Whether friend or foe,...", "...is almost perceptible to the eye,--still, shady walks, and evermore palms. We passed a morning there with some botanical friends, and had much explained to us that we cannot possibly remember. This we did retain, that there are known on the island sixty varieties of palms, and that this garden contains at least forty of them. And here is Dona Herrera's garden, which we visited one morning, with our friends of the Cup of Tea, (_vide_ earlier letters). How soft and dewy was it <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> light! the flowers had still the dreamy starlight in them. We ran about like children, admiring at every moment something new and strange. In the middle of the garden was a fairy lake, with a little mock steamboat upon it, the paddles being moved by hand. There were gas fixtures disposed throughout the grounds, which are lighted on the occasion of a _fete champetre_. What a time the young people must have of it, then! There is an Aviary, too, with the remnant of a...", "...carried on at the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, obtained the testimony of the mothers as to the difficulties involved. This study showed that in many cases the household duties could not be performed at the proper time; 60 women, for example, of the 109 reporting on this question, said that they did not make their beds until night; 105 said their dishes were not washed after each meal, but in 41 cases were washed in the mornings, and in 56 not until night. Three washed them <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> if they had time, and five left them for the children, after school. Many women who worked outside the home did their housekeeping without assistance from other members of the family. This meant that they had to get up early in the morning and frequently work late at night at laundry or cleaning; 49 women, for example, washed in the evening; 25 washed either Saturday, Sunday, or evenings.

He wept aloud, tore his beard, and dashed himself upon the ground, like a madman. The slaves stood around in motionless astonishment, surprised to see their master exhibiting such passionate emotion; others sought to console him, but fruitlessly; at length they all began to cry and bewail with him for his dear son, who was beloved by them all. After a sleepless night, the afflicted father rose not at all quieted. He wished early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to send messengers in all directions; but Salek, who had come to inquire if the lost one had returned home, explained to him how foolish this step would be. \"Consider,\" said he, \"that your Medjeddin has most probably found a night's lodging, and slept better than you. Supposing him, therefore, to be at any probable distance, even if he had set out on his way at daybreak, he could hardly be here now: if you send these messengers after him, he may perhaps come home by a...", "...on their faces and tears in their eyes. The hour had come; we were going to leave them. And the landladies' daughters? One, a buxom wench of eighteen, kissed the Jersey youth in sight of the whole battalion, but nobody took any notice of the unusual incident. All were busy with their own thoughts, and eager for the new adventures before them. I did not go to sleep that night; booted and dressed I lay on the hearthrug in front of the fire, and waited for the call. About four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> a whistle was blown outside on the street; I got to my feet, put on my equipment, fastened the buckles of my haversack, bade adieu to my friends of the billet who had risen from bed to see me off, and joined my company.

The Beast was very unwilling to grant her request. \"If I let you go, I am afraid you will never come back to me,\" he said, \"and then I shall die of grief.\" Beauty promised most earnestly to come back to him if he would only allow her to spend a few days with her family; and at last the Beast yielded to her entreaties.

But if you do not return to me at the end of a week, I shall die of sorrow.\" Beauty's father was almost overcome with joy at seeing his daughter again, and he was delighted to hear of her happiness and good fortune. But her two sisters--who in the meantime had married--were more jealous than ever of their beautiful sister. They were not very happy with their husbands, who were poor and not over-lovable; and they...", "...It was decided that the army was deficient in numbers and in quality. The latter defect was owing to a system of recruiting which allowed any man called to the barracks by the ballot, who did not wish to serve, to find a substitute, who for a small sum of money, would take his place. The law doing away with substitutes in the army was one of the last signed by King Leopold before his death. An early riser and indefatigable worker, Leopold often summoned his attendants at five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and remained at his desk until evening.

The return of the Catholic party was effected in 1884, and although their rule has...", "...since my childhood that the scenes of their exploits are of much more moment to me than Waterloo and Austerlitz.

We arrived at Brindisi at four o'clock in the morning. Brindisi at four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> is not pleasant, nor would any other city be on the face of this green footstool. We were in quarantine, and we had to cope with a cross stewardess, who declared that we demanded too much service, and that she would _not_ bring us our coffee in bed, and who then went and did it like an angel, so that we patted her on the back and told her in French that she was \"well amiable,\" although at that hour in the morning we would have preferred to throttle her for her...", "...and punish the mutineers. Resuming the voyage, he proceeded along the Chilian and Peruvian coast as far northward as Callao Bay, where he cruised about for some days, awaiting an opportunity of attacking the Spanish shipping there collected in considerable force. While thus waiting he employed his leisure in observations, great and small, of the sort and in the way characteristic of him all through life. One of his rough notes runs thus:--\"Cormorants resort in enormous nights, coming <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> from the northward to Callao Bay, and proceeding along shore to the southward, diving in regular succession one after another on the fish which, driven at the same time from below by shoals of porpoises, seem to have no chance but to be devoured under water or scooped up in the large bags pendent from the enormous bills of the cormorants.\" \"Prodigious seals,\" we read in another note, \"inhabit the rocks, whose grave faces and grey beards look more like the human...", "...we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings, and therefore he would not give himself the trouble to cast the lead. Accordingly we continued our course all that afternoon and night, without shortening sail, although the gunner pretended to discover Scilly light; and next morning protested in form against the captain's conduct, for which he was put in confinement, We discovered no land all that day, and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding; but at three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the ship struck, and remained fast on a sand-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was immediately hoisted out, but as we could not discern which way the shore lay, we were obliged to wait for daylight. In the meantime, the wind increased, and the waves beat against the sloop with such violence, that we expected she would have gone to pieces. The gunner was released and consulted: he advised the captain to cut away the mast, in order to lighten her; this...", "...and the court. Then the old wife went through the fair halls of Odysseus to tell the women, and to hasten their coming. So they came forth from their chamber with torches in their hands, and fell about Odysseus, and embraced him and kissed and clasped his head and shoulders and his hands lovingly, and a sweet longing came on him to weep and moan, for he remembered them every one. Book XXIII Odysseus maketh himself known to Penelope, tells his adventures briefly, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> goes to Laertes and makes himself known to him. Then the ancient woman went up into the upper chamber laughing aloud, to tell her mistress how her dear lord was within, and her knees moved fast for joy, and her feet stumbled one over the other; and she stood above the lady's head and spake to her, saying: 'Awake, Penelope, dear child, that thou mayest see with thine own eyes that which thou desirest day by day.

Remarkable as it appears, this proposition was agreed to by Bragg, and Wilder, under escort, investigated the enemy's lines prepared for assault, and counting forty-five cannon in position, supported by 25,000 men, he concluded it was impossible to further successfully defend the place. He reported the facts to the Council of War, and the demand for the surrender was acceded to at two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 17th. Under the terms of the capitulation the troops marched out with the honors of war at daylight, retained their sidearms and private property, and were at once paroled. This attack on Munfordville by Bragg established the fact that it was not his intention to press on to Louisville, and the advantage Buell derived from the delay attending this attack was in a measure some compensation for the loss of the place. Bragg then took position at Prewitt's Knob,...", "...and he would be accommodated. For those people hated aristocrats. They had a particular and malignant animosity toward what they called a \"biled shirt.\" It was a wild, free, disorderly, grotesque society! Men--only swarming hosts of stalwart men--nothing juvenile, nothing feminine, visible anywhere! In those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that rare and blessed spectacle, a woman! Old inhabitants tell how, in a certain camp, the news went abroad early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that a woman was come! They had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the camping-ground--sign of emigrants from over the great plains. Everybody went down there, and a shout went up when an actual, bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind! The male emigrant was visible.

The puppy's name must be Julie.\" In his joy at the coming of Fleur's family Marcel had forgotten, for the time being, the hearing.

It was well it had these small places of refuge, for it had many perils. Two cats, a white and a gray, patrolled the garden with silent and velvety tread; boys, who were not silent, used all kinds of small but deadly weapons on the street that ran beside it, and great heavy wagons rumbled up and down all day, making a great noise and dust.

Pliny reports of one who, dreaming he was blind, found himself so indeed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> without any preceding infirmity in his eyes. The force of imagination might assist in this case, as I have said elsewhere, and Pliny seems to be of the same opinion; but it is more likely that the motions which the body felt within, of which physicians, if they please, may find out the cause, taking away his sight, were the occasion of his dream.

Such a party greeted Steve, with Gay showing plans for Beatrice's secret room with a sliding panel--clever idea, splendid when they would be playing hide and seek--and the cooks en route with the kettles and bottles of wine and the husbands meekly arriving in sulky silence. A little before two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Steve escorted Aunt Belle back to the Constantine house.

On the 15th of August, the American army advanced down the Miamis, with its right covered by that river; and on the 18th, arrived at the rapids. Here they halted on the 19th, in order to erect a temporary work for the protection of the baggage, and to reconnoitre the situation of the enemy. The Indians were advantageously posted behind a thick wood, and behind the British fort. [Sidenote: General Wayne defeats the Indians at the Miamis.] At eight <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 20th, the American army advanced in columns: the legion with its right flank covered by the Miamis: One brigade of mounted volunteers commanded by General Todd was on the left; and the other under General Barbee was in the rear. A select battalion, commanded by Major Price, moved in front of the legion, sufficiently in advance to give timely notice for the troops to form in case of action.[25] [Footnote 25: An evasive answer having been returned to...", "...had slipped out sooner----\" Almost in silence they carried him down to the small farm called the Holme; and the good-hearted people roused from their beds did their best for him. In a short time he was undressed and put to bed.

After a time the doctor came. He was an old man, who had worn himself out in the hard practice of a wild country-side. Accidents were his daily experience, and he fell to work in the cool, business-like way acquired by custom. White and breathless, Austin Ambrose, who had been permitted to remain during the examination, waited for the verdict. It came at last. \"He's not dead,\" said the old doctor, gravely, \"and that's about all that...", "...meantime, let me follow my nose.\" He tried to answer, but he was too far gone.

I no longer thought that Alex Goddard's Children of Light and its Guatemalan accomplices were merely doing something shady. My hunch now was that it was completely illegal.

When we woke up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we laughed at it. The marquis came to see us in the evening, and greeting me with an air of mingled confusion and vexation, he said that he knew he had done wrong in surprising me as he had, but that he was ready to do anything in his power by way of atonement, and to give whatever satisfaction I liked.

A solitary mower in the meadow was very busy with his scythe, but its swishing could not be heard through the shunting.

CHAPTER I. IN THE YEAR 1877. The dale lay green <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> sunlight; the river that ran through its lowest bed sparkled with purple and amber; the leaves prattled low in the light breeze that souched through the rushes and the long grass; the hills rose sheer and white to the smooth blue lake of the sky, where only one fleecy cloud floated languidly across from peak to peak. Out of unseen places came the bleating of sheep and the rumble of distant cataracts, and above the dull thud of tumbling waters far away was the thin...", "...diminished; their enthusiasm died down as the night advanced, while the train rushed full steam ahead for the frontier of France. They fell asleep, knowing that kind comrades would awaken them when the train drew up at their various garrisons. At Reims, the compartments disgorged the dragoons pell-mell; at Chalons, so many gunners and infantry had got out that the train was half emptied. At Sainte-Menehould, a large contingent of cuirassiers and infantry had cleared out. Towards four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the express was nearing Verdun. As the train steamed out of Sainte-Menehould, a corporal of the line, who had been forced to sit up as stiff as a poker for several hours, stretched himself at length on the compartment seat with a sigh of relief. But the jerks and jolts of the carriage, the hard seat, made sleep impossible: the epaulettes of his uniform were an added source of discomfort. The corporal sat up, rubbed the musty glass of the window, and watched for the...", "...ended. Of two things you may be sure. Johnny walked that street no more at night, nor did he forget that youth with a face that was like a mask. CHAPTER XVII THE SERGEANT'S STORY When Johnny returned to the shack that night his strange guest was still asleep. A third cot had been set up in the room. Understanding this, Johnny crept between the fresh, clean-feeling sheets, and was soon sleeping soundly. When he awoke <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Drew was gone. His white-haired guest, Newton Mills, the man he had found, was seated on his bunk, chin cupped in hands, staring at the floor. Johnny lay in his bunk watching him for a full quarter of an hour. In all that time he did not move so much as a finger. This man fascinated Johnny. Does this seem strange?

We need feel no surprise that he and many of his companions thought no risk too great to run for the chance of effecting their escape. Their treatment by this time had become so bad as to be almost unendurable. For example, to avoid being frozen to death, they were compelled to run around all night, and only when the sun arose <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> dare they venture to recline themselves on the ground to sleep. The truth is, that our friend, in common with many of his comrades, had arrived at the desperate conclusion that no fate, even death by shooting, or by hounds, could be worse than the misery and suffering he was now enduring. It was not alone that they were starved and shelterless, sick and unattended, nearly naked, with no hope of being clad; it was not alone that they were immersed, day and night, in filth...", "...possible that the boys of the present day could pass through such trials and hardships, and live. We worked in this way all winter. When the job was finished, I took my little budget of clothes and started for home. I traveled the first day as far as Elizabethtown, and stopped there all night, but found no conveyance from there to New York. I was told that if I would go down to the Point, I might in the course of the day, get a passage in a sailing vessel to the city. I went down early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and, after waiting till noon, found a chance to go with two men in a small sail boat. I was greatly alarmed at the strange motions of the boat which I thought would upset, and felt greatly relieved when I was again on terra firma. I wandered about the streets of New York all that afternoon, bought a quantity of bread and cheese, and engaged a passage on the Packet Sloop Eliza, for New Haven, of her Captain Zebulon Bradley. I slept on board of her that night at the...", "...every evening fly out to sea from Dover in great numbers.] _30th, Friday._ We tacked over to the Flemish coast this morning in twenty-five fathoms of water; but it was so calm that we made little progress. It was too cloudy to take the latitude. The wind was very variable, and we could not keep on S.W., or even south, and so drifted for the most part with the tide. JULY _1st, Saturday._ We had drifted the whole night in the calm, and had gone backwards instead of forwards; but <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the wind began to blow out of the N.W. and N.N.W. with a stiff breeze. We therefore set all sail, and went ahead tolerably well on a straight course W. by S. and W.S.W. against the current. We saw land many times about two hours' distance, both on the starboard and larboard, that on the starboard being the cape of Dover, and on the larboard, the cape of Calais. There was a free wind and fine weather, though a little haze on the horizon. The land began to loom up more...", "...and then they were accepted as one of life's worst evils. To eat well was to be well, and the natural conclusion was that the best cure in case of trouble was to eat. Lack of appetite was a misfortune as well as a dangerous symptom, and to eat when not hungry was not only a necessity but a virtue. Yet Keith longed for other things and he learned early that even eating has its drawbacks. XVII Except on Sundays, the father rarely ate with the rest of the family. He left <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> before Keith was up and never came home for breakfast. His dinner often had to wait until five or six or even later, so he seldom cared to eat again when the others had their supper. One afternoon, however, he appeared just as Keith and his mother were to sit for dinner. It put her in a flutter and she couldn't get an additional cover laid quick enough. \"I heard that mother was coming,\" he remarked as he seated himself at the table. Instantly Keith's mother shot...", "...used one combination of words and some the other, but all agreed that the light had no apparent source, that it was all-pervasive, that it was very dim at first, but that it steadily increased until they fled in panic from its nameless terror. For ten years we permitted no repetition of the experiment, but a year ago my brother--he's an army officer, you know--insisted upon sleeping in the room. He remained there longer than anybody else ever had done, but between two and three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he came down the stairs with barely enough strength to cling to the balustrades, and in such an ague fit as I never saw any one else endure in all my life. He had served in the Florida swamps and was subject to agues, but for several months before that he had been free from them. I suppose the terror attacked his weakest point and brought the chills on again.\" [Sidenote: A Challenge to the Ghosts] \"Did he have the same experience the rest had had?\" I asked. \"Yes,...", "...the Southern Gate, and once free of the city, urged his horse forward toward the forest which lies between Breslen and Sturatzberg.

The work of planting gardens and cutting carriage roads through the nearer stretches of the forest which touched the city on this side was due to Ferdinand I, whose statue stood in the Grande Place, the only useful action of which he had ever been guilty, it was said. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> men riding in the Bois had inquired of one another whether the story concerning Baron Petrescu were true. One had heard this, another that. It was whispered that the Baron had been killed in a duel by a member of the British Embassy, who had also been seriously wounded; and again, that he had wounded his adversary and had then been nearly killed by his adversary's partisans. Then one man inquired the name of the woman and another where the duel had been fought, for there...", "...and sank in the sea. [Illustration] Being able to swim, I swam until night, when my arms and shoulders were tired, and, in this perilous situation, I repeated the profession of the faith, and gave myself up as lost; but the sea rose with the violence of the wind, and a wave like a vast castle threw me upon the land, in order to the accomplishment of the purpose of God. I ascended the shore, and after I had wrung out my clothes, and spread them upon the ground to dry, I slept; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I put on my clothes again, and, looking about to see which way I should go, I found a tract covered with trees, to which I advanced; and when I had walked round it, I found that I was upon a small island in the midst of the sea; upon which I said within myself, Every time that I escape from one calamity I fall into another that is worse:--but while I was reflecting upon my unfortunate case, and wishing for death, I beheld a vessel bearing a number of men. I arose...", "...away. \"I'll learn you to throw water over your poor old dad!

Martin came out from under the table, and after dressing himself with great secrecy crept to the door to make his escape. It was locked and the key taken away. But he was determined to make his escape somehow, and not wait to be whipped; so, by and by, he drew the...", "...wrong?\" _Civis Romanus_ carried the House and the country with the speaker: Palmerston's appeal saved the Government.

Next day at noon he attended a meeting of the Royal Commissioners of the Great Exhibition which was to be held the following year. After the meeting he mounted his horse, went to write his name in the Queen's book at Buckingham Palace, and then rode up Constitution Hill. He stopped to talk to the Hon. Miss Ellis, whom he met riding down from Hyde Park: something frightened his horse, which, by a sudden bound, unseated him. Peel in falling kept hold of the...", "...him to come home. How she would love to play the good fairy to these people, and to see them happy after all their troubles! Then her thoughts turned to her own affairs. She never ceased to long for her father, although her life was much brighter and happier than it used to be. Night and morning she prayed that he might be given to her. She would lie awake picturing their happy meeting, and sometimes the visions that she conjured up in the night were so lifelike that she would wake <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> almost expecting them to prove realities. But the days and weeks went by, and nothing happened to bring any nearer that longed-for day when he should come. Next morning Marjory signalled to Blanche that she would like to ride with her, and the answer came that she would be ready at eleven. Marjory asked Peter to saddle Brownie early, so that she would have time to go to Hillcrest before calling at Braeside.

This was one of the most extraordinary escapes we had in the course of this expedition; for Captain Cheap, and every one else, had entirely given themselves up for lost. However, it pleased God that we got that evening into Redwood Cove, where the weather continued so bad all night, we could keep no fire in to dry ourselves with; but there being no other alternative for us, but to stay here and starve, or put to sea again, we chose the latter, and put out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> again, though the weather was very little mended. In three or four days after, we arrived at our old station, Wager's Island; but in such a miserable plight, that though we thought our condition upon setting out would not admit of any additional circumstance of misery, yet it was to be envied in comparison of what we now suffered, so worn and reduced were we by fatigue and hunger; having eat nothing for some days but sea-weed and tangle.

Washington sent out some of his men on wagon-horses to beat the woods; who came in about dusk, without having, however, discovered any traces of the enemy. About nine o'clock that same night, an Indian runner came from the Half King with word, that some of his hunters had late that evening seen the tracks of two Frenchmen not five miles distant; and that, if Col. Washington would join him with some of his men, they would set out early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> in quest of the lurking foe. Taking with him about forty men, and leaving the rest to guard the intrenchments, Washington set out forthwith for the Indian camp. Their way led them through tall and thick woods, that were then in the full leaf of early summer. As if to deepen their gloom, the sky was overcast with the blackest of clouds, from which the rain poured down in torrents; and the night, of course, was as dark as dark could be. No wonder, then, that they were...", "...as his presence had not yet been discovered. All that day the negroes gave themselves over to eating and drinking.

I was taken to the best assemblies, where the monks swarmed. I was introduced to a lady of monstrous size, who, I was informed, was cousin to the famous Palafox, and I did not feel my bosom swell with pride as was evidently expected. I also made the acquaintance of Canon Pignatelli, a man of Italian origin. He was President of the Inquisition, and every morning he imprisoned the procuress who had furnished him with the girl with whom he had supped and slept. He would wake up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> tired out with the pleasures of the night; the girl would be driven away and the procuress imprisoned. He then dressed, confessed, said mass, and after an excellent breakfast with plenty of good wine he would send out for another girl, and this would go on day after day. Nevertheless, he was held in great respect at Saragossa, for he was a monk, a canon, and an Inquisitor.

The bride rushed through the formula of...", "...what they used to be,\" but more likely than not, a passing animal had polluted the water previous to our consumption and we were victims of chance. By evening we felt much better and prepared the car for our early morning departure. Before trying to indulge in some restless sleep, however, we drove to the park and made a final circuit of our favorite scenic views. I branded the magnificence into my mind so I could later return to the mountains in envisioned thoughts. At 4:00 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we were off, drifting down the black road which wound silently through the mountain pass. Above, rocky sentinels observed our progress, their formidable figures etched against the dark mat of the sky. As we coasted deeper into the rocky crevasse, the stars receded into the morning light, bowing to the far greater sun which sought dominion over the earth and sky. With the coming of dawn, the spell of silence was broken. and we gained relatively flat land. \"You...", "...\"Yes, a nest. And the very thing for me.

You have a lovely voice; I have been listening to it all the time.\" But she drew back her...", "...led by the Swiss hotel-keeper of the place and his wife, had marched down to the gate after the Boxers had rushed in, had locked it, and taken the key home to bed, so that no one else could pay us their attentions from this quarter. This is the simplest and the most sensible thing which has been yet done, and it shows how we will have to take the law into our own hands if we are to survive. In this fashion the Boxers were ushered in on us. Most of us kept awake until ten or eleven <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for fear that by sleeping we might miss some incidents. But even the Boxers had apparently become tired, for there was not a sign of a disturbance after midnight.

This made especially difficult the laying of concrete foundations for the heavy guns. The first detachment of British troops, numbering about 8,000 marines, reached Antwerp on October 3, 1914. This buoyed up the spirits of the Belgian soldiers and redoubled their efforts. Under cover of the continuous fire of their guns, the Germans made determined efforts to cross the river Nethe at Waelhem. Desperate fighting, which lasted all night and until early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of October 4, took place. This attempt, however, failed. Later in the day the Germans succeeded in putting a pontoon bridge in place. Troops in solid masses hurried across; but as they reached the other side some well-directed shots from the Belgian guns blew the pontoon bridge to pieces, killing many. Throughout the night of October 4, 1914, and the day and night of October 5, the battle raged about Lierre with savage ferocity. The British marines had by this time...", "...too soon, or too late; a few lucky ones come in the very nick of time. The last named are favourites, selected with no obvious reason by Fortune, and greatly envied by their contemporaries; it is usual for them to claim the entire credit to themselves.

Gertie's escort had a pair of driving-gloves, and he could not determine whether it looked more aristocratic to wear these or to carry them with a negligent air; he compromised on the departure platform by wearing one and carrying the other.

One night by accident the hostler had shut the stable-door, and Ralph was deprived of his friend the whole night; but the hostler found <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the bottom of the door so pecked away, that had it not been opened, Ralph would in another hour have made his own entrance-port.

A respectable old lady, long since gone to her rest, and whose grandchildren are somewhat aristocratic, was wont in those days to go away to the woods early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to gather and eat the buds of the basswood, and then bring an apronfull home to her family. In one neighbourhood a beef bone passed from house to house, and was boiled again and again in order to extract some nutriment from it. This is no fiction, but a literal fact. Many other equally uninviting bills of fare might be given, but these no doubt will suffice.

From six to nine chin-chucking, not actually upon the Parade and the Terrace, but close by, among the trees, on the steps of houses, beside the pond, was an amusement in full flow. Many of the higglers were comely red-cheeked damsels who thought it fine thus to be noticed by the quality, and I suppose no harm came of it all, save a little...", "...till towards noon of the 22d, when the weather cleared up, and we observed in latitude 55 deg. 48' S., longitude 156 deg. 56' W.

At the same time I liked the idea of the warning. It would at any rate be original, especially if I succeeded in beating the major. But it was clear that I could not kill him.

Just below the junction of these two creeks (although the southern one is only a small one and in it we got the water) the creek is from 250 to 300 yards broad with splendid gums in it on its banks. Although I searched up and down the main creek some distance still no water to be found, the bed of the creek is so very sandy. My reason for camping at so short a stage was that from the top of the hill I was on I fancy I could...", "...would help. Then he could get to work. What was today's assignment? He tried to remember.

The church seats at Yoxham were broad, with soft cushions, and the hassocks were well stuffed. Surely, Daniel Thwaite did not know everything. As she thus built her castles in the air,--castles so impossible to be inhabited,--she fell asleep before she had resolved what letter she should write. But <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> she did write her letter. It must be written,--and when the family were about the house, she would be too disturbed for so great an effort. It ran as follows:-- Yoxham, Friday. DEAREST MAMMA, I am much obliged for your letter, which I got the day before yesterday. Lord Lovel came here yesterday, or perhaps I might have answered it then.

But the waves were immense at high tide, and the fishermen muttered among themselves and stared darkly out over the mighty breakers. It was known among them that a boat had put out to sea <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and had not returned before the rising of the gale. There were heavy hearts in Old Silverstrand that day. But to launch another boat to search for the missing one was out of the question. The great seas that came hurling into the little fishing-harbour were sufficient proof of that, even to the most inexperienced landsman. Seton, learning the news when lunch was half over, rushed off to New Silverstrand in the hope that the boat might have been driven in that...", "...dead before he expired.

The blockhouses were reduced to a heap of ruins; the palisades were beaten down, and most of the guns dismounted and otherwise disabled. The barracks were battered in every part, so that the troops could not remain in them. They were under the necessity of working and watching the whole night to repair the damages of the day, and to guard...", "...increased; and that the plank was so rotten it broke away like dirt; and that now it was impossible to save the ship; for they could not come at the leak because the water in the room was got above it. The rest of the night we spent in pumping and bailing. I worked myself to encourage my men, who were very diligent; but the water still increased, and we now thought of nothing but saving our lives. Wherefore I hoisted out the boat that, if the ship should sink, yet we might be saved: and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we weighed our anchor and warped in nearer the shore; yet did but little good.

In the meanwhile all but about 400 of the men were allowed to return to their homes to put their affairs in order for a prolonged absence. About 1,000 Secessionists, under the command of Walter S. O'Kane, marched on June 19 to attack them. Col. Cook was informed of the intended attack and prepared for it by throwing out pickets and summoning his absentees. At 3 o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of June 20 the Secessionists reached the pickets, whom they bayonetted to prevent their giving the alarm, and rushed in upon the sleeping Unionists, pouring volley after volley into the barns. The men in one of the barns had been warned, but were prevented from firing by the Union Flag which the Secessionists carried. Many of them who managed to get out of the barns were rallied behind the corn cribs, and began an obstinate fight which lasted till daylight.

Why not?\" \"I may have time,\" Ned replied. Frank threw himself on the blankets which had been provided by Mr. Green and closed his eyes, which were still smarting from the effects of the smoke. \"If you go away to-morrow,\" he said, presently,...", "...magnificent table which was fit for a king. On one of these trips certain machinery was broken at Rochester, and it was thought that they had to go afoot to Muscatine to make the repairs before the steamer could proceed further. A village blacksmith by the name of Jim Grant, a cousin of the general, after looking over the broken piston rods, said in his laconic way, \"I'd rather pound away here all summer, than have a man walk to Muscatine and back,\" and he was as good as his word, for <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he had the damage repaired and received a good day's wages and three cheers from the crew and the passengers.

Outside the window which overlooked the lake from two hundred feet above the street, the sleet-like snow was driving ceaselessly; all over the western basin of the great lakes, as Constance knew--over Huron, over Michigan, and Superior--the storm was established. Its continuance and severity had claimed a front-page column <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> papers. Duluth that morning had reported temperature of eighteen below zero and fierce snow; at Marquette it was fifteen below; there was driving snow at the Soo, at Mackinac, and at all ports along both shores.

And as it was, Mrs. Carson insisted upon it that the boys remain all night. \"If you leave the house I'll be worried to death, thinking the lion caught you,\" she said. So the boys stayed over another night.

Strongly posted on a semicircular hill, at the forks of Middle Creek, on both sides of the road, with cannon commanding its whole length, and hidden by the trees, they were waiting his coming. The Union commander broke up his bivouac at four <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and began to move forward. Reaching the valley of Middle Creek, he encountered some of the enemy's mounted men, and captured a quantity of stores they were trying to withdraw from Prestonburg. Skirmishing went on until about noon, when the Rebel pickets were driven back upon their main body, and then began the battle. It is not my purpose to describe it; for that has already been ably done, in thirty lines, by the man who won it. It was a wonderful battle. In the...", "...there was in the monastery a young monk, Brother Lawrence, of such steadfast life and holiness that his prayers would almost avail to give life to the dead; and that he would dispense him leave, if he were willing to go with her awhile; for the Prior saw that she was a great lady, and he was moved by her grief and purity. So Brother Lawrence was fetched, and soon stood before them; and the Prior told the lady's tale, and Brother Lawrence said that he would go, if he was permitted. So <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they rode away. Then the Lady Alice told him all the tale, saying that the sick man was the Baron de Benoit, and that he loved not God, though he served him faithfully, though knowing not that it was God whom he served. And the monk said, \"Ay, and there be many such;\" but she wondered that he grew so strangely pale, yet thought that it was his long fasting, and the bitter morning air. Then the monk questioned her very nearly about all her life, saying that in such cases...", "...go without a thing. \"Don't have to afford necessities.

She was quite happy the next few days planning for their descent on the shops. She sang at her work--warbling that was natural as that of the little bird which prinks and plumes for its mate <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> sunlight. Reflecting her happy mood, Carter was humorously cheerful--so pleased and satisfied that she stared when, one evening, he came in, gloomy and depressed. His black mood had come out of the east with a moaning wind that now herded leaden clouds over dun prairies. For one day rain pelted down, then, veering north, the bitter wind blew hard for a second day. That evening it died, and a pale sun swung down a cloudless sky to a colorless horizon. Under its cold...", "...he immediately brought to, with the ship's head off from the land, and gave a signal for the Friendship to do the same. They lay to all night, and the next morning were surprised with the sight of a most mountainous coast, bearing from north-east by east to west-north-west, about five or six leagues distant. This proved sufficiently that the land seen the preceding day could not be Egmont Island, and Lieutenant Shortland was inclined to think that this was united to it. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he bore away west by north, and west by north half north, as the land trended, running along the shore at five or six leagues distance. The most eastern point of this land he called Cape Henslow, the most western which was then in sight, Cape Hunter. Between these two points the land is very singularly mountainous, the summits of the mountains rising among the clouds to a prodigious height. It may be known by one summit more elevated than the rest, which, from being...", "...of habitations or trace of cultivation was visible; we had no corn for our cattle, but fortunately the more sheltered spots in the vicinity of water were clothed with luxuriant grass, which the horses greedily eat. Our followers had, with the improvidence of Asiatics, brought but a scanty supply of food, and indeed we were all to blame for having trusted too much to the wild mountains for supplies. There were plenty of chikore, however, and as I had succeeded in shooting two or three <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we were not entirely without food; and having pitched our tent, we retired to rest in the hope that the next day we should come upon some fort where we might recruit. As we were preparing to start early on the morning of the 31st, we met a traveller pursuing his solitary way to Keune, who, after expressing his wonder at encountering a party of Feringhis in such a place, inquired our proposed route. We informed him that our intention was to proceed over the Surruk...", "...to beset her solitary path? Why had he so recklessly exposed her to them? Vain questions, alas! vain as was his self-reproach, his anguish and despair! CHAPTER XXVII. THE MISSING MARIAN. In the meantime, how had the morning broken upon Dell-Delight? How upon Luckenough? and how at Old Field Cottage? At Dell-Delight the old man had expired just before the sun arose. The two physicians that had been summoned the night previous, but had been delayed by the storm, arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> only to see the patient die. Many inquiries were made and much conjecture formed as to the cause of Thurston Willcoxen's improper and unaccountable absence at such a juncture. But Melchizedek, poor, faithful fellow, having followed his master's steps, did not appear, and no one else upon the premises could give any explanation relative to the movements of their young master. He had left the bedside of his dying relative at nine o'clock the night before, and he had not...", "...try on their costumes until the day of the performance. It was Helen and Margaret and their classmates who were making them but they were so absorbed in doing all these extra matters in addition to their regular club tasks and pleasures that they felt it would only add one more thrill if at this last-minute trying-on all the costumes should be proved misfits and have to be made over in one day! Nothing of the sort happened, however, though there were dress rehearsals at seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the appointed day, when early risers saw braves in full war paint flocking to the lake front, with a tread not as stealthy as it would be at night when boots should be exchanged for moccasins. The scenes were staged on a large raft anchored in the lake before the hotel and girt with low bushes so that it looked like an island. The observers assembled on the lawn that sloped from the hotel to the water, and spread along the pebbly beach. Those in front brought camp...", "...a \"hunter\" for the next day would be impossible, but he would do what he could for a few days hence. All he could promise for the morning would be to lend me a horse of his own, a thoroughbred mare, not up to my weight, but tough and wiry, and good for any amount of road-work. He kindly volunteered to arrange for our going by the first train to Coventry, only a couple of miles from Brinklow (it turned out to be nine miles), so that we should arrive fresh on the ground. At seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he came to my room to say that everything was arranged, and that I should find the mare at the station in an hour. Swallowing a glass of milk as a stay-stomach,--my usual habit,--I put myself, for the first time since the war ended, into breeches and boots, and drove to the station. On a turn-out stood a \"horse-box,\" one of the institutions of England,--a three-stabled freight-car for the transportation of horses. Paying five shillings for a horse-ticket to Coventry...", "...I----\" \"Do you mind calling me Paula,\" she said in the most matter-of-fact tone. \"I hate the name of Marsh--it's my Uncle James' name--and it's always on those horrid law papers--'_Marsh versus Marsh_.'

Paula smiled. \"That idea has occurred to me dozens of times,\" she said gaily. \"I will when this horrible lawsuit is settled.\" His companion grew a shade paler. \"Is that a--a bargain----\" he asked seriously. \"Yes,\" she laughed. \"And may I--pick--pick out a suitable name for you----?\" \"If you...", "...spices.\" (Mark xvi: 1,) and be ready to keep the Sabbath according to the commandment, (please read it in Exo. xx: 8-11,) as stated in Luke xxiii: 54-56.

Here then is the three days: The day before the Sabbath he was entombed, between the hours of 3 and 6 P.M., and the day after the Sabbath, the first day of the week, he arose. As J. B.

Whitby and Scott say, \"It is a received rule among the Jews that a part of a day is put for a whole day.\" And so, let me add, it is with the commercial nations of the earth.

We went on the rock and turned over on the side just outside of the Agness lighthouse.\" Then the captain said, \"What kind of a man are you?\" \"Just an ordinary minister,\" I answered. The captain then told me his father was captain of that ship at that time. (It might be interesting to the reader to know that we lay on our side until almost six fifteen <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when the ship straightened up as the tide arose. Then they cut the anchor chain and we backed up and went our way.) Needless to say, that night was one of the greatest prayer meetings ever held. While I was speaking with the Captain, the first mate had come, a fine tall Englishman. \"Will you kindly go with me to the front end of the ship and see if we can see any lights? We are lost. We don't know where we are.\" I answered, \"I know nothing about navigation sir.\" He...", "...were busy making lint. Once we stopped at a neighbor's to gather the news, but that did not interfere with our labors at all. Four miles from here we met a crowd of women flying, and among them recognized Mrs. La Noue and Noemie. A good deal of loud shouting brought them to the carriage in great surprise to see us there. They were running from the plantation where they had taken refuge, as it was not safe from the shells, as the gunboats had proved to them. The reports we had heard <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> were from shots fired on this side of the river by them, in hopes of hurting a guerrilla or two. Noemie told us that two Western regiments had laid down their arms, and General Williams had been killed by his own men. She looked so delighted, and yet it made me sick to think of his having been butchered so. Phillie leaned out, and asked her, as she asked everybody, if she knew anything about her father. Noemie, in her rapture over that poor man's death, exclaimed, \"Don't...", "...got rid of his patriotic notions as to the propriety of living on his own estate, had determined forthwith to send Brien Boru over to Scott's English stables; and then, went to bed, and dreamed that he was a winner of the Derby, and was preparing for the glories of Newmarket with five or six thousand pounds in his pocket.

At long last, in the end, the horn grew to be as thin and worn away as a knitting needle, by the continuous rubbing. One night there happened to be a great storm. There came frost, snow and wind, very violent. The roofing was swept away off the forge, and along with it went the plumage and feathers of the crow, and the poor crow was left <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> after that dreadful night, and he without a feather or any plumage on his body, but just as much as if he had been scalded with boiling water. When the sun rose after that in the morning there came a rest and a calm, but the poor crow was afraid to go out, and [_i.e._, after] the flaying that had been done upon him during the night. \"Oh,\" said he, \"it's a long time I'm in this world, and I never felt a single other night of such bad weather as the night last night.

Not finding enough to do in teaching his brother, Balzac advertised to tutor boys who were backward in their studies.

That is the way: we buy our tickets to one place and Fate puts us off at another! \"Put me off at Buffalo,\" we say, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we find ourselves on the platform at Rochester. Madame De Berney was the mother of nine, and she was just twenty-two years older than Balzac. The son she wished to have tutored was weak in body and not strong in mind.

His downfall had been a calamity; his return to the Faith would mean a triumph over the powers of evil. Thus did the car rush through the night, its bright headlights picking out the road in front of it; blackness around; the horn now sounding its deep note as they dashed past a township, while Father Healy was praying for the sick man in Melbourne. It was three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when the car entered the sleeping city, where darkness and quiet held possession. Here and there a light shone from a window, telling its tale of sickness; now and again they passed a night wanderer or policeman; but Melbourne lay in placid sleep, reinvigorating itself for the busy day. In the flat Denis Quirk was sitting in an armchair anxiously expecting the sound of the motor. His quick ears heard it as it came up Collins Street, and he was at the door to admit...", "...and myself were both covered with blood. Let me tell you about this battle. The war was between the Blackfeet and the Crees. The camp was on Old Man's River. The bands were so many that they were camped on every bend of the river. My father, Mountain Chief, was at the upper end of the camp. I was twenty-two years old at the time. It was in the fall of the year, and the leaves had all fallen. The lower camp was attacked by the Crees at night. The people were just getting up <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when the news came that the lower camp had been attacked by the Crees. I got my best horse; it was a gray horse. My father led his band in company with Big Lake who that summer had been elected a big chief. We rode up over the ridge while in the plain below the battle was raging. As we rode down the hill slope, I began to sing my war song. I carried the shield in my hand and this song that I sung belonged to that shield.

What evenings I have spent in these rooms! What little suppers, or _sizings_, as they were called, have I enjoyed; when Aeschylus and Plato and Thucydides were pushed aside with a pile of lexicons and the like, to discuss the pamphlets of the day! Ever and anon a pamphlet issued from the pen of Burke.

It is the one source of information as to the last days of Shelley; concerning Byron's, others have furnished material. Trelawney is suspected of mingling some fiction with his...", "...now, men of Portie--sailors and fishers--ay, and sutors and saddlers, masons and merchants--every man among you, I have just one word more to say to you all--but chiefly to you sailors. Willie here has whispered two words in my ear, and one of them I'll give you. \"Never through all that terrible storm that beat upon them, nor after it, when the bitter thought that the ship must be forsaken was forced upon them, nor during the long doubtful days--harder to bear--that followed, when <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> none could say whether hope or fear was to win the day, or at night whether there was to be another day to them-- through all that time, I say, not a man among them looked to the devil for courage to dare his fate, or deaden his fears. There passed not the lips of a man among them a drop of that which has lost more ships, and broken more hearts, and beguiled more sailors from their duty, than you and I, and all here could count in a day.\" \"Is that so, Willie?\" cried a...", "...by the separate colonies, or \"cites,\" so called, consisting of blocks of miners' cottages and works united in one big mining district.

Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the Allies, striking together on a nine-mile front east and northeast of Flanders, carried all their objectives excepting those on the right flank. French troops on the left drove the Germans from the tongue of land between the Yser Canal and the Martjevaart and won the bridgehead at Dreigrachten.

Moreover the government--whether from want of judgment, from negligence, or from any evil design, we cannot tell--no longer as formerly enrolled the communities admitted to the franchise after 513 in newly instituted election-districts, but included them along with others in the old; so that gradually each tribe came to be composed of different townships scattered over the whole Roman territory.

She embraced me tenderly, probably out of gratitude, because I did not pester her with useless questions, and she promised to write to me, and I held her hands for a long time and kissed them, finding it hard to keep back my tears, and not saying a word. And when the train moved, I stood looking at the receding lights, kissed her in my imagination and whispered: \"Masha dear, wonderful Masha!...\" I spent the night at Mikhokhov, at Karpovna's, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I worked with Radish, upholstering the furniture at a rich merchant's, who had married his daughter to a doctor.

About the end of this year, the king became much indisposed, and exhibited the first signs of that mental aberration, which, in after years, so heavily afflicted him.

And they bowed their heads and lay down in the place where they stood. Then came the black raven of Corri- nan-creag, whose eyes never closed, and whose wings never tired; and he fluttered before the face of Covan and told him that he knew of a cranny in the rock where there was food in plenty, and soft moss for a bed. 'Go with me thither,' he said to Covan, 'and you shall lay aside three-thirds of your weariness, and depart <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> refreshed,' and Covan listened thankfully to his words, and at dawn he rose up to seek his cows. 'Farewell!' cried the black raven. 'You trusted me, and took all I had to offer in return for the food you once gave me. So if in time to come you need a friend, wish for me, and I will not fail you.' As before, the cows were standing in the spot where he had left them, ready to set out.

Jerome, at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned Theodore severely why he had accused him to Manfred of being privy to his escape. Theodore owned it had been with design to prevent Manfred's suspicion from alighting on Matilda; and added, the holiness of Jerome's life and character secured him from the tyrant's wrath. Jerome was heartily grieved to discover his son's inclination for that princess; and leaving him to his rest, promised <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion. Theodore, like Isabella, was too recently acquainted with parental authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart. He had little curiosity to learn the friar's reasons, and less disposition to obey them. The lovely Matilda had made stronger impressions on him than filial affection. All night he pleased himself with visions of love; and it was not till late after the morning office...", "...the effect of his mischievous blue eye. \"Well, you need not be so fierce, Mother Carey,\" said the youth with an affected air of deprecation. \"Don't mother me,\" said the jolly widow with a kindling eye; \"go to your own mother, who is dying in a back cellar without a winder, while you've got lodgings in a two pair.\" \"Dying; she's only drunk,\" said the youth. \"And if she is only drunk,\" rejoined Mrs Carey in a passion, \"what makes her drink but toil; working from five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to seven o'clock at night, and for the like of such as you.\" \"That's a good one,\" said the youth; \"I should like to know what my mother ever did for me, but give me treacle and laudanum when I was a babby to stop my tongue and fill my stomach; by the token of which, as my gal says, she stunted the growth of the prettiest figure in all Mowbray.\" And here the youth drew himself up, and thrust his hands in the side pockets of his pea-jacket. \"Well, I never,\" said Mrs...", "...themselves clean, tidy, and ship-shape for the journey to come.

The woman, who was then a girl in the first bloom of youth, full of strength and spirit, was moved to pity on me, for that wherein I was fallen, and coming to me with a rope, said to me, \"Lay hold of this rope.\" So I laid hold of the rope and clung to it and she pulled me up; but, when I was halfway up, I pulled her [down] and she fell with me into the pit; and there we abode three days, she and I and the dog. When her people arose <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and saw her not, they sought her in the camp, but, finding her not and missing me also, doubted not but she had fled with me. Now she had four brothers, as they were falcons, and they mounted and dispersed in quest of us.

She threw herself wearily on the luxurious bed, and in spite of hunger and thirst and terror, slept heavily for hours. When she awakened, she felt sure that day must be far advanced.

The small army of Christians attacking the great force of the Turkish fleet was an undertaking similar to the assault of David upon the giant Goliath. On October 7, 1571, the deciding battle was fought, in the Bay of Lepanto. The battle raged from six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until six o'clock at night. It was one of the most terrific battles ever fought. And, lo! in the evening, toward six o'clock, the battle ended in the victory of the Christians over their powerful enemy. This wonderful victory of the Christians was undoubtedly due to the assistance of the Blessed Virgin. Pope Pius V so declared, and in memory of this wonderful achievement he added to the litany of the Blessed Virgin the supplication: \"Help of Christians, pray for us!\" He...", "...time, I turned my eyes to the heaven in the direction of a particular star; I, however, could not find the star, nor indeed many of the starry train, the greater number having fled, from which circumstance, and from the appearance of the sky, I concluded that morning was nigh.

As he lay there and watched the sunlight run through the lattices like strands of pale-coloured silk, it seemed to him that he was through the worst. He did what he had not done for many days, allowed the thought of his wife to come and dwell with him. He went over many of their past years together, and, nodding his head, decided that he had been often to blame. Then the further thought of...", "...of an ascetic Bedawy prophet--are small as those of the simplest hermit. Water and a few dates often suffice him for days together.

It is regarded by him as wholly needless, and indeed as an exceptional indulgence. The double meal of flesh does not resemble the simple diet of bread and water on which the Prophet lived afterwards at Sarepta. Are we or are we not to take this as a literal fact? Here we are face to face with a plain question to which I should deem it infamous to give a false or a prevaricating answer.

The feeding of this irrigator was the constant preoccupation of Monsieur Perdrix, who would sometimes get up at five o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> in order to fill the tank. Then, in his shirt sleeves, his big stomach almost bursting from his trousers, he would pump wildly, so that on returning from the office he could have the satisfaction of letting the fountain play and of imagining that it was cooling off the garden.

During the War fashionable ladies by thousands willingly got up at six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to scrub canteen floors or serve coffee, in order to add to the comfort of their working-class countrymen--in khaki. They did this, one assumes, from the love of countrymen who risked their lives and suffered hardship in the execution of duty. It sounds satisfactory until the same countryman ceases fighting and turns to extremely hard and hazardous duties like mining, or fishing in winter-time in the North Sea.

The able little 323 came up to her stern; breasted her waist, her bridge, and as he passed her (and he came quite close to let all hands view the passing), young Captain Chisholm leaned out...", "...you said--dinner first!\" THIRTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER BETH AND ADITH MALLORY Beth Truba dreamed: She had been traveling for days and years, over plains, through the rifts of high mountains, across rivers and through great lonely silences, with just a dog for a companion. A white dog with small black spots, very playful and enduring, and though not large, he was very brave to contend with all that was fearful. At night he curled up close to her and licked her hand, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> before the weary hours, he played about and made her laugh. They came at last to a great desert. There was no other way, but to cross, if she hoped ever to reach her journey's end....

At length one mid-day, the dog could go no further. He sat down upon his haunches and...", "...Sergeant-Major Grant at the door of the orderly tent. Three men, as in file, came marching through the doorway, and as they reached the camp table at which I sat, the Sergeant-Major continued, \"Halt, Left Turn, Right-Dress.\" The men turned smartly, facing me.

Finding that our day's journeys were much shorter than I had anticipated, our allowance of food for supper was somewhat reduced. The thermometer in the evening stood at +11 deg.

After a sound night's rest we resumed our journey at 5 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of the 9th.

In trying to return she became confused, and she wisely decided to keep with the cattle. When they lay down for the night, she sheltered herself against the warm back of a motherly old cow, and then followed them about <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> till the neighbors found her. She was none the worse for the night's adventure except for her fright at the howling of the wolves, and from the pain of her slightly frost-bitten feet. But the fate of a little boy who wandered from home in Williams County was of a singular pathos. He was found dead after a three-days search, when the poor little body, which was half clad, was still warm.

Howard, however, effected a crossing of Citico Creek and a junction with Sherman, and was directed to report to him. With two or three regiments of his command he moved <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> along the banks of the Tennessee, and reached the point where the bridge was being laid. He went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end, and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and moving himself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadway put upon it.

Brown was the uncle of Page, between whom there being some misunderstanding, Page built and freighted the _Halcyon_ after the departure of...", "...too much absorbed, in her own feelings to perceive or to be grateful for her kindness; and as each day brought a no better report, her despair became so engrossing that she could not attempt any employment. She wandered in the garden, sat in dreamy fits of silence in the house, and at last, after receiving one of the worst accounts, sat up in her dressing-gown the whole of one night, in one dull, heavy, motionless trance of misery. She recollected that she must act her part, dressed <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and came down; but her looks were ghastly; she tasted no food, and as soon as possible left the breakfast-room. Her mother was going in quest of her when old nurse came with an anxious face to say,--'Ma'am, I am afraid Miss Edmonstone must be very ill, or something. Do you know, ma'am, her bed has not been slept in all night?' 'You don't say so, nurse!' 'Yes, ma'am, Jane told me so, and I went to look myself.

But instead of that, they were forced to experience the biting reality of a cutting off here, too, the place being too important for money-saving not to be used. True, it would cost something, but the custom had been to keep the hall comfortable through cold weather. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> they would let the steam into the shop and have that warm when the men were ready to commence their work, and keep it so during the day. But a different policy had now been adopted. The present fall had nearly passed and no steam had been admitted into these apartments at all, the cook-room and reception-room drawing from the waste steam and engine boilers. People outside had long been using fires constantly and freely. At length, a remark of the warden to company,...", "...teetotaler, take a little medicine, some of this apple jack to brace you up.\" He said, \"No, go ahead, I will keep in sight.\" We went on slowly, he well behind.

He came up and said, \"Captain, where is that bottle?\" I took it out, unscrewed the cover and said, \"Now drink enough to brace you up. It will not hurt you if you drink it all.\" He took some and it helped him and we got to the flour mill.

We went to the pickets and when they were relieved went with them to their camp at Strawberry Plains in East Tennessee. This was on Sunday. In the afternoon the rest of our crew came in.

While waiting for the train and talking with the officers there, we were asked if we had any money. Some had a...", "...so when we haven't done right ourselves--and I really believe it is--for I remember how discontented I felt that night. Presently Race spoke: 'See that star over the mountain, Dimpey! don't it look handsome up there all alone? By the by, who is going to wait on you to the picnic--you didn't say, did you?' I was so vexed at the question, I'd a great mind to answer,'It's none of _your_ business, Race Miller, who I go with,' but just then, I can't tell why, the thoughts I'd had <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> out in the orchard all came back to me, and I remembered how Race had given up coming to ask me because his mother wanted him; and then I thought how good he was to his mother, and waited on her as if she was a pretty young girl. And what would _my_ mother say, if she was living, to hear me speak so. Father always said _she_ never gave any one a cross word in her life! I looked up at the star, and it appeared to me that mother might be up there watching me, and knowing...", "...it was towed by the boat to the ships. In this way, by constant and sleepless exertions, in the space of two days, almost every thing of value was transported on board the squadron, and little else left than the hull of the caravel, stranded, decayed, and rotting in the river. Diego Mendez superintended the whole embarkation with unwearied watchfulness and activity. He, and five companions, were the last to leave the shore, remaining all night at their perilous post, and embarking <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with the last cargo of effects. Nothing could equal the transports of the Spaniards, when they found themselves once more on board of the ships, and saw a space of ocean between them and those forests which had lately seemed destined to be their graves. The joy of their comrades seemed little inferior to their own; and the perils and hardships which yet surrounded them, were forgotten for a time in mutual congratulations. The admiral was so much impressed with a sense...", "...Soll ich athmen, soll ich lauschen! So the thing went; and I panted and throbbed, and sank down upon the ground for weakness. There came to me all that mad poetry that I had written myself, all that victory that I had won, that freedom, that vision, that glory! It came to me ten times over, for was it not everything to me now? It was more than I could bear, it split my brain. And it would not leave me. All through the long, long night I prayed and wept with it; and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I reeled through the street with it, and men stared at me. * * * * * But here was one time when I did not fear men! I was free--I was a soul at last. I had won the victory, I went my way as a god. I had renounced, I had given up fear, I had given up my _self_. My mind was made up, and I never change my mind. I had passed the death-sentence upon myself, I walked through the streets as a disembodied soul--as the Captive dragged to the...", "...right. I'll take a look at the milk-room. Where's Ham?\" \"Out among the stock. Dab's just gone to him.\" Curious things people will do at times. Miranda had put down the coffee-pot on the range. There was not a single one of the farm \"help\" around, male or female, and there stood the blooming young bride, with her back toward her mother, and staring out through the open door. And then Mrs. Kinzer slipped forward and put her arms around her daughter's neck. Well, it was very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for those two women to stand there and cry; but it seemed to do them good, and Miranda remarked, at last, as she kissed Mrs. Kinzer: \"O mother, it is all so good and beautiful, and I'm so happy.\" And then they both laughed in a subdued and quiet way, and Miranda picked up the coffee-pot while her mother walked away into the milk-room. Such cream as there seemed to be on all the pans that morning! As for Ham Morris, his first visit, on leaving the house, had been...", "...do you mean?

Yet, illuminated by the sunshine, or darkened by the alternate shade of the houses, and with its garments fluttering lightly <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> breeze, there passed the image along the street. It was exactly and minutely the shape, the garb, and the face which the towns-people had so recently thronged to see and admire. Not a rich flower upon her head, not a single leaf, but had had its prototype in Drowne's wooden workmanship, although now their fragile grace had become flexible, and was shaken by every footstep that the wearer made. The broad gold chain upon the neck was identical with the one represented on...", "...Froehlich kept a little draper's shop which might have had customers enough, thanks to its position in a street of shops in the center of the town: but she did not bother about it any more than about her garden. Instead of doing her housework herself, as, according to Frau Vogel, every self-respecting woman ought to do--especially when she is in circumstances which do not permit much less excuse idleness--she had hired a little servant, a girl of fifteen, who came in for a few hours <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to clean the rooms and look after the shop, while the young woman lay in bed or dawdled over her toilet. Christophe used to see her sometimes, through his windows, walking about her room, with bare feet, in her long nightgown, or sitting for hours together before her mirror: for she was so careless that she used to forget to draw her curtains: and when she saw him, she was so lazy that she could not take the trouble, to go and lower them. Christophe, more modest than...", "...and they have nearly as many as we have.

No one goes out in a carriage till after two, as the servants dine at one, and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> early the footman is employed in the house. A coachman never leaves his box here, and a footman is indispensable on all occasions. No visit can be paid till three; and this gives me very little time in these short days.

Pa went to the police station and reported his loss, also my loss, too. The sergeant said it did look queer. However, we looked all over the house, but not a sign of the missing bank-notes.

The police were at work on the case, so were the newspapers. Hearst's \"American\" got the real first news; said a man in a big house in the suburbs had all the money that had been lost, but not much came to light till some days later, for the house had a high stone wall and was guarded by big men, who said Mr. Worthington, the author, was busy writing a book on his European travels and...", "...at him rather hard and Barbara waited.

All through the night the struggle lasted, but between five and six o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> it became plain to every one that the powder-magazine was in imminent danger of being blown up. Then the brave garrison agreed to an honourable capitulation; and as they marched out, the people, with savage cries of triumph, flung themselves into the building. The students and many of the National Guards did their utmost to save the magazine; of the others, some sought for weapons, while the remainder appeared bent solely upon destruction. After a tremendous...", "...and surveyed the surroundings of the post of duty to which she had been assigned.

Languidly pacing in front of the Colonel's tent was an Orderly, who had been selected <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for his spruce neatness, but who now looked like some enormous blue vegetable, rapidly withering under the sun's blistering rays. Beyond were the barracks, baking and sweltering, cracking their rough, unpainted sides into yawning fissures, and filling the smothering air with resinous odors distilled from the fat knots in the refuse planking of which they were built. Beyond these was the line of camp-guards--bright gun-barrels and bayonets glistening painfully, and...", "...sense of believing--a symphony. The invading beauty swept about us both.

About us, over us, within us, stirred the awe of that immense idea.

Conscious,...", "...up her fond project in despair, and felt very much like a child whose house of bricks had been knocked down by the unlucky waft of some passing petticoat. Meanwhile, the entire change of scene brought on the exquisite refreshment of entire change of thought. Ellinor had not been able so completely to forget her past life for many years; it was like a renewing of her youth; cut so suddenly short by the shears of Fate. Ever since that night, she had had to rouse herself on awakening <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> into a full comprehension of the great cause she had for much fear and heavy grief. Now, when she wakened in her little room, fourth piano, No. 36, Babuino, she saw the strange, pretty things around her, and her mind went off into pleasant wonder and conjecture, happy recollections of the day before, and pleasant anticipations of the day to come.

Moreover he had been singing most vehemently in the church, and hence he began to feel in a piteous plight, and to long for a dram. As he had worked hard through the week, and had been particularly kind to his better-half, making her a very pretty gown out of the pieces cabbaged from his customers, she consented to his going into the apothecary's and getting himself a dram, which he did accordingly. The awkward apprentice, who was alone in the shop, made...", "...underlying the apparent one; and for nearly half-an-hour he sauntered to and fro in a reverie, leaning sometimes against the old stone fountain, and sometimes watching the pale clouds as they began flitting together as though to keep a rendezvous in space, until they concealed the face of the moon entirely from view and left the garden dark. * * * * * Whether Austin had strange dreams that night or no, certain it is that when he came down to breakfast <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> his face was set and there was a look of unusual preoccupation in his eyes.

Two brass nine-pounders completed this novel armament. It was about eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> when the British vessels came up within range. Alarm guns had been firing from the shore all the morning; and by that time the village was filled with militiamen, who flocked to the scene of action. Woolsey, who had taken charge of the shore-batteries, ordered a shot from the thirty-two pounder.

In a week I cured him, and also succeeded in getting another boy who could cook and shoot, and had no objection to go into the interior.

Even some of the young and lovely girls, who had thought, <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> of life, before the freshness of their bloom had been dimmed, or the lustre of their beauty had decayed, that this one obstacle to their happiness must be removed,--many of these gay, joyous, and unthinking beings had sunk unexpectedly into an early grave, while still Lord Doncaster, in a most provoking and unprincipled manner, disappointed everybody, and continued to exist in a world where he was anything but welcome, resolved apparently, never, in an every-day vulgar...", "...have seen that the number of males far exceeds that of females among the immigrants from southeastern Europe. This the church attendance corroborates. I have seen in Pittsburgh a congregation of one thousand men, all in the prime of life, so intent upon the religious exercises that the least movement of the priest at the altar found immediate response in every member of the audience. The ritual of the church has a deep hold upon Slav and Lithuanian; often the men go to confession at six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> that they may go to communion the day following. When men are so employed that they cannot attend mass on Sundays, they will attend one on Saturdays.

And <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> early she was delivered of a child, a strong boy, and then lay back and slept profoundly.

And she had need to be; for the creature never made any noise, but came up as quiet as a shadow. One afternoon, however, she had gone to meet her lover a little way down the glen; and they stopped talking so long, about one thing and another, that the sun was almost set before she bethought herself....", "...nine o'clock several were roaring drunk. One of them--the Bolshevik who had told of the drowning of Baltic fleet officers--staggered across the aft deck with a drawn knife in his hand, shouting that he wanted to finish off the third engineer, who had insulted him. He found Josef in the engine-room, but was cowed and disarmed when the engineer threatened him with a revolver. He let himself be led away, while verbally murdering all officers in general and Josef in particular. At 6.30 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Josef, the third engineer, roused us from our sleep on the floor of his cabin and invited us to the ballast-tanks; for as the police and customs officers would be on board most of the time until we weighed anchor, we must remain hidden until the _Batoum_ left Turkish waters.

Our ship met such heavy weather that only the bravest souls could keep a cheery countenance. Running into a growing storm, and unable to turn from the racing head seas, we beat out our unwilling way into the Atlantic. Three days later we limped back to base with injured men, hatches stove in, winch pipes and boats torn away. Our forward gun was smashed and leaned over at a drunken angle. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the crew were taking a well-earned rest, and the decks were deserted but for the usual stoker, taking a breath of air after his stand-by watch. A dockyard official, seeing our damage, came on board, and, after viewing the wrecked gun at close quarters, turned to the stoker with the remark: \"Do you mean to say that the sea smashed a heavy gun like that, my man?\" The stoker, spitting with uncanny accuracy at a piece of floating wood overside, looked at the official:...", "...soda-water, and cigarettes which enable the Briton to conquer the world without discomfort.

With the dawn the 'material' train arrived, the platelaying gangs swarmed over it like clusters of flies, and were carried to the extreme limit of the track.

Then back again to the Hoffman, where Addicks, Chandler, and some Bay State directors were nodding. By this time I was in no mood to say more than that I would be over in the morning, and that Addicks should go early to the National Committee's head-quarters and explain the desperation of conditions in Delaware to Hanna, Osborne, and their associates.

However, when he was no more, the housekeeping spirit triumphed in our independence of the butcher, while his fry and other delicacies lasted, and Betsey was supremely happy over the saltings of the legs, etc., with a view to the more distant future.

Yet it fascinated them. And it may be that, in spite of all, they were proud of it; they were proud in secret of the pilgrims and the homage and the Sunday crowds. It is certain at least that they never went to their beds--and this also they confessed to each other--they never went to their beds or threw up a window <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> to bathe in the sun without turning their eyes up the river to the end of the Island, to the seated figure under the tree. On a dark night it was difficult to see, but on a moonlit night they could see it very clearly. And they looked at it always.

The next morning found the three heroes sleeping soundly. Truechen had closed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from the heavy eyes of her guests, like a kind good woman.

Not that he thought she could have been attracted to the man; she was too fine, her instincts too true. But on the other hand she was young, so unlearned in the world's ways, so liable to be duped through her own innocence. His thoughts swung like a pendulum from point of torment to point of torment and <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> he rose, determined on the visit. It was to satisfy himself and if possible drop a hint of warning. He never thought of Chrystie.

As already mentioned in our account of the visit of the party to a sheep farm in South Africa, each shepherd started out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with his flock, moving it slowly along so as to reach water about noon, and then slowly feeding it back again, reaching the station about nightfall. Nearly every shepherd has a sheep dog, partly for the sake of companionship and partly for assistance. A good sheep dog is a very useful and valuable animal. He aids the shepherd in keeping the flock together whenever any of them show a disposition to straggle, and the sheep speedily learn to know him and regard him as...", "...Western knowledge, invited to its shores bodies of men to act as its instructors, the attention of the newcomers was naturally attracted to the frequent shakings of the ground.

The excitement was intense, and before the ruins had been removed a meeting was convened and the Seismological Society of Japan established.

After I had gazed about the space for a time, standing in the gateway formed by the mounds, I clambered up the mound to the left hand, and on the top of that mound I found myself at a great altitude; beneath, at the distance of a mile, was a fair old city, situated amongst verdant meadows, watered with streams, and from the heart of that old city, from amidst mighty trees, I beheld towering to the sky the finest spire in the world. And after I had looked from...", "...\"Safe and sound, as true as my name's Jack Butler.\" \"Well,\" said Milady, \"if you keep your word, instead of five hundred, I will give you a thousand pistoles.\" \"Hurrah for you, then, my beautiful lady,\" cried the captain; \"and may God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship!\" \"Meanwhile,\" said Felton, \"convey me to the little bay of--; you know it was agreed you should put in there.\" The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers, and toward seven o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named. During this passage, Felton related everything to Milady--how, instead of going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had returned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and how, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder. Milady knew the rest. On her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his...", "...more unsentimental than the way in which she would make him take off his coat during a friendly call, and let her sponge and press it for him; or the imperative fashion in which she sent him to the barber's to have his beard trimmed.

Once a fine melon was accompanied by a bottle of perfumery; and again a basket of peaches had secreted in its center a package of toilet soap \"strong enough to kill the grass,\" as Hepsey remarked as she sniffed at it.

She was then propelled by her own machinery to within about five hundred yards of the shore. There the clockwork, which was to explode her within a certain length of time, was set and she was abandoned. Everybody left, and even the vessels put out to sea to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them. At two o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the explosion took place--and produced no more effect on the fort, or anything else on land, than the bursting of a boiler anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have done.

The women and children left without homes were all sheltered in a warehouse in town. At night the men were on guard.

There was no milk to give it. At three o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> I said I would go out and milk the cow if the men would guard me.

At last our animals appeared. They had been sent from Papalo, and we made arrangements, as we supposed, for using them through to Cuicatlan. The animals arrived at 9:30 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and the _mozo_ with them reported that the roads were bad from the constant rains of the past several days. We decided to leave that afternoon, stopping at Zautla for the night, and then, making an early start, to push through in a single day. The _presidente, alcalde_, and other town officials accompanied us to the border of the village, where they bade us adieu, begging for a _real_ for drink.

When Tom entered, the father spoke with quick decision: \"The situation in this campaign, my boy, is tense and dangerous. I want you to go with me to-morrow and stay to the finish.\" Tom flushed and there was a moment's pause: \"Certainly, Dad, if you wish it.\" \"We'll start at eight o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> and drive through the country to the next appointment.

Some time afterward the old alcalde sent in to ask permission to go home, as he was very sleepy, which we graciously granted, and, by his direction, three or four Indians swung their little hammocks under the arbour, to be at hand in case we should need anything. During the night we found it extremely cold and, with the little covering we had brought, could hardly keep ourselves comfortable. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we found a large gathering round the house to escort us to the ruins. In the suburbs of the rancho we turned off to the left, and passed among the huts of the Indians, almost smothered by weeds, and having at the doors rude boxes of earth set up on posts, for vegetables to grow in out of the reach of the hogs.

An unlucky circumstance, which took place on the 1st January of 1812, proved the means of nearly extinguishing the custom.

My companions and myself had received several invitations from Commodore Porter, and, accompanied by Mr. Dwight, one of our American missionaries, to whom I am under particular obligations for his kindness, early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we took a caique with three athletic Turks, and, after a beautiful row, part of it from the seraglio point to the Seven Towers, a distance of five miles, being close under the walls of the city, in two hours reached the commodore's residence at St. Stephano, twelve miles from Constantinople, on the borders of the Sea of Marmora.

From Cape Manifold the coast falls back to a sandy beach, six miles long, and near it are some scattered rocks. The land is there very low; but at the north end of the beach is a hilly projection, from which we tacked at one o'clock, in 12 fathoms; being then within a mile of two rocks, and two miles from the main land. The brig was seen to the south-eastward, and we made a long stretch off, to give her an opportunity of joining, and at two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> [SATURDAY 21 AUGUST 1802] lay by for her; but the wind veering to south-west at five, we stretched in for the land, and approached some rocky islets, part of the Harvey's Isles of captain Cook, of which, and of the main coast as far as Island Head, Mr. Westall made a sketch (Atlas, Plate XVIII.

At half past nine, when we tacked from Harvey's Isles, I was surprised to see trees upon them resembling the pines of Norfolk Island; none such having been before noticed...", "...to the unreconstructed soul of the Judge. Still they were the only dogs anywhere around capable of tackling a savage timber wolf, and without their aid the judge's own high-spirited animals ran a serious risk of injury, for they were altogether too game to let any beast escape without a struggle. Luck favored us. Two wolves had killed a calf and dragged it into a long patch of dense brush where there was a little spring, the whole furnishing admirable cover for any wild beast. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> we started on horseback for this bit of cover, which was some three miles off. The party consisted of the Judge, old man Prindle, a cowboy, myself, and the dogs. The judge and I carried our rifles and the cowboy his revolver, but old man Prindle had nothing but a heavy whip, for he swore, with many oaths, that no one should interfere with his big dogs, for by themselves they would surely \"make the wolf feel sicker than a stuck hog.\" Our shaggy ponies racked along at a...", "...for dispossessing his nephew. Would he have loitered at York at such a crisis, if he had intended to step into the throne? But whether the circumstances are true, or whether artfully imagined, it is certain that the king, with a small force, arrived at Northampton, and thence proceeded to Stony Stratford. Earl Rivers remained at Northampton, where he was cajoled by the two dukes till the time of rest, when the gates of the inn were suddenly locked, and the earl made prisoner. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the two dukes hastened to Stony Stratford, where, in the king's presence, they picked a quarrel with his other half-brother, the lord Richard Grey, accusing him, the marquis Dorset, and their uncle Rivers, of ambitious and hostile designs, to which ends the marquis had entered the Tower, taken treasure thence, and sent a force to sea. \"These things,\" says Sir Thomas, \"the dukes knew, were done for good and necessary purposes, and by appointment of the council; but...", "...taken exactly the right course to relieve the strain of the situation.

Rehearsals will not begin until next week; but I can give you the music, and tell you something of what we are planning to do.\" \"Yes. I could come at ten <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> for an hour, or at three in the afternoon for two hours or more,\" replied Miss Greggory, after a moment's hesitation. \"Suppose we call it in the afternoon, then,\" smiled Billy, as she rose to her feet. \"And now I must go--and here's my address,\" she finished, taking out her card and laying it on the table near her. For reasons of her own Billy went away that morning without saying anything more about the proposed new pupils. New pupils were not automobile rides nor...", "...returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.

CHAPTER XXXIV. ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET. About an hour had elapsed since Mrs. Grivois had seen or pretended to have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the extension of Saint-Dizier House. It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible, the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss de Cardoville. This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything...", "...a couple of hours, he asked whether the casks were out of sight. The mate and Banister replied that they were, whereupon the master took a candle, examined the hold, and afterwards the sleeping-berths, but he could not see anything of the brandy. He then went to the boy and said, \"Mind you don't let Mr. Coplin [the owner] know anything about this business, for the world.\" The vessel arrived at Falmouth on Sunday morning, the 2nd of June, and brought up off the Market Strand. At six <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> the boy went ashore and returned about midnight. The mate was on board and addressed him thus, \"You knew very well what was going on and ought to have been on board before this.\" For at that time both the master and Banister were ashore. On Monday the boy went down to the hold and saw the brandy was gone, and the same night about half-an-hour before midnight the mate and Banister brought four gallons of the brandy to where the boy was lodging, as his share. The youngster...", "...in the arbour to read a book; but as soon as he had begun to observe Will, the book was laid aside; he was plainly one of those who prefer living people to people made of ink and paper. Will, on his part, although he had not been much interested in the stranger at first sight, soon began to take a great deal of pleasure in his talk, which was full of good nature and good sense, and at last conceived a great respect for his character and wisdom. They sat far into the night; and about two <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Will opened his heart to the young man, and told him how he longed to leave the valley, and what bright hopes he had connected with the cities of the plain. The young man whistled, and then broke into a smile. \"My young friend,\" he remarked, \"you are a very curious little fellow, to be sure, and wish a great many things which you will never get. Why, you would feel quite ashamed if you knew how the little fellows in these fairy cities of yours are all after the same...", "...I took from one of these battle-fields--I guess I will bring you some of them. I went with the American Minister and took dinner this evening with the King's Grand Chamberlain, who is related to the royal family, and although darker than a mulatto, he has an excellent English education and in manners is an accomplished gentleman. The dinner was as ceremonious as any I ever attended in California--five regular courses, and five kinds of wine and one of brandy. He is to call for me <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> with his carriage, and we will visit the King at the palace--both are good Masons--the King is a Royal Arch Mason. After dinner tonight they called in the \"singing girls,\" and we had some beautiful music; sung in the native tongue.

I have often mentioned to you the multiplicity of my engagements, and have been once exposed to the ridicule and censure of the world for mentioning the great importance of the business which lay upon me; and if this letter should ever see the light, it would be again imputed to vanity that I mention to you how busy I am. But I must repeat it by way of apology for not writing you oftener. From four o'clock <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until ten at night, I have not a single moment which I can call my own. I will not say that I expect to run distracted, to grow melancholy, to drop in an apoplexy, or fall into a consumption; but I do say, it is little less than a miracle that one or other of these misfortunes has not befallen me before now.

They were at least ten leagues from the Sauce posta, and since the murder committed by the Indians, twenty from another. The Indians are supposed to have made their attack in the middle of the night; for very early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> after the murder, they were luckily seen approaching this posta. The whole party here, however, escaped, together with the troop of horses; each one taking a line for himself, and driving with him as many animals as he was able to manage. The little hovel, built of thistle-stalks, in which they slept, neither kept out the wind nor rain; indeed in the latter case the only effect the roof had, was to condense it into larger drops. They had nothing to eat excepting what...", "...fix the bolt, look at the window, open my valise, and wish I was at home. I think of fires, of sudden sickness, of to-morrow's trade, of to-day's orders, and of all the pros and cons of business. Through the night I hear scurrying feet in the hall, the late arrivals, the early risers, the bell-boy's raps on the doors, and finally the chambermaid's clatter, and her occasional turn on the knob, as a broad invitation to get up and out of the way that she may do her work. I started out <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> at B----, determined to do all in my power to make a good showing for myself. There is but one gun-store, but all the hardware dealers handled something in my line. It is a sleepy town.

There was not a day that had not been wasted, botched, besmirched. Not a single piece of work, not a thought, not an effort of enduring quality. A chaos of desires destructive of each other.

The 4th Division was able to extend its line some little way to the north of the river and thus release troops of the 1st Cavalry Division, which subsequently fought fiercely all day at Messines. Throughout the day the left of the 4th Division rendered valuable and efficient support, as did the artillery on Hill 63, about one mile north of Ploegsteert. But the great events of the day took place between Gheluvelt on the north and Messines on the south. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> Allenby reported that Messines was being heavily attacked, and that the 9th Lancers had been withdrawn after suffering severely; that the eastern exit of the town was held by the 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards, and that the situation was \"decidedly critical.\" A heavy attack had been delivered against the right of the 1st Cavalry Division shortly after 7 a.m., and an Indian Battalion of Rifles (the 57th, attached to the 1st Cavalry Division) were driven from their trenches....", "...very exact in authenticity.

If he still lives--this modern Horatius at the bridge--he remains an unnamed hero in the ranks of the French Army, unhonored except in the hearts of those few of his countrymen who know.

Besides, the ammunition was gone. But for eight hours--from 8 <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> until 4 in the afternoon--the seventy-five had held the 12,000. General Joffre has said in one of his reports that the defense of the bridge at Gerbeviller had an important bearing on the battle of the Marne, which was just beginning, for it gave Castelnau's Army of the East time to dig its trenches a few miles back of Gerbeviller before the Germans got through.

The warriors brought in the prisoners, who were astounded at the unexpected welcome which awaited them. Forty-five were in the party. They were put under guard with the others. The utmost care was observed during the night, as the Illyas were known to be very foxy, and half the force was detailed to keep guard. Early <span class=\"clocktext\">in the morning</span> John's first care was to make an investigation as to the character of the provisions on hand, and to arrange that foraging parties should be sent out to bring in vegetables. He was surprised to learn that the Illyas cultivated many kinds of garden products, and fruit was growing in abundance. This was found to be a prudent thing to consider, when it will be remembered that the village now had to feed over three hundred of the allies, and that the penned-up Illyas were...", "...numericals combined with letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
