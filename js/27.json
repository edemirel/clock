His first object was to seek for some healthy high land in which to plant a station. Ascending the Zambezi, he, however, found no place free from the tsetse fly, and therefore resolved to discover a route to the interior from either the west or east coast. To accompany Livingstone <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> men were selected from the various tribes under Sekeletu, partly with a view to open up a trade route between their own country and the coast. The start was made from Linyante on the 11th of November 1853, and, by ascending the Liba, Lake Dilolo was reached on the 20th of February 1854.

At that time life in Vienna was as costly as it is normally in the United States. While her husband had been alive the woman had led a very comfortable life.

Far more important than the increase or decrease of the number of units is their relative significance in the total production, a phase of the subject which is rather disingenuously avoided by most critics of Marxism. Mr. Lucien Sanial, a Socialist statistician of repute, and one of the profoundest Marxian students in America, has shown this in a number of suggestive tables. For example, he takes <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> typical manufacturing industries for the years 1880, 1900, and 1905, and compares the number of establishments in each year with the total amount of capital invested and workers employed. In 1880 the number of establishments was 63,233; in 1900 the number was 51,912, and in 1905 it was only 44,142. From 1880 to 1905 there had been a decrease in the number of establishments of 35.3 per cent, of which 15 per cent took place within the last five years.

Adamnan, who was very young when he entered the community at Iona, could have gathered the materials for his book from the lips of those who had personally known the great Apostle of Scotland, and who had been eye-witnesses of the events recorded.

The Senate ratification of the nomination of Clay (March 7, 1825) foreshadowed the alliance of southern interests with those of Pennsylvania; [Footnote: Adams, Memoirs, VI., 525, VII., 69.] but only fourteen votes, including that of Jackson, were mustered against him, while among the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> who ratified the nomination was Van Buren. By the opening of the nineteenth Congress, in December, 1825, however, the situation might well have convinced Adams of the need of caution.

It is thus inscribed:-- Erected to the...", "...a foot up over my head and down like this----\" As Ostrich swung his leg every one skurried out of the way, for they knew it was like a sword descending. \"Yes,\" cried Magh, \"if you only had a brain the size of that toe-nail----\" \"Stop it!\" cried Sa'-zada, for this was an unpleasant truth; Ostrich, though such a huge fellow himself, has a brain about the size of a Humming Bird's. \"Talking of Wives,\" said Ostrich, with the most extraordinary irrelevance, \"mine died when I was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years old; and, of course, as it is the way with us Birds, I never took up with another, though I've seen the most beautifully feathered ones of our Kind--quite enough to make one's mouth water. \"She had queer ways, to be sure--my wife.

In the following year, the present James was born, as appears from the following entry on the back of the same old Bible: \"James, the son of William and Elizabeth Horrocks of Bradshaw Chapel, was born March 14th, 1744.\" He will therefore complete his hundredth year on the 14th of next March. He was born in a house near Bradshaw Chapel, which has long since been removed. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years old when an uncle left him a small estate in Harwood, called Hill End; and soon after he married, we believe in 1773, and by that marriage had eight children.

These, if any, must have been the days of the two hundred millions. And how much do you suppose was really expended for improvements during that four years? Two hundred millions? One hundred? Fifty? Ten? Five? No, sir; less than two millions. As shown by authentic documents, the expenditures on improvements during 1825, 1826, 1827, and 1828 amounted to one million eight hundred and seventy-nine thousand six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> dollars and one cent. These four years were the period of Mr. Adams's administration, nearly and substantially. This fact shows that when the power to make improvements \"was fully asserted and exercised,\" the Congress did keep within reasonable limits; and what has been done, it seems to me, can be done again. Now for the second portion of the message--namely, that the burdens of improvements would be general, while their benefits would be local and partial, involving an...", "...were known, and in his words shall be told the remainder of the distressing story which began so bravely, and ended in shame and in death.

It is not known, however, whether this group is in any way connected with either of the others.

These eighteen gods may simply be the Great and Little companies of gods taken together. In the texts of Pepi I and Teta, however, we find a third company of nine gods, officially recognized by the priests of Heliopolis, and all three companies are represented by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> symbols representing the word _neter_ (god) placed in a row. Although these companies of gods are spoken of as containing nine deities, that is owing to their designation of _Pesedt_, which signifies 'nine'. The Little company in reality contains eleven gods, but nine was their original number, and, as Sir Gaston Maspero says, each of them, especially the first and last, could be developed. A local company such as that of Heliopolis might have the god of another nome or...", "...appealed to God to avenge her sufferings and murder. Probably the ancestral curse hanging over _The House of the Seven Gables_ would not have been so vividly conceived, if such a curse had not been traditional in the Hawthorne family. Nathaniel Hawthorne, the sixth in descent from the first New England ancestor, and the first of his family to add a \"w\" to his name, was born in Salem in 1804. His father, a sea captain, died of a fever at a foreign port in 1808. Hawthorne's mother was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years old at this time, and for forty years after this sad event, she usually took her meals in her own room away from her three children. Everybody in that household became accustomed to loneliness. At the age of fourteen, the boy went to live for a while on the shore of Sebago Lake, Maine. \"I lived in Maine,\" he said, \"like a bird of the air, so perfect was the freedom I enjoyed. But it was there I got my cursed habits of solitude.\" Shyness and aversion to meeting people...", "...hastily recounted the facts to the time of the great Trojan war, and then said that he had arrived at a period when the narrative could not be so hurriedly dispatched. He showed how the old historians had gone back to Troy for the beginnings of the English race, and had chosen a great-grandson of \u00c6neas, named Brutus, as the one by whom it should be attached to the right royal heroes of Homer's poem. Thus we see how firm a hold upon the imagination of the world the tale of Troy had after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> hundred years. Twenty-five or thirty years before the birth of Christ there was in Rome another poet, named Virgil, writing about the wanderings of \u00c6neas. He began his beautiful story with these words: \"Arms I sing, and the hero, who first, exiled by fate, came from the coast of Troy to Italy and the Lavinian shore.\" He then went on to tell in beautiful words the story of the wanderings of his hero,--a tale that has now been read and re-read for nearly two thousand...", "...like that pass, we'd be flying in the face of Providence.\" With her hands gripping the arms of her chair, she leaned forward, her eyes staring into space, her lips moving. \"COME ON, you Dromedary!\" she whispered.

The apparent magnitude of Sirius has been computed at 27,000 times less than the sun, and, therefore, supposing their magnitudes equal, is 27,000 times more distant. If so, as our earth is ninety-five millions of miles from the sun, that multiplied by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> thousand, will give two millions of millions, and an addition of 565 thousand millions, for the distance of this star from the sun.[136] Our earth, in moving round the sun, is 195,000,000 miles nearer to this star in one part of its orbit, than in the opposite one; and yet the magnitude of the star appears not to be in the least altered or affected by it.

As soon as it was known that the Military Committee of the House would report such an amendment, it was assumed that the Senate would concur, and a \"slate\" was made up accordingly. On the hypothesis that the list of major-generals was thirteen in excess of the forty fixed by statute, a new list of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> was made out, which would complete the forty to be added by the new bill. A similar list was prepared for the brigadiers and precisely similar negotiations went on, but for brevity's sake I shall confine myself to the list for the highest rank, in which I was personally concerned. The House passed the amended bill on the 27th of February, and it went back to the Senate for concurrence in the amendments. But now an unexpected difficulty arose.

From his father, a persevering and skilful jeweller, but too prudent to risk or gain much, he learned the business of precious stones, to which he added that of laces, paintings, old materials, tapestries, rare furniture. An infallible eye, the patience of a German united with his Israelitish and Dutch extraction, soon amassed for him a small capital, which his father's bequest augmented. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> Justus had not less than five hundred thousand marks. Two imprudent operations on the Bourse, enterprises to force fortune and to obtain the first million, ruined the too-audacious courtier, who began again the building up of his fortune by becoming a diamond broker.

But, between the longitude of Hilo and 128 degrees west longitude is a difference of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> degrees, or, roughly, sixteen hundred miles. At sixteen miles a day, one hundred days would be required to accomplish this distance.

Dordrecht is vulgarly and colloquially known as Dordt, or Dort, and, as such, is referred to in history and literature in a manner, which often puzzles the stranger. It is one of the most ancient cities of Holland, and, in the middle ages, the most busy in its intercourse with the outside world.

The number of these old manuscripts is large, and the first general division of them is into \"uncials\" or \"cursives,\" as they are called; the uncial manuscripts being written in capital letters, the cursives in small letters more or less connected, as in our written hand. The uncials are the oldest, as they are the fewest; there are only one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of them in all; while of the cursives there are about fifteen hundred. Yet most of these manuscripts are fragmentary. Some of them contain only the Gospels or portions of them; some of them contain the Acts and the Catholic Epistles; some of them the Epistles of Paul or a single epistle; some are selections from the Gospels or the Epistles, prepared to be read in church, and called lectionaries.

I tried it myself from the time when I could handle a boat oar, until I was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age. During that time I was at the fishing every day, summer and winter, when it was fishing weather, and living in the midst of the ocean; and I have no hesitation in saying that if fishermen had been dependent on fishing alone, they would have died from sheer want, leaving their families out of the question altogether. 8034.

A few strict persons considered this concession on the part of the Court very injudicious. The Emperor, on leaving France, passed by the Chateau of Ferney without stopping there.

Gall expounded his doctrines at Vienna as early as 1796, but, being expelled, went to Germany, where he was joined by Spurzheim, who, though much{243} more of a student and scientist, accepted the doctrine of the former with enthusiasm; and it was chiefly due to the efforts of Spurzheim that phrenology was introduced into England, and later (1832) into America. Gall assumed to locate <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> different organs alongside of each other in the brain, and held that external markings on the skull were guides to the development of the various parts.

Not only were the jails damp, unhealthy, filthy places, but prisoners were obliged to pay many exorbitant charges, so that if a man escaped with his life and health, he had to leave large sums of money behind him. One jail bill of that day has a weekly item of five dollars and a half for food, and as money would purchase about five times as much then as now, this charge was equivalent to more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> dollars to-day. This was not all by any means, for a prisoner had to pay the rent of his wretched dungeon. If he was doomed to wear fetters, he must pay extra for them, and, most absurd charge of all, he was forced to pay an entrance fee on being sent to the horrible place. Besides being imprisoned, dissenters, as those were called who would not attend the Church of England, were sometimes whipped or tortured or even hanged. The only excuse for such treatment is that...", "...\"Then I'll explain. I meant to have those eggs myself, young man!\" IV A TIGHT SQUEEZE Timothy Turtle's remark was most surprising.

This being the case, let us examine his biography. Le Sage was born in 1668 at Sargan, a small town near Vannes in Bretagne; at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> he published a translation of Aristoenaetus; and declining, from his love of literature, the hopes of advancement, which, had he taken orders, were within his reach, he came to Paris, where he contracted an intimate friendship with the Abbe de Lyonne, who settled a pension on him, taught him Spanish, and bequeathed to him his library--consisting, among other works, of several Spanish manuscripts--at his death.

That the sun is rotating upon an axis, is shown by the continual change of position of all spots in one constant direction across his disc. The time in which a spot is carried completely round depends, however, upon the position which it occupies upon the sun's surface. A spot situated near the equator of the sun goes round once in about twenty-five days. The further a spot is situated from this equator, the longer it takes. About <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> days is the time taken by a spot situated midway between the equator and the solar poles. Spots occur to the north of the sun's equator, as well as to the south; though, since regular observations have been made--that is to say, during the past fifty years or so--they appear to have broken out a little more frequently in the southern parts.

At peace now with the rest of Europe he had no need of so many troops, even although the war Against the Empire had continued; fortunately, however it did not. Negotiations were set on foot, and on the 6th of March of the following year, 1714, after much debate, they ended successfully. On that day, in fact, peace was signed at Rastadt.

This error is due to the fact that at the close of the battle there actually were twenty-seven battalions within the village, but they were not there at the beginning of the action; and Marlborough cannot, therefore, have \"counted\" them going in.

The loudest outcries against Japanese encroachments come from those nations that possess the widest spheres of influence.

Hudson, says of Scott's editorial and critical work, \"these exertions, though they call for passing record, occupy a minor place in his story\"; and he gives them only \"passing record.\" Mr. Andrew Lang's still more recent and briefer _Sir Walter Scott_ devotes only a few lines here and there to comment on Scott as a critic, and contains hardly even a reference to the little-known volumes that he edited.] [Footnote 2: Ten of Scott's <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> novels (counting the first series of _Chronicles of the Canongate_ as one) have scenes laid in the eighteenth century.

This shews that Chaucer used Trivet's text. On the other hand, Gower mentions Knaresburgh (i. 191), which he found in Trivet, whilst Chaucer says nothing about it; see note to B 729. As to the instances in which one poet has copied the other, whilst at the same time Trivet does not suggest the phraseology which they employ, Luecke gives <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> examples in Anglia, xiv. 183. Some of these are rather far-fetched and doubtful, and not many of them are very clear; but their cumulative evidence sufficiently proves the fact. I shall only adduce the clearer cases.

He carried in his triumph many military standards, and much spoil of other sorts, with all the royal furniture; and also <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> pounds' weight of gold, and nineteen of silver, besides three thousand denariuses,[107] and, in Illyrian money, the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand.[108] Before his chariot were led Gentius, with his queen and children; Caravantius, the king's brother, and several Illyrian nobles.

It is therefore not difficult to prophesy that the day is not far off when the Indian Christians, among whom both sexes find equal opportunity and inducement to study in the schools, will outstrip the Brahmans and stand preeminent as the educated and cultured class of India. This is as true in the higher as in the lower grades of education. There are today living 418 native Christian graduates of the Madras University. Last year <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of these Christian youth received the B.

Some companies of the 95th and 60th Rifles pressed forward three miles farther in pursuit, when they were suddenly attacked in flank by a greatly superior force, and had it not been that General Spencer, whose division was but a short distance behind, pressed forward to their assistance, they would have suffered heavily; as it was they escaped with the loss of two officers and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> men killed and wounded. Their rashness, however, led to the discovery that Laborde's force had taken up a strong position in front of the village of Rolica, and that he apparently intended to give battle there. The next day was spent in reconnoitring the French position. It was a very strong one. Rolica stood on a table-land rising in a valley, affording a view of the road as far as Obidos.

From that date the country knew no peace; there was a constant series of little wars. Slatin had fought no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> battles. Then after the defeat of Hicks Pasha came the Dervishes, and Zogal became Emir of Darfur, residing at El Fasher; but his rule was not peaceful. The Sultan Dudbenga was fought, overcome, and sent to Omdurman a prisoner in 1884; thence he was sent to Galabat, where he died. After this, Zogal was left undisturbed, and succeeded in accumulating a considerable amount of riches; but when the Mahdi died, Zogal, as we have seen, was summoned to Omdurman, and left Darfur...", "...it was many years before another vessel touched there. It had always been considered an uninhabited island; so when a ship did at last drop its anchor there, in 1808, the captain was greatly surprised to find the place peopled.

Many new forms are found in the {920}collection of the Challenger, so that we may here distinguish eight genera and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> species. The family Plectanida may be divided into four different subfamilies, according to the number of the radial spines which compose the skeleton. Those four subfamilies, as also the genera contained in them, correspond exactly to the four subfamilies of Plagonida, from which they have originated: Triplectida with three, Tetraplectida with four, Hexaplectida with six, and Polyplectida with numerous (seven to nine or more) radial spines. These spines are usually...", "...career spent two years in a business house at Civita Vecchia. On returning to England in 1851 he was induced to enter the newly established Royal School of Mines, which his younger brother Henry F. Blanford (1834-1893), afterwards head of the Indian Meteorological Department, had already joined; he then spent a year in the mining school at Freiburg, and towards the close of 1854 both he and his brother obtained posts on the Geological Survey of India. In that service he remained for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years, retiring in 1882. He was engaged in various parts of India, in the Raniganj coalfield, in Bombay, and in the coalfield near Talchir, where boulders considered to have been ice-borne were found in the Talchir strata--a remarkable discovery confirmed by subsequent observations of other geologists in equivalent strata elsewhere. His attention was given not only to geology but to zoology, and especially to the land-mollusca and to the vertebrates. In 1866 he was...", "...poulps and cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the cetaceans. Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five cubits, or nine feet two inches. Our fishermen frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of poulps are preserved in the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two yards in length. Besides, according to the calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> feet long. That would suffice to make a formidable monster.\" \"Do they fish for them in these days?\" asked Ned. \"If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least. One of my friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas.

In the twenty-seven years from 1815 to 1842 the export trade of Great Britain diminished from L49,600,000 to L47,280,000; while in the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years which succeeded 1842 it increased from L47,280,000 to nearly L190,000,000. These figures are a simple and enduring monument to the minister's memory. It is fair to add that the whole increase was not due to free trade. It was partly attributable to the remarkable development of communications which marked this period. Two other financial measures of great importance were accomplished in Sir Robert Peel's ministry. In 1844 some L250,000,000 of the national debt...", "...should be checked by keeping the dog strictly to heel where he is likely to meet any traffic. The Sheep Dog The old English bob-tailed sheep dog is a bouncing, rough-and-ready fellow.

The true Newfoundland is black all over, except for a white star on the chest, and he stands at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> inches at the shoulder. The black-and-white specimens are called Landseer Newfoundlands, on account of the famous painter's fondness for them. In character these dogs are dignified and magnanimous, and they are particularly good with children. Many stories are told of their gallant efforts in saving life from drowning. The Newfoundland is used for draught in the island from which he takes his name. The Mastiff The mastiff is the best of all guards; it is more pure...", "...with eager confidence and pleasure.

Not for one of those considerations, but because it had been my happiness to have a public opportunity of testing the spirit of its people.

The normal number of these globules is one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> out of the thousand component parts of the blood; but they vary according to the barometer of health; sometimes they are observed in disease to descend to sixty-five.

The appearance of the rings of Saturn as viewed from our planet changes periodically as a result of the revolution of the earth and Saturn around the sun, which places them in constantly changing positions with reference to each other. The rings lie in the plane of Saturn's equator, which is inclined <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> degrees to its orbit and twenty-eight degrees to the Earth's orbit. Since the position of the equator remains parallel to itself while the planet is journeying around the sun it happens that half the time the earth is elevated above the plane of the rings and the remainder of the time it lies below the plane of the rings. Twice in the period of Saturn's revolution around the sun, which occupies nearly thirty years, the earth lies directly in the plane of the rings and at...", "...leagues to the northward, by aid of the wind and a current setting to the north, we had sight of the high land of Bintang, rising with two hills and a deep swamp or hollow between, and, as we judged, twelve leagues from us.

Andrew, then only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years old, came forward in support of his pastor, and argued the case vigorously, not because he agreed with Parker's theological opinions, but because he considered the opposition illiberal.

From this arose the long conflict known as the Peloponnesian War, which lasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years, its real cause being that Sparta was determined to lead Greece. It was in vain that the Athenians fought with the energy of despair. Their beautiful city--the City of the Gods--was at last surrendered, and the scoffing Spartans (404 B.C.) took possession of the treasures they scorned. Athens had fallen, but her real kingdom was indestructible. She was to be forever Queen in the empire of ideas, of literature, and of art!

The dedication contained some fine passages of genuine beauty and graceful versification. It was in some respects an imitation of the Lutrin of Boileau. It was very different from the doggerel in which he had taken part with his humpbacked father so long ago. Then he had blown the cow-horn, now he spoke with the tongue of a trumpet. The hero of Jasmin's Charivari was one Aduber, an old...", "...the hands of the enemy. One letter, which revealed the treatment Union men were receiving in Arkansas, I forwarded to _The Herald_.

Quickly and quietly was the door of the mission house opened, and in there came two Indians. One of them was our beloved friend Memotas, who was warmly greeted by all, for he was a general favourite. The little children of the mission home, Sagastaookemou and Minnehaha, rushed into his arms and kissed his bronzed but beautiful face. When their noisy greetings were over, he introduced the stranger who was with him. He seemed to be about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> or twenty-eight years of age, and was a fine, handsome looking man; in fact, an ideal Indian of the forest. Very cordially was he welcomed, and Memotas said his name was Oowikapun. Thus was our hero in the mission house, and in the presence of the first missionary he had ever seen. How had he reached this place? and what was the object of his coming? These questions we will try to answer. The last glimpse we had of Oowikapun was when he was quietly speeding away...", "...No sooner had the electoral formalities been con-concluded than, in the presence of the cardinals, he raised himself from his former stooping position, contemptuously threw away his crutch, and with a bounding and vigorous step displayed to the horror consternation of the sacred college that it had chosen for a holy father, not a pliant simpleton, but a man of authority, determination, and sagacity. Pope Celestine was elected solely on account of his ignorance and mental imbecility. For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> months the disputes of the cardinals had kept the papal throne without an incumbent. To conciliate their differences they finally agreed to elect Celestine, who was celebrated for his intellectual deficiency and profound ignorance of the world.

However, that brought us up to nineteen--not counting the three under- stewards--against <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> mutineers. The next question was as to weapons. The mutineers were each of them possessed of at least a knife, while it was known that Tonkin and some six or seven others had one or more pistols, and it was also speedily ascertained that they had secured all the pikes and tomahawks belonging to the ship. Moreover, there were such formidable makeshift weapons as capstan-bars, marline-spikes, belaying-pins, and other instruments accessible to them at a moment's notice....", "...Bolingbroke, Burlington, Lady Scudamore, the Countess of Winchilsea, Lord-chancellor Harcourt, and his son Sir Simon Harcourt, the Duke of Chandos, Lords Carlton, Peterborough, and Lansdowne, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Addison, Steele, Swift, Parnell, Gay, Rowe, and all the literary men of the age.

All the world is familiar with Pope's intense admiration of her, his having her picture drawn by Sir Godfrey Kneller to gaze on every day,...", "...persons were lynched in the United States. Of this number, one hundred and eighteen were executed in the South and nine in the North and West. Of the total number lynched, one hundred and two were Negroes, twenty-three were whites, and two Indians. Now, let every one interested in the South, his country, and the cause of humanity, note this fact,--that only twenty-four of the entire number were charged in any way with the crime of rape; that is, twenty-four out of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> cases of lynching. Sixty-one of the remaining cases were for murder, thirteen for being suspected of murder, six for theft, etc. During one week last spring, when I kept a careful record, thirteen Negroes were lynched in three of our Southern States; and not one was even charged with rape. All of these thirteen were accused of murder or house-burning; but in neither case were the men allowed to go before a court, so that their innocence or guilt might be proven.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> odd States that grant school suffrage have had different methods of dealing with the question, because their laws differ, but both the positive proof of its being granted, and the negative proof of its being withheld, tell the same story in regard to the fundamental principle involved.

Women have full municipal suffrage, and the Supreme Court of that State decided that they could vote for school treasurer, which was a...", "...and so many men to horses and wine.

They show, among other things, that in Louisiana, April 23-28, eight Negroes were lynched because one white man was killed by the Negro, the latter acting in self defense. Only seven of them are given in the list. Near Memphis, Tenn., six Negroes were lynched--this time charged with burning barns. A trial of the indicted resulted in an acquittal, although it was shown on trial that the lynching was prearranged for them. Six widows and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> orphans are indebted to this mob for their condition, and this lynching swells the number to eleven Negroes lynched in and about Memphis since March 9, 1892.

The fact is, little or nothing is actually _known_ by historical and documentary verification of the origin or dates of the MSS. upon which our New Testament is based. The next question that arises in a rational mind in this connection is this: Have we in these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> little pamphlets all that has been written upon the subjects to which they relate? The answer to this question is very embarrassing. It is an undoubted fact that the ecclesiastical council that selected the books composing the New Testament had at least _fifty_ Gospels, from which they selected _four_, and more than _one hundred_ Epistles, from which they selected _seventeen_, and that from nearly a _score_ of books professing to be records of the \"Acts of the Apostles\"...", "...the brief period of personal contact of which I have been bragging--I was struck by the tact and kindliness which he showed in the course of the discussion.

The tomb was close to a large Crusading hospice, and I have no doubt that it was used for the burial of pilgrims.

Five years after the \"Erlking\" was composed, several of them refused to print it, although Schubert offered to forego royalties on it. Finally, some of Schubert's friends had the song published at their own expense, and its success led to the issuing of eleven other songs, Schubert unwisely accepting eight hundred florins in lieu of royalty on these and the \"Erlking.\" Yet from one of these songs alone, \"The Wanderer,\" the publishers received <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> thousand florins between the years 1822 and 1861.

One afternoon, the breaching batteries, comprising <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> large guns, opened their fire on the wall of the town. In five days the breaches were practicable, and a summons to surrender was sent to the governor. This he declined doing.

Each man represented on an average six votes, but in estimating their values they said ten, for men always begin by exaggerating their own influence. Among these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> was one who was wholly devoted to the Prefet, one false brother who secretly looked for some favor from the Ministry, either for himself or for some one belonging to him. At this preliminary meeting, it was agreed that Savaron the lawyer should be named as candidate, a motion received with such enthusiasm as no one looked for from Besancon.

The colours taken from the enemy were carried in triumph; the King was received by the mayor with a present of money at Pennilesse Bench, and the heavy ordnance, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> pieces in all, were driven into Magdalen College Grove. The princes and many of the court took their degrees. Charles stayed but a short while, for, after having recruited his army and having been presented by the colleges with all the money they had in their treasuries, he presently left the city to make an advance on London.

The progress of enclosure was alleged as a proof that England was never more prosperous than under Walpole; the number of private gentlemen in Britain of ample estates was said to exceed that of any country in the world proportionately, and was far greater than in the reign of Charles II. The value of land at twenty-six or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years' purchase was a conclusive proof of the wealth of England.[425] Though, however, the first half of the century was generally prosperous there were bad times for farmer and landlord. We have seen that wheat-growing paid little, although from 1689 to 1773 the farmer was protected against imports and aided by a bounty on exports.

In 1139 one of the chieftains of the Juchen rebelled and entered into negotiations with the South Chinese. He was killed, but his sons and his whole tribe then rebelled and went into Mongolia, where they made common cause with the Mongols. The Chin pursued them, and fought against them and against the Mongols, but without success. Accordingly negotiations were begun, and a promise was given to deliver meat and grain every year and to cede <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> military strongholds. A high title was conferred on the tribal leader of the Mongols, in the hope of gaining his favour. He declined it, however, and in 1147 assumed the title of emperor of the \"greater Mongol empire\". This was the beginning of the power of the Mongols, who remained thereafter a dangerous enemy of the Chin in the north, until in 1189 Genghiz Khan became their leader and made the Mongols the greatest power of central Asia.

In this engagement, colonel Bredenbach attacked four brigades very strongly posted, with a battery of fourteen pieces of cannon, repulsed, and drove them down a precipice, and took all their artillery and ammunition; but preferring the care of his wounded to the glory of carrying away the cannon, he brought off only six, nailing up and destroying the rest. The loss of the allies in all the skirmishes, which lasted three days, was three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> men killed, nine hundred and seven wounded, and two hundred and twenty missing, or taken prisoners; whilst that of the French, according to their own accounts, amounted to fifteen hundred men.

Not many years since, I received a letter from a family in a retired village of the Green Mountains, begging me to visit one of their number, a young woman about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age. She was a farmer's daughter, and had been, in early life, employed as is customary in such families in that region; but, for a few years past had been employed, a considerable portion of the time, in teaching in the district or public schools. It is probable she exchanged the employments of home for the labors of the pedagogue, on account of increasing ill health (though of this I am not quite certain), since nothing is more common or more hazardous. The...", "...five hundred francs in notes. There is a little hum of applause. \"_Faites vos jeux, messieurs.\"_ Down rained the notes, the Napoleons, the British sovereigns and the five-franc pieces, and the game continues with monotonous regularity. For three mortal hours Lucy Warrender clutched her hotel key, and played with varying success. At one time there was quite a little heap of notes and gold in front of her, upon which she discreetly laid her fan. She had steadily backed the number <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> for varying but ever increasing amounts. The number twenty-seven had come up no less than eight times and had been the cause of Miss Warrender's winning heavily. The keenest eye at that time could have detected no wrinkle on Lucy's lovely girlish face. But fortune after a while ceased to favour her; the crowd of admiring onlookers, \"the gallery,\" that had stood behind her chair attracted by her successes gradually dwindled, and the heap of gold and notes in front of her...", "...into town.

This advertisement roused both the parson...", "...bridge over the Sambre and kept there all night. The bridge was similarly guarded for a day or two, apparently either from a fear that it was mined or in the belief that these men, women, and children would afford some protection to the Germans in the event of the French attempting to storm the bridge. At one period of the German occupation of Montigny, eight nuns of the Order of Ste. Marie were captives on the bridge.

A return to Cherbourg, where he married his first wife, who died at the end of two years; another sojourn in Paris, and a visit home of some duration; a number of portraits and pictures painted in Cherbourg and Havre, in which his talent was slowly asserting itself, brings us to 1845, when he remarried. Returning to Paris with his wife, he remained there until 1849, when he went to Barbizon \"for a time,\" which was prolonged to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years. In all the years preceding his final return to the country, Millet was apparently undecided as to the definite character of his work. Out of place in a city, more or less influenced by his comrades in art, and forced to follow in a degree the dictation of necessity in the choice of subject, as his brush was his only resource and his family constantly increasing, his work of this period is always tentative.

John Haldorson Bjoergo, who had emigrated from Voss in 1838, as we have seen, also came to Koshkonong in the spring of 1841, and Ole Severson Gilderhus[146] came a short time after. The latter had emigrated in 1840, having remained in Chicago during the winter. Bjoergo settled in the Town of Christiana in section nine, Ole Gilderhus a little farther north in Deerfield Township. \"None but Norwegians were then living in these regions,\" writes Bjoergo <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years later.[147] Bjoergo and Ole Gilderhus had, of course, arrived before Anders Nilson Lie.

The Populist vote as a whole was much larger than 223,000--the total usually given in the tables---for this figure does not include the vote in the twenty-two fusion States in which the ballots were not separately counted. This is apparent from the fact that the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> electoral votes from ten States which were cast for Watson came, with one exception, from States in which no separate Populist vote was recorded. It is evident, nevertheless, from the figures in States where comparisons are possible, that the party had lost ground. CHAPTER XIII.

The fishery of 1903 was the first since 1891, and produced a revenue of Rs.829,348, being the third largest on record. In 1797 and 1798 the government sold the privilege of fishing the oyster-beds for L123,982 and L142,780 respectively. From that time the fishery was conducted by the government itself until...", "...officer, 0 men. Arrived by Cadet: 3 officers, 52 men. 1847: Arrived by Freak: 2 officers, 6 men.

In the soft ground, where shutters were used, all of the twenty-seven jacks were frequently used, and on several occasions the pressure exceeded 6,000 lb. per sq. in.

The Allies had maintained and strengthened their old positions, made slight advances at some points, and continued to harass and destroy the enemy in trench raids, artillery duels, and in battles in the air.

About half a mile behind these came three unarmored gunboats, mounting <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> heavy guns, which took a more distant position, and kept up a bombardment of shells that fell within the works. Some four hundred of the formidable missiles of the ironclad boats were also thrown into the fort. The officers and men inside were not slow to respond, and as many as fifty-nine of their shots were counted as striking the gunboats.

Unwelcome as the meeting and the recognition were, he had not realised his danger until now. The awkward circumstances connected with the tankard and the guineas had escaped his memory.

When I composed them my soul was within yours. Without such a bride, indeed no one could write such music; once more I have composed so much that it seems almost uncanny. Alas!

The statement that woman is man's plaything has been often heard in Japan. Confucian no less than Buddhistic ethics must bear the responsibility for putting and keeping woman on so low a level. Concubinage, possibly introduced from China, was certainly sanctioned by the Chinese classics. The Lei-ki allows an Emperor to have in addition to the Empress three consorts, nine maids of high rank, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> maids of lower rank, all of whom rank as wives, and, beside these, eighty-one other females called concubines. Concubinage and polygamy, being thus sanctioned by the classics, became an established custom in Japan. The explanation for this ideal and practice is not far to seek. It rests in the communal character of the social order. The family was the social unit of Japan. No individual member was of worth except the legal head and representative, the father.

Now, watch.\" Suddenly two spurts of flame burst from the deck of the pursuing boat. Shells from her three-pounder quick-firers pitched a short distance on her starboard side. Simultaneously the torpedo-boat swung round. Travelling at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> knots, the sudden porting of her helm caused her to heel outwards till her deck was almost awash. \"By Jove, she's rammed our boat-hook!\" shouted Kenneth enthusiastically. \"If ever she gets back to port, won't she pitch a yarn about ramming and sinking a British submarine!\" The lad was not wrong in his surmise, for the torpedo-boat slowed down and made a complete circle, steaming over the spot where she imagined the periscope to have been.

In the second affidavit five men and fifteen animals, twenty in all, are called for on the then schedule, and on the proposed schedule twelve men and forty-two animals. The proportion there is 2.7. So that the affidavits, leaving out the fractions, which are substantially the same, stand in this way: By the first the contract price would have...", "...and indeed of the new kingdom of Siam. For, with the fall of Ayuthia and the removal of the seat of government to Bangkok, the country entered on a new era of prosperity and progress. Bangkok is not far from sixty miles nearer to the mouth of the river than Ayuthia, and the geographical change was significant of an advance toward the other nations of the world and of more intimate relations of commerce and friendship with them. The founder of this dynasty reigned prosperously for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years, and under his sway the country enjoyed the repose and peace which after a period of prolonged and devastating war it so greatly needed. After him his son continued the pacific administration of the government for fourteen years, until 1824. At the death of this king (the second of the new dynasty), who left as heirs to the throne two sons of the same mother, the succession was usurped by an illegitimate son, who contrived by cunning management and by a readiness to...", "...a single train of thought from beginning to logical end, then something is up.\" \"Such as what, for instance.\" The lieutenant leaned back in my easy-chair and stared at the ceiling. \"Wally,\" he said, \"I was relaxing in the car with Sergeant Holliday driving.

The sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> dollars was connected with the fact that the rewards made the risk worth taking; there were distinct impressions of playing that twenty-seven bucks across the board on three very especial nags at the Derby.

The leaders of the enterprise were, the gallant marques of Cadiz; Don Pedro Henriquez, adelantado of Andalusia; Don Juan de Silva, count of Cifuentes and bearer of the royal standard, who commanded in Seville; Don Alonso de Cardenas, master of the religious and military order of Santiago; and Don Alonso de Aguilar. Several other cavaliers of note hastened to take part in the enterprise, and in a little while about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> hundred horse and several companies of foot were assembled within the old warlike city of Antiquera, comprising the very flower of Andalusian chivalry. A council of war was held by the chiefs to determine in what quarter they should strike a blow. The rival Moorish kings were waging civil war with each other in the vicinity of Granada, and the whole country lay open to inroads. Various plans were proposed by the different cavaliers. The marques of Cadiz was desirous of...", "...of the maple wears its choicest hue of red; and the beech and chestnut assume their \"sere and yellow.\" Blending with these varieties, the unfading richness of the evergreen, it would excite no wonder, that the younger of our travelers, at least, beheld with admiration the gorgeous drapery which, in this climate, the forest assumes, preparatory to the desolation of winter. The younger of the two persons to whom we have called the attention of the reader, might have been twenty-six or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age. Of middle stature, he exhibited a frame of much symmetry and power; and it was apparent that he had been inured to labors which had fully developed health and strength. His face was somewhat embrowned by exposure to the weather; but his active and intelligent eyes, the firm compression of his lips, and the ready play of his countenance, as he listened to or answered some remark of his companion, made it apparent that he had at least bestowed some labor upon...", "...in 1644. Not long before his death, he purchased, jointly with his son-in-law Haynes, the Weston grant. His half of it he bequeathed to his son Nathaniel. He was evidently a man of real dignity and worth, enjoying the friendship of the best men of his day. Governor Endicott and Townsend Bishop were with him in his last sickness, and witnesses to his will. His widow married John Knight of Newbury. In a legal instrument filed among the papers connected with a case of land title, dated <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years after her first husband's death, she expresses in very striking language the tender affection and respect with which she still cherished his memory. William Haynes married Sarah, daughter of Richard Ingersoll, and occupied his half of the Weston grant.

Many of these coincidences between the first and third Synoptics are insignificant in the extreme.

After losing one of their number, the rest escaped from the Athenians and sailed into Corinth. Meanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades seized all they met with on their voyage, to prevent news of their coming, and let them go at Corycus, the first point which they touched at in the continent.

Lucan was educated at Rome under the Stoic Cornutus, and was introduced by his uncle Seneca to the Emperor Nero. Having for a time enjoyed the patronage of Nero, he at length became the object of his jealousy and hatred, was accused of having taken part in Piso's conspiracy, and was condemned to death. He was allowed, as a favor, to put an end to his own life, and thus died, A.D. 65. Although so young, for he was scarcely <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age, Lucan, besides several shorter poems, produced the Pharsalia, an epic, of which he finished only ten books: it relates the wars between Caesar and Pompey, and contains many fine thoughts and striking images.

But the arrogance of Itakh, to whom he owed his Caliphate, became insufferable. So, with the perfidy of his race, the caliph took him off his guard, and had him imprisoned and killed at Bagdad.

Asserting that Gabriel brought him revelations, he had contrived to attract <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> followers. The caliph had him flogged, and compelled each of the twenty-seven to give him ten blows on the head with his fist. The \"prophet\" expired under the blows (850).

The only issue of the canvass was slavery, and on this they were perfectly agreed,...", "...the Bande Isles there. At five I altered my course and steered east, and at eight east-south-east, because I would not be seen by the inhabitants of those islands in the morning.

It is laid down in our drafts in latitude 5 degrees 9 minutes south, which is too far southerly by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> miles, according to our observation, and the like error in laying down the Turtle Islands might be the occasion of our missing them. At night I shortened sail, for fear of coming too nigh some islands, that stretch away bending like a half moon from Ceram towards Timor, and which in my course I must of necessity pass through.

At the surface of the sun the force of gravity is more than twenty-seven times as great as it is on the earth. A person who on the earth could just lift <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> equal pieces of metal would, if he were transferred to the sun, only be able to lift one of the pieces at a time. The pressure of the gases below the surface must therefore be very great, and it might be supposed that they would become liquefied in consequence.

For thirty years she was unsurpassed in her impersonation of the tragic heroines of Shakespeare. Her first great success was in the season of 1782, when she appeared for the second time on the London stage. She was then about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age, and had devoted years of arduous study to her profession. Though gifted by nature with strong dramatic instincts inherited from generations of players, her powers developed slowly. The roles which she acted were of the more serious sort, which required maturity and experience for interpretation. Her personal appearance was eminently fitted for tragic parts. She had a queenly presence, a countenance moulded in noble lines, a deep-toned measured voice, and an...", "...ridges with acute apexes. Along these ridges the usual system of spines is placed, with the shorter ones radially arranged and very sharp. These radial spines are unequal in length and are spreading from their bases, while the centrals are stouter, the lowest two inches or so long, all thorns having bulbous bases and a tannish brown color scheme, toning off to gray. The flowers are among the largest of the salmon or scarlet forms--when opened, about the length of a large egg--and have <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> broad thick petals, the tips well rounded; or the petals may be notched or tipped with a short point. The general colorings are from orange-red to a flaming salmon; hence the common name. There are many stamens of about the same length as the style and stigmas. The style branches are light green and are incurved. The stems of this cactus grow singly or in loose clusters, and thrive well in sandy or gravelly loam. How to grow Little is known about growing this...", "...rapidly rose out of sight. We resumed our place before the hive; and in seven minutes, the young queen returned to the entrance of a habitation which she had left for the first time. Having found no external appearance of fecundation, we allowed her to enter. In a quarter of an hour she re-appeared; and, after brushing herself as before, took flight. Then returning to examine the hive, she rose so high that we soon lost sight of her. Her second absence was much longer than the first; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> minutes elapsed before she came back. We then found her in a state very different from that in which she was after her first excursion. The sexual organs were distended by a white substance, thick and hard, very much resembling the fluid in the vessels of the male, completely similar to it indeed in colour and consistence{E}. But more evidence than mere resemblance was requisite to establish that the female had returned with the prolific fluid of the males. We allowed...", "...feet above the ocean, while its proportions--nearly twenty-two thousand miles in area and in places over five hundred feet deep--assumed those of an inland sea.

From Ujiji he then explored Lake Tanganyika, finding it to be about half the size of Victoria, with an elevation of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> hundred feet.

The plains between the escarpments are full of lagoons or marshes. Such a terrain continued until, about five hours' way from the vessel, we came to a height of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> metres. From this point the terrace-formations cease, and the terrain then consists of a large number of ranges of heights, intersected by rivulets, which during the snow-melting season must be very much flooded. Seven or eight hours' way from the vessel we met with such a rivulet, which farther to the S.S.E. unites with another which runs between two rocky escarpments twenty metres high.

The two former feed and clothe themselves and their families on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the farmhand has to feed himself on his $1.08.

During the year the Athletics took part in fifty professional games, of which they won <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> and lost twenty-three, and in fourteen exhibition games, of which they won twelve and lost two, being defeated in the exhibition series twice by their home rivals, the Philadelphias, which numbered among its players several who had helped to make the Athletics famous in former years, among them being Malone and Mack. Between these two nines there was the strongest kind of a rivalry, and as both were popular with the home people great crowds turned out to see the contests...", "...to Sierre, and thence by diligence or private conveyance to Visp, some seventeen miles farther up the Rhone valley. Here it is better to shoulder one's knapsack, for there is no carriage road for the first twelve miles of the Visp-Thal, which leads to Zermatt, though the mule-path is exceptionally good.

The river flows into the Rhone near this point with a volume almost as great as the Rhone itself. The little town was once a place of great importance. The houses on the heights, which still bear traces of the earthquake of 1855, were formerly the palaces of the princes of the Valais.

It is built on the remains...", "...of pope and emperor. To Santa Croce this morning.

Mary added twenty-one, Elizabeth sixty, and James <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> members.[66] These accessions to the popular chamber of parliament after the reign of Henry VIII. were by no means derived from a popular principle, such as had influenced its earlier constitution.

In March, 1861, when Lincoln was inaugurated, the available ships-of-war at sea, or in the yards, numbered sixty-one. Of these thirty-four were sailing vessels, substantially worthless; although, as the commerce of the world was still chiefly carried on by sailing ships, they could be of some slight service against these attempting to pass a blockade. For the most part, however, they were but scarecrows, if even respected as such. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> steamers, only six dated from before 1850; the remainder were being built when I entered the Naval Academy in September, 1856. Their construction, with all that it meant, constituted a principal part of the environment into which I was then brought, of which the recasting of the list of officers was the other most important and significant feature. Both were revolutionary in character, and prophetic of further changes quite beyond the foresight of contemporaries.

However, an hour's journey by rail and then a quarter of an hour's sleigh ride will take you from Buffalo within sight of this, perhaps the grandest piece of scenery in the world. Words cannot describe it. You spend a couple of hours visiting every point of view. You are nailed, as it were, to the ground, feeling like...", "...extending north and south, and on either side environed by mountains. [Footnote 348: Although these hydrographical notices of the environs of Saldanha bay and the Cape of Good Hope are by no means perfectly accurate, probably vitiated in the abbreviation of Purchas, they distinctly shew, that the bay named Saldanha by our early voyagers, was that now called Table bay: This latter is twelve or thirteen leagues from the Cape, nearly as in the text, while that now called Saldanha bay is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> leagues distant. The near neighbourhood of False bay is incontestible evidence of the fact, being only three leagues distant; while our modern Saldanha bay is more than twenty leagues from False bay as the crow flies.--E.] In former time, Saldanha bay was very comfortable to our navigators, both outward and homeward-bound, yielding them abundance of cattle and sheep, by which their weak and sick men in former voyages were easily recovered and made strong. These used to...", "...wait eighteen years, it would be well to leave Bucquoy and Targone to build dykes and chariots and bury them on the east at their leisure, while more energy was brought to bear upon the line of fortifications of the west than had hitherto been employed. There had been shooting enough, bloodshed enough, suffering enough, but it was amazing to see the slight progress made. The occupation of what were called the external Squares has been described. This constituted the whole result of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> months' work. The town itself--the small and very insignificant kernel which lay enclosed in such a complicated series of wrappings and layers of defences--seemed as far off as if it were suspended in the sky. The old haven or canal, no longer navigable for ships, still served as an admirable moat which the assailants had not yet succeeded in laying entirely dry. It protected the counterscarp, and was itself protected by an exterior aeries of works, while behind the...", "...answered: not so the magisterial Bumpus who lived in Boston on the water side of Beacon, whom likewise he had ventured to address,--to the indignation and disgust of his elder daughter, Janet. \"Why are you so proud of Ebenezer?\" she demanded once, scornfully. \"Why? Aren't we descended from him?\" \"How many generations?\" \"Seven,\" said Edward, promptly, emphasizing the last syllable. Janet was quick at figures. She made a mental calculation. \"Well, you've got one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> other ancestors of Ebenezer's time, haven't you?\" Edward was a little surprised. He had never thought of this, but his ardour for Ebenezer remained undampened. Genealogy--his own--had become his religion, and instead of going to church he spent his Sunday mornings poring over papers of various degrees of discolouration, making careful notes on the ruled block. This consciousness of his descent from good American stock that had somehow been deprived of its heritage,...", "...arises, no doubt, from that natural depravity which has come upon men in consequence of the fall of Adam, or because, at their baptism, the devil is not brought sufficiently under subjection. A remarkable example of this hardness of heart was given by one Colin, the richest farmer and proprietor in Napoule, whose vineyards and olive gardens, whose lemon and orange trees could hardly be counted in a day. One thing particularly demonstrates the perverseness of his disposition; he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years old, and had never yet asked for what purpose girls had been created! True, all the people, especially damsels of a certain age, willingly forgave him this sin, and looked upon him as one of the best young men under the sun. His fine figure, his fresh, unembarrassed manner, his look, his laugh, enabled him to gain the favorable opinion of the aforesaid people, who would have forgiven him, had there been occasion, any one of the deadly sins. But the decision of such...", "...and the government. Upon her majesty's return to Windsor, she found the king something improved in natural spirits, but desirous not to be troubled with unnecessary visiters. This slight improvement was, however, but of short duration; for, in a few days afterwards, this distressingly-afflicted sovereign relapsed into insensibility, and frequently became very boisterous in his conduct. The amount required for this year's service was upwards of one hundred and sixteen millions, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of which were raised by loans. The year 1815 commenced under numerous public and private difficulties. The regent found himself in a very unpleasant situation, being under a necessity of increasing the number of the various orders of knighthood, in order to preserve himself a sufficiency of adherents. A strange concatenation of events had also placed the rest of the royal family in an uneasy position. The Duke of Kent, some considerable time before, entered...", "...she answered quickly. \"Was he all right--then?\" \"All right, but that was just after he came to the North. I was camping on this side of Grizzly River, and he stayed to eat with me. He said his name was Lounsbury. I've never heard of him since.\" The surface lights died in her eyes. \"Then that doesn't help us much, except to know that he got that far, at least,\" she went on. \"I'll tell you the whole thing, simply; maybe it will help you in deciding where to look for him. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> then--and he'd spent the fortune his father left him. He had to have more, and he came up here--to look for gold. \"Like many other men--before him,\" Bill interrupted gravely. \"He had some sort of definite plan--a vacation place to go--but he never told me what it was. He told me he was going into Clearwater. He had to have money--he was in debt and besides, he was engaged to marry me. The last word I ever heard of him was a note he wrote from Bradleyburg. I was...", "...from the Wood Mouse by its larger size, the head and body measuring four and a quarter inches, and the brown spot on the chest commonly found in the Wood Mouse developed into an orange cross whose arms are connected with the upper side coloration--described as golden brown. This is a feature that at once attracts attention where this form occurs; but there is another distinction out of sight--there being three additional bony joints in the tail, that is thirty instead of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> in the tail of an ordinary Wood Mouse. Whether it is a really distinct species or the typical form of the Wood Mouse is at present open to question. It is found chiefly in the southern and eastern portions of England, but its distribution also includes Northamptonshire, Herefordshire, and Northumberland. Other local races have been distinguished also as distinct species or sub-species under the name of Hebridean Field Mouse (_A. hebridensis_) with the white of the under...", "...won twice that year and gave Michigan her first experience with \"real interference and fast play.\" Michigan took her first Western trip the following year. The team was coached by Frank Barbour, a classmate of Crawford's at Yale, and for the first time played a complete schedule with the leading universities of the West, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Northwestern, and Chicago, with varying success. The Varsity lost most of her principal games in 1893, Minnesota winning for the last time in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years, though a final victory over Chicago, 18 to 10, was some compensation for the earlier defeats. The autumn of 1894 saw the beginning of a long series of remarkably successful seasons, which lasted with one or two partial relapses until 1906. These twelve years were not only Michigan's \"golden age\" of football, as far as the game itself is concerned, but also one of the longest series of almost uniformly successful seasons in the history of any of the larger...", "...to draw out the papal army at the same time, in order that the latter might find itself between two fires.

Monte Rotondo, defended by only three hundred and fifty soldiers, resisted Garibaldi's attacking force of six thousand during <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> hours, a feat which must have been quite impracticable had the inhabitants themselves not joined in the defence. The revolution in Rome was a total failure, the mass of the people looking on with satisfaction, while the troops shot down the insurgents, and at times even demanding arms that they might join in suppressing the disturbance. The Rome of 1867 was not the Rome of 1870, as will perhaps be understood hereafter. With the exception of a few turbulent spirits, the...", "...No wonder he was ashamed to look us in the face when he was meditating such a step as this. The duplicity of man is something shocking!\" It was not surprising that Herbert Penfold's sudden assertion of his will was a shock to his sisters. These ladies had so long been accustomed to rule absolutely at Penfold Hall that Mr. Penfold's assertion of his right to act as he pleased in his own house came upon them like an act of absolute rebellion. At their father's death they were women of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> and twenty-six years old respectively. Herbert was a lad of sixteen. He was of a gentle and yielding disposition; and as their father for some years previous to his death had been a confirmed invalid, and they had had the complete management of the house, it was but natural that at his death they should continue in the same position. Owing to weak health, Herbert had not been sent to school, but had been educated under the care of a tutor. He had wished when he reached...", "...what I referred to. The little rogue had put on my glasses and had got hold of a big book. We were great chums, and she delighted to mock me.

Those of the Councillors who opposed this determined on their part to send a counter-address; and to avoid this clashing of opinions Bonaparte signified his wish that each member of the Council should send him his opinion individually, with his signature affixed. By a singular accident it happened to be Berlier's task to present to the First Consul the separate opinions of the Council. Out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> Councillors present only seven opposed the question. Bonaparte received them all most graciously, and told them, among other things, that be wished for hereditary power only for the benefit of France; that the citizens would never be his subjects, and that the French people would never be his people.

Jovian dying, after a reign of eight months, Valens became emperor of the East, who was at first very orthodox, but afterwards, seduced by the persuasions of his wife, he espoused the Arian heresy, and received baptism from Eudoxus, bishop of Constantinople, who made him promise upon oath to promote the cause of that sect.

In 1824 a new Company was formed to provide a dock nearer to the heart of the City than any of the existing ones. The site selected was the space between the Tower and the London Docks, which included the property of St. Katherine's Hospital. The whole extent of land available was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> acres of a very irregular figure, so that when the quays and warehouses were laid out, it was found that only about ten acres remained for the docks; but these, from the nature of the ground, presented an unusual amount of quay room. The necessary Act was obtained in 1825; the works were begun in the following year; and on the 25th of October, 1828, the new docks were completed and opened for business. The St. Katherine Docks communicate with the river by means of an...", "...charged among the thickest of the enemy, and soon drove them to the shore, whence they fled into the woods.

Three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> prisoners had, however, been already shipped off. Those who remained were not permitted to converse, even with each other, without risk,--one Thomas Wells being appointed as a spy to write to the Jacobites, and to discourse with them, under the garb of friendliness, in order to draw out their real sentiments.[21] From this digression, which may not be deemed irrelevant, since it marks the spirit of the times, we return to the unhappy prisoners in the Tower, which was now...", "...burdensome navigation laws of England, to give American ships a fair field and no favors. The Atlantic trade was therefore stimulated by allowing a reduction of ten per cent of the customs duties on goods imported in vessels built and owned by American citizens. The East India trade, which already employed forty New England ships, was fostered in like manner. Teas brought direct under the American flag paid an average duty of twelve cents a pound while teas in foreign bottoms were taxed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> cents. It was sturdy protection, for on a cargo of one hundred thousand pounds of assorted teas from India or China, a British ship would pay $27,800 into the custom house and a Salem square-rigger only $10,980. The result was that the valuable direct trade with the Far East was absolutely secured to the American flag. Not content with this, Congress decreed a system of tonnage duties which permitted the native owner to pay six cents per ton on his vessel while the...", "...Indians, disgusted at his multiplied demands for clemency, observed that everybody seemed to be his relation.

Thirty or forty captured horses dragged their sledges; and a troop of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> men and boys were driven prisoners into the forest. About sixty old men, women, and children were left behind, without farther injury, in order, it is said, to conciliate the Mohawks in the place, who had joined with Glen in begging that they might be spared.

The extraordinary speed of the return journey is to be accounted for by the fact that we merely had to retrace our old trail instead of making a new one, and because we were fortunate in encountering no delays. Excellent conditions of ice and weather also contributed, not to mention the fact that the exhilaration of success lent wings to our sorely battered feet.

The census gives the number of children between six and fifteen years of age at 6931; and there are 324 teachers, or one teacher for every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> children in the whole group. Attendance at school is, I suspect, more general here than in any other country in the world. The last report of W.P. Kamakau, the President of the Board of Education, made in March, 1872, returns 8287 children actually attending upon 245 schools of various grades, 202 being common schools. Under this system there is scarcely a Hawaiian of proper age who can not both read and write.

One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years have passed away since its erection, and old Captain Bonner's map now requires a pretty close study to enable our modern eyes to recognize any clue to its present locality.

With all my heart, says Pantagruel, and swallowed down three quarts of Burton ale; but remember, it wants but an hour of dinner time, and the question must be asked in as few words as possible; for I cannot deprive myself of the pleasure I expected to enjoy in the company of my good friends for a set of mad-headed masters.

Her sister, Agnes, but three years younger than Marie, also entered the convent, and, at the age of fifteen, was made mistress of the novices; during the absence of her sister, at Maubuisson, she was at the head of the convent; from that time, she governed Port-Royal alternately with her sister, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years. Her work, _The Secret Chapter of the Sacrament_, was suppressed at Rome, but without bringing formal censure upon her. The last of those great abbesses was Mere Angelique, who lived through the most troublous and critical times of Port-Royal (1624 to 1684). At the age of twenty she became a nun, having been reared in the convent by her aunt, Marie, who was the most perfect disciple of Saint-Cyran. Mere Angelique was especially conspicuous for her obstinacy, and...", "...face south appears to be a deeply rooted one, as even the tents in summer all face the same way.[N146] [Footnote N146: Frobisher says the tents in Meta Incognita (in 1577) were \"so pitched up, that the entrance into them, is alwaies South, or against the Sunne.\" Hakluyt's Voyages, etc., (1589) p. 628.] The tents on the sandspit at Plover Bay all face west. The same was observed by the Krause brothers at East Cape.[N147] At Utkiavw[)i]n there are twenty-six or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> inhabited houses. The uninhabited are mostly ruins and are chiefly at the southwest end of the village, though the breaking away of the cliffs at the other end has exposed the ruins of a few other old houses. Near these are also the ruins of the buildings destroyed by the ice catastrophe described above (p. 31). The mounds at the site of the United States signal station are also the ruins of old iglus.

The slave who has a hut and a family is less miserable than he who is purchased as if he formed part of a flock. The greater the number of slaves established with their families in dwellings which they believe to be their own property, the more rapidly will their numbers increase. The annual increase of the last ten years in the United States (without counting the manumission of 100,000), was twenty-six on a thousand, which produces a doubling in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years. Now, if the slaves at Jamaica and Cuba had multiplied in the same proportion, those two islands (the former since 1795, and the latter since 1800) would possess almost their present population, without 400,000 blacks having been dragged from the coast of Africa, to Port-Royal and the Havannah.

But yet the parents did not thus apply it; whereupon he placed a box in his own dwelling, that all who visited him might contribute. He knew that then he would have the personal distribution of such funds.

New books were bought, and henceforth it was required that they be left in the room. At first Francke's own study was the book depository and school-room; but in a short time his pupils so greatly increased that he hired adjacent accommodations. Voluntary contributions came in freely; new buildings were erected, and teachers provided; and before the death of the founder, the...", "...seal the letters with my ring.

In the highest, the holiest sense he was the most profoundly religious man of his time. VI. THE RETURN. AFTER an exile of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years, occupying during all that time a first place in the civilized world, Voltaire returned to Paris. His journey was a triumphal march. He was received as a conqueror. The Academy, the Immortals, came to meet him--a compliment that had never been paid to royalty. His tragedy of \"Irene\" was performed. At the theatre he was crowned with laurel, covered with flowers; he was intoxicated with perfume and with incense of worship. He was the supreme French poet, standing above...", "...later the preacher returned with an order from the general for the prisoners to be placed in durance. \"I have obtained your life,\" the preacher said, \"but even to my prayers the general will grant no more. You and your men are to be sent to the Bermudas.\" Although Harry felt that death itself would be almost preferable to a life of slavery in the plantations, he thanked the preacher for his efforts in his behalf. A week later Harry, with the eight men who had taken with him, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> others who been discovered in hiding-places, long after the capture of the place, were placed on board a ship bound for the Bermudas, the sole survivors of the garrison--three thousand strong--and of the inhabitants of Drogheda.

In 269 they imposed a tribute on the Emperor Gratian, and seem to have been settled in Dacia. After this they made several successful raids,--invading Bythinia, entering the Propontis, and advancing as far as Athens and Corinth, even to the coasts of Asia Minor; destroying in their ravages the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, with its one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> marble columns. These calamities happened in the middle of the third century, during the reign of the frivolous Gallienus, who received the news with his accustomed indifference. While the Goths were burning the Grecian cities, this royal cook and gardener was soliciting a place in the Areopagus of Athens. In the reign of Claudius the barbarians united under the Gothic standard, and in six thousand vessels prepared again to ravage the world.

In the interior ranged twenty-four antae, or square pillars, of fifty feet in height; on the top of each was a sculptured giant <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> feet in height, which with his hands clasped over his head supported the lofty roof. One can scarcely conceive any thing more noble and majestic than this wonderful edifice, in comparison with which, though covering much more ground, St. Peter's in Rome is a splendid gew-gaw.

A wide heap of ruin; the interior of which, the columns and walls having fallen outward, is a flowery field, in which lie some fragments of those huge giants...", "...At the age of twenty-five Timur was hailed as the deliverer of his country. When he chose Samarkand as the capital of his dominion, he declared his purpose to make that dominion embrace the whole habitable earth; and at the height of his power he ruled from the Great Wall of China to the centre of Russia on the north, while his sovereignty extended to the Mediterranean and the Nile on the west, and on the east to the sources of the Ganges. In his own person he united <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> different sovereignties, and nine several dynasties of kings gave place to the unparalleled conqueror, who won by the sword a larger portion of the globe than Cyrus or Alexander, Caesar or Attila, Genghis Khan, Charlemagne, or Napoleon.

The pro-slavery party were very indignant over the matter, and the Hon.

But these instruments did not long maintain their supremacy. In 1881, Mr. Howard Grubb, of Dublin, manufactured a still larger instrument for the Austrian Government--the object-glass being of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> inches aperture. But Mr. Alvan Clark was not to be beaten. In 1882, he supplied the Russian Government with the largest refracting telescope in existence the object-glass being of thirty inches diameter. Even this, however, is to be surpassed by the lens which Mr. Clark has in hand for the Lick Observatory (California), which is to have a clear aperture of three feet in diameter.

This observation proves that the Sun revolves upon itself. The reappearance of the spots occurs in about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> days, because the Earth is not stationary, and in its movement round the burning focus, a motion effected in the same direction as the solar rotation, the spots are still visible two and a half days after they disappeared from the point at which they had been twenty-five days previously.

Being pursued by a party of young men from Albany, about twenty-five of them were killed and captured.[117] [Footnote 117: Smith.] [Sidenote: Expedition against Port Royal.] In the spring...", "...the young Chinaman, Major Noltitz, Ephrinell, Miss Bluett, Monsieur Caterna, the Baron Weissschnitzerdoerfer, and seven or eight other passengers.

In an hour we are in sight of Uzun Ada, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> minutes afterward we set foot in Asia. CHAPTER V. Travelers used to land at Mikhailov, a little port at the end of the Transcaspian line; but ships of moderate tonnage hardly had water enough there to come alongside. On this account, General Annenkof, the creator of the new railway, the eminent engineer whose name will frequently recur in my narrative, was led to found Uzun Ada, and thereby considerably shorten the crossing of the Caspian. The station was...", "...Royale, and Prince de Carignan was appointed in 1731 _inspecteur-general_. A captain of the Picardy regiment, Eugene de Thuret, followed in 1733, was succeeded in 1744 by Berger, and then came Trefontaine, whose management lasted sixteen months--until the 27th of August 1794. All this was a period of mismanagement and deficits, and the King, tired of constant mishaps and calls upon his exchequer, ordered the city of Paris to take over the administration of his Academy. At the end of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years the city had had enough of it, and the King devised a fresh scheme by appointing six \"Commissaires du Roi pres la Academie\" (Papillon de la Ferte, Mareschel des Entelles, De la Touche, Bourboulon, Hebert and Buffault), who had under their orders a director, two inspectors, an agent and a cashier. But the combination was short-lived, lasting barely a year. In 1778 the city of Paris made one more try by granting a subvention of 80,000 livres by a Sieur de Vismos. In...", "...his thoughts were carried over the mountains to his old home. \"Ah, my good friend,\" I added \"how their hearts must rejoice to hear from you.\" Then, after a short pause, I remarked, \"What is the case against your prisoner? He, too, perhaps, may have a mother and sister in the East, thinking of him as your mother and sister do of you, and wondering when he will come back. For God's sake remember this.\" The heart of the good man responded in a voice which, even to this day--now nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years past--sounds like a delicious melody in my ears: \"I will do so.\" Passing from him I went to the other jurors, and, finding they were about to go back to the trial, I exclaimed, \"Don't be in a hurry, gentlemen, let us take another glass.\" They again acceded to my request, and seeing that they were a little mellowed by their indulgence, I ventured to speak about the trial.

M. de Gourmont read it and smiled; he wrote an article, and still found something to smile at; he wrote a book, _Le Probleme du Style_, in which, mocking M. Albalat through a hundred and fifty-two courteous pages, he showed, besides many other things, that style is not to be taught in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> lessons, and, indeed, is not to be taught at all. Then he felt free to smile at something else. M. de Gourmont is careful to say that he brought to the _Esthetique de la langue francaise_, \"ni lois, ni regles, ni principes peut-etre; je n'apporte rien qu'un sentiment esthetique assez violent et quelques notions historiques: voila ce que je jette au hasard dans la grande cuve ou fermente la langue de demain.\" An aesthetic feeling and some historical notions were...", "...of the world.

These considerations, however, only induced Lord Cochrane to proceed cautiously upon his enterprise. Three days were spent in preparations, the purpose of which was known only to himself and to his chief officers. On the afternoon of the 5th of November he issued this proclamation:--\"Marines and seamen,--This night we shall give the enemy a mortal blow. To-morrow you will present yourself proudly before Callao, and all your comrades...", "...friendship; but at last even this was done. \"At any rate,\" thought the bishop, \"he will come and dine with me from time to time, and if he be absolutely starving I shall see it.\" It was settled that Mr. Harding should still be the precentor of the cathedral, and a small living within the walls of the city was given to him. It was the smallest possible parish, containing a part of the cathedral close and a few old houses adjoining. The church was no bigger than an ordinary room--perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> feet long by eighteen wide--but still it was a perfect church. Such was the living of St. Cuthbert's at Barchester, of which Mr. Harding became rector, with a clear income of L75 a year. Mr. Harding allowed himself no rest till everything was prepared for his departure from the hospital. For his present use he took a lodging in Barchester, and thither were conveyed such articles as he wanted for daily use.

His son Philip was a widower; and though he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age, eleven years younger than the queen, this objection, it was thought, would be overlooked, and there was no reason to despair of her still having a numerous issue.

He was familiar with all literary and scientific data, and according to Clemens could swear in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> languages. It was thought to be a choice idea to get Trumbull to supply a lingual medley of quotations to precede the chapters in the new book, the purpose being to excite interest and possibly to amuse the reader--a purpose which to some extent appears to have miscarried.] The book was begun in February and finished in April, so the work did not lag.

Very few of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> thousand, probably, are wholly destitute of merit.

From these considerations it will be seen that the sun does not rotate as the earth does, but that different portions appear to move at different speeds. Whether in the neighbourhood of the solar poles the time of rotation exceeds <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> days we are unable to ascertain, for spots are not seen in those regions. No explanation has yet been given of this peculiar rotation; and the most we can say on the subject is that the sun is not by any means a solid body. _Faculae_ (Latin, little torches) are brilliant patches which appear here and there upon the sun's surface, and are in some way associated with spots. Their displacement, too, across the solar face confirms the evidence which the spots give us of the...", "...they could equally effect fecundation; also, in case it succeeded, whether a laying, begun in the middle of autumn, would be interrupted or continued during winter. Thus, we allowed the queen to leave the hive. She departed, indeed, but made four and twenty fruitless attempts before returning with the evidence of fecundation. Finally, on the thirty-first of October, she was more fortunate: She departed, and returned with the most undoubted proof of the success of her amours: She was now <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> days old, consequently fecundation had been retarded. She ought to have begun laying within forty-six hours, but the weather was cold, and she did not lay; which proves, as we may cursorily remark, that refrigeration of the atmosphere is the principal agent that suspends the laying of queens during winter. I was excessively impatient to learn whether, on the return of spring, she would prove fertile, without a new copulation. The means of ascertaining the fact was easy;...", "...Andre-Louis' own garments--was thereby protected against the risk of his latest recruit absconding with the takings. Andre-Louis, without illusions on the score of Pantaloon's real object, agreed to it willingly enough, since it protected him from the chance of recognition by any acquaintance who might possibly be in Guichen. The performance was in every sense unexciting; the audience meagre and unenthusiastic. The benches provided in the front half of the market contained some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> persons: eleven at twenty sous a head and sixteen at twelve. Behind these stood a rabble of some thirty others at six sous apiece. Thus the gross takings were two louis, ten livres, and two sous. By the time M. Binet had paid for the use of the market, his lights, and the expenses of his company at the inn over Sunday, there was not likely to be very much left towards the wages of his players. It is not surprising, therefore, that M. Binet's bonhomie should have been a...", "...his field of vision. It was situated between the former and the ring; that is, it is the nearest to it of the seven. But the most remarkable of Herschel's achievements was the discovery of the planet Uranus, and the detection of its satellites. On the 13th of March 1781, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, the great astronomer was engaged in examining the small stars near H in the constellation Gemini, with a seven-foot telescope, bearing a magnifying power of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> times. It appeared to him that one of these stars was of an unusual diameter; and he came to the conclusion, therefore, that it was a comet. It was under this denomination that it was discussed at the meeting of the Royal Society. But the researches of Herschel at a later period showed that the orbit of the new body was circular, and accordingly it was elevated to the rank of a planet. As already stated, Herschel named it, in compliment to George III., the Georgium Sidus;...", "...putting in your malt, one sack at a time, and mash for one hour and a quarter, stand one hour, run down as fine as you can, yet smartly; second mash one hundred and eighty-five, need not boil, but when brought to that heat in your copper, begin mashing, and mash well for three quarters of an hour, stand two hours; boil, skim, and hop, as already directed.

These are the nerves called \"sensory,\" which carry to the brain sensations from outside the body. The \"motor\" nerves are those which take orders from the brain, to be instantly obeyed by the muscles. In the hand, which has <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> bones--one more than the foot--and is a more wonderful \"tool\" than any which God has given to the lower animals, wonderful as _their_ tools are, the sense of touch is stronger than in any other part of the body.

Everything Mrs. Schmidt said testified to her humanity and her clear, serious, sympathetic insight. What a pity she had forgotten how to laugh! What a pity she was not Ratsherr Willibald Pirkheimer's stately, respected wife, surrounded by his healthy children! Her broad shoulders and hips, her long, thick hair required the soft curves of a body blooming in happiness, sunlight and wealth. As it was, her face, though she was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years old, was fearfully worn and anxious, and her shabby clothes hung carelessly on her angular figure. Nevertheless, Frederick perceived the beauty even in her neglected appearance. Naturally Peter Schmidt, the blond Friesian, also suffered under these conditions, but not to such an extent as to be shaken in his peculiar, deep-seated idealism. It was his idealism, never for an instant forsaking him, that raised him above all momentary hardships. This very fact, it...", "...in the markets of Europe to require description: it grows in the gardens about the town, in greater quantities amongst the Western Gallas, and in perfection at Jarjar, a district of about seven days' journey from Harar on the Efat road. It is said that the Amir withholds this valuable article, fearing to glut the Berberah market: he has also forbidden the Harash, or coffee cultivators, to travel lest the art of tending the tree be lost. When I visited Harar, the price per parcel of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> pounds was a quarter of a dollar, and the hire of a camel carrying twelve parcels to Berberah was five dollars: the profit did not repay labour and risk. The tobacco of Harar is of a light yellow color, with good flavour, and might be advantageously mixed with Syrian and other growths. The Alo, or Western Gallas, the principal cultivators, plant it with the holcus, and reap it about five months afterwards.

At another time he put to the most inhuman torture a leader who had opposed his cause; in repeated instances he instigated the crime of assassination.[103] In early life he had been engaged in a peaceful caravan trade, and all his influence had been cast in favor of universal security as against the predatory habits of the heathen Arabs; but on coming to power he himself resorted to robbery to enrich his exchequer. Sales mentions <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of these predatory expeditions against caravans, in which Mohammed was personally present.[104] The biographers of his early life represent him as a man of a natural kindness of disposition, and a sensitive temperament almost bordering on timidity. Though not particularly genial, he was fond of children, and had at first, as his recorded utterances show, frequent impulses of pity and magnanimity. But he became hardened as success crowned his career. The temperateness...", "...worked with him, we'd have done big things, bigger than he did, and that was big enough.\" \"Do nothing till you see me,\" his mother had written in a postscript to her letter, and, with a moroseness at his heart and scorn of Barouche at his lips, he went slowly up to his mother's room. At her door he paused. But the woman was his mother, and it must be faced. After all, she had kept faith ever since he was born. He believed that. She had been an honest wife ever since that fatal summer <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years before. \"She has suffered,\" he said, and knocked at her door. An instant later he was inside the room. There was only a dim light, but his mother was sitting up in her bed, a gaunt and yet beautiful, sad-eyed figure of a woman. For a moment Carnac paused. As he stood motionless, the face of the woman became more drawn and haggard, the eyes more deeply mournful. Her lips opened as though she would speak, but no sound came, and Carnac could hardly bear to look at...", "...B will, in a bent path, vary more and more from a horizontal straight line, and the light will do the same, because if we observe the movements from another standpoint this can have no effect upon the remaining next to each other of B and C. DEFLECTION OF LIGHT The bending of a ray of light thus described is much too light on the surface of the earth to be observed. But the attraction of gravitation exercised by the sun on its surface is, because of its great mass, more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> times stronger, and a ray of light that goes close by the superficies of the sun must surely be noticeably bent. The rays of a star that are seen at a short distance from the edge of the sun will, going along the sun, deviate so much from the original direction that they strike the eye of an observer as if they came in a straight line from a point somewhat further removed than the real position of the star from the sun. It is at that point that we think we see the star; so...", "...The crowd had assembled under my windows at the Albemarle Hotel, and I was obliged to go out on to the balcony several times to bow and to thank this public, which I had been told I should find cold and prejudiced against me. From the bottom of my heart I also thanked all my detractors and slanderers, as it was through them that I had had the pleasure of fighting, with the certainty of conquering. The victory was all the more enjoyable as I had not dared to hope for it. I gave <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> performances in New York. The plays were _Adrienne Lecouvreur_, _Froufrou_, _Hernani_, _La Dame aux Camelias_, _Le Sphinx_, and _L'Etrangere_. The average receipts were 20,342 francs for each performance, including _matinees_. The last performance was given on Saturday, December 4, as a _matinee_, for my company had to leave that night for Boston, and I had reserved the evening to go to Mr. Edison's at Menlo Park, where I had a reception worthy of fairyland.

The motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the surface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one night in the lunar month, each lasting three hundred and fifty-four and one-third hours.

The paper employs rat printers, and as they have been engaged in assorting and distributing this mass of pi, it is called rat pi in China, and the term is quite popular. When the editor underscores a word, the Chinese compositor charges $9 extra for italicizing it. This is nothing more than fair, for he may have to go all over the empire, and climb <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> flights of stairs to find the necessary italics. So it is much more economical in China to use body type mostly in setting up a paper, and the old journalist will avoid caps and italics, unless he is very wealthy.

The master of the ceremonies received us with great politeness and with much ceremony; he was habited in a robe of crimson, figured with velvet, having a silk scarf thrown over his shoulders, and wearing a turban; his teeth were of a deep black, owing to his excessive use of areca and phunam, and his lips and gums were of a livid hue. Scarcely were we seated, at a table set apart for our own use, in the midst of many hundred hungry native revellers, ere <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> dishes, composed chiefly of sweetmeats, (there not being a particle of meat or fish,) were upon the table. After tasting a little of each, to show that we were gratified with the _whole_ entertainment, and partaking of a cup of tea, we took our leave; areca was offered, as is customary, on our entry and departure. During the repast, four Javanese stepped out between the orchestra and danced for our amusement; their movements were slow, but very graceful, the head looking...", "...issue. Some were loyal to the Assembly and many favored warlike measures. It has been asserted that had not Forbes's Road been built in 1758 its building would have been postponed twenty years. Passing this interesting speculation, it is sure Braddock's defeat brought to Pennsylvania a terrible and bloody awakening; nothing can show this more strikingly than the fact that when Braddock's successor came, only three years later, the Pennsylvania Assembly quickly supported him by voting <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> hundred men for offensive service and appropriating half a million dollars for war. The change was not more striking than was the need for it.

And now, having passed over the salt and stubbly domain of pedagogics, what is the dominant impression gleaned from the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> Chopin studies?

Their variety is great, the aesthetic side is nowhere neglected for the purely mechanical, and in the most poetic of them stuff may be found for delicate fingers.

I have verified this over many water-courses, upon bridges, etc., and I am satisfied it is correct, at least for the latitude in which my experiments were made.

I employed an experienced well borer and had a two and one-half inch pipe driven into the ground at the exact point my switch indicated, and found water at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> feet exactly. I had the pipe driven down forty feet, and found that I had thirteen feet of water in it. I then had a windmill erected and a large tank. Up to the time of my leaving the road, the engines were supplied with the water, which, besides, proved to be of excellent quality for drinking. My well borer, who was a doubting Thomas, said he believed that he could get water at the same depth anywhere.

BAKER went further still in his experiments on paste-eels, for he kept the paste from which they had been taken, without moistening it in any way, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years, and at the end of that time the eels revived on being immersed in a drop of water. _If they had exhausted their lives all at once and without these intermissions, these Rotifera and paste-eels would not have lived beyond sixteen or eighteen consecutive days._ To remove all doubt as to the complete desiccation of the animalcules experimented on by SPALLANZANI and BAKER, M.

He again made a calculation and at last replied: \"By travelling hard, Excellency, you should reach Yakutsk, I think, in twenty-five to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> days.

All, however, except the black slave, were enlisted in the army before starting, so that they might be kept under regular discipline. In addition to these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> men there were seven soldiers and nine voyageurs who started only to go to the Mandan villages on the Missouri, where the party intended to spend the first winter.

She misprints Shakespeare and Wordsworth shamefully, thinks that Professor Saintsbury is dead, and, sparing only four pages for \"the lyric,\" devotes <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> to such forms as roundel, ballade, etc. Her book, we think, has been spoiled by haste; yet she has such enthusiasm and brightness as tempt us to regret that haste and to hope for better work.

It was therefore necessary to summon all Believers together every day, at the same hours fixed for the five prayers. How was the exact time of meeting to be determined?

This was but a bad beginning of the new life he was expected to lead under the renewed fortunes which his father was preparing for him. He had given his promissory note for the money at a week's date, and had been extremely angry with Captain Vignolles because that gentleman had, under the...", "...same time. As a matter of fact, the knowledge of Baranoff's enterprise and the energy with which it was being prosecuted did not come before the committee until October, 1794; and it was in that very month that the report of Mackenzie's journey reached them. The next few years were devoted to devising and considering schemes to counteract these two growing competitors--to oppose the further progress of the Russians on the one hand, and to combat the North-Westers on the other. For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years Baranoff continued to be the controlling mind of the new Russian trading enterprise. Shelekoff died in 1795; and his widow continued the business, and upon combining with the Milnikoff Company it increased gradually in wealth.

When this record of facts, this \"natural history,\" is completed, an attempt may then be made to discover, by a comparison of the various facts, the cause of the phenomena. Here it is of the utmost importance to bear in mind that all facts have not the same value. There are, as Bacon points out, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> species of facts, and he concludes that in any science where facts cannot be tested by experiment there can be no conclusive evidence. Thus it will be seen that Bacon's method was a system of specific rules.

Through her father she was a lineal descendant of the Rev. John Newton and Sir Isaac Newton. Her father was a revolutionary soldier. Her mother was Jane (Smith) Williamson. They believed that negroes had souls and therefore treated the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> slaves they had inherited like human beings. Her mother was fined in South Carolina, for teaching her slaves to read the Bible. Consequently, in 1804, in her early infancy, her parents emigrated to Adams county, Ohio, in order to be able to free their slaves and teach them to read the Word of God and write legibly. The story of Aunt Jane's life naturally falls into three divisions. I--PREPARATION FOR HER GREAT LIFE WORK. This covered forty years. She grew up in an...", "...death she found herself in the deepest financial distress and was compelled to appeal to the emperor for a small pension, which he granted. Her nobility of character can be seen also in the concert of her husband's works, which she arranged, and with such success that she paid all Mozart's debts, some three thousand gulden ($1,500). Thus she took the last stain from his memory. She also interested herself, like Mrs. Purcell, in the publication of her husband's compositions. She was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> when he died, and her interest in his honour, as well as the conspicuous motherliness she showed to the children he had left her, were all the more praiseworthy. Neimtschek, who published a biography of Mozart in 1798, emphasises her fidelity to \"our Raphael of Music,\" her grief still keen for him, and her devotion to the children he left fatherless and penniless.

Beneath the part marked off by the flagstaffs and sentinels, at a great depth in the chalk rock, were buried many thousand (the Brighton Herald said <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> thousand!) pounds of gunpowder, distributed in different chambers and galleries, one communicating with another by means of a platina wire.

The bank charges two per centum for two months, the factor two and a half, and thus, if the draft is at sixty days, he pays at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> per centum. If, however, he has no factor, he is obliged to get some friend who has one to make the arrangement to get his draft accepted. For this accommodation he pays his friend one and a half per cent., besides the two per cent. to the bank, and the two and a half per cent. to the acceptor; making, in this mode of arrangement, thirty-six per cent. which he pays before he can get out of the clutches of the bank for that time,...", "...a glory, like Mingrelia and Guria, of the past.

A block by Dalziel, after Clayton, on page 19, shows a good example of the white line, used horizontally, for the modelling of flesh, somewhat in the way, as Pannemaker employed it so effectively in many of Gustave Dore's illustrations years after. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> Birket Fosters are full of the special charm that his work possesses, and show once again how a great artist may employ a method, which, merely 'pretty' in inferior hands, has something of greatness when he touches it.

There was little to distinguish her from the other students except that she was exceedingly plainly dressed, and seemed forced to spend most of her spare time at work. Yes, there was one other difference. She was older than most of the girls--already thirty, and rich in experience. When not yet fifteen she had taught a country school in Pennsylvania. At twenty she was considered capable of managing an unusually turbulent crowd of boys and girls. When she was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> her father had died, leaving upon her very largely the care of her mother. At twenty-eight she already looked back upon a career of fourteen years as a teacher, of some work for Christ incidentally accomplished, but also upon a fading youth of wasted hopes and unfulfilled desires. Then came a great decision--not the first, but one of the most important that marked her long career. Her education was by no means complete, and at whatever cost she was determined to go to...", "...I loved him I wouldn't mind what he did--ever! Why don't I love him? There's something loveable.

Gyp too had seen the humours of her baby, of its queer little reddish pudge of a face, of its <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> black hairs, and the dribble at its almost invisible mouth; but she had also seen it as a miracle; she had felt it, and there surged up from her all the old revolt and more against his lack of consideration.

The pronoun \"I\" occurs <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> times in these fifteen verses and the Holy Spirit is not found once, whereas in the eighth chapter of Romans the pronoun \"I\" is found only twice in the whole chapter and the Holy Spirit appears constantly.

The number of minutes which the district teacher may give to each grade is fifty minutes; the consolidated teacher has one hundred and seventeen minutes per grade.

No teacher can do justice to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> classes per day, and an average recitation period of thirteen minutes is so short as to be almost unworthy of mention.

He said that the viceroys used to praise them and thank them for their exertions; that the house was then kept in the most perfect order, the principal officers wearing a uniform, etc. Hereupon another old gentleman took up the theme, and improved upon it; and told us, that, on one occasion, they had one million three hundred thousand dollars' worth of gold in the house; and described the visit of the vice-queen Yturriguary, who...", "...ball does no injury to the lad struck.

If you fasten a cord one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> feet four inches long straight out in the field, the place for second base is found. This done, take a rope or line one hundred and eighty feet long, fasten one end to the home plate and the other to second base; then draw the middle of the line at first to the right and then to the left, till it is tight. This will mark the places of first and third base. The place of the pitcher's box is fixed by measuring a line of fifty feet from home to second base. The pitcher's...", "...cornet of his company. His elder brother Thomas was very naturally a member of the House of Commons for Old Sarum, and later sat for Oakhampton. Another of Nature's little ironies here outcrops: Thomas, who was named for his illustrious grandfather--he of the crystallized carbon--didn't resemble his grandfather nearly so much as did his younger brother William. So Thomas with surprising good sense named his brother for a seat in the House of Commons from Old Sarum. William was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age when he began his official career, but he seemed one who had leaped into life full-armed. He absorbed knowledge on every hand. Demosthenes was his idol, and he, too, declaimed by the seashore with his mouth full of pebbles.

We remarked in the harbour several sloops, and on shore some brick stores, five stories high.

A very low island in the middle of the stream between the two places rendered this communication somewhat difficult at first, as vessels were obliged to...", "...Federal Government, the separate governments of each State, and many other elective offices, there are about two thousand five hundred elections of different descriptions every year; and if I were to add the civic elections, which are equally political, I do not know what amount they would arrive at. In this country we have on an average about two hundred elections per annum, so that, in America, for thirteen millions, they have two thousand five hundred elections, and in England for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> millions, two hundred, on the average, during the year. It must, however, be admitted, that the major portion of these elections in the United States pass off quietly, probably from the comparative want of interest excited by them, and the continual repetition which takes place; but when the important elections are in progress the case is very different; the excitement then becomes universal; the coming election is the theme of every tongue, the all-engrossing topic,...", "...holding a seance in her house, and several persons present, a great scratching was heard in a neighboring closet.

The house now occupied by Powers was formerly a convent, and I suppose these were the spirits of all the wicked monks that had ever inhabited it; at least, I hope that there were not such a number of damnable sinners extant at any one time.

As far as George could see she was an extremely pretty girl, small and dainty, with a proud little tilt to her head and the jaunty walk that spoke of perfect health. She was, in fact, precisely the sort of girl that George felt he could love with all the stored-up devotion of an old buffer of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> who had squandered none of his rich nature in foolish flirtations. He had just begun to weave a rose-tinted romance about their two selves, when a cold reaction set in.

After his separation from her, he consoled himself by an intrigue with Madame de Charriere--a Dutch lady, married to a Switzer, residing at Colombier, near Neuchatel, and known as the authoress of several sentimental novels. It was an affair that could hardly have lasted long in any case, seeing that the lady was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years older than her lover. As a matter of fact it came to a quick end when the lover met Madame de Stael. The details of that meeting are curious. Being at Lausanne, Benjamin Constant set out to call on Madame de Stael at Coppet. His relatives already knew, and he was interested to make her acquaintance. It happened that he met Madame de Stael on the road, driving from Coppet to Lausanne. He stopped the carriage and introduced himself. She invited him to get in, and...", "...for such a close association. England already possesses a famous subaqueous tunnel in that known as the Severn tunnel under the river of that name. It is four and a half miles long, although it was built largely through rock. Water gave much trouble in its construction which occupied thirteen years from 1873 to 1886. Pumps were employed to raise the water through a side heading connecting with a shaft twenty-nine feet in diameter. The greatest amount of water raised concurrently was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> million gallons in twenty-four hours but the pumps had a capacity of sixty-six million gallons for the same time. The greatest tunnel in Europe is the Simplon which connects Switzerland with Italy under the Simplon Pass in the Alps.

About one-third of the verse, for instance, is taken from Euripides. Dr. Brambs, of Leipsic, has proved that this \"Christ's Passion\" dates from the tenth, not the fourth century. It is not difficult to see how the early Christian dramas could have developed from the elaborate liturgical presentations of such events as the nativity, the annunciation, and the crucifixion. Indeed there are extant some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> or twenty-eight liturgical arrangements which are purely dramatic in form and style. Their musical part was provided by the old Latin hymns. In one of these dramas, \"The Shepherds,\" occur passages used in Handel's oratorios, such as \"Glory to God in the highest,\" and \"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son.\" It was a natural outcome of the social condition of the era that in the course of time these dramas, enacted frequently in the open air, forced to...", "...there were the three gifts of charioteering on the charioteer that day, the leap over ----, and the straight ----, and the ----.

Anyone who looks over these republications will realize at once that had Leonardo written his text-book of anatomy and illustrated it with his own drawings, it would have been an epoch-making landmark in the history of anatomy and of medicine. It was not until a quarter of a century after the artist's death that Vesalius, but five years old when Leonardo died, published his great anatomical text-book. At the time Vesalius was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years of age, but his work revolutionized anatomy and he is rightly greeted as the father of modern anatomy. Had Vesalius had the opportunity to consult Leonardo's work, his own would have been greatly facilitated. It was not merely anatomy for art purposes but for all purposes, scientific as well as artistic, that Leonardo with characteristic thoroughness had studied. There are studies of his in zoology, made evidently for the sake of his work in sculpture, that...", "...of all mensuration, that it is only by means of them that we can form any estimate of some of the ancient distances. For example, the length of a degree on the Earth's surface, as determined by the Arabian astronomers shortly after the death of Haroun-al-Raschid, was fifty-six of their miles. We know nothing of their mile further than that it was 4000 cubits; and whether these were sacred cubits or common cubits, would remain doubtful, but that the length of the cubit is given as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> inches, and each inch defined as the thickness of six barley-grains. Thus one of the earliest measurements of a degree comes down to us in barley-grains. Not only did organic lengths furnish those approximate measures which satisfied men's needs in ruder ages, but they furnished also the standard measures required in later times. One instance occurs in our own history. To remedy the irregularities then prevailing, Henry I. commanded that the ulna, or ancient ell, which...", "...together with a million to be raised by loans or exchequer bills, at three per cent, interest; one million five hundred thousand pounds, to be raised by the sale of redeemable annuities at three and a half per cent., and five hundred thousand pounds to be raised by a lottery, at three per cent.

Yet there seems to be a very simple interpretation of their symbology; the circle, through all antiquity, stood for the circling year, which ever returns to its point of departure, spring repeating spring, summer answering to summer, winter with its icy winds only the return of former winters: the circling year and its landmarks, whether four seasons, or twelve months, or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> lunar mansions, through one of which the wandering moon passes in a day. We should thus have circles of twelve or twenty-seven stones, or four outlying stones at equal distances, for the four seasons, the regents of the year.

Soon after that date his father, having gained a modest fortune in the linen business, retired to Binfield, on the fringe of Windsor Forest.

A clue to his activity is furnished in the fact that in 1872 he had applied for thirty-eight patents in the class of telegraphy, and twenty-five in 1873; several of these being for duplex methods, on which he had experimented. The earlier apparatus had been built several years prior to this, as shown by a curious little item of news that appeared in the Telegrapher of January 30, 1869: \"T. A.

On the average, the shields were shoved by from ten to twelve of the bottom jacks, with a pressure of about 4,000 lb. per sq. in. The jacks had 9-in. plungers, which made the average total force required to shove the shield 2,800,000 lb.

Indeed, the late Lord Kelvin is said to have held to the last that it was amply sufficient to account for the underground heat of the earth, the heat of the sun, and that of all the stars in the universe.

The force of gravity at the sun's surface is, indeed, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> times that at the surface of our globe. The earth's atmosphere appears to absorb about one-half of the radiations which come to us from the sun. This absorptive effect is very noticeable when the solar orb is low down in our sky, for its light and heat are then clearly much reduced. Of the light rays, the blue ones are the most easily absorbed in this way; which explains why the sun looks red when near the horizon.

Watt had claimed such an engine in his patent <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years before, but had failed to carry it into practice. Hornblower had tried something like it in his double-cylinder expansion engine, but he did not use high-pressure steam, and consequently also failed.

The Romans, victorious at the naval battles of Mylae (Melazzo) and Ecnomus (260 and 256), sent M. Atilius Regulus with an army to Africa. But the Carthaginians, by the help of the Spartan Xanthippus, were successful, and Regulus was captured.

Each of these columns was a gift from a king.

The look-out man reported a ship on the port side, and in a few minutes two other vessels suddenly appeared. One of them afterwards proved to be the French second-class cruiser Arethuse; the others were the protected cruiser Chanzy and a torpedo-destroyer. The Caledonia could not possibly get past the French in the direction of Malta, for the destroyer was much faster and capable of making, at full speed, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> knots an hour. The captain had no choice; he accordingly turned round, and began to make for Alexandria again. While the great vessel was wheeling round, those on board perceived that the French had seen her and had started in pursuit. Meanwhile the Forbin had approached considerably nearer and was attempting to cut off the Caledonia. The captain accordingly gave orders to steer further south.

Having been the confidant of both parties, and an involuntary actor in those scenes, now that <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years have passed since they occurred what motive can induce me to disguise the truth in any respect? Madame Louis Bonaparte was enceinte. Josephine, although she tenderly loved her children, did not seem to behold the approaching event which the situation of her daughter indicated with the interest natural to the heart of a mother. She had long been aware of the calumnious reports circulated respecting the supposed connection between Hortense and the First Consul,...", "...Your Lordships will see soon how this ended.

Yet out of the thirty-three sail of the line, he lost eighteen to an enemy that numbered only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> sail; and that fact alone absolves him from the charge of cowardice in declining to face Cornwallis and Calder in July with ships that were cumbered with sick and badly needed refitting.

To refute this error it is merely needful to remind the reader that all immediate fear of invasion was over, when, at the close of August, Napoleon wheeled the Grand Army against Austria.

The battle was obstinately disputed by both armies; its fury cost the Imperialists twenty thousand men, eight thousand of whom were taken, with four generals. They lost <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> pair of colors and fifty cannon. Marshal Daun was wounded at the commencement of the battle.

This strengthened the belief they had already formed, that on account of its <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> and a half degrees inclination the changes in temperature on Mars must be great and sudden.

The symptoms came on almost immediately, she was very sick, and was attacked by a menorrhagia.

The Frenchman's wheel was shot away, and, the mizzenmast going overboard at the same time, the _Cleopatre_ yielded to the impulse of her forward sails, turned sharp round to the right, and ran perpendicularly into the _Nymphe_. The British boarded her, fixed in this disadvantageous position, fought their way aft, and, although the French crew was numerically superior, in ten minutes hauled down the colors. In this brief hour they had lost twenty-three killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> wounded, the enemy sixty-three killed and wounded, out of ships' companies numbering respectively two hundred and forty and three hundred and twenty. This was the first decisive frigate action of the War of the French Revolution, and in consequence great was the enthusiasm aroused.

Sixty-one of Harrison's officers and men were killed or mortally wounded; one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> others suffered serious injury. The Governor himself probably owed his life to the circumstance that in the confusion he mounted a bay horse instead of his own white stallion, whose rider was shot early in the contest.

After we had been in the moon about forty eight hours, the sun had sunk below the horizon, and the long twilight of the Lunarians had begun.

The sun is above the horizon nearly a fortnight, and below it as long; of course the day here is equal to about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of ours. The earth answers the same purpose to half the inhabitants of the moon, that the moon does to the inhabitants of the earth. The face of the latter, however, is more than twelve times as large, and it has not the same silvery appearance as the moon, but is rather of a dingy pink hue, like that of her iron when beginning to lose its red heat.

But is wasn't thinking about such grim matters that actually threw Frank Nelsen--that got him truly mixed up. In Parnay's attack, ten men and two women had been killed. There were also <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> injured. Such facts he could accept--they didn't disturb him too much, either. Yet there was a curious sort of straw that broke the camel's back, one might have said. The incident took place quite a while after the assault.

Indeed, women have taken more than their due proportion of the prizes, honors, and fellowships which have been accessible to them on the same terms as to men. Their resort to institutions of higher learning has increased far more than that of men. In 1872 the total number of college students in each million of population was 590. Last year it had risen to 1270, much more than doubling in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years. During this time the number of men had risen from 540 to 947, or had not quite doubled. The women rose from 50 in 1872 to 323 in 1899, having increased their former proportional number more than six times, and this advance has also been maintained in graduate and professional schools. The immensity of the change which the last century has wrought in women's education may best be seen by setting side by side the conditions at its beginning and at its close. In 1800...", "...with Mr. Scaley's fraternity in his bachelor days, and was, besides, very far from being taken by surprise on the present agitating occasion, he merely shrugged his shoulders, thrust his hands down to the bottom of his pockets, elevated his eyebrows, whistled a bar or two, swore an oath or two, and, sitting astride upon a chair, put the best face upon the matter with great composure and decency.

Their perseverance was later rewarded in 1904 by a flight of three miles in five minutes and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> seconds. The year following a flight of 24.20 miles was made in thirty-eight minutes, thirteen seconds, at heights of seventy-five to one hundred feet. These attracted small attention.

He had thought Menko ill in London; but the latter appeared before him, and the day was decidedly a happy one. \"How happy you make me, my dear fellow!\" he said to him in a tone of affection which was almost paternal.

Beneath a polished manner, the evidence of an imperious temperament appeared in the slightest glance, the least gesture, of this handsome fellow of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> or twenty-eight years. Seeing him pass by, one could easily imagine him with his fashionable clothes cast aside, and, clad in the uniform of the Hungarian hussars, with closely shaven chin, and moustaches brushed fiercely upward, manoeuvring his horse on the Prater with supple grace and nerves like steel.

He got converted and had the grit to say so. Being a member of the Legislature, he had a committee of investigation appointed. Now, in order that you may understand the difference, you must know that in the Northern penitentiaries the average annual death rate is one per cent.; that is, of one thousand convicts, ten will die in a year, on the average. That low death rate is because we are civilized, because we do not kill; but in the Georgia penitentiary it was as high as fifteen, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> and forty-seven per cent., at a time when there was no typhoid or yellow fever, or epidemic of any kind. They died for four months at a rate of ten per cent, per month. They crowded the convicts in together, regardless of sex. They treated them precisely as wild beasts, and many of them were shot down.

If the owners had kept the land, their descendants to-day could have sold it for a sum that would represent a handsome fortune, as evidenced by the fact that a plot of ground of the same size, on which Thorney House stood, in Kensington Gore was sold in 1898 for L100,000.

But it is important to bear in mind that their powers in this direction are limited; for it is manifest that a mountain stream is a much more powerful agent, and will deepen its little valley much more rapidly, than a cumbrous, slow-moving glacier, advancing at the rate of a few inches a day. It has been found by careful measurements that the Mer de Glace of Chamouni moves during summer and autumn at the average daily rate of twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> inches in the centre, and thirteen to nineteen and one half inches near the side, where friction somewhat impedes its course. This seems very slow compared to the rapid movement of a mountain stream; but then, a glacier partly makes up for this by its great weight.

Gradually it extended its influence until in 1672 the priests reported 300,000 baptized Chinese, including children. In the nineteenth century, the growth of the Roman Church was rapid. It is now strongly entrenched in all the provinces, and in most of the leading cities its power is great. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> bishops and about six hundred foreign priests. The number of communicants is variously estimated, but in 1897 the Vicar Apostolic of Che-kiang, though admitting that he could not secure accurate statistics, estimated the Roman Catholic population at 750,000.

Now, however, something seemed to say that the end was near, as old Teleda, the veteran of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> engagements, stood as if on parade, directing the attack. His men sank to mother earth singly and in mangled heaps, but he had no eye for their dead or ear for the moaning of their wounded; 203 was the game, and anything smaller, such as noting the mutilated forms upon the blood-drenched sands in the valley, was beneath contempt.

In consideration for which he departed with a sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> pounds sixteen shillings in his trousers pockets. At his rooms in Golden Square he settled his account with the landlady, a luxury that reduced his wealth by a matter of nineteen pounds. Of the eight pounds sixteen shillings remaining, five guineas were placed on one side for the tobacconist who had supplied him with Gold Flake and the margin transferred to another pocket for the purpose of one final engagement with the habit of high living.

There are about one hundred and fifty land birds known from the island of Madagascar, of which a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> are peculiar; and about half of these peculiar species belong to peculiar genera, many of which are extremely isolated, so that it is often difficult to class them in any of the recognised families, or to determine their affinities to any living birds.[100] Among the other moiety, {423} belonging to known genera, we find fifteen which have undoubted African affinities, while five or six are as decidedly Oriental, the genera or nearest allied species being found in India or...", "...captures in September were Norfolk (seven), Essex (one), Lincoln (one).

This well was said to be a vast subterraneous structure, adorned with sculptured figures, an immense table of polished stone, and a plaza with columns supporting a vaulted roof, and it was said to have a subterraneous road, which led to the village of Mani, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> miles distant.

Proper measures were taken to remedy the confusion created by his long intrusion, and a profession of faith was published, as well as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> disciplinary canons. Photius was invited to appear in person; but he refused, denying the competency of the synod to try him. To say the least, it was as competent to try him as the one he had called to try Ignatius.

In August, 1813, he was offered the position of poet-laureate, which he declined. But he was destined to add to his already great reputation as a poet, by a success equally as great in the realms of prose fiction. In 1814 appeared _Waverley_, published anonymously, and its success was enormous. It was quickly followed by the other volumes of the \"Great Unknown,\" as Scott was now designated, amounting in all to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> volumes. In 1820 he was created a baronet and his degree of success had been unparalleled and had raised him to apparent affluence, but, in 1826, by the failure of two publishing houses with which he was connected, he was reduced to bankruptcy. He set himself resolutely to redeem himself from the load of debt (\u00a3147,000) but, although successful, his faculties gave way before the enormous mental toil to which they were subjected.

His spies having reconnoitered it, he divided his men into three companies, the largest portion of which he led himself. The attack was made at the break of day. The English made a stout resistance, but were unable to withstand the well-directed fire of the assailants. Thirty of the bravest of the inhabitants were cut to pieces; the remainder, amounting to fifty-four, were made prisoners. The English had <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> houses reduced to ashes, and two thousand domestic animals perished in the barns that had been burned. The third party, which was fitted out from Quebec by the directions of Frontenac, made an attack upon _Casco_, in Maine. This was commanded by M. de Portneuf.

At peace now with the rest of Europe he had no need of so many troops, even although the war Against the Empire had continued; fortunately, however it did not. Negotiations were set on foot, and on the 6th of March of the following year, 1714, after much debate, they ended successfully. On that day, in fact, peace was signed at Rastadt. It was shortly afterwards published at Paris, a Te Deum sung, and bonfires lighted at night; a grand collation was given...", "...four hundred years of Han supremacy the march of civilization went steadily forward. Paper and ink were invented, and also the camel's-hair brush, both of which gave a great impetus to the arts of writing and painting, the latter being still in a very elementary stage.

The twenty-seven months of mourning for parents--nominally three years, as is now again the rule--was reduced to a more manageable period of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> days.

The appointment caused great surprise to men of all parties, on account of the comparative youth of the incumbent, and his limited experience of practice at the bar.

Mr. Browning, while staying at Pornic with his family, saw the gipsy woman who suggested to him the idea of Fifine.

There...", "...and all you have to do is to pay them a commission and look pleasant. The customs duty is ten per cent. on everything you have, and the commission is five per cent. But in a hot climate, where one is apt to feel lazy, the price is cheap. Thanks to the governor, our party of four was invited to go to Nairobi on his special train. It left Mombasa on the morning of the nineteenth of September, and at once began to climb toward the plateau on which Nairobi is situated, three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> miles away. We had dreaded the railway ride through the lowlands along the coast, for that district has a bad reputation for fever and all such ills. But again we were pleasantly disappointed. The country was beautiful and interesting, and at four o'clock in the afternoon we arrived at Voi, a spot that is synonymous with human ailments. It is one of the famous ill health resorts of Africa, but on this occasion it was on its good behavior. We stopped four hours, inspected...", "...embarrassment of rebelling against the Government represented by a man against whom no charge of self-interest or lack of patriotism could be hurled. [Illustration: Earl of Clarendon] One friend of O'Connell was succeeded by another, and George William Frederick Villiers, fourth Earl of Clarendon, was sworn in as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland shortly after Lord Bessborough's death. It was understood that he was to be the last Viceroy of Ireland. He was then forty-seven years of age, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of which {249} had been spent in the service of the country. At twenty he was an attache to the British Embassy at St. Petersburg; from 1827 to 1829 a commissionership of Customs took him to Ireland, where he studied the Irish question so effectively that the Lord-Lieutenant, the Marquis of Anglesey, was glad to have his advice. When he left Madrid, the Spanish Government struck a medal in his honour as a tribute to his successful occupancy of an embassy by no means the...", "...a circular track, on which elderly children may take a ride round and round in a self-moving chair; an amusement a step above the old merry-go-round in gravity and scientific pretension. But for its vicinity to some tracts of beautiful scenery, Saratoga must be a very dull place to persons shaken out of their domestic habits, and deprived of their usual occupations; and the beauties of the scenery must be sought, Saratoga Lake lying three miles, Glen's Falls eighteen, and Lake George <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> miles from the Springs. At dinner Mr. R., the gentleman of our party, announced to us that he had been able to engage a pretty double gig, with a pair of brisk ponies, for ourselves, and a light cart for our luggage. The day was very cold for an open carriage; but it was not improbable that, before twenty-four hours were over, we might be panting with heat; and it was well to be provided with a carriage in which we might most easily explore the lake scenery if we should...", "...man, one to whom success would have been very pleasant. He was damaged, and confirmed in oddity, by the want of it. He missed it because of what first started him in oddity--that is to say, an unfortunate childhood. \"The subject of this memoir,\" so Butler once suggested that his biography ought to begin, \"was the son of rich but dishonest parents.\" Dishonest they may have been: respectable they certainly were. Dr. Butler, the first distinguished member of the family, was for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years headmaster of Shrewsbury, a man with all the attributes of the great schoolmasters of the early nineteenth century, an imposing figure, who, towards the end of his life, became Bishop of Lichfield. His son was not so distinguished. His sole claim to be remembered, if his canonry be disregarded, is the fact that somehow or other he became the father of Samuel Butler. There is much detail, in Mr. Festing Jones's enormous book, on Butler's early life and his relation to...", "...and were united, whether more saw fit to join or not. Meanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had given her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat of anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the convention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events finally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good judgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority of thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> votes in favor of ratification. The great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and Rhode Island, had ratified. \"The sloop Anarchy,\" wrote an ebullient journalist, \"when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks.\" =The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to fill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the importunities of friends, he...", "...easterly along the township line between townships ten (10) and eleven (11) south to the southeast corner of township ten (10) south, range twenty-five (25) east; thence southerly along the unsurveyed and surveyed range line between ranges twenty-five (25) and twenty-six (26) east to the southwest corner of township twelve (12) south, range twenty-six (26) east; thence easterly along the third (3d) standard parallel south to the northwest corner of township thirteen (13) south, range <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> (27) east; thence southerly along the range line between ranges twenty-six (26) and twenty-seven (27) east to the southwest corner of township thirteen (13) south, range twenty-seven (27) east; thence easterly along the township line between townships thirteen (13) and fourteen (14) south to the southeast corner of township thirteen (13) south, range twenty-seven (27) east; thence northerly along the boundary line of \"General Grant National Park\" to the northwest corner,...", "...wonder that this fur-clad figure was thought by the amazed M'Clure to be an Eskimo, a mistake aided by the wild gesticulations and loud, unintelligible shouts of a man whose face was as black as ebony. Of Pim's coming Dr. Armstrong of the _Investigator_ says: \"No words could express the feelings of heart-felt gladness which all experienced at this unlooked-for, this most providential arrival.\" Over the rough, winding trails of the arctic highway, Pim had travelled four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> miles from ship to ship, and made a journey that will ever live in polar annals as fraught with vital interests beyond those of any other single sledge trip. Of Pim's work a fellow-officer, McDougal, wrote: \"Each member of our little community must have felt his heart glow to reflect that he formed one of the little band whose undertakings in the cause of humanity had been crowned with such success.\" Thus it happened that through the heroic energy and persistent...", "...certainly, the Queen was never found wanting in those days. In \"natural curiosity\" she was a veritable daughter of Eve, and granddaughter of George the Third. She was interested not only in the scientific discoveries, new mechanical inventions, and agricultural improvements which so interested her husband, but in odd varieties of animals and human creatures. She accepted with pleasure the gift of a Liliputian horse, supposed to be the smallest in the world--over five years old, and only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> and a half inches high--brought from Java, by a sea-captain, who used to take the gallant steed under his arm, and run down-stairs with him; and she very graciously received and was immensely entertained with the distinguished young American, who should have been the Alexander of that Bucephalus--General Tom Thumb. This little _lusus natur\u00e6_, under the masterly management of Mr. Barnum, had made a great sensation in London--which, after the Queen had summoned him two or...", "...jury refused to convict, and the prisoners were discharged. The Government was compelled to act; and on January 24th Mr. Forster moved for leave to bring in a bill for the better protection of person and property in Ireland. After an unprecedented obstruction on the part of the Irish members, and after a continuous sitting of forty-one hours, the Speaker summarily closed the debate, and the bill, commonly known as the Coercion Bill, passed the first reading on February 2nd. On the 3rd, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> of the Irish members were suspended; and the bill, having passed through the succeeding stages, finally became law on March 2nd. * * * * * _From M. B. St.-Hilaire_ _Paris, February 6th_.--I am happy in your approval, and permit me to add that I am proud of it. I know the value and sincerity of your judgements. You have a long experience of politics, and every reason not to be deceived even by the most obscure complications. There was...", "...on the first floor for apartments remoter from the centre of the king's life. Louis continued to receive her in public, and publicly paid her visits which deceived careless observers; but practised eyes perceived the profound change which had taken place beneath these external appearances. Madame de Sevigne wrote to her daughter that Louis treated Madame de Montespan with harshness; Bussy-Rabutin wrote that he treated her with scorn. Thus began the expiatory martyrdom which lasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-seven</span> years. On March 15, 1691, Madame de Montespan retired to Paris, going into the community of St. Joseph which she had founded. Louis granted her a right royal pension, 10,000 pistoles--L20,000 of to-day--a month; but when, in 1692, the double marriage of Madame de Montespan's children, Mademoiselle de Blois and the Duke de Maine, was celebrated with the Duke de Chartres and Mademoiselle de Charolais, Louis did not allow their mother to appear at the ceremony or to sign..."]
