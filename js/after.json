But even yet the work for the Riverlawns was not all over.

The fighting was still on, when Deck's battalion found itself in a little gulch, pursuing a small body of Confederates that had been uncovered ten minutes before.

Trite Phrases.=--Interest requires one also to seek originality of expression, to avoid trite phrases and hackneyed words. Embalmed meats and kyanized sentences are never good. Yet one of the most difficult acquirements in reporting is the ability to find day after day a new way to tell of some obscure person dying of pneumonia or heart disease. Only reporters who have fought and overcome the arctic drowsiness of trite phraseology know the difficulty of fighting on day <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> day, seeking a new, a different way to tell the same old story of suicide or marriage or theft or drowning. Yet one is no longer permitted to say that the bridegroom wore the conventional black, or the bride was elegantly gowned, or the bride's mother presided at the punch bowl, or the assembled guests tripped the light fantastic. The reporter must find new words for everything and must tell all with the same zest and the same sparkling freshness of expression with which he wrote...", "...That thou may'st freely live to be my heir. _Itha._ Why, master, will you poison her with a mess of rice porridge? that will preserve life, make her round and plump, and batten more than you are aware. _Bar._ I, but, Ithamore, seest thou this?

We subjoin, however, a few hints and suggestions of practical value, together with some perfected ideas in the shape of traps, by which the average rat may be easily outwitted and led to his destruction.

It also takes care of itself, requires no re-baiting or setting <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> once put in working order, and is sure death to its prisoners.

Next dampen a piece of very thick paper, and stretch it over the top of the barrel, tying it securely below the upper hoops. When the paper dries it will become thoroughly flat and tightened. Its surface should then be strewn with bits of cheese, etc., and the barrel so placed [Page 126] that the rats may jump upon it...", "...I am not competent to keep a set of books, or clerk anywhere; but,\" I said, \"I will go back if I do starve.\" So I wrote to my patient wife: \"I have lost every cent I had in the world, I have got to work one week longer to make enough money to come home on, and I am coming.

Slavery was not uncommon then, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Douglass, in his Summary, vol. i. page 351, states, that in 1735, about seven years before Peter's death, the whole number of whites, of 16 years and upwards, in the Province, was 35,427; and of negroes, 2600. Feb. 3, 1738. Peter Faneuil writes thus, to Peter Buckley--\"Herewith you have invoice of six hogsheads fish and eight barrells of alewives, amounting to L75.9.2, which, when you arrive at...", "...hammocks slung to the roof, from each of which a cord was hung. In these were placed the babies, and if any one became wakeful during the night and cried, she would pull the string and set its hammock swinging, and soon the little one was slumbering again. Sometimes she had to look after half a dozen or more at once, and two or three hammocks would be going at the same time. With many she had a hard struggle, but never grudged any trouble to make them well. She would come home late <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a long day's tramp in the forest, tired and hungry and sleepy, and send Janie to bed and stay up herself and tend the sick and suffering ones. You can fancy her there alone in the mud-house in the forest in the quiet hours of the night, bending over a wasted form, watching the pain in its eyes with tears in her own, giving it medicine, soothing it, and seeking to make it comfy, and beside her the pale dark shape of Death, with its grim smile, waiting for another victim. Ma...", "...he was introduced to Liston and Elliston, each of whom received tokens of his liking. The first was the subject of an amusing fictitious biography. In Lamb's words, it was \"a lying life of Liston,\" uncontaminated by a particle of truth. Munden, he says, had faces innumerable; Liston had only one; \"but what a face!\" he adds, admitting it to be beyond all vain description. Perhaps this subject of universal laughter and admiration never received such a compliment, except from Hazlitt, who, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> commenting on Hogarth's excellences, his invention, his character, his satire, &c., concludes by saying, \"I have never seen anything in the expression of comic humor equal to Hogarth's humor, except Liston's face.\" In the course of time, official labor becomes tiresome, and the India House clerk grows splenetic.

Rarer even than the first Walton is the first edition of Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's Progress,' 1678; Southey, writing in 1830, declared that the date of the first publication of this work was at that time unknown, since no copy could be traced. Not long <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> this an example--still in possession of Capt.

There were a number of oblong huts, but one seemed to have been occupied by more than one family, as it was divided into stalls, by great slabs of granite set up on edge, and in front of each stall was a hearth on the soil, and the soil burnt brick-red from heat. The pottery found strewn about was all wheel-turned, but early and rude, and no trace of glass could be found.

Here I met Elisha Bennett and told him my story. He said he could sell me a yoke of oxen. He had a yoke in J.A. Philipps' team and was going to take them out. He said nothing in particular as to price. I said that I wanted to see Mr. Philipps and talk with him about the matter, for he had said Bennett should not have the cattle.

That is why, when one asks if a thing is possible or necessary, and brings in the consideration of what God wills or chooses, one alters the issue.

And then, when Mercy was confiding to Prudence all about her possible husbands, she said that they...", "...a part of the Rukchin valley in descending from the Lachalang pass towards the salt lake. As it may fairly be inferred that the lake was quite fresh at the time when it was inhabited by _Lymnaeae_ and _Cyclades_, it is satisfactory to know that so very small an increase of the height of the surface of the water, as about 150 feet, would be sufficient to admit of its discharging its waters along the course of an open valley into one of the tributaries of the Zanskar river. Our road, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> passing the ravine on the left, along which I suppose the discharge of the lake at its original level to have been effected, turned still more towards the north, and ascending an open valley to the right, crossed a low _col_, or pass, and descended into a small basin surrounded by hills, which was evidently at some former period the bed of a small lake, for it was filled with pure fine clay, in which, however, I could not observe any shells.

It seemed, however, to him just as if he were flying away. At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down. The tailor, more dead than alive, required a longer time than that to come to himself. When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock, that it sprang open. Flames of fire shot forth, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight. The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again.

ROGERS,--The billiard table is better than the doctors. It is driving out the heartburn in a most promising way. I have a billiardist on the premises, and I walk not less than ten miles every day with the cue in my hand. And the walking is not the whole of the exercise, nor the most health-giving part of it, I think. Through the multitude of the positions and attitudes it brings into play every muscle in the body and exercises them all. The games begin right <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> luncheon, daily, and continue until midnight, with 2 hours' intermission for dinner and music. And so it is 9 hours' exercise per day, and 10 or 12 on Sunday. Yesterday and last night it was 12--and I slept until 8 this morning without waking.

Take the tube, behold for yourselves the miserable state she is in.' Prince Ali took the tube out of Prince Houssain's hand and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> he had looked, presented it to Prince Ahmed. When Prince Ahmed saw that the Princess Nouronnihar's end was so near, he addressed himself to his two brothers, and said, 'Princes, the Princess Nouronnihar, the object of all our vows, is indeed at death's door; but provided we make haste and lose no time, we may preserve her life.' Then he took out the artificial apple, and showing it to the princes his brothers, said to them, 'This apple which you see here cost as much as either...", "...whom he afterwards deposed, and recognised Honorius again. At last he took Rome by storm on the 24th August, 410. The city was completely plundered, but the lives of the people spared. He withdrew to Lower Italy and soon died. His brother-in-law and successor, Ataulf, was first minded entirely to destroy the Roman empire, but afterwards to restore it by Gothic aid. In the end he went to Gaul, conquered Narbonne, Toulouse, and Bordeaux, and afterwards Barcelona. His half-brother Wallia, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> reducing the Alans and driving back the Sueves and Vandals, planted his seat in Toulouse, which became, in 415, the capital of his Aquitanean kingdom, Gothia or Septimania. Gaul, in which several Roman commanders assumed the imperial title, was overrun in the years from 406 to 416 by various peoples, whom the two opposing sides called in: by Burgundians, Franks, Alemans, Vandals, Quades, Alans, Gepids, Herules. The Alans, Sueves, Vandals, and Visigoths, at the same time, went to...", "...party, and he thus found himself at liberty to take the road again and retire without apprehension. In Horse Shoe's reckoning, it was a matter of great importance that he should obtain the most accurate information regarding the troop that he had just encountered; and his present purpose was, accordingly, to post himself in a secure position upon the rock and there maintain a close watch upon the party as they rode beneath it. The brook was gained, the ford passed, and the sergeant, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> riding a short circuit towards the rear of the little promontory, dismounted from his horse, which he secured in the depths of the wood, and then clambered to the top of the precipice, where he had barely time to conceal himself amongst the crags and the thick shrubbery that shot up above them, before the headmost files of the cavalry appeared descending the opposite hill.

He says: \"A great deal more depends upon the maintenance of speed after the ball is struck than is commonly supposed. This part of the stroke is known as the follow-through, and plays a very important part in the length of the drive as in straightness.\" Mr. Travis evidently does not perfectly realise that the follow-through is of no importance whatever except as the natural result of the correctly played first part of the stroke, and the maintenance of speed <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the ball has been struck is of no importance provided that the first portion of the stroke has been properly executed and at a sufficient pace. The only importance of the maintenance of speed in any way whatever is that this indicates that the first half has been correctly performed.

A ball being hit slightly to the right of its centre would not necessarily produce a slice, although it would probably...", "...But, you see, I did make it.\" \"Yes, but I don't think Mr Rogers could refuse to cancel it.

An open attack by the Autocrat and his minions would certainly consolidate it; a prolongation of Louis Napoleon's power (no longer probable) would have the same effect.

To obtain that aid, \"the Prince\" must secretly swear that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> four years more he will turn France over to Henry V.; this promise only the last extreme of desperation could extort from him, and then to no purpose, since he could not fulfill it and the Legitimists could not trust him.

We have seen (above, p. 8) how the evidence which Dodge adduces to disprove the hypothesis of anaesthesia is not conclusive, since, although an image imprinted on the retina during its movement was seen, yet nothing showed that it was seen before the eye had come to rest. Having convinced himself that there is <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> all no anaesthesia, Dodge devised a very ingenious attachment for a perimeter 'to determine just what is seen during the eye-movement.'[18] The eye was made to move through a known arc, and during its movement to pass by a very narrow slit. Behind this slit was an illuminated field which stimulated the retina. And since only during its movement was the pupil opposite the slit, so only during the movement could the stimulation be given.

All this power and admiration was very important to her, though she felt the insufficiency of mere worldly prosperity. \"Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain,\" were words that very nearly fitted her state of mind.

It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone. This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room. When he had...", "...shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 17:3 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace. 17:4 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. 17:5 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. 17:6 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> his saying? if not; speak thou. 17:7 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time. 17:8 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. 17:9 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be...", "...in December of 1896, by a force of the Guardia Civile, the corps d'elite of the Spanish army, and defended himself when they tried to capture him, wounding three of them with his machete.

He therefore sent his servant Bedr to the chiefs of the Syrian party in Spain, among whom many were freedmen of the Omeyyads and were thus bound by the Arab code of honour to succour any relation of their former patrons. Bedr found these chiefs willing to receive the young prince, and, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> some negotiation with the hostile factions, the support of the men from the Yemen was also promised. Upon this Bedr returned to Africa.

Hugo possessed one valuable piece of landed property, a plot of ground bought by him for 337,365 francs in the Avenue which bears his name. It is covered with trees, which surround a bright patch of lawn, and throw deep shadows over the ground, grateful to the eyes of those accustomed to the dusty streets of Paris. It says not a little for his vigour and apparent hold upon life, that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> he had passed his eighty-second year he intended to superintend the erection of his new house, which was to be built entirely from his own designs. A large portion of Hugo's fortune--which was estimated altogether at about four million francs--was invested in Belgian National Bank shares, English Consols, and French Rentes. For several years before his death Victor Hugo had renounced public speaking, his latest efforts in this direction having brought on an indisposition which...", "...between them and the United States, not only by sea but by land; not only with those who bore arms, but with the entire population of the Confederate States.

Was this a government resting on the consent of the governed?

Yes, so damnable were the conditions that a man in the prime of his youth could not follow the bidding of nature and found a family without plunging those that were dependent on him into want and misery!

Michel and myself remained in camp to look <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the dogs, which had now become so ravenous that they required constant watching to keep them from eating the lodge, harness, and everything else that they could get at. The others went in couples in different directions with the agreement that if anyone discovered a band of musk-ox they should return at once to wait for the rest of the party to come in, when we were all to start with the dogs in pursuit.

A. Some give as an excuse for neglecting to seek and embrace the true religion that we should live in the religion in which we were born, and that one religion is as good as another if we believe we are serving God. Q. 1178. How do we show that such an excuse is false and absurd? A. We show that such an excuse is false and absurd because (1) It is false and absurd to say that we should remain in error <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> we have discovered it; (2) because if one religion is as good as another, Our Lord would not have abolished the Jewish religion, nor the apostles have preached against heresy.

They found, to their astonishment, that there the brook which they had been following so long came to a sudden end, or rather to a sudden beginning; for the whole volume of water that composed it was seen here to come boiling up out of the ground in a sort of shallow basin, which was formed on the hill side at the head of the glen.

Germany alone might have had visions, but Germany had a nightmare too, and when the man who ruled her councils with a strong if tortuous policy saw wave <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> wave of the infectious triumph of Socialism reach his own shores, he recognised that England's weakness was more hostile to his ambitions than England's strength.

The entire history of social improvement has been a series of transitions, by which one custom or institution <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> another, from being a supposed primary necessity of social existence, has passed into the rank of an universally stigmatized injustice and tyranny. So it has been with the distinctions of slaves and freemen, nobles and serfs, patricians and plebeians; and so it will be, and in part already is, with the aristocracies of colour, race, and sex.

But he changed his mind, a few days <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> his arrival in Paris, upon meeting Jackson of the American Aviation Squadron, who was on leave after a service of six months at the front.

Finding so much that was beyond her comprehension, she sometimes sought elucidation from the author.

She had said to him when he first used to come, that she supposed he \"came there because he might charge for his visits, and get something by it;\" but when she found this was not the case, and that Doctor Jolly had no base intentions towards her money bags, she tolerated him, and allowed him...", "...that he was there for her. \"It is your own place, the house, the farm----?\" \"Yes,\" he said.

And whenever her eyes, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> watching him for some time, inevitably met his, she was aware of a heat beating up over her consciousness. She sat motionless and in conflict. Who was this strange man who was at once so near to her? What was happening to her?

Why were his eyes so certain, so full of light and confident, waiting for no permission nor...", "...Yes, a man might think she was pretty--a low-browed girl, with a wave of reddish-gold hair, and crimson lips blossoming out against the strange, milk-whiteness of her skin. Her eyes, too--Thyra recalled them--hazel in tint, deep, and laughter-brimmed. The girl had gone past her with a smile that brought out many dimples. There was a certain insolent quality in her beauty, as if it flaunted itself somewhat too defiantly in the beholder's eye. Thyra had turned and looked <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the lithe, young creature, wondering who she might be. And to-night, while she, his mother, waited for him in darkness and loneliness, he was down at Blair's, talking to this girl! He loved her; and it was past doubt that she loved him. The thought was more bitter than death to Thyra. That she should dare! Her anger was all against the girl.

Every thing nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\" Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.

It might have been noticed, however, that both of them slung their guns over their backs by means of the straps used for this purpose.

The old woman stopped immediately, and asked if she was addressing Mr. Hsi; and when informed that she was, she said mournfully, \"Alas! my husband has been killed by the falling of a wall. We are going to bury him to-day. There is no one at home; but please wait here, and we will be back by-and-by.\" They then disappeared among the trees; and, returning <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a short absence, they walked along together in the dusk of the evening. The old woman complained bitterly of their lonely and helpless state, and Hsi Shan himself was moved to compassion by the sight of her tears. She told him that the people of the neighbourhood were a bad lot, and that if he thought of marrying the poor widow's daughter, he had better lose no time in doing so. Hsi Shan said he was willing; and when they reached the house the old woman, after lighting the lamp...", "...at St. Andrews, near Cornwall, in 1791.

At last the patient old grandmother went down herself to the end of the long walk where they were, with some bread and venison on a plate. Felipa ate but little, but Drollo, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> waiting politely until she had finished, devoured everything that was left in his calmly hungry way, and then sat back on his haunches with one paw on the plate, as though for the sake of memory. Drollo's hunger was of the chronic kind; it seemed impossible either to assuage it or to fill him. There was a gaunt leanness about him which I am satisfied no amount of food could ever fatten. I think he knew it too, and that accounted for his resignation. At length, just before sunset,...", "...in the most elegant forms. A great change had taken place in the habits of these ancient in-dwellers of the forest, whose eyes in former days had seldom been gladdened by a sight of such treasures, unless when brought, now and then, by some warrior from the Gaulish wars, to be looked on and wondered at, or caught sight of for a moment amongst the coveted hoards of the druids.

I want to go, but there are reasons why I should not,\" and he smiled. \"That sounds rather curious.\" \"It is very curious, but it is so.\" \"Do you mind explaining?\" \"I do.\" His eyes were set on mine. They seemed somehow to hold my gaze in fascination. There was in them an expression that was half ironical, half humorous. \"I believe this is the first time we have met,\" he said, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a pause. \"I'm quite sure it is,\" I answered. \"You will forgive my saying so, but I don't think any one who had once met you could very well forget it.\" He gave a great laugh. \"Perhaps you are right--ah! perhaps you are right,\" he said laughing, wiping his moustache and mouth with his napkin. \"Certainly I shall never forget you.\" I began, for the first time, to feel rather uncomfortable.

I suspect that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> all it is a good thing for humanity that all people do not have to go through with what Alice and I have experienced the last four months. Otherwise the world would be filled with distrust, for I can conceive of nothing else so likely to sow the seeds of rancor and of suspicion in one's bosom as an experience at building a house.

But when he says it took a new flight at the close of that period, we must acknowledge that the result was not of that kind which could charm us as it did the Roman narrator. As Brunn remarks, the date of Pliny agrees with that period when Hellenic art attained a decided mastery in Rome. Scarcely any evidences of the monumental art of Greece were to be recognized in Rome before the conquest of Syracuse in 212 B.C. After this time the Roman triumphs brought forth, one <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> another, an almost oppressive number of productions, so that the art of the Greek colonies, and of Greece itself, overflowed Rome in a broad stream. Not to mention the plundering of Capua, Tarention, and numerous Grecian cities in Lower Italy, we have an example in the triumphs of Quintius Flaminius, the conqueror of Kynoskephalae, 197 B.C., when the transportation of the statues lasted an entire day.

Upon this, Pontiac arranged his plan, which was that his Indians should commence the game of ball under the forts, and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> playing a short time, strike the ball into the fort: of course, some of them would go in for it; and having done this two or three times, and recommenced the play to avoid suspicion, they were to strike it over again, and follow it up by a rush after it through the gates; and then, when they were all in, they would draw their concealed weapons, and overpower the unsuspicious garrison.\" \"It was, certainly, a very ingenious stratagem,\" observed Mrs Campbell. \"And it succeeded,...", "...irritation whenever I stayed with him in either of his English homes.

By the terms of the agreement made <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> Ipsus, Seleucus was recognized as monarch of all the Greek conquests in Asia, with the sole exceptions of Lower Syria and Asia Minor. The monarchy thus established extended from the Holy Land and the Mediterranean on the west, to the Indus valley and the Bolor mountain-chain upon the east, and from the Caspian and Jaxartes towards the north, to the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean towards the south.

Each band recognises a headman, who, with the aid of the caste elders, settles marital and other disputes. Marriage is usually celebrated <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> puberty. In the North Arcot district, it is customary for a man to marry his maternal uncle's daughter, and in the Madura district a man can claim his paternal aunt's daughter in marriage.

It is desirable to discard the condom <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> it has been used once. But as this is not always done, care must be taken to wash the condom in an antiseptic solution before drying it and placing it away for further use.

Eggadi-ben-Yousouf, a merchant at Miliana, was a mere lover of gain; he never gave away any thing in alms; his heart was dry as the earth in the hottest days of summer, and never open to pity for the unfortunate. To amass, to amass for ever was the sole desire of Eggadi. But in what did his riches consist? None could say, for he concealed them...", "...de Nucingen up to 1819, then with Diane de Cadignan. In his position as member of the Thirteen Henri was in Montriveau's party when Antoinette de Langeais was stolen from the Carmelites. He bought Coralie for sixty thousand francs.

He was the companion and counselor of Victurnien d'Esgrignon, Savinien de Portenduere and above all of Paul de Manerville, whose course he vainly tried to direct <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> an ill-appointed marriage, and to whom he announced, as soon as possible, his own union. Marsay aided Lucien de Rubempre and served for him, with Rastignac, as second in a duel with Michel Chrestien. The Chaulieu and Fontaine women feared or admired Henri de Marsay--a man who was slighted by M. de Canalis, the much toasted poet. The Revolution of July, 1830, made Marsay a man of no little importance. He, however, was content to tell over his old love affairs gravely in the home...", "...the horrible deeds that are done by our fellow-men in the Cannibal Islands. It is good for us to be made acquainted with the truth in order that we may be filled with strong pity for the degraded savages, and in order, also, that our hearts and hands may be opened towards those noble missionaries who venture themselves into the midst of such awful scenes for the sake of souls, and in the name of Jesus Christ. CHAPTER TEN. VISIT TO NEW ZEALAND. Captain Cook left Tahiti <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a stay of three months. During the greater part of this period the sailors and natives had lived together in the most cordial friendship, and in the perpetual interchange of kindly acts. It must be borne in mind that, though the unchristianised natives of the South-Sea Islands are all degraded, cruel, and savage, all are not equally so. Those inhabiting the Feejee group are generally reported to be the worst in all respects. Those who inhabited Tahiti, on the other hand,...", "...received intelligence that his mother and uncle were both sick and not expected to recover.--They live in Philadelphia: the uncle, his mother's brother, a bachelor, by the way, with whom she is living, is reputed wealthy, and, it is said, has willed his property to young Hadley.

I presume, however, he must have started yesterday in the <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> part of the day; but be this as it may, I wish you and Dick to follow after him, and don't fail to finish him somehow and somewhere.

On the road Pan Michael told them about the neighborhood, and the famous nobles of Lauda, of Kmita, and of all that had happened during a certain time. He confessed also his love for Panna Billevich, unrequited as usual. \"It is well that war is near,\" said he, \"otherwise I should have suffered greatly, when I think at times that such is my misfortune, and that probably...", "...was over with him when Pym said the story did not march. \"It is a dead thing,\" Pym would roar, flinging down the manuscript,--\"a dead thing because the stakes your man is playing for, a woman's love, is less than a wooden counter to you.

With the exception of a touch or two in Scott's stories, such as the impressive Bodach Glas, in 'Waverley,' and the apparition in the exquisite 'Bride of Lammermoor,' it would be difficult to discover any parallel.

His Puritan blood shows itself in sympathy, not with the stern side of the ancestral creed, but with the feebler characters upon whom it weighed as an oppressive terror.

As long as it remained secret, the new sort of relationship to the man as a lover fascinated her, but her mother discovered everything and believed that nothing stood in the way of a complete reconciliation between the pair.

Colonel Mirabel, however, grew weary of these singular doings; he obtained a position in Lyons, but died soon <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> from the consequences of his excesses. Years passed; her mother, too, died, and Clarissa's grief was so overwhelming that she would spend entire days at the grave, and the influence of her more readily consoled father alone succeeded in inducing her to reconcile herself to her lonely, empty existence.

One flat shelf, over which the thin water slipped like a sheet of molten glass, remained and caught her eye; she was no longer cold or stiff with terror, but frantic to save herself; it was the only chance, the last; shooting by, she sprang forward, pole in hand, touched it, fell, caught a ledge with her hands while the fierce flow of the water lifted her off her feet, scrambled up breathlessly and was safe, while the scow swept past, two flashing furlongs, poised a few moments <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> on the brink of the fall, went majestically over, and came up to the surface below in pieces.

Brescia was an opulent city, second only to Milan among the towns of northern Italy, and Romanino obtained plenty of patronage; but in 1511 the city fell a prey to the horrors of war, was taken and lost by Venice, and in 1512 was sacked by the French. Romanino fled to Padua, where he found a home among the Benedictines of S. Giustina. Here he was soon well employed on an...", "...petrified, and afraid lest the slightest noise should dispel the enchanting apparition. \"Oh, how pleasant this is!\" said the lady, drawing a deep breath; \"my hands were quite chilled.

The surface of the arm west of Hudson Bay is gently undulating and that of the eastern arm has been roughened to low-rolling hills and dissected in places by such deep river gorges as those of the Ottawa and Saguenay.

In the examples cited the uplift has been a broad one and to comparatively little height.

Won't you, mammy?\" \"Pick me some grasses, then; I 'low I has to, but don't yo' come pesterin' me no more <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> this time. \"Seed-top grasses, honey, seed-top grasses; don't git me none of them blade kind. Ketch hol' near the top and pull 'em up slow like, then they'll come out nice and smooth, an' leave they ole rough skins behind, just like a eel does when you skins him. That's it, you got 'nough now; bring 'em 'long here an' we'll make the hoppergrass-house. \"Hol' your own hand, honey, you'll learn best that-a-way. Can't forgit the feelin' of it once you build it on yo' fingers....", "...Jimmie regarded him with a critical glance, with a stifled sigh of disappointment. He saw clearly that strange scenes and stirring adventures had failed to work a cure. He expected better things--quite a different result. \"Yes, it's beastly weather,\" he said; \"but you'll stand it all right. You are in uncommonly good condition for a chap who has just pulled through fever and a bullet hole. By Jove! I wish I could have seen you tackling the Afridis--you were mentioned in the papers <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> that last scrimmage, and they gave you a rousing send-off. You deserve the Victoria Cross, and you would get it if you were a soldier.\" \"I didn't fight for glory,\" Jack muttered, bitterly. \"I'm the most unlucky beggar alive.\" Jimmie looked at him curiously. \"You don't mean to say,\" he asked, \"that you were hankering for an Afridi bullet or spear in your heart?\" \"It's the best thing that could have happened. They tell me I bear a charmed life, and I believe it's true. I...", "...later the bigger bears come down and eat the bait. I don't know that we'll do anything more with this trap, and, any way, it won't pay to set it just as we're going away. If we were going to be near enough so that we could come down here every day and look at it, it would be different; but it's quite a long ride up to the pass, and if we're going to hunt, we won't feel much like riding down here.\" Before they had finished skinning the beaver, the Cliffords had come up the hill, and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the work was over Hugh and Jack took them down to the bear trap and explained the situation. Then Hugh proposed that they should all pack up and start up the stream for the pass, and before noon the pack train, now more than doubled in numbers, was climbing toward the summit. It was a delightful ride through the green timber, with frequent glimpses of the brawling stream, which grew constantly smaller, steeper, and more noisy.

He did not ask if her infidelity was real or if it had no warrant in his own slight and goading. The poor, pale face went <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> him reproachfully. Every painful footfall that she made was the patter of a blood-drop. Such unnatural excitement must have some termination. He quarrelled with a waiter. Old Bullier ordered a cuirassier to take him to the door; he would have resisted, but Terrapin whispered: \"Don't be foolish, Flare; if you are put out it will be a triumph for the girl;\" and only this conviction kept him calm.

Frank had had time to think. He realized that several things conflicted with such an explanation of the mysterious explosion....", "...I have seen a man hung on suspicion of stealing a horse, and directly he was hung the horse in question has turned up underneath the thief that really stole him. As Mr. Townsend observed, sometimes it seems as if the innocent were born to hang. If everything in life were certain, where would be the sport, and what would be the use of betting? It is the element of chance that makes the game! One afternoon something happened which struck me as being distinctly curious. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> lunch. I was thinking of taking the air. I had just gone into the drawing-room for a moment, when there came a knocking at the door. \"Now, who's that, I wonder?\" I stopped the servant on her way to answer the door. \"Eliza, let me know who it is before you say I'm in.\" I knew who it was directly she opened the door.

It was the...", "...\"At the present time your wine-shop is the resort of rogues and criminals.

He was aged fifty-six, but appeared ten years younger, though his cheek was brown with camp-fire smoke; he wore the uniform of a camp-marshal. The king cast a dull and heavy glance on the little man, whom he had never met; but it was not without observation. The other fixed on him a scrutinizing eye full of fire and...", "...the fight right on to our front porch.... What about it, Hammond? Will such a tom-fool law stand water?\" \"Can't tell.

Sitric remained with reserves within the fortress, and thus saved his kingdom; nor do the annalists cease to make frequent mention of the foreigners. But the defeat was great, and may have had considerable influence in deciding those who were already hovering between Woden and Jesus. Fourteen years <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> Clontarf we find Sitric going to Rome, and his son Olaf was killed in England when attempting the same pilgrimage. These facts lend some countenance to the legend that Sitric founded Christ Church in 1038; for the Roman court well knew how to impress the rude northern warriors, and to profit in various ways by their simple faith. We are told that Flosi the Icelander went to Rome to cleanse himself from the stain of blood-guiltiness, 'where,' says the Njal-Saga, 'he gat so great...", "...It would be very pleasant and agreeable to come in contact occasionally with this extremely pretty girl; it would ameliorate the coarse, hard routine of his work just as the finding of a cluster of mountain heart's-ease had often before dispelled the gloom of a hard day's ride.

After practice and experience with this technique, we could locate the approximate source of the signal within 10 to 30 minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> first receiving it. Even though the radiotagged wolves spent most of their time inland, often in stands of conifers, they were frequently observed from the aircraft.

From December through April, 65 percent of the wolves located by radio were sighted; the rate was much higher for more experienced personnel. A pack of five wolves that was...", "...the beginnings!

As might be expected, the Argentine Government has shown itself anxious to encourage the cultivation of _mate_. The difficulty lay in the germinating process. In certain provinces of the Argentine, _mate_ grew wild, but when sown the crops were a failure. After many trials, M.

It appears that in the ordinary course of nature, the fertilising process takes place in the stomach of birds. The Jesuits had made the same discovery, but on their expulsion they carried the secret away with them. M. Thays rediscovered it. More than once an attempt has been made to introduce the habit of _mate_-drinking into Europe.

Hetty's conduct throughout seems to me to be thoroughly consistent. The author has escaped the easy error of representing her as in any degree made serious by suffering.

I would rather have had a little more premeditation before his fault, or a little more repentance <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> it; that is, while repentance could still be of use. Not that, all things considered, he is not a very fair image of a frank-hearted, well-meaning, careless, self-indulgent young gentleman; but the author has in his case committed the error which in Hetty's she avoided,--the error of showing him as redeemed by suffering. I cannot but think that he was as weak as she. A weak woman, indeed, is weaker than a weak man; but Arthur Donnithorne was a superficial fellow, a person...", "...do not shine at daytime when the sun, which is itself a luminous body, is shining. Hence we infer that that thing on account of which all this, including the moon, the stars, and the sun himself, does not shine is likewise a thing of light. The 'shining after' also is possible only if there is a luminous body already, for we know from experience that 'acting after' (imitation) of any kind takes place only when there are more than one agent of similar nature; one man, for instance, walks <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> another man who walks himself. Therefore we consider it settled that the passage refers to some luminous body. To this we reply that the highest Self only can be meant.--Why?--On account of the acting after. The shining after mentioned in the passage, 'After him when he shines everything shines,' is possible only if the praj/n/a Self, i.e. the highest Self, is understood. Of that praj/n/a Self another scriptural passage says, 'His form is light, his thoughts are true' (Ch.

Before we can affirm that the labour of preparing these barks and mats and setting up, and taking down, the lodge, is disproportionately great, or heavy on the females, it will be necessary to inquire into other particulars, both on the side of the male and female.

She deserves all the censure she gets, and more--but, oh! she does deserve a little pity with it! When this girl had been married nearly a year, she heard her husband coming upstairs one night long <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> midnight, in a condition she had learned to recognize--and fear. She locked her bedroom door. When he discovered that, he was furiously angry; as I said before, he was a big man, and he was very strong. He knocked out a panel, put his hand through, and turned the key. When he reached her, he reminded her that she had been perfectly willing to marry him--that she was his wife, his property, anything you choose to call it; he struck her. The next day she was very ill, and the child...", "...with the regiment. We were cheered, however, just at evening by the return of our kind-hearted assistant surgeon, Doctor Prosper K.

The author of this book is not known, and can hardly be guessed at with any degree of plausibility. It was unquestionably written, or rather compiled, a long time probably several hundred years <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the prophets whose wonderful adventures it recounts had passed away. The internal evidence is sufficient, both in quality and quantity, to demonstrate that the book is for the most part a collection of traditions.

The parson made a sprint and caught the ultimate rail of the moving train. Mallory made a frantic leap at a flying coat-tail and missed.

Yaspard was not so confident himself <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> being in the water some time, and he frequently found himself obliged to pause and rest his hands on the dog. They were greatly helped by the tide flowing towards Burra Isle. Indeed, Yaspard would not have started on such a dangerous voyage if he had not calculated that he must receive great assistance from the sea itself. All he had to do was to keep himself afloat and drift with the current; but, as all swimmers know, it is often as trying to do that as to breast an opposing...", "...They saw no reason to suppose that it had drowned itself in the stream; but while searching for it they found on one of the banks an old man, who laughed and said, \"What do you seek?\" They answered, \"A hog.\" After some moments the old man said that it was he, himself, whom they had been chasing, and by this the boys knew that he was a witch.

Not indeed that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> every victory it is to be apprehended that the victorious generals will possess themselves by force of the supreme power, after the manner of Sylla and Caesar: the danger is of another kind.

Very little is known of Langland. He was born probably near Malvern, in Worcestershire, the son of a poor freeman, and in his early life lived in the fields as a shepherd. Later he went to London with his wife and children, getting a hungry living as clerk in the church. His real life meanwhile was that of a seer, a prophet <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> Isaiah's own heart, if we may judge by the prophecy which soon found a voice in _Piers Plowman_. In 1399, after the success of his great work, he was possibly writing another poem called _Richard the Redeless_, a protest against Richard II; but we are not certain of the authorship of this poem, which was left unfinished by the assassination of the king. After 1399 Langland disappears utterly, and the date of his death is unknown. PIERS PLOWMAN. \"The voice of him that crieth in...", "...where does the question come in?

The first division offers few problems to the plumber, little variety in the layout being possible, and the result depending mostly upon the arrangement of the pipes and fittings; but the second division calls for careful study in the arrangement, good workmanship in the installing, and individual attention to each fixture. The trade had its beginnings in merely supplying fresh water to a community. This was done by means of trenching, or conveying water from lakes,...", "...Why?...

It would have spared him the chagrin he was made to feel, on Mr Smythje reporting to him the encounter he had had on board ship--which the latter proceeded to do, the moment after Kate had been so unceremoniously dismissed from the hall. Smythje had also overheard the communication of the overseer--the word \"nephew,\" at least--and this recalled to his mind--not without some unpleasant remembrance of the satire from...", "...of the two victims hidden in a mass of thick underbush, several yards apart. The tracks of the two bears encircled the spot, a plain proclamation of ownership to any other of the wild creatures which might be inclined to trespass on that domain.

The bark at a considerable height was scored by the marks of mighty claws. The larger bear, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> her meal, had stretched herself like a cat, rearing herself and digging in her claws against the trunk. And the great height of her reach was a pointed announcement that her displeasure would be a perilous thing to reckon with.

I desired to detain him, but was unable to make any effort for that purpose, till he had passed out of the room. I then uttered an involuntary and piercing cry--\"Pleyel! Art thou gone?

Here I met two American friends, and we walked by the quay of the palace, towards the Pont Neuf. The people were in a dense crowd, and it was even difficult to penetrate the mass. Just before we reached the bridge, we heard shouts and cries of _Vive le Roi_, and presently I saw M. de Chabot-Rohan, the first honorary aide-de-camp, a gentleman whom I personally knew, and who usually led the cortege of the King.

The numerous Indian tribes subsist almost entirely on these animals, sell their skins <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> retaining a sufficient supply for their clothing, tents, &c., and the agents of the Company recklessly shoot down these noble animals for their own pleasure, often not making the least use of them, except taking out the tongue.

Instead of being sent to study at Paris and London by the Prussian government, as he seems to have wished, he was suddenly called to Paris by his old pupil, Mr. Astor, who, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> two years' absence, had returned to Europe, and was anxious to renew his relations with Bunsen. Bunsen's object in accepting Astor's invitation to Paris was to study Persian; and great was his disappointment when, on arriving there, Mr. Astor wished him at once to start for Italy. This was too much for Bunsen, to be turned back just as he was going to quench his thirst for Oriental literature in the lectures of Sylvestre de Sacy. A compromise was effected. Bunsen remained for...", "...of 1788-1789 passed uneventfully except that the English were no sooner out of the harbor, than the Indians, who had kept askance of the Americans, came in flocks to trade.

They were married upon the seventh. It was a wedding in the fine, old-fashioned country style, with a ball and supper the same evening, and dinner parties and dancing parties, given successively by the neighbors, in honor of the bride, almost every day and night for the next two weeks.

Kali, not desiring to remain alone among the negroes, ran after him. From the breasts of the savage warriors there came a shout--it was not known whether of alarm or of rage, but, before they recovered their wits, the stockade under the pressure of the elephant's head crashed and tumbled; after that the clay walls of the hut crumbled and amid dust the roof flew up in the air; and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a while M'Rua and his men saw the black trunk raised high and at the end of the trunk the fetish-man, Kamba.

He arose from his knees, and again shaded his face to hide the traces of his emotion. When at last he looked up, Mr. Walton was quietly reading, and the ladies had retired. He rose and bade Mr. Walton good-night with a strong but silent grasp of the hand. The thought flashed across him as he went to his room, that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> this evening and the grasp as of friendship he had just given the father, he could not in the faintest degree meditate evil against the daughter.

But when they have tasted the bitterness of their own way, in pity of their misery, the Lord will bring out that which He has in reserve for them, the man <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> His own heart that shall fulfil all His pleasure. How perfect was all this! Had David been given to Israel in the day of 1 Sam. xi. the whole moral of the story would have been lost to us.

One of these I will relate, as nearly as possible in the words of my revered uncle, in order that my readers may be able to imagine the kind of way in which all his stories were told. But the other tales which I propose to chronicle I will tell <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a different fashion, relating the substance of Uncle Joe's narrative, but leaving out the personal allusions to his own prowess with which it was embellished. Those who read have only to imagine that in the chief personage in every story they discern Uncle Joe, and they will easily discover the little alterations which I have thought it well to make in order to vary the form of each tale. The one which I am now going to tell was a favourite one with us boys, but the girls did not...", "...Waynefleet. \"We'll lay you off for a week. There's a little business waiting at the settlement, anyway, and you can see about getting the new tools and provisions in.\" Waynefleet's face was expressive of a vast relief. The few bitter weeks spent in the canyon had taken a good deal of the keenness he had once displayed out of him. \"I certainly think the arrangement suggested is a very desirable one,\" he agreed \"I am quite sure that Miss Waynefleet will have much pleasure in looking <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> Nasmyth.\" Gordon turned to Nasmyth. \"Now,\" he said, \"you can protest just as much as you like, but still, as you'll start to-morrow if we have to tie you on to the pack-horse, it's not going to be very much use. You can nurse your hand for a week, and then go on to Victoria and see if you can pick up a boring-machine of the kind we want cheap.\" Nasmyth, who was aware that the machine must be purchased before very long, submitted with the best grace he could, and, though his...", "...Fiercely, he swept her to him, bruising her lips with his. \"Sophia, Sophia....\" At last, she drew back. \"Kit,\" she said, smiling demurely. She took his right hand in her left, held it, squeezed it. Her own right hand she suddenly brought up from her waist, fist clenched, driving it against his jaw. Temple fell, half stunned by the blow, at her feet. For the space of a single heartbeat he watched her move slowly toward the round doorway, then he had clambered to his feet, running <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> her. He got his arms on her shoulders, yanked at her. When she turned he saw she was crying. \"I--I'm sorry, Kit. You couldn't fool me about.... Stephanie. You can't fool me about this.\" She had more leverage this time. She stepped back, bringing her small, hard fist up from her knees. It struck Temple squarely at the point of the jaw, with the strength of Jovian-trained muscle behind it. Temple's feet left the floor and he landed with a thud on his back. His last thought of...", "...upon a very narrow circle, to another form of influence which would one day flood the world. I do not need to dwell upon that thought, beyond seeking to emphasise this truth, that one ought to feel that Jesus Christ has a living connection now with each of us. It is not merely that the story of the Cross is left to work its results, but, as I for my part believe, that the dear Lord, who, before He became Man, was the Light of the World, and enlightened every man that came into it, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> His death is yet more the Light of the World, and is exercising influence all over the earth, not only by conscience and the light that is within us, nor only through the effects of the record of His past, but by the continuous operations of His Spirit. I do not dwell upon that thought further than to say that I beseech you to think of Jesus Christ, not as One who died for our sins only, but as one who lives to-day, and to-day, in no rhetorical exaggeration but in simple and...", "...explained Phil. \"And you want me to knock out a morning's practice, when you know how much the team needs it,\" went on the captain, reproachfully. \"We don't need it--so much,\" declared Sid. \"No, you fellows think you're perfect, I guess,\" and the captain looked injured, and spoke sarcastically. \"It isn't that,\" said Tom, eagerly, \"but if we _don't_ go, our chair may vanish again. We'll put in hard practice when we come back.\" \"Oh, well, then, go ahead,\" conceded Kindlings, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a consultation with the coach. \"I'll make you pay for it, though. If we lose the Boxer game, it will be up to you fellows.\" \"We won't lose!\" declared Tom, confidently. They caught the next trolley car for town, and, piloted by Frank, headed for the second-hand shop on the little side street. \"Now we'd better map out a plan of campaign,\" suggested Phil, as they neared the place. \"If we go into the place, and demand the chair, the fellow may insist that he has a good claim...", "...one of our soldiors appointed for a forlorne Sentinel, whom they presently put to the sword.

She kissed the young mother and her little nursling affectionately, then left the cottage, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> they had pointed out the road to Grenoble, where they supposed that she was going. The young woman did not travel rapidly; her pregnancy, her lack of practice in walking, and the bundle of clothing she carried, compelled her to stop frequently. She would sit down on a felled tree, a stone, or the bank of a ditch, and wait until her strength had returned and she could go on. Sometimes other travellers passed her while she was resting. Those in carriages did not look at her;...", "...debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience.\" \"Well, I've got just as much conscience as any man in business can afford to keep,--just a little, you know, to swear by, as 't were,\" said the trader, jocularly; \"and, then, I'm ready to do anything in reason to 'blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a fellow--a leetle too hard.\" The trader sighed contemplatively, and poured out some more brandy. \"Well, then, Haley, how will you trade?\" said Mr. Shelby, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> an uneasy interval of silence. \"Well, haven't you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?\" \"Hum!--none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it's only hard necessity makes me willing to sell at all. I don't like parting with any of my hands, that's a fact.\" Here the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five years of age, entered the room. There was something in his appearance remarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as floss...", "...It is His will, I do not doubt it; but I cannot see the goodness or the justice of the act, and I will not pretend to myself that I acquiesce. September 25, 1889. Yesterday was a warm, delicious, soft day, full of a gentle languor, the air balmy and sweet, the sunshine like the purest gold; we sate out all the morning under the cliff, in the warm dry sand. To the right and left of us lay the blue bay, the waves breaking with short, crisp sparkles on the shore. We saw headland <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> headland sinking into the haze; a few fishing-boats moved slowly about, and far down on the horizon we watched the smoke of a great ocean-steamer. We talked, Maud and I, for the first time, I think, without reserve, without bitterness, almost without grief, of Alec. What sustains her is the certainty that he is as he was, somewhere, far off, as brave and loving as ever, waiting for us, but waiting with a perfect understanding and knowledge of why we are separated. She dreams of...", "...their sole object. They possessed themselves at once of nearly all the level land lying between those mountains--a plain of 25 or 30 miles in length and varying from three fourths to two miles in width, and of fine soil. Among those who were first to occupy that section of country, we find the names of Hadden, Connelly, Whiteman, Warwick, Nelson, Stalnaker, Riffle and Westfall: the latter of these found and interred the bones of Files' family, which had lain, bleaching in the sun, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> their murder by the Indians, in 1754.

Robert Butler, William Morgan and some others settled on the Dunkard bottom. In this year too, settlements were made on Simpson's creek, the...", "...be compared with the fearful accounts which had been rife in the neighborhood. I have that old letter in my possession now. Soon after the battle Gov. Richard Yates, of Illinois, Gov. Louis P. Harvey, of Wisconsin, and many other civilians, came down from the north to look after the comfort of the sick and wounded soldiers of their respective states. The 16th Wisconsin Infantry was camped next to us, and I learned one afternoon that Gov. Harvey was to make them a speech that evening, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> dress parade, and I went over to hear him. The Wisconsin regiment did not turn out in military formation, just gathered around him in a dense group under a grove of trees. The Governor sat on a horse while making his speech. He wore a large, broad-brimmed hat, his coat was buttoned to the chin, and he had big buckskin gauntlets on his hands. He was a fine looking man, heavy set, and about forty-two years old. His remarks were not lengthy, but were patriotic and eloquent. I...", "...seeds separately an inch apart and half an inch deep.

Even a statement of the condition of things below decks failed to convince all of them of the futility of further fighting. It is said that two of the junior officers, swearing that they would never surrender, rushed to the two port guns and reopened fire on the Kearsarge. At this point there is a flat contradiction in the statements of eye witnesses. Lieutenant Kell denies that there was any firing of the Alabama's guns <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the colors had been hauled down, and that her discipline would not have permitted it. Semmes and Kell both aver that the Kearsarge fired five shots into them after their flag had been hauled down. When the firing had ceased Master's Mate Fullam was sent to the Kearsarge with a boat's crew and a few of the wounded in the dingey (the only boat entirely unharmed) to say that the Alabama was sinking and to ask for assistance in transferring the wounded. He told Captain Winslow...", "...patrons of literature and art. Under such august auspices it penetrated into the English public at large. The translator was a well-known teacher of the Italian language, John Florio. From the preface of the first book of the 'Essais' we learn that, at the request of Sir Edward Wotton, Florio had first Englished one chapter, doing it in the house of Lady Bedford, a great lover of art. In that preface, Florio, in most extravagant and euphuistic style, describes how this noblewoman, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> having 'dayned to read it (the first chapter) without pitty of my fasting, my fainting, my laboring, my langishing, my gasping for some breath ... yet commaunded me on'--namely, to turn the whole work into English.

And La Fantine, as she had been called, had brought pleasure to many men. She was looking her best, dainty to a degree. The footlights, with the larger possibilities of powder and paint, had restored her youth, and...", "...had been long enough under this treatment, he withdrew the coverings one by one, and taking my wet clothes from me, I soon fell into a sound and refreshing sleep, from which I did not awake till the next morning's sun was shining on my eyelids.

The current story in the United States is that he was proved to have been in touch with the Mexican General Huerta with the object of bringing about war between the two Republics--an offence of which the famous list of Mr. Bielaski makes no mention.

It was at a ball he first saw Emmeline, the eldest of the family. She had but lately returned from a school at which from the first she had had for her bedfellow a black ewe. It was not a place where any blackness under that of pitch was likely to attract notice, being one of those very ordinary and very common schools where everything is done that is done, first...", "...deeds achieved for her sake, you may be sure the young man behaved worthily, though he was modest when she praised him, and his limbs trembled when the land whispered of his great reward to come. The longer he stayed at Beckley the more he lived in this world within world, and if now and then the harsh outer life smote him, a look or a word from Rose encompassed him again, and he became sensible only of a distant pain. At first his hope sprang wildly to possess her, to believe, that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> he had done deeds that would have sent ordinary men in the condition of shattered hulks to the hospital, she might be his. Then blow upon blow was struck, and he prayed to be near her till he died: no more. Then she, herself, struck him to the ground, and sitting in his chamber, sick and weary, on the evening of his mishap, Evan's sole desire was to obtain the handkerchief he had risked his neck for.

The monarch, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> making some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival, despatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers, to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit.

We at once skinned the animal, and then set to work to scrape the skin as clean and thin as possible. This done, Bigg hung it on to the end of a stick, which he carried over his shoulder, that it might thus dry in the sun and air as we walked along. Soon <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> this I killed a fine deer, which we skinned to serve as a robe for Bigg. I thought that he would be soon tired if he had to carry both skins, and so I proposed at once cutting them into the shape of the robes we required. This we did with our knives, and two very fine-looking garments we produced. I, however, was not satisfied that my appearance would be sufficiently regal, so I proposed, if I could, to obtain a lion-skin with which further to deck myself. We marched on,...", "...so beautiful.

Something impelled him to go to the studio, some obscure desire for self-torture, and yet he dreaded the anguish that he foresaw. He dragged himself up the stairs; his feet seemed unwilling to carry him; and outside the door he lingered for a long time, trying to summon up courage to go in. He felt horribly sick. He had an impulse to run down the stairs <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> me and beg me to go in with him; he had a feeling that there was somebody in the studio. He remembered how often he had waited for a minute or two on the landing to get his breath after the ascent, and how absurdly his impatience to see Blanche had taken it away again. To see her was a delight that never staled, and even though he had not been out an hour he was as excited at the prospect as if they had been parted for a month.

The joy of the youthful pair at meeting again, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> so long a separation, is more easily imagined than described. Preparations were now made for the consummation of their union, at which I was earnestly invited to be present, but the multiplicity of my pastoral engagements prevented me from doing so, much to my regret.

This is the young man's description of him: \"Tall, straight, and well-formed; large in size, but shapely, hair brown with gray in it; in all the face a look of great power, reserved, but ready to act; eyes of changeable color, that took the shade of the emotion that chanced to come and look out of them; when...", "...had but a notion of the revelation of Thy glory, conceived a likeness of Thee according to their own understanding, and men of erudition, who had gained but a glimpse of the manifold evidences of Thy loving-kindness and glory, have contrived peers for Thee in conformity with their own imaginations.

Every man of insight is far astray in his attempt to recognize Thee, and every man of consummate learning is sore perplexed in his search <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> Thee. Every evidence falleth short of Thine unknowable Essence and every light retreateth and sinketh below the horizon when confronted with but a glimmer of the dazzling splendour of Thy might.

Panic alone was their destruction. But although we thus left a way open for them to flee, we pressed them hard--_au_! we pressed them hard. We smote them as they fled, striking them down by scores, but I and Kalipe, and the other war-captains were too wary to allow this to continue, even if we had not seen the King's signal of recall. So, singing in mockery <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> them the war-song of Dingane, we left the pursuit and returned in triumph. _Au, Nkose_! that was a sight. I have seen your countrymen lying in heaps at Isandhlwana, and I have been in many a hard-fought battle since that of which I am telling.

I do not, however, believe that the great ladies wear any, but certain it is that the wife of Denis, the landscape painter, with whom I lodged, and who was a Roman, showed me the dagger which she always had about her. As for the men of the people, they are never unprovided with one, and this brings about a number of grave tragedies. Three evenings <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> my arrival, for instance, I heard in my street some shouts followed by a great tumult. I sent out to learn what the matter was, and was informed that a man had just killed another with his dagger. As these peculiar habits made me very much afraid, I was assured that strangers had nothing to fear--that it was simply a question of an act of revenge between Italians. As for the case in point, the murderer and his victim had quarrelled ten years ago, and the first, having recognised...", "...except to await the appearance of some cattle. The repair work had all been done to that end, and it was inevitable that Betty must be considering some arrangement for the procuring of cattle, but for a week she had said nothing and Calumet did not question her.

As he was leaving the table she told him she wanted to speak to him <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> her housework was done, and he went outside, where he lingered, watching Dade and Malcolm and Bob. About an hour or so later Betty came out. Calumet was standing at the corral fence near the stable when she stepped down from the porch, and he gave a gasp of astonishment and then stood perfectly still, looking at her.

He remained some minutes gazing on the prospect, till the prospect reminded him of the fields which Jackeymo was bent on his hiring, and the fields reminded him of Lenny Fairfield.

Meanwhile Frank, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> cantering on for some distance, stopped at a cottage, and there learned that there was a short cut across the fields to Rood Hall, by which he could save nearly three miles. Frank, however, missed the short cut, and came out into the high road; a turnpike-keeper, after first taking his toll, put him back again into the short cut; and finally, he got into some green lanes, where a dilapidated finger-post directed him to Rood.

The parachute still waved in the mulberry, and a few policemen were unobtrusively hanging about the street. Two of these did not move very far from the gate. I supposed that in view of pending inquiries it was important that the parachute should not be touched. We waited so long for an answer <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> ringing the bell that I had almost concluded there was nobody at home. We were, in fact, on the point of turning away when Esdaile himself opened the door. Poor devil!

He had as a matter of fact removed his telephone receiver from the hook. He said its ringing had nearly driven him mad.

Nevertheless, a good many escaped, and in 1325, when John XXII. was reigning in Avignon, he ordered a fresh _battu_ of heretics. A great number fled to the cave of Lombrive near Ussat in Ari\u00e8ge. It consists of an immense hall, and runs to the length of nearly four miles. In 1328 the papal troops, to save themselves the trouble or risk of penetrating into these recesses <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> their prey, built up the entrance, and left from four to five hundred Albigenses along with their bishops to perish therein of starvation. Of late years the bones have been collected, removed, and buried. From 1152, the Bordelois, Saintonge, Agenois, Perigord, and the Limousin were nominally under the English crown.

Who could tell exactly the cause of his dismissal, and why the young lady had asserted her capricious resolve to be free?

Now some men--and Sir Harry was of them--are churlish and ferocious over their loves, as certain brutes are over their victuals.

After the first mouthful she said to Neale with enthusiasm, \"You know how to order a dinner as well as to choose a table, that's evident.\" \"It was the first fish he proposed,\" said Neale. Eugenia thought, \"How much better breeding he has, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> all, than Mr. Livingstone, always boasting of his savoir-faire.\" Neale's thoughts were jumping incoherently from one thing to another. \"Funny place Rome is, to be planning how to run a wood-working plant in Vermont.

At all dances, the drum is used to call the dancers together, the third call being accompanied by yelps and the fourth by a real burst of war-whoops. There is a curious variation in the call to the scalp dance, which is something like skipping a stone on new ice. It begins in slow time, with each successive beat shorter, and ending in a mere roll.

The period during which he had the care of the Princess Elizabeth. 2. His term of office as Lieutenant of the Tower. 3. The twenty-five years after Mary's death, which he spent for the most part in retirement in Norfolk.

I called Trusty away from under the tree, bade him lie down in the grass behind me, and gave the cub something which brought it down like a ball, crashing through the foliage to the ground, when I put the other barrel to its forehead, and stopped its young bearish existence. After reloading, I broke it up, to give Trusty his share of the spoil--the kidneys, the only bear-meat he ever touched, unless he was very hungry. I then hastened home, and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> breakfast I went back to the forest with one of my men and three mules, when we broke up the old bear, and carried the meat home on two of the animals, and the cub entire on the third.

Remember the old adage: \"There's many a slip Between the cup and the lip;\" and consider how your feelings would be mortified, if, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> making such an engagement generally known among your acquaintances, anything should occur to break it off.

The daughter grows up into supernatural likeness of her mother, but remains nameless, since her father, for a reason he cannot analyze, hesitates to give her any name. But at last, as she stands before the altar to be christened, some force outside the father causes him to call her Morella.

She was accustomed to enter wayside cabins, and get into homely chat with the peasants. The Italian woman never did that. Alphonse Daudet's description of Isabella as a stout queen, who by her massive jaws and high complexion resembled a coarse-rinded blood-orange, would not be endorsed by these humble yearners <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the bygone. Indeed, they regarded her as one who had been a type of beauty in her time, and was still a type of good-nature, and were forgiving to her peccadilloes, she was so devout.

He could understand nothing of the part that the wire and the sapling were playing in this curious game.

In this instance, however, he did not regard Wapoos as he had looked on Umisk the beaver. He knew that Wapoos made mighty fine eating, and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> another moment or two of hesitation he darted upon his prey. Wapoos, half gone already, made almost no struggle, and in the glow of the stars Baree finished him, and for half an hour afterward he feasted. McTaggart had heard no sound, for the snare into which Wapoos had run his head was the one set farthest from his camp.

There he breathlessly stated his errand; and the sturdy fisherman and his son were immediately prepared to start. The boat was launched, and they set out. It was slightly cloudy, and there seemed some prospect of a storm.

Twenty minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the boat had left the strand it had reached the bay. All thought of mere reward faded out soon from the minds of these honest men. They only thought of the young lady whom they had often seen along the shore, who might even now be in the jaws of death. Not a word was spoken.

It appears that an attack upon them had been pre-concerted; and that, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> being long insulted with the grossest language, they were repeatedly assaulted by the mob with balls of ice and snow, and with sticks, before they were induced to fire. This representation is strongly supported by the circumstances, that captain Preston, after a long and public trial, was acquitted by a Boston jury; and that six of the eight soldiers who were prosecuted, were acquitted, and the remaining two found guilty of manslaughter only.

Upon each was marked out a representative portion, care being exercised to select areas where previous inspections had not disturbed the surface of the film in any manner.

The marked sections were sawed out, wrapped in tissue paper, and then transferred to the laboratory where they were...", "...with all he had heard, or probably imagined.

This could not but exceedingly affect those who stayed behind. Immediately they sent guards to all the prisons, at Lambeth-house, Ely-house, and such places where malignants were in custody, with directions to search the prisoners, and some other places which they thought fit should be suspected.

It would also appear that by reason of the friction between magnetism and iron, the molecules of the latter are only partially moved, such movement being the result of the tendency of iron to retard magnetic change. I have found that the magnetic molecules also possess inertia, that they are capable of acquiring momentum, and that their rotation continues for a considerable time <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the exciting cause of their rotation has ceased. These facts may be proved in a very evident manner, inasmuch as induced electric currents are generated by this _after_ rotation, which may be made to light incandescent lamps. In this case the magnetic rotations are produced in an electro magnet by means of alternate currents supplied by alternating Gramme machine. In order to better explain the action, it will be necessary to refer to a new electro-motor, which was the...", "...when we left him, for fear we would get lost and he would starve to death.

It was a plate with a hole in the centre large enough to admit the iron bar which I had brought for the purpose. I put it in, and whispering to Tupac to help me, we gripped the bar, and <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> two or three hard pulls felt it coming towards us. A great slab of rock, which fitted into the wall with all the perfection that our old Inca masons could give it, turned on a central hinge, leaving a space that two men could have walked through abreast.

A whistling moaning wind swept over the grass, laying low the young barley, and carrying the great, white seagulls inland like sprays of foam.

It is well known that the Arabs, especially <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> their conversion to Mahometanism, were great colonizers or conquerors; even the now half-christian kingdom of Abyssinia was an early colony and conquest of the pagan Arabs, and its inhabitants are consequently _white_ Moors in the most extended Portuguese sense.

He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the measure of his going; at which he smiled and said, 'By Allah, this is a strange thing! Yesterday, the bird flew before me as fast as I could run; and to-day, knowing that I am tired and cannot run, it flieth after the measure of my walking. By Allah, this is wonderful! But, whether it lead me to my death or to my life, I must needs follow it, wherever it goeth, for it will surely not abide save in some inhabited land. So he followed the bird, eating of the fruits of the...", "...as a science incapable of further development, or as a science which in recent periods has not altered in its laws. The many mistaken ideas upon Armory, however, are not all due to the two considerations which have been put forward. Many are due to the fact that the hand-books of Armory professing to detail the laws of the science have not always been written by those having complete knowledge of their subject. Some statement appears in a textbook of Armory, it is copied into book <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> book, and accepted by those who study Armory as being correct; whilst all the time it is absolutely wrong, and has never been accepted or acted upon by the Officers of Arms. One instance will illustrate my meaning. There is scarcely a text-book of Armory which does not lay down the rule, that when a crest issues from a coronet it must not be placed upon a wreath. Now there is no rule whatever upon the subject; and instances are frequent, both in ancient and in modern grants, in...", "...It was not a kind thing to do, even though she _is_ so foolish; and I beg her pardon and yours, little daughter.\" Marjorie did not ask why her mother apologized to her.

Later in the day Mrs. Bellairs met him coming in extremely bored from her husband's office. \"I am going to pay some visits,\" she said, \"are you disposed to go with me?\" \"Most thankfully,\" he answered. \"I have been listening to half-a-dozen cases of trespass, not a single word of which I could understand. It will be doing me the greatest kindness to take me into civilized society.\" \"I thought,\" she said laughing, \"that you came to the backwoods to escape...", "...You could love that. You could love that always. \"He _says_ he asked you to release him. Did he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then why on earth didn't you?\" \"I did. But I couldn't release myself.\" \"But that's what you ought to have done. Instead of leaving him to do it.\" \"Oh, no. That would have been dishonourable to myself.\" \"You'd rather be jilted?\" \"Much rather. It's more honourable to be jilted than to jilt.\" \"That's not the world's idea of honour.\" \"It's my idea of it....

CHAPTER VI It was Warrenton who brought Master Geoffrey his red-armored steed and lance, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> all; for, although Robin had had a voice in the choosing of the horse, and had helped the retainer to bind the shaft and interlace the cuirass and gyres with riband such as the knight had ordered, events stayed Robin from going out with these appurtenances of war to the Lady's Bower. Young Fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the Squire. There befell an anxious interview, Mistress Fitzooth arguing for and against...", "...and on making some acknowledgment I was released. I will, however, relate this story rather more in detail. On that day I had been engaged with Jane Ray, in carrying into effect a plan of revenge upon another person, when I fell under the vindictive spirit of some of the old nuns, and suffered severely. The Superior ordered me to the cells, and a scene of violence commenced which I will not attempt to describe, nor the precise circumstances which led to it. Suffice it to say, that <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> exhausting my strength, by resisting as long as I could against several nuns, I had my hands drawn behind my back, a leathern band passed first round my thumbs, then round my hands, and then round my waist, and fastened. This was drawn so tight that it cut through the flesh of my thumbs, making wounds, the scars of which still remain. A gag was then forced into my mouth, not indeed so violently as it sometimes was, but roughly enough; after which I was taken by main force, and...", "...and refining those, maybe long dead, who have looked upon it.--If there were no possibility of more such fiddles, more such china, their loss would be an infinitely more serious matter; but on this the sad-glad old Persian admonishes us:-- .... fear not lest Existence, closing your Account and mine, should know the like no more; The Eternal Saki from the bowl has pour'd Millions of Bubbles like us, and shall pour.

Her lovely forms are all safely housed in her memory, and beauty and goodness sleep secure in her heart, in spite of all the arrows of death.\" Without saving what they are, or which of them he considers at all convincing, Mr. Le Gallienne observes that the arguments as to a future life are \"probably stronger on the side of belief\"--which is rather a curious expression. But, whichever theory be true, it \"does not really much matter.\"...", "...them: the public may flatly contradict us in one case, but it never can in the other; it is easy to prove that a man is alive, but utterly impossible to prove that he is in health.

What if the afflicted individual himself write us word that he never was better in his life? We have only mysteriously to shake our heads and observe that to contradict is not to prove, that it is little likely that our authority should have been mistaken, and (we are very fond of an historical comparison), beg our readers to remember that when Cardinal Richelieu was dying, nothing enraged him so much as hinting that he was ill. In short, if Horace is right, we are the...", "...It would thus appear that depression and stimulation is entirely a matter of dosage. Gescheidlen, in his researches on the frog, found the motor nerves at first excited, and then depressed. When the doses were large, there was scarcely any excitement, but the reverse effect, in the neighbourhood of the place of application. According to other observers, the function of the motor nerves may be annihilated.[386] According to Meihuizen, reflex action, at first much diminished, is later, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> several hours, normal, and later still again increased. The intestinal movements are transitorily increased. In the dog there has been noticed a greater flow of saliva than usual, and the flow of bile from the gall-bladder is diminished.

I eagerly grasped the first moments of freedom: three or four weeks in Hampshire and London were employed in the preparations of my journey, and the farewell visits of friendship and civility: my last act in town was to applaud Mallet's new tragedy of Elvira; a post-chaise conveyed me to Dover, the packet to Boulogne, and such was my diligence, that I reached Paris on Jan. 28, 1763, only thirty-six days <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the disbanding of the militia. Two or three years were loosely defined for the term of my absence; and I was left at liberty to spend that time in such places and in such a manner as was most agreeable to my taste and judgment. In this first visit I passed three months and a half, (Jan. 28-May 9,) and a much longer space might have been agreeably filled, without any intercourse with the natives.

There are still gypsies on Esher common; I came across quite a settlement once, walking over the common to Cobham on a sunny morning <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> late April snow. The common was patched with sparkling white and blue; the snow lay in blue shadows unmelted under the gorse bushes, and among the gorse and sodden bracken twenty ponies snuffed for grass. Three gypsy boys shuffled through the fern near them. What did they do with the ponies? I asked, and the eldest told me they sold them; they were good ponies; he was voluble in suburban English. What did they fetch? That depended.

Mothers belonging to the merchant class arrayed their marriageable daughters in their best attire; hung about their necks not only all the jewels which formed a part of their dowries, but also, it is said, the silver ladles, forks, and spoons; and took them to the Summer Garden, to be inspected and...", "...man or two and another young woman were all called in to interview us, under the excuse of explaining matters. These desired to know where we came from, how long we were stopping, and whither we intended going, taking the greatest interest in our answers, and evidently mentally making a detailed inventory of every article of our dress and feature on our face.

Once more tears gathered in his eyes. \"Robert,\" said he, \"I never did make pretension to being a Christian, or a praying person, but if we do not thank God all of us for this when we get ashore, we do not deserve to live.\" \"Amen!\" said Robert; and Mary and Frank responded, \"Amen!\" The shore was full seven miles away.

But gladly did they draw aboard their anchor, raise their sail, and make toward it. The sea was smooth, but there was wind enough to fill their sails, and give promise of their reaching the shore ere night. Robert took the helm, and Harold managed the sails.

The painter further promised to make a correct copy of the portrait as it was, then to skilfully erase from the original, without injury, the disfiguring additions that had been made, leaving it as when first painted. This was a bold proposition, and a bold undertaking; but the artist was one of eminence, and the college government, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> due deliberation, decided to let him make the trial. He did so, and was perfectly successful, as the two pictures prove. The original, divested of the foreign frippery that had been added in the way of costume and head drapery, now presents a sweet, sad, pensive face, far more beautiful, and in features resembling those of the painting of the decapitated head of the queen at Abbotsford.

One banker expressed the general attitude by saying: \"If the Heidlemanns...", "...all over now; and that was the very door through which the Vice-Chancellor was accustomed to escape from his assassins! * * * * * Jack sighed again; passed through, picked up the parcel of clothes that lay in the window-seat, unhitched the hammock in which Frank had slept last night (he noticed the ends of three cigarettes placed on the cover of a convenient biscuit-tin), and went off resembling a _retiarius_.

In the early ages of the Church notorious sinners, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> being absolved, were sentenced to long public penances. By sincere sorrow, an indulgence or remission of some of the time was granted them. Public confession and public penances have passed away. These public penances are replaced by pious devotions.

Yet somewhere in the rare moments of her crowded days--and one can imagine how far apart those moments must have been--she put into verse \"a compleat Discourse and Description of The Four Elements, Constitutions, Ages of Man, Seasons of the Year; Together with an exact Epitome of the four Monarchies, viz., the Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, Roman\" [this means _five_ long poems, and not two];...", "...the Irish prisons--seditious, conspiring, dangerous--were drafted for the king's service. The admiralty pursued its course of seizing men of the mercantile marine, taking them aboard ships, keeping them away for months from the harbours of the kingdom, and then, when their ships returned, denying them the right of visiting their homes. The press-gangs did not confine their activities to the men of the mercantile marine. From the streets after dusk they caught and brought in, often <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> ill-treatment, torn from their wives and sweethearts, knocked on the head for resisting, tradesmen with businesses, young men studying for the professions, idlers, debtors, out-of-work men. The marvel is that the British fleets fought as well as they did. Poverty and sorrow, loss and bereavement, were in every street, peeped mournfully out of every window, lurked at street corners. From all parts of the world adventurers came to renew their fortunes in the turmoil of London,...", "...as it appears to himself. I feel this strongly in reading other men's recollections of their early years. There are, however, a few notable exceptions, the best one I know being Serge Aksakoff's _History of His Childhood;_ and in his case the picture was not falsified, simply because the temper, and tastes, and passions of his early boyhood--his intense love of his mother, of nature, of all wildness, and of sport--endured unchanged in him to the end and kept him a boy in heart, able <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> long years to revive the past mentally, and picture it in its true, fresh, original colours. And I can say of myself with regard to this primitive faculty and emotion--this sense of the supernatural in natural things, as I have called it--that I am on safe ground for the same reason; the feeling has never been wholly outlived.

This was usually the way when anything not very pleasant had occurred, or when anything had had been said that it was not agreeable to recall. It was Mr Snow who began the conversation. \"Well, what do you think of all that talk?\" asked he, when his wife sat down, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> a rather protracted putting away of various articles in boxes and drawers. \"Oh! I think little of it--just what I have ay thought--that yon is a meddlesome, short-sighted woman. It is a pity her daughter hasna the sense to see it.\" \"Oh!

'You don't know what my father is.' 'Neither do you, Gilbert. Let that be the first token of sincerity.' Without leaving space for another word, Mr. Ferrars went through the conservatory into the garden, where, meeting the children, he took the little one in his arms, and sent Maurice to fetch his mamma. Albinia came down, looking so much heated and harassed, that he was...", "...my son, as the priests say of what is heard in confession.\" This statement, which made clear a good deal of what De Courval had heard in the German's delirium, was less singular to him than it would have seemed to-day.

The letter was addressed to Baron Georg von Metzsch at Dresden.

He wrote a reply, and as Imperial messenger I returned at once to Potsdam, handing it to the Emperor as he strode alone from the Shell Saloon, through which he was passing <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> dinner. He took it from my hand without a word. The All-Highest never bestows thanks upon those who obey his orders. It is, indeed, said to-day that Hindenburg has never once, during his whole official career, been verbally thanked by his Imperial Master.

He had not intended to lie when he told the jury that he was not quite sure he had never witnessed two signatures by Sir Joseph Mason on the same day, nor did he lie when he told them again that he had witnessed three.

With regard to Bridget Bolster, he had no hesitation whatever in telling the jury that she was a woman unworthy of belief,--unworthy of that credit which the jury must place in her before they could convict any one on her unaided testimony.

Indeed the greatest firmness and forbearance were necessary on our part to prevent the unfortunate sufferers from committing fatal excesses.

It was in vain to represent to him the injury done to my character by the sudden removal of one who had been with me from my earliest years, and was so greatly in my esteem and confidence; he could not give an ear to my reasons, being firmly bound by the promise he had made to the King. Accordingly, Torigni left me that very day, and went to the house of a relation, M. Chastelas. I was so greatly offended with this fresh indignity, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> so many of the kind formerly received, that I could not help yielding to resentment; and my grief and concern getting the upper hand of my prudence, I exhibited a great coolness and indifference towards my husband. Le Guast and Madame de Sauves were successful in creating a like indifference on his part, which, coinciding with mine, separated us altogether, and we neither spoke to each other nor slept in the same bed. A few days after this, some faithful servants about the...", "...novel, there are a thousand who can get not more than a fifteenth of those prices. \"On the whole, I think that the effect of the cheap monthlies has been good.

Of course, it does happen now and then, but not often enough to make me impatient for their coming.

It didn't apply to the industrial conditions of today, for they didn't know anything about the industrial conditions of today, but they imagined that they were so wise that lest people one hundred and twenty-five years later should think they knew more they would tie things up so that we could not make a fool of ourselves, to the third or fourth generation <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> they were dead. (Laughter). And so they wrote down a constitution which meant that whatever the American people wanted to do a hundred, or two hundred, or five hundred years afterward, they could not do it unless it agreed with the constitution that had already been written down or unless they changed it.

Then as the weeks passed and the world settled into this new shape and form, thoughts of Francis Breton returned to her. She had written to him soon <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> the accident, but that was for herself, that she might clear her mind of anything except her husband, rather than for Breton. She had considered him whilst she wrote that letter, had seen him as someone in her old, old life, someone who had stirred her then but possessed now no power to move her.

Among the scattered bands, at some distance below, I caught a glimpse of Maxwell; and while I was looking, a light wreath of white smoke curled away from his gun, from which I was too far to hear the report. Nearer, and between me and the hills, towards which they were directing their course, was the body of the herd, and giving my horse the rein, we dashed <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> them. A thick cloud of dust hung upon their rear, which filled my mouth and eyes, and nearly smothered me. In the midst of this I could see nothing, and the buffalo were not distinguishable until within thirty feet. They crowded together more densely still as I came upon them, and rushed along in such a compact body, that I could not obtain an entrance--the horse almost leaping upon them. In a few moments the mass divided to the right and left, the horns clattering with a noise...", "...or to be unhappy.

So while Corrie was walking through his five miles of desolate, dark road, the evening became well under way in the country parlor; sick-room no longer. There had been changes in the room since Gerard's occupancy of it.

Thou art not at all <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> my mind, thou goest about with jibes and jeers, with scorn and mocking; but that is not my turn of mind. That is why thou gettest on so well with Hallgerda, because ye two have your minds more alike.\" Gunnar scolded him a long time, and he answered him well, and said he would follow his counsel more for the time to come than he had followed it hitherto. Gunnar told him then they might get on together. Gunnar and Njal kept up their friendship though the rest of their people saw...", "...gloom. \"See this beautiful cala that has just opened in the garden,\" she would say, with an abortive attempt at making her believe that her ankle was strong and well. \"I cannot get up, miserable creature that I am,\" came back the dismal response. \"Oh, that lovely cloth-of-gold has grown a shoot full half a yard long since yesterday; come and see.\" \"I cannot.\" \"Yes, you can; come lean on me.

Oh, Nora, how can any one be unhappy with flowers to tend, and a home to keep?\" \"Ah! yes.

She knew her sister's proud spirit...", "...he brought collections of great value and extent. During these arduous journeys his health had several times suffered most severely, and he was more than once reduced by fever to a state of extreme exhaustion; but up to this time the strength of his constitution enabled him to triumph over the attacks of disease, and the energy of his mind was so great, that the first days of convalescence found him again as actively employed as ever. \"On his return to Calcutta in August 1841, <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> visiting Simla and the Nerbudda, he was appointed to the medical duties at Malacca: but Dr. Wallich having proceeded to the Cape for the re-establishment of his health, Mr. Griffith was recalled in August 1842 to take, during his absence, the superintendence of the Botanic Garden near Calcutta, in conjunction with which he also discharged the duties of Botanical Professor in the Medical College to the great advantage of the students.

Fish is also a common article of diet; the natives usually eat it raw, even when it is rotten and stinking. They keep pigs, but seldom kill them except for a festival or at the reception of a stranger. Hence pork is not a regular or common article of diet with them; and apart from it they hardly taste flesh. Other sorts of food, such as bananas, taro, and sugar-cane, are entirely subsidiary to the great staples, bread-fruit and...", "...in the end to any philosophy which shall show what mighty moral conviction, what unspeakable spiritual invigoration, must needs grow out of comprehension of the despised Real. These thoughts are not remote abstractions, up in the air, out of reach, of no practical value or application; they touch the very life and soul of Harvard University. For want of such thoughts, many of the brightest and most intellectual of her students, graduates from the philosophical courses, go out year <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> year disbelieving totally in the possibility of arriving at any fundamental \"truth\" whatever, even in ethics.

In dealing with tramps and trespassers the plan is to keep up a continuous surveillance of them, and they are taken off trains one by one, day <span class=\"clocktext\">after</span> day, rather than in squads of fifty and sixty, with no more effort in this direction for weeks and sometimes months, as is the prevailing custom on most railroads. There is consequently very little crowding of magistrates' courts and jails, and the taxpayers are not forced to board and lodge a great collection of vagabonds.
