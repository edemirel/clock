Shortly stated, Huxley's argument was to the following effect: That Mark's Gospel is the oldest of the Synoptic Gospels, and that Mark's Gospel does not contain, nor even mention, the Sermon on the Mount.

That the Matthew version contains one hundred and seven verses, and the Luke version <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> verses. Huxley's conclusion is as follows: \"Matthew,\" having a _cento_ of sayings attributed--rightly or wrongly it is impossible to say--to Jesus among his materials, thought they were, or might be, records of a continuous discourse and put them in a place he thought likeliest.

Kotzebue's triumph was due in part to his great skill in stage-craft, and in part to his adroit appeal to the more superficial sentiments for social and political revolution that were everywhere stirring.

In one arroyo, which was about a thousand feet in length and of comparatively gentle slope, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> trincheras were counted from the bed of the main drainage to the summit of the mountain. Some of them were quite close together, three being within eighteen feet of one another. These trincheras somewhat resemble the small terrace gardens of the Moqui Indians, and have undoubtedly been used for agricultural purposes, just as they are used by the Tarahumares to this day (page 152). It is true that they are built in great numbers, sometimes in localities that would appear...", "...in their history; but this must not be imputed to them as a reproach. History, dark as it is on other points, shows clearly enough that this now abject and degraded race did cling with desperate and fatal tenacity to the memory of those ancestors whom they know not now; the records of their conquerors show the ruthless and savage policy pursued by the Spaniards to root this memory from their minds; and here, in this very town of Mani, we have a dark and memorable instance. In 1571, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years after the foundation of Merida, some Indians of Mani relapsed and became idolaters, practising in secret their ancient rites. Intelligence of their backsliding reached the ears of the provincial in Merida, who came to Mani in person, and forthwith established himself as inquisitor. Some who had died obstinately in the secret practice of idolatrous rites had been buried in sacred ground; he ordered their bodies to be dug up, and their bones thrown into the fields;...", "...thousand dollars a year. He had four thousand dollars left, and his tiny income of three hundred, when he went to Sally Seabrook, after having been sober for a month, and begged her to marry him. Before dissipation had made him look ten years older than he was, there had been no handsomer man in all America. Even yet he had a remarkable face: long, delicate, with dark-brown eyes, as fair a forehead as man could wish, and black, waving hair, streaked with gray--gray, though he was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years of age. When Sally was fifteen and he twenty-two, he had fallen in love with her and she with him; and nothing had broken the early romance. He had captured her young imagination, and had fastened his image on her heart. Her people, seeing the drift of things, had sent her to a school on the Hudson, and the two did not meet for some time.

At this time a permanent technical sub-committee was appointed by the Institution, whose object was, with the assistance of an eminent consulting naval architect--a new post created--and the Institution's official experts, to give its careful attention to the designing of improvements in the life-boat and its equipment, and to the scientific consideration of any inventions or proposals submitted by the public, with a view to adopting...", "...to those with whom she differed, she seemed to go out of her way to say the kindest things possible.

Taking me under his charge, he commenced with a new moon, and brought me down for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> successive mornings to the Euphrates, where he bathed me, apostrophizing the rising sun in a long formula, of which I never caught much; he gabbled indistinctly, like bad heralds at the Games; but he appeared to be invoking spirits.

When death resulted from injuries caused in falling down stairs, it was found that this person was a woman. She was fifty years of age, and had apparently spent the greater part of her life as a man. When employed in early life as a manservant on a farm, she had married her mistress's daughter. The pair were married for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years, but during the last six years lived apart, owing to the \"husband's\" dissipated habits. No one ever suspected her sex. She was of masculine appearance and good muscular development. The \"wife\" took charge of the body and buried it.

People tell of an old man of eighty-four whose heart beat only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> times in the sixty seconds. Observe that in all my calculations I have taken special care to prefix the word _about_ to the numbers mentioned. And this because, in point of fact, the heart is a capricious creature, which has no exact rules to go by.

Between their traditional system of legal juries and the new system of military tribunals the Ohio voters made their choice without hesitation. They rejected Vallandigham and sustained the Lincoln candidate by a majority of over a hundred thousand. That same year in New York the anti-Lincoln candidate for Secretary of State was defeated by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> thousand votes. Though these elections in 1863 can hardly be called the turning-point in the history of the Lincoln Government, yet it was clear that the tide of popularity which had ebbed so far away from Lincoln in the autumn of 1862 was again in the flood. Another phase of his stormy course may be thought of as having ended. And in accounting for this turn of the tide it must not be forgotten that between the nomination and the defeat of a Vallandigham the bloody...", "...the college library at Brunswick, Maine, two mementoes of his college life.

He entered Congress at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> and quickly rose to high political favor; he was elected to the Senate in 1837, being at that time its youngest member. During his term of office, he stood firm for his party against the opposing members, and yet so popular was he that when his hour of departure came, the senators crowded around him as though he were a personal friend, and no member of the Senate ever retired with warmer friends.

The third Whitehall received nine prisoners only--a catch of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> in all. \"You didn't get the Porpoise,\" the Centipede said exultantly, as though his escape materially diminished our success.

This included a list of 186 species of birds, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> were altogether new. A special feature of the paper was that it enabled him to mark out precisely the boundary line between the Indian and Australian zoological regions, and to trace the derivation of the rather peculiar fauna of these islands, partly from Australia and partly from the Moluccas, but with a strong recent migration of Javanese species due to the very narrow straits separating most of the islands from each other.

Some eight or ten years ago, Mr. Smith was the owner of large tracts of land, lying in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> counties in the State of New York, and came to the strange conclusion to give the most of it away. Consequently, three thousand lots of land, containing from thirty to one hundred acres each, were given to coloured men residing in the State--the writer of this being one of the number.

The two little girls whose faces the ladies of the first coaching-party saw at the farm-house windows had died away from them; two of the lank boys had escaped, and in the perpetual exile of California and Colorado had saved themselves alive. Their father talked of going, too, but ten years later he still dragged himself spectrally about the labors of the farm, with the same cough at sixty which made his oldest son at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> look scarcely younger than himself. II. One soft noon in the middle of August the farmer came in from the corn-field that an early frost had blighted, and told his wife that they must give it up. He said, in his weak, hoarse voice, with the catarrhal catching in it, that it was no use trying to make a living on the farm any longer. The oats had hardly been worth cutting, and now the corn was gone, and there was not hay enough without it to winter the stock; if...", "...with brilliant plumage, swam about in the water. Not far from the shore Prince Milan noticed thirty little white garments lying on the grass, and dismounting from his horse, he crept down under the high bulrushes, took one of the garments and hid himself with it behind the bushes which grew round the lake. The ducks swam about all over the place, dived down into the depths and rose again and glided through the waves. At last, tired of disporting themselves, they swam to the shore, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> of them put on their little white garments and instantly turned into so many beautiful maidens. Then they finished dressing and disappeared. Only the thirtieth little duck couldn't come to the land; it swam about close to the shore, and, giving out a piercing cry, it stretched its neck up timidly, gazed wildly around, and then dived under again. Prince Milan's heart was so moved with pity for the poor little creature that he came out from behind the bulrushes, to see if he...", "...turned southward, and in August, near the head waters of the Snake River, met two of his partners. Together they crossed the mountains to the source of the Big Horn, and then one went on to St. Louis. Early in 1830 he returned with eighty-two men and ten wagons. This was the first wagon train on the Oregon trail. [28] Wyeth had joined Kelley's party; but finding that it would not start for some time, he withdrew, and organized a company to trade in Oregon, and early in 1832, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> companions, left Boston, went to St. Louis, joined a band of trappers of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and went with them to a great Indian fair on the upper waters of the Snake River. There some of his companions deserted him, as others had done along the way. With the rest Wyeth reached Fort Vancouver, where the company went to pieces, and in 1833 Wyeth returned to Boston.

At the entrance sat the boy, whose voice is even now ringing in my ears, rattling a bag of balls, drawing them out, and calling off the numbers. Along the corridor was a rough table with a row of candles in the centre, and benches on each side were occupied by the villagers, without distinction of persons, with papers and grains of corn before them, the same as at Merida. The largest sum called off was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> reals. One real was deducted from every dollar for the particular object of the lottery, and the fund which the boy had obtained by such a potent use of his voice then amounted to sixty-three dollars. There were several performers giving out somewhat equivocal music, without which nothing in that country could go on long, and occasionally two reals were drawn from the purse for them. All entered who pleased. There was no regulation of dress or etiquette, but much quiet...", "...had forfeited every halfpenny of his money if she married before her daughter and by an ingenious stroke did the same if she failed to find a husband during the ensuing six months.

She was perfectly happy in the ridiculous attentions and elderly gallantries of Major Tarry and Justice Moon. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> she had still possessed enough florid beauty to excuse her ill-spelled love-letters. Moreover, she had a husband and was safe sport for young gentlemen who lost the hounds somewhat early in the day. When she was widowed, most of her attraction vanished. She grew fat and had to content herself with middle-aged suitors for whom she became a placid ideal on the dull journey of their lives. Mrs. Courteen continued to fan herself.

Complaint is made, however, in the same number, of the fact that there is a meager supply of apples, plums and pears from the Willamette, and that the apples sell for twenty-five cents apiece, or fifty cents a pound. The _Statesman_ of September 27th has the story of Walter Davis of Dry Creek sending a squash of a weight of 134-1/2 pounds and twelve potatoes of a weight of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> pounds to the Oregon State Fair at Salem. Lamentable to narrate it appears later that these specimens of Walla Walla gardening disappeared. The _Statesman_ indulges in some bitter scorn over the kind of people on the other side who would steal such objects.

Schroeder found that on an average of twenty-six cases in which boys were born, the conception had taken place 10.08 days after menstruation; on an average of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> cases in which girls were born, 9.76 days after.

Yet the general rule that the monarch was to belong to the race of Miledh was adhered to almost without exception. One hundred and eighteen sovereigns, according to the moat accredited annals, governed the whole island from the Milesian conquest to St. Patrick in 432. Of these, sixty were of the family of Heremon, settled in the northern part of the island; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> of the posterity of Heber, settled in the south; twenty-four of that of Ir; three issued from Lugaid, the son of Ith. All these were of the race of Miledh; one only was a _firbolg_, or plebeian, and one a woman. It is certainly very remarkable that for so long a time--nearly two thousand years, according to the best chronologists--Ireland was ruled by princes of the same family. The fact is unparalleled in history, and shows that the people were firmly attached to their...", "...the messenger from Fort Hall, met Lee, and delivered his packages to him at the Shawnee mission, and received from Lee the price agreed upon.

I have said that in December, 1838, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> persons connected with the Protestant missions in the country. This is not strictly true, Rev.

The Assyrian month commenced on the evening when the new moon was first observed, or, in case the moon was not visible, the new month started thirty days after the last month. Since the actual lunar period is about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> and one-half days, a practical adjustment was required between the months themselves, and this was probably effected by counting alternate months as Only 29 days in length. Mr. R. Campbell Thompson(10) is led by his studies of the astrological tablets to emphasize this fact. He believes that \"the object of the astrological reports which related to the appearance of the moon and sun was to help determine and foretell the length of the lunar month.\" Mr. Thompson believes also...", "...The platform was made and submitted to him. He approved of it. It indorsed the Compromises. But again there was an old soldier in the field, in the person of General Scott. He had fought the British in 1812. He had made treaties with the Sauk, Fox, Winnebago, and Sioux tribes after the Black Hawk War. Yes, he had made a brilliant record in the Mexican War. In mental stature he was up to the knees of Webster, and no more. But Webster had no imaginative appeal. He could only pull <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> votes on the first ballot, as against Scott's one hundred and thirty-one votes. Webster never had more than thirty-two votes. On the fifty-third ballot Scott was nominated. And in a few months Webster died, and left the tangles of statecraft to other hands. Who was Franklin Pierce?

In 1171, we find the murder of a child at Orleans, or Blois, causing capital punishment to be inflicted on several Jews. Imputations of this horrible character were continually renewed during the Middle Ages, and were of very ancient origin; for we hear of them in the times of Honorius and Theodosius the younger; we find them reproduced with equal vehemence in 1475 at Trent, where a furious mob was excited against the Jews, who were accused of having destroyed a child <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> months old named Simon. The tale of the martyrdom of this child was circulated widely, and woodcut representations of it were freely distributed, which necessarily increased, especially in Germany, the horror which was aroused in the minds of Christians against the accursed nation (Fig. 361).

He speaks of Sevier's troops as only two hundred in number; and says twenty-eight Indians were killed. He does not speak of the number of the Indians, but from the way he describes Sevier's troops as encircling them, he evidently knew that the white men were more numerous than their foes. His mistake as to the number of Indian dead is easily explicable. The official report gives <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> as the number killed in the entire campaign, and Haywood, as in the Island Flats battle, simply puts the total of several skirmishes into one. Thirty years later comes Ramsey. He relies on traditions that have grown more circumstantial and less accurate.

Further combinations will be seen by a glance at the Ursa Major swastika (fig. 4). The analysis of the Ursa Minor swastika is not so simple and occasions a certain perplexity.

Most of the great poets established their fame before they were thirty years old--Keats and Shelley died at twenty-five and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> respectively. But nowadays the poet of forty-five is still called young and the poet of thirty our kind critics consider a precocious infant. As a matter of stern fact, it is doubtful that American literature has really lost much by Moody's death.

About the year 1642 it became a royal monopoly, and afterwards, in order to encourage its growth in the colonies, and thereby increase the revenue of the Crown, Parliament prohibited the planting of it in England. The average quantity shipped from the North American colonies to the parent country, for ten years preceding the year 1709, was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> millions of pounds.

The extreme length of the route agreed upon from St. Louis to San Francisco was two thousand seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles; the most southern point was six hundred miles south of South Pass on the old Salt Lake route. Because of the out-of-the-way southern course followed, two and one half days more than necessary were nominally-required in making the journey. Yet the postal authorities believed that this would be more than offset by the southerly course being to a great extent free from winter snows.

At that period of the day the whole population of each village is on the alert; and quitting the dark rooms in which they had sheltered from the heat of the day, men, women, and children gather on the roofs; animation, mirth, and the din of tongues, takes place of the silence of day, and the observer is never weary of watching the picturesque scenes formed by the various groups engaged in their household occupations. At Koktebel, a little village on the sea shore, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> versts from Soudagh, the sombre headland Kara Dagh terminates the bolder scenery of the Crimea. Beyond that point the country presents no picturesque features; vast plains gradually succeed the hills, and as the traveller advances he is forewarned by various tokens of his approach to the steppes, which form all the northern part of the peninsula, and extend eastward of the old Genoese colony to the shores of the Cimmerian Bosphorus.

Doctors Percy Frankland and Templeman have shown that the spore form of the anthrax bacillus is able to successfully challenge all such attempts upon its vitality. Thus when put into water and frozen at a temperature of -20 deg. C., the process being extended over a period of three months and interrupted no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> times by thawings, when examined even after this severe series of shocks, it showed no signs of submission and clung to life as tenaciously as ever. The more sensitive form of anthrax, however, the bacillus, was readily destroyed; for after one freezing its numbers were already so much reduced that it was only with difficulty that even one or two could be found, and after the second freezing every one out of the large number originally present had died.

The particular remark which elicited this letter was made by Mr. Chatterton, the Tory candidate for the Crewe division. It was that 'in his fiftieth year Mr. Gladstone was in full sympathy with the Tory party.' Mr. Gladstone, in his letter, put forward ten propositions: 'It is true that down to the year 1839, when I was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years old, I might fairly be called a Tory of the Tories in questions relating to the Church. (2) It is untrue that even at that time I could justly be so described in other questions.

A clerk from the Post-Office certified to the fact that they had passed through the post, and that he had seen them opened, read, and copied. Atterbury, as well he might, asked for the authority for this practice; and, especially, if the Secretary of State had directed that his letters should be interfered with? A majority in the House of Lords decided that the question need not be answered. It is pleasant to relate that <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> peers recorded an indignant protest against this decision. One of them proposed to cross-examine the Rev. (!) Edward Willes, \"one of His Majesty's Post-Office decipherers,\" but the majority going to a still greater length, resolved: \"That it is the opinion of this House that it is not consistent with the public safety to ask the decipherers any questions which may tend to _discover the art or mystery of deciphering_.\"[120] Again, at the trial of Horne Tooke for high treason...", "...the Baconians is that a man of {213} Shakespeare's limited education could not have written plays replete with so many kinds of learning. This argument is weak at both ends. It assumes as true that Shakespeare had a limited education and that his plays are full of knowledge learned from books rather than from life. The first of these points rests on vague tradition only, and the second is still a debatable question. But even if we admit these two points, what then? Shakespeare was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years old and had probably lived in London for five or six years when the first book from his hand appeared in its present form. Any man capable of writing _Hamlet_ could educate himself during several years in the heart of a great city.

Except to the mind of an ardent Baconian many of these show no likeness whatever.

We are now in a position to sum up the policy of the Central Authority, with regard to outdoor relief to the able-bodied, as it stood in 1847, embodied in documents applicable to three different parts of England and Wales. In thirty-two unions the Labour Test Order of 1842 was alone in force, whilst in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> others the regulations were essentially similar to this. In this part of the country the discretion of the local authorities to give outdoor relief to able-bodied independent women (as to other independent women) was unfettered by any regulation, and not directed by any instructions. Outdoor relief to able-bodied men and their families was within the discretion of the local authorities, if it was accompanied by test work by the man and subject to certain conditions.

This place stands at an elevation of five thousand six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> feet. Humboldt Wells, as they are designated, give celebrity to the place, which was a great watering-station in the days of the old emigrant travel. The emigrants always rejoiced when they had passed the perils of the Great American Desert and arrived at these springs, where there was always plenty of pure water and an abundance of grass for the weary animals. Hence it was a favorite camping-ground before the existence of the Pacific Railroad. The wells are very deep.

In 523 Cassiodorus writes of the \"innumerosa navigia\" belonging to Venice, and where trade is active there is always a probability that manufactures will flourish. However this may be, the earliest positive evidence of the existence at Venice of a worker in glass would seem to be the mention of Petrus Flavianus, phiolarius, in the ducale of Vitale Falier in the year 1090. In 1224 <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> persons are mentioned as friolari (i.e. phiolari), and in the same century \"mariegole,\" or codes of trade regulations, were drawn up (_Monografia della vetraria Veneziana e Muranese_, p. 219). The manufacture had then no doubt attained considerable proportions: in 1268 the glass-workers became an incorporated body; in their processions they exhibited decanters, scent-bottles and the like; in 1279 they made, among other things, weights and measures.

(2) _Criminality of the Negro._ One of the most important features of the negro problem in the United States is the strong tendency among the negroes toward crime; and this, as we have just seen, is especially manifest in those of mixed origin. Professor Willcox has shown that in 1890 there were in the South six white prisoners to every ten thousand whites, but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> negro prisoners to every ten thousand negroes, while in the North there were twelve white prisoners to every ten thousand whites, but sixty-nine negro prisoners to every ten thousand negroes. These statistics show that the negro is everywhere more criminal than the white, and that his tendency toward crime increases as we go North, doubtless largely because in the North he is in a strange and more complex environment and finds greater difficulty in making social...", "...witch-trials preserved for the wonder of succeeding ages, that of Wurzburg, from 1627 to 1629, is the most frightful. Hauber, who has preserved this list in his \"Acta et Scripta Magica,\" says, in a note at the end, that it is far from complete, and that there were a great many other burnings too numerous to specify. This record, which relates to the city only, and not to the province of Wurzburg, contains the names of one hundred and fifty-seven persons, who were burned in two years in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> burnings, averaging from five to six at a time. The list comprises three play-actors, four innkeepers, three common councilmen of Wurzburg, fourteen vicars of the cathedral, the burgomaster's lady, an apothecary's wife and daughter, two choristers of the cathedral, Gobel Babelin the prettiest girl in the town, and the wife, the two little sons, and the daughter of the councillor Stolzenberg.

I am certain that there were not at any one time. I am also certain that more than double as many young birds left those nestings than all the birds caught, killed or destroyed. The morning that the Crooked nesting broke, I was out at daylight, and at the net to see and help one of my men make a strike; for an hour and a half a continuous body of birds half a mile wide and very thick was going out; our strike was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> dozen, twenty-five dozen young and four dozen old, about the same proportion as the other catchers. This showed that of the immense body over five-sixths were young birds, barely old enough ones remaining to guide the body of young, and this was out of the nesting from which the bulk of the birds had been caught, where the destruction had been the greatest.

On completing this course the final vows were taken, at an age of from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> to thirty-two. The training to- day is still longer. To become a teacher in the inferior classes required training until twenty-one at least, and for college (secondary) classes training until at least twenty-nine.

Although the Negro population of Boston has been steadily increasing, the number of marriages between the races, which remained about stationary from 1875 to 1890, has since 1900 been rapidly decreasing.

The most extraordinary efforts had been made to purge this army of non-combatants and of sick men, for we knew well that there was to be no place of safety save with the army itself; our wagons were loaded with ammunition, provisions, and forage, and we could ill afford to haul even sick men in the ambulances, so that...", "...you to live, Morrel, it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life.\" \"Oh, heavens,\" said the young man, \"oh, heavens--what are you saying, count?

It is possible that the London dockers' strike was not without its influence on the minds of the Australian Labour leaders.

A strike of the Newcastle miners, after lasting <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> weeks, came to an end in January 1890, and throughout the rest of the year there was great unrest in Labour circles. On the 6th of September the silver mines closed down, and a week later a conference of employers issued a manifesto which was met next day by a counter-manifesto of the Intercolonial Labour Conference, and almost immediately afterwards by the calling out of 40,000 men.

It was not until 1840 that he began manufacturing reapers for the market. In that year he constructed one and sold it to a neighbor. For the harvest of 1843 he made and sold <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> machines. These had all been built upon the home farm by hand, the workmen being himself, his father, and his brothers.

Some of these vessels foundered at sea, others were wrecked or accidentally burnt, and it was at the close of this eventful year that a calamity occurred which equalled, if it did not surpass, any previous disaster.

She was much courted in the fashionable circles of London for her literary and conversational talents, and numbered Sir Walter Scott, Sir James Mackintosh, Wordsworth and Sydney Smith among her friends and acquaintances.

A Spanish horse was presented to him, and he was armed in polished steel, and with a helmet covered with precious stones; his gilded spurs were buckled on, and his sword and lance given to him. He sprung on horseback without putting his foot in the stirrup, and six days were spent in jousting with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> young nobles, who were knighted at the same time. At the close of the tourney, Henry conferred on him the accolade, or sword-blow, which was the chief part of the ceremony. Henry had great difficulty in making his daughter consent to the marriage.

It was pitiful to see them. In the morning they had to be lifted up and put on their feet; they had not strength enough to raise themselves. When they had staggered on a little way and got some warmth into their bodies, they seemed to be rather better -- at any rate,...", "...excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his domain. The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However, during the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six days; then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a height of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared propitious for an excursion. The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the _Bonadventure_, anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of some duration. Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed that he should take part in it; but Ayrton preferring to remain on shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the absence of his companions....", "...two hundred and seventy-three. The subject of national education was introduced in the lords on the 5th of July, by the Archbishop of Canterbury; who, after defending the clergy from the attacks made on them by certain parties in regard to this government scheme, and entering into some details of the progress of education in this country, moved a series of resolutions condemnatory of the proposed system of education; and the resolutions were carried by a majority of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> against one hundred and eighteen. In consequence of this majority the lords went in a body to her majesty to offer their remonstrance against the proposed alteration in the manner of distributing the educational grant. At a later period of the session Lord Brougham brought forward his plan for educating the people; but its merits were not canvassed by the house, and the consideration of it was adjourned till next session.

He gathered about him a body of adherents, but although he had a great reputation as an individual pirate, it seems to have been a good while before he achieved any success as a leader. The fortunes of Peter and his men must have been at a pretty low ebb when they found themselves cruising in a large, canoe-shaped boat not far from the island of Hispaniola. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> of them in all, and they were not able to procure a vessel suitable for their purpose. They had been a long time floating about in an aimless way, hoping to see some Spanish merchant-vessel which they might attack and possibly capture, but no such vessel appeared. Their provisions began to give out, the men were hungry, discontented, and grumbling. In fact, they were in almost as bad a condition as were the sailors of Columbus just before they discovered signs of land,...", "...through the frail curtains she could see the rounded moon over the roofs and beyond it on the sky the yellow glow from Times Square--and watching the two incongruous lights, her mind worked over an emotion, or rather an interwoven complex of emotions, that had occupied it through the day, and the day before that and back to the last time when she could remember having thought clearly and consecutively about anything--which must have been while Anthony was in the army. She would be <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> in February. The month assumed an ominous and inescapable significance--making her wonder, through these nebulous half-fevered hours whether after all she had not wasted her faintly tired beauty, whether there was such a thing as use for any quality bounded by a harsh and inevitable mortality.

The crenellations of the palace walls consist of two rectangular masses, of unequal size, placed one upon the other. The lower is two bricks'-length, or about thirty-two inches, wide, and the thickness of three bricks, or about fourteen inches, high. The upper mass equals the lower in height, while its width is the length of a single brick, or sixteen inches. The total height of the battlement, between twenty-eight and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> inches, is thus divided into two masses, one of which is twice the size of the other (see Fig. 104). The battlements are all the same, and between each pair is a void which is nothing but the space a battlement upside down would occupy. Fill this space with the necessary bricks, and a section of wall would be restored identical in bond with that below the battlements, with the one exception that the highest block of the battlement, being only one brick wide, is formed by...", "...as much fun as it is when you let us have some weight to hold us down.\" \"Hard to tell exactly, Dottie. If we had precisely four times their acceleration and had started from the same place, we would of course overtake them in just the number of days they had the start of us, since the distance covered at any constant positive acceleration is proportional to the square of the time elapsed. However, there are several complicating factors in the actual situation. We started out not only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days behind them, but also a matter of five hundred thousand light-years of distance. It will take us quite a while to get to their starting-point.

One of the most heartrending disasters, which have befallen the modern lifeboat, happened on the night of the 9th of December 1886. The lifeboats at Southport and St. Anne's went out in a furious gale to rescue the crew of a German vessel named the _Mexico_. Both were capsized, and twenty-seven out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> who manned them were drowned. It was afterwards found out that the Southport boat succeeded in making the wreck, and was about to let down her anchor when she was capsized by a heavy sea. Contrary to all expectations the boat did not right, being probably prevented from doing so by the weight of the anchor which went overboard when the boat upset. What happened to the St. Anne's lifeboat can never be known, for not one of her crew was saved to tell the tale. It is...", "...week in rational-emotive therapy is really, then, like a tutorial session with a teacher. The client-students talk about their feelings; the therapist criticizes underlying irrational beliefs and makes it clear to the clients what a rational response would be. Then the clients are asked to practice applying rational beliefs on their own, outside of therapy. Gradually, a more rational way of looking at things takes the place of the old habits.

He had been a pitcher on the Red Sox and had done fine work in the box. It was only after he had been playing some time in that position that he himself, as well as others, began to realize the tremendous strength that resided in his batting arm and shoulders. He was a left handed batter, so that most of his hits went into right field, or rather into the right field bleachers, where they counted as home runs. In one season he accumulated <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> home runs, which was a record for the major leagues. The Yankee owners made a deal with the Red Sox by which the \"Kid\" was brought to the New York club at a price larger than had ever been paid for a player. It was a good investment, however, for the newcomer was excelling his home run record of the year before and drew so many people to the parks where he played that a constant golden stream flowed into the strong boxes of the club.

Surely no young man of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> more needed all the human qualities than Friedrich now. The threatenings, the seductions, big Belleisle hallucinations,--the perils to you infinite, if you MISS the road. Friedrich did not miss it, as is well known; he managed to pick it out from that enormous jumble of the elements, and victoriously arrived by it, he alone of them all.

Schwann was himself, as his later work showed, more a physiologist than a morphologist; he did quite fundamental work on enzymes, discovering and isolating the pepsin of the gastric juice; he proved that yeast was not an inorganic precipitate but a mass of living cells; he carried out experiments directed to show that spontaneous generation does not occur. We shall see in his treatment of the cell-theory clear indications of his physiological turn of mind. Schwann was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> when his master-work appeared, and the book is clearly the work of a young man. It has the clear structure, the logical finish, which the energy of youth imparts to its chosen work. So the work of Rathke's prime, the _Anatomische-philosophische Untersuchungen_ of 1832 shows more vigour and a more reasoned structure than his later papers. Schwann's book is indeed a model of construction and cumulative argument, and even for this reason alone justly deserves to rank as a...", "...pleased, at our own charge, except the carriage of his goods.

But they refused to unite on any one, and on the fourth ballot sixty-nine of them voted with the Southern Whigs and secured the nomination of Zachary Taylor.

At that time a merchantman could be turned into a capable fighting ship by adding strengthening timbers and providing the necessary guns. Such a ship, when commissioned as a privateer by the United States government, could capture the enemy's merchantmen and on occasion fight small cruisers. For instance, the brig _Yankee_, 160 tons burden, eighteen guns, 120 men, captured <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> prizes, one of which sold for more than $500,000. The money was divided equally between the owners and the men on board. The privateers together captured about 2,000 British vessels; though over 1,500 American vessels were captured by the English. The whole British nation felt the shock of this unexpected naval resistance; and it was the pressure of the shippers and shipowners of England which caused that power to make favorable terms of peace.

In 1880 were enumerated in the United States no less than one hundred and forty-two seminaries, representing all sects, orders, and schools of theological opinion, employing five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> resident professors.[252:1] To Andover, in the very first years of its great history, came Mills and others of the little Williams College circle; and at once their infectious enthusiasm for the advancement of the kingdom of God was felt throughout the institution. The eager zeal of these young men brooked no delay. In June, 1810, the General Association of Massachusetts met at the neighboring town of Bradford; there four of the students, Judson, Nott, Newell, and Hall,...", "...enclose towns and cities; and the said Saturn was the first to build the city of Sutri, called Saturna, and it was so called after his name; and in that country, by his care, grain was first sown, wherefore the dwellers therein held him for a god; and Janus himself, which was lord thereof, made him his partner, and gave him a share in the kingdom. This Saturn reigned thirty-four years in Italy, and after him reigned Picus his son thirty-one years; and after Picus reigned Faunus his son <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years, and was slain by his people. The two sons of Faunus were Lavinus and Latinus. This Lavinus built the city of Lavina. And Lavinus reigned but a short time; and when he was dead the kingdom was left to Latinus, which changed the name of the city of Lavina to Laurentia, because on the chief tower thereof there grew a great laurel tree. The said Latinus reigned thirty-two years, and was very wise; and he much bettered the Latin tongue. This King Latinus had only one most...", "...experience of them.

The remainder of the force reached the Kimberley to Mafeking railway line in the direction of Kraaipan, the spot where the first bloodshed of the war had occurred some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> months before. On Lord Methuen himself no blame can rest for this unsuccessful action. If the workman's tool snaps in his hand he cannot be held responsible for the failure of his task.

The fate of Amaziah (\"Jehovah is strong\"), son of Joash of Judah, resembles in some respects that of his father. Both began to reign prosperously: the happiness of both ended in disaster. Amaziah at his accession was twenty-five years old. He was the son of a lady of Jerusalem named Jehoaddin. He reigned <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years, of which the later ones were passed in misery, peril, and degradation, and, like the unhappy Joash, and at about the same age, he fell the victim of domestic conspiracy. The hereditary principle was too strongly established to enable the murderers of Joash to set it aside, but Amaziah was not at first strong enough to make any head against them. In time he became established in his kingdom, and then his earliest act was to bring the head conspirators, Jozacar and...", "...up the arquebus he might one day cease to be the anvil and become the hammer. But there was no thought for the common weal; each order wrangled for its own privileges, and their meeting-place was closed on the pretext that the hall was wanted for a royal ballet.

In 1920, juggling the figures a little, she imported 767,000,000 pounds, which was fifty-nine percent of the total. While she was thus practically marking time, she watched New Orleans run wild with an increase from 44,000,000 pounds to 380,000,000 pounds, or 763 percent gain; this meaning also the supplying of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> percent of the country's demands instead of five percent, while San Francisco in the same time jumped from 24,000,000 pounds to 137,000,000 pounds, or 470 percent gain, her share of the total trade now being ten percent instead of three percent in 1900. These gains, however, have not all been made at the expense of the city on the Hudson.

GLADSTONE There has been no great day of hope for Ireland, no day when you might hope completely and definitely to end the controversy till now--more than ninety years. The long periodic time has at last run out, and the star has again mounted into the heavens. What Ireland was doing for herself in 1795 we at length have done. The Roman Catholics have been emancipated--emancipated after a woeful disregard of solemn promises through <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years, emancipated slowly, sullenly, not from good will, but from abject terror, with all the fruits and consequences which will always follow that method of legislation.

Now, if the moon passes exactly between us and the sun when she is apparently largest, then a total eclipse takes place; whereas, if she glides between the sun and ourselves when smallest--_i.e._, when furthest off from the earth--then she is not sufficiently [Page 26] large to cover the sun entirely, but a ring of sunlight remains visible around her, and what is called an annular eclipse of the sun occurs.

The method of calculating the calendar introduced by Hillel is so simple and certain that up to the present day it has not required either emendation or amplification, and for this reason is acknowledged to be perfect by all who are competent to express an opinion on the subject, whether Jews or non-Jews. The system is based upon a cycle of nineteen years, in which seven leap years occur. Ten months in every year are invariable, and consist alternately of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> and thirty days; the two autumn months only which follow Tishri (the most important of all the months) are left variable, as being dependent on certain circumstances in astronomy and Jewish law.

When at the beginning of March Keats's volume came out, Bailey was much struck, and on a visit to London called to make the new poet's acquaintance.

There are one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> native species of trees. The yellow pine, the white oak and the cypress are the most valuable growths. The northern woods are mainly hard; the yellow pine is most characteristic of the heavy woods of the south central counties; and magnificent cypress abounds in the north-east.

It was given in evidence before the committee on registration, that out of seventy or eighty parishes for which Bridges made collections a century since, thirteen of the old registers have been lost, and three accidentally burnt.

Burrell between 1770 and 1780, and of those returned as the earliest in the population returns of 1831, the old registers, in no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> parishes, had in the interval disappeared; whilst, during the same half-century, nineteen old registers had found their way back to the proper repository. On searching the MSS. in Skelton Castle, in Cleveland, a few years since, the first register of that parish was discovered, and has been restored. These changes show how great the danger is to which the old registers are exposed; and in many instances it saves time and trouble to search the Bishop's transcripts before...", "...the next, and some say it was, though I think it was the same day--he got drunk and fell down the hatchway, and was borne to his home a corpse.

The Rationalists reasoned correctly, for, in Germany, music is a power which has at times defied the authority of popes and kings.

This is not wonderful, for Sirius's marvellous light-giving power is one of the wonders of the universe; he shines as brilliantly as <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> or thirty of our suns!

Lowell, if not a transcendentalist, was always an idealist, and he knew that ideality was as necessary to Cromwell and Canning as it was to Shakespeare and Scott. He was certainly more popular in England than he had ever been in America, and he openly admitted that he disliked to resign his position. Professor Child said, in 1882: \"Lowell's conversation is witty, with a basis of literary cramming; and that seems to be what the English like. He went to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> dinner parties in the month of June, and made a speech at each one of them.\" In the last years of his life he was greatly infested with imitators who, as he said of Emerson in the \"Fable for Critics,\" stole his fruit and then brought it back to him on their own dishes. Some of them were too influential to be easily disposed of, and others did not know when they were rebuffed. An old man, failing in strength and vigor, he had to endure them as best he could.

The original Sumatrans rudely estimate their annual periods from the revolution of the seasons, and count their years from the number of their crops of grain (taun padi); a practice which, though not pretending to accuracy, is much more useful for the general purposes of life than the lunar period, which is merely adapted to religious observances.

At that time this province contained nine colonies and eight municipalities of Roman citizens; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> Latin towns; six free, three federate, and one hundred and twenty tributary communities.

The Chinese showed more courage than skill, and four of their junks were sunk. It is worth noting that the English sailors pronounced both their guns and their powder to be excellent.

It is not, in our judgment, to be compared with his shorter poems, and is generally read and overpraised only by his more ardent admirers, who discover a crystal tear of genuine emotion in every stanza. IDYLS OF THE KING.--The fragment on the death of Arthur, already mentioned, foreshadowed a purpose of the...", "...\"To raise water from low pits by fire. To make any sort of mills to go on standing waters by continual motion without help of wind, water, or horse. To make boats, ships, and barges to go against strong wind and tide. To raise water from mines and coal pits by a way never yet in use.\" This was in 1630, which was about the date of the Marquis of Worcester's engine. It is possible, however, that these devices existed only in the imagination of the inventor. The marquis was then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years of age, and as he was curious in matters of science, it is highly probable that he was acquainted with this patent, and may have conversed with the inventor. It is strange how little we know of a man so important as the Marquis of Worcester in our modern industrial development. I believe that not one of the histories of England mentions him, and scarcely anything is known of the circumstances that led to his experimenting with steam.

This arrangement, conformable to the lunar year, only gave 354 days to the civil year, and as this was too short by ten days, twenty-one hours, this difference, by accumulation, produced nearly eighty-seven days at the end of eight years, or three months of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days each. To bring the lunar years into accordance with the solstices, it was necessary to add three intercalary months every eight years. The phases of the moon being thus brought into comparison with the rotation of the earth, a cycle was discovered by Meton, now known as the Metonic cycle, useful also in predicting eclipses, which comprised nineteen years, during which time 235 lunations will have very nearly occurred, and the full moons will return to the same dates....", "...toward the door. \"This young lady's name is 'Mary Jane'; and I'll leave it to you to find anything very masculine in that!\" It was a short drive from Mrs. Carleton's Commonwealth Avenue home to the South Station, and Peggy made as quick work of it as the narrow, congested cross streets would allow.

Hooke[5] measured the motion of one in 1664.

He watched an unusually permanent spot during <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> rotations, and fixed the period at 9h. 56m. Later he inferred that spots near the equator rotate quicker than those in higher latitudes (the same as Carrington found for the sun); and W. Herschel confirmed this in 1778-9. Jupiter's rapid rotation ought, according to Newton's theory, to be accompanied by a great flattening at the poles. Cassini had noted an oval form in 1691.

The crew of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> was rescued and brought to Dover. For the British this was a stroke of good fortune, for while the _U-8_ was of an earlier type it was a dangerous craft, having a total displacement of 300 tons, a radius of operation of 1,200 miles, a speed of 13 knots when traveling \"light\" and a speed of 8 knots when submerged.

The decision to make the push-off from Beavermouth, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles farther down, was come to merely because it was much easier to get the boat into the water at the latter point. There was little swift-water boating worthy of the name above Beavermouth.

The event is also commemorated in a poem of the Sutta-Nipata[312] which reads like a very ancient ballad. It relates how Bimbisara, King of Magadha, looking out from his palace, saw an unknown ascetic, and feeling he was no ordinary person went himself to visit him.

One of them was a Lao Lai, a contemporary of Confucius, who wrote fifteen treatises (or sections) on the practices of the school of _Tao_.

She died at their house in Crutched Friars, and was buried at St. Olave's Church, Hart Street, where Pepys erected a monument to her memory.

On the following evening, a serjeant and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> men arrived to conduct them to the commandant of the fortress, who gave them a friendly reception, afforded them supplies, and provided a boat to carry them to Paraibo.

'Only twenty-nine?' Zoe affected great surprise. 'I should have thought you were much, much older! Are you quite sure?' 'Yes.' Carlo laughed. 'I am quite sure. But I suppose I seem very old to you.' 'Oh yes! Very!' She nodded gravely as she spoke. 'You are seventeen, are you not?' Zeno asked. 'How in the world should I know!' she enquired. 'Is not my age set down in the receipt Rustan gave you with me? How should a slave know her own...", "...twenty-five cents a pound in the city, and into hams for which I get twenty-five cents a pound, delivered.

HENRY WILSON TO THE COLORED PEOPLE IN CHARLESTON, S. C., APRIL, 1865. \"For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years, in private life and in public life, at all times and on all occasions, I have spoken and voted against Slavery, and in favor of the freedom of every man that breathes God's air or walks His earth. And to-day, standing here in South Carolina, I feel that the slave-power we have fought so long is under my heel; and that the men and women held in bondage so long are free forevermore. \"Understanding this to be your position,--that you are forever free,--remember, O...", "...Jans Haven, Drachart, and Stephen Jensen, received this in charge; and some other brethren resolved to take a part in it, and go themselves as sailors in a ship which a Society of the Brethren in London had fitted out, and which they resolved should annually visit the coast of Labrador to carry out supplies of the necessaries of life to the missionaries. They first made land at a place called Arnitok, an island about six miles from the spot where Nain now stands; there they found <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> boats full of Esquimaux, but they behaved in a very unruly manner and with great insolence, till the report of the great guns, fired over their heads, frightened them into order; they then showed themselves friendly, and the missionaries, who understood the language, preached the gospel to them. After this the two brethren, Haven and Jensen, traversed the coast unmolested in search of favourable ground for a settlement; but being unable to find such a spot they set sail...", "...path, the utter absence of color in his cheeks was startling. That meant the absence of red,--that warm glow of the blood, eager and alive in his veins. There was, indeed, another color, visible only because of the stark whiteness of his skin. He was newly shaven, and his lips and chin looked somewhat blue from the heavy growth of hair under the skin. Perhaps an observer would have noticed lean hands, with big-knuckled fingers, a rather firm mouth, and closely cropped dark hair. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years of age, but he looked somewhat older. He knew now that he was never going to be any older. A doctor as sure of himself as the one he had just consulted couldn't possibly be mistaken. It was rather refreshing to get into the park. Dan could think ever so much more clearly. He never could think in a crowd. Someway, the hurrying people always seemed to bewilder him.

The reason is, the criminality is raised by foreigners in the East, by the Negro in the South, by the adventurer in the West. On comparing the total number of prisoners North and South with the total populations, we find that there were in the South about six prisoners per myriad of Whites, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> prisoners per myriad of Blacks; whereas in the North were twelve prisoners per myriad Whites, and sixty-nine prisoners per myriad Blacks. On going from South to North, we find the prison numbers exactly doubled among the Whites, but much more than doubled among the Blacks. But our tables can teach us still more. The increase from 1880 to 1890 is worth attention. In the West and the North Central region, it was only slight--twenty-two and twenty-six per million; but both...", "...some time at a college of one kind or another. So-called professors appear among the convicts, but I have been unable to discover that any professor in an institution of standing has been at either San Quentin or Folsom since its establishment. The preceding statistics of illiteracy are defective, but some additional light can be had from the tables upon occupations. Among 905 prisoners at Folsom, 96 occupations were represented. In round numbers, thirty-four per cent were mechanics, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> per cent were rated as laborers, twenty per cent were in business, and seven per cent were agriculturists. But a closer analysis of the statistics on this point shows that nearly fifty-seven per cent of the entire number came from the following occupations: acrobat, barber, bar-tender, butler, cook, gardener, hackman, hostler, laborer, laundryman, mill-hand, miner, nurse, sailor, vaquero, and \"no occupation\" (22). The classification of crimes is very complete in all...", "...Movement of Mercury, showing the Variations in Phase and in apparent size.] [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Mercury as a Crescent.] The facts which have been thoroughly established with regard to Mercury are mainly numerical statements as to the path it describes around the sun. The time taken by the planet to complete one of its revolutions is eighty-eight days nearly. The average distance from the sun is about 36,000,000 miles, and the mean velocity with which the body moves is over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles a second. We have already alluded to the most characteristic and remarkable feature of the orbit of Mercury. That orbit differs from the paths of all the other large planets by its much greater departure from the circular form. In the majority of cases the planetary orbits are so little elliptic that a diagram of the orbit drawn accurately to scale would not be perceived to differ from a circle unless careful measurements were made. In the case of Mercury the...", "...I am going to some Indian friends for a time. On the 15th of June I shall be at Srinagar in Kashmir. A friend has allowed me to take her little houseboat, the \"Kedarnath.\" If you like this plan we will share the cost for two months. I warn you it is not luxurious, but I think you will like it. I shall do this whether you come or no, for I want a quiet time before I take up my nursing in Lahore. In thinking of all this will you remember that I am not a girl but a woman. I shall be <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> my next birthday. Sincerely yours, VANNA LORING. P.S. But I still think you would be wiser not to come. I hope to hear you will not. I replied only this:--Dear Miss Loring,--I think I understand the position fully. I will be there. I thank you with all my heart. Gratefully yours, STEPHEN CLIFDEN.

Her manner was distinctly more cordial as she mentioned casually that Vanna had left--she understood...", "...my lamp at night, was in their favour. After this occurrence the lamp at night always hung lighted outside of the tent door. All evidence pointed to the four men from Tumbang Djuloi who recently left us. The sergeant had noticed their prahus departing from a point lower down than convenience would dictate, and, as a matter of fact, nobody else could have done it. But they were gone, we were in seclusion, and there was nobody to send anywhere. In the middle of February we had <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> men here from Tamaloe, twenty of them Penyahbongs and the remainder Malays. The lieutenant had been successful, and the men had only used two days in coming down with the current. They were in charge of a Malay called Bangsul, who formerly had been in the service of a Dutch official, and whose fortune had brought him to distant Tamaloe, where he had acquired a dominating position over the Penyahbongs. I wrote a report of the robbery to the captain in Puruk Tjahu, and sent...", "...it up,\" he said, putting down the money. \"Hadn't the carrier better bring it, sir?\" suggested the ironmonger. \"He'll be going Wrottesford way to-morrow morning.\" Obviously John could not carry the toboggan five miles, but just as obviously he must get the toboggan back to Ambles that night: so he declined the carrier, and asked the ironmonger to order him a fly while he made a last desperate search for Frida's present. In the end, with twilight falling fast, he bought for his niece <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> small china animals, which the stationer assured him would enchant any child between nine and eleven, though perhaps less likely to appeal to ages outside that period. A younger child, for instance, might be tempted to put them in its mouth, even to swallow them if not carefully watched, while an older child might tread on them. Another advantage was that when the young lady for whom they were intended grew out of them, they could be put away and revived to adorn her...", "...of fifty pounds to the square inch. This proceeding occupied fifty-seven minutes. The engine then started on its journey, dragging after it about thirteen tons weight in wagons, and made the first ten trips backward and forward along the two miles of road, running the thirty-five miles, including stoppages, in an hour and forty-eight minutes. The second ten trips were in like manner performed in two hours and three minutes. The maximum velocity attained during the trial trip was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles an hour, or about three times the speed that one of the judges of the competition had declared to be the limit of possibility. The average speed at which the whole of the journeys were performed was fifteen miles an hour, or five miles beyond the rate specified in the conditions published by the company. The entire performance excited the greatest astonishment among the assembled spectators; the directors felt confident that their enterprise was now on the eve of...", "...the Bernese, they mistook him for a French spy and struck him dead in his carriage. The loss of Berne greatly dispirited them and they desisted from further and futile opposition. Steiger escaped. Hotze, a gallant Austrian general, who, mindful of his Swiss origin, had attempted to place himself at the head of his countrymen, was compelled to retrace his steps. In Berne, the French meanwhile pillaged the treasures of the republic.[11] Besides the treasury and the arsenal, estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> million livres, they levied a contribution of sixteen million. Bruno planted a tree of liberty, and Frisching, the president of the provisional government, had the folly to say, \"Here it stands! may it bear good fruit! Amen!\" Further bloodshed was prevented by the intervention of the patriots.

No matter what kind of atom we are considering there is always in it just as many electrons as protons. For example, the iron atom is formed by a nucleus and twenty-six electrons playing around it. The copper atom has twenty-nine electrons as tiny planets to its nucleus. What does that mean about its nucleus? That there are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> more protons in the nucleus than there are electrons. Silver has even more planetary electrons, for it has 47. Radium has 88 and the heaviest atom of all, that of uranium, has 92. We might use numbers for the different kinds of atoms instead of names if we wanted to do so. We could describe any kind of atom by telling how many planetary electrons there were in it. For example, hydrogen would be number 1, helium number 2, lithium of which you perhaps never heard, would be...", "...her fourteen-room apartment faced the Park, but was on the ground floor because a vice-president of a bank, a black-broadcloth little pelican of a man, who stumped on a cane and had a pink tin roof to his mouth, disliked elevators.

At twenty-seven it was the fourth vice-president of a Harlem bank. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> an interim. Startling to Josie Drew. Terrifying. Lean. For the first time in eight years her gasoline expenditures amounted to ninety cents a month instead of from forty to ninety dollars. And then not at the garage, but at the corner drug store.

He had bought a house in the city itself because the merchants of Genoa all dwelt in the town of Pera, on the other side of the Golden Horn. A Venetian could not have lived in the same place with Genoese, for the air would have poisoned him,...", "...it also retards the despatch of business.

The other Federal courts have been created by Congress under a power in the Constitution to establish \"inferior courts.\" The circuit courts consist of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> circuit judges, acting in nine judicial circuits, while to each circuit there is also allotted one of the justices of the Supreme Court. Circuit courts of appeals, established to relieve the Supreme Court, consist of three judges (two forming a quorum), and are made up of the circuit and district judges of each circuit and the Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. Some cases may, however, be appealed to the Supreme Court from the circuit court of appeals, and...", "...eyes were not to see, their hands were not to touch these things. They were only to push their frontier a little farther to the west and hold the dream and pass it on to their children. Those early years of the nineteenth century held the first days of fulfillment. Samson and Sarah Traylor had the old dream in their hearts when they first turned their faces to the West. For years Sarah had resisted it, thinking of the hardships and perils in the way of the mover. Samson, a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> when he set out from his old home, was said to be \"always chasing the bird in the bush.\" He was never content with the thing in hand. There were certain of their friends who promised to come and join them when, at last, they should have found the land of plenty. But most of the group that bade them good-by thought it a foolish enterprise and spoke lightly of Samson when they were gone. America has undervalued the brave souls who went west in wagons, without whose sublime...", "...himself at Sedan, safe, as he hoped, for a brief breathing space, from the attacks of the two Prussian army corps which were following in his rear. He had been warned repeatedly that he must not return to Paris without a victory. \"The language of reason,\" he remarked, \"is no longer understood at the capital.\" On Aug. 30, 1870, the retreating French were concentrated, or rather massed, under the walls of Sedan,[1] in a valley commonly called the Sink of Givonne.

Calculating four leagues as a...", "...tells the story, as it is hardly consistent with the views of the friars. As to the perpetual jealousies between the friars and the possessioners, see P. Plowman, B. v. 144. 1728. It was usual (as said in note to l. 1717) to sing the thirty masses on thirty consecutive days, as Chaucer here remarks. But the friar says they are better when 'hastily y-songe'; and it would appear [332] that the friars used occasionally to sing all the thirty masses in one day, and so save a soul from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days of purgatory; cf. ll. 1729, 1732. In English Gilds, ed. Toulmin Smith, p. 8, we have an example of this. The wardens are there directed to summon the Minorite Friars to say the dirge, 'and _on the morwe_ to seie a _trent_ of masses atte same freres.' In Jack Upland, s. 13, we find: 'Why make ye [freres] men beleeue that your golden trentall sung of you, to take therefore ten shillings, or at least fiue shillings, woll bring souls out of hell, or out of purgatorie?'...", "...his eyes closed.

Our theory was that all of those fellows had sheep's livers, and that accounted for the insatiable \"hankering after grass.\" I told this story in an after-dinner speech at a banquet some time ago to a company of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> female doctors of medicine--trained, and practicing physicians. They made no protest; listened with unbroken gravity; accepted it as a narrative of actual occurrence, and looked at me with wide-eyed interest.

Alvarado, upon this summons, consulted the military and civil authorities; and, finding that the garrison consisted of only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> men, that the artillery was composed of eleven pieces, entirely useless from the rottenness of their carriages, and that the whole number of muskets and carbines, good and bad, did not exceed a hundred and fifty, he surrendered the place, which was taken possession of by the Americans early on the 20th of October.

Her first husband was Lord Edward Borough, a middle-aged widower with several children, who died a short time after the marriage. John Neville, Lord Latimer, was her second choice; he was also a widower with children, and Katharine's amiable temper and sound sense so well fitted her to perform the duties a stepmother that she was loved and esteemed by the families of both her husbands. She was not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years old when she was left a widow for the second time. It was then that she became a convert to the Reformed religion, and encouraged its apostles to meet daily in her chamber of state to preach their sermons. She was not only pious, learned and handsome, but she possessed great wealth, and was connected by descent or marriage with some of the noblest families in England. Scarcely six months had elapsed after the death of Lord Latimer when she was informed by Henry...", "...on you,\" remarked Quincy. \"Yes,\" said Uncle Ike, \"it has lasted me sixty-eight years, one month, and thirteen days,\" pointing to a calendar that hung on the wall. As Quincy looked in the direction indicated he saw something hanging beside it that attracted his attention. It was a sheet of white paper with a heavy black border. Within the border were written these words, \"Sacred to the memory of Isaac Pettengill, who was killed at the battle of Gettysburg, July 4th, 1863, aged <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years.

The historian devotes but one verse to his reformation--which probably began early in his reign, though it occupied many years.

I understood, however, that the stage to Savannah was very bad; that the steam-boat went very irregularly; that Savannah had lost its importance as a place of trade, and on the whole, contained nothing worthy of observation. As this tour would cost me many days, and a circuitous route, I resolved to relinquish the visit to Savannah, and betake myself the nearest way to Augusta, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles distant; thence by Milledgeville through the Creek Indians, to go into the state of Alabama. Colonel Wool liked my plan, as also did Mr. Temple Bowdoin, an Anglo-American, a very polished man, who had travelled, and who in his younger days served in the British army.

In one year seventy of these turreted bulwarks of oppression were torn down; and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> of the highest nobles, who had ventured upon insurrection, were put to death.

There he did good service, until his death, on the Combahee, on the twenty-seventh of August, 1782, when he was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years of age.

He declared that he could discover no fault in him, unless it was intrepidity, bordering on rashness. \"Poor Laurens,\" wrote Greene, \"has fallen in a paltry little skirmish.

Acceleration in the time of marriage, often amounting to seven years, as from twenty-eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> to twenty-one or twenty-two, under influences such as those mentioned above, is by no means improbable.

It might be expected to act in two ways:-- \"(1) By shortening each generation by an amount equally proportionate to the diminution in age at which marriage occurs.

The diffusion of a knowledge of the first indications of this insidious disease, and of what it may culminate in, is the only safeguard against the terrible acts which from time to time startle the community, and which are found, when too late, to have been perpetrated by those who ought to have been under medical restraint. Bearing immediately upon this, is the fact that there were recently, out of the cases of murder in Broadmoor, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> cases in which insanity had been recognized before the act was committed, but the persons were regarded as harmless, and thirty-three in which it was not regarded as harmless, but insufficient precautions were taken.

The potatoes might probably make better flour, if they were boiled in steam, in a close vessel, made some degrees hotter than common boiling water. Other vegetable matters may be deprived of their too great acrimony by boiling in water, as the great variety of the cabbage, the young tops of white briony, water-cresses, asparagus, with...", "...explosion was terrific and was seen and heard for many miles up and down the river. Had it occurred near the vessels, it would have destroyed every one of them.\" [Illustration: GUN AND MORTAR BOATS ON THE MISSISSIPPI.] After the fall of New Orleans Porter was sent to Ship Island to await the attack that was in contemplation upon New Orleans. He was recalled by Admiral Farragut to aid him in the siege of Vicksburg. In passing the batteries Porter had three of his vessels disabled and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> men killed and wounded. The capture of that last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi was a severe and tedious task, but General Grant, with that bulldog tenacity for which he was famous, held on until the 4th of July, 1863, when General Pemberton, the Confederate commander, surrendered his whole garrison of more than 20,000 men. In thus opening the Mississippi all the way to the Gulf the navy rendered invaluable assistance. Porter's aid was so important and his...", "...certain functional activities much wider areas must be covered.

Again, the sewer and water problem of Pittsburgh is a water-shed problem. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> towns and boroughs are dumping their sewage into the rivers which run past Pittsburgh and from which Pittsburgh must draw its water. No one of these governmental units can work out its sanitary problem alone. Close co-ordination of sanitary work is needed throughout the whole river district.

About two miles from the latter village is Elsey peak, about twelve hundred feet high, round which the road passes, the base being washed by the sea, and then we came to the bay and village of the same name, having another small whaling establishment; but the inhabitants had shaken hands with poverty, and these three villages are evidently fast going to ruin.

Protestant interference in such a question is as irritating and as useless as would be the interference of a mutual friend in a quarrel between a man and his wife.

The number of minutes which the district teacher may give to each grade is fifty minutes; the consolidated teacher has one hundred and seventeen minutes per grade.

No teacher can do justice to twenty-seven classes per day, and an average recitation period of thirteen minutes is so short as to be almost unworthy of...", "...And this was the case in Boston, immediately after the passage of the bill, when a fugitive slave was surrendered.

Thousands came into the city, and it is said that more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> thousand loyalists and refugees (including three thousand negroes), left the State of New York for Canada, Nova Scotia and other British possessions, during the year. After the news of peace, there was little restraint on going in or out of New York, and many who had abandoned their homes when the British entered the place, or before, now prepared to return, but found when they came into the city that they could not obtain possession of their own property.

I would gladly have gone through this passage, and anchored under one of the islands, to have waited for better weather, for on sounding we found only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> fathoms water; but when I considered that this was running to leeward in the dark, I chose to keep without the islands, and accordingly hauled off to the north.

Vejar, who had been assessed in 1851 for thirty-four thousand dollars' worth of personal property, sold his share of the estate for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> thousand dollars, in the spring of 1874. It is a curious fact that not until the San Jose _rancho_ had been so cut up that it was not easy to trace it back to the original grantees, did the authorities at Washington finally issue a patent to Dalton, Palomares and Vejar for the twenty-two thousand acres which originally made up the ranch.

The truth is that, mediocre or undecided or addle-pated as they may have been, they all succumbed, internally and externally, without initiating and without resisting, to the course of events, and that, in 987, the fall of the Carlovingian line was the natural and easily accomplished consequence of the new social condition which had been preparing in France under the empire.

The reader has just seen that, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years after the death of Charlemagne, that is, in 843, when, by the treaty of Verdun, the sons of Louis the Debonnair had divided amongst them his dominions, the great empire split up into three distinct and independent kingdoms--the kingdoms of Italy, Germany, and France. The split did not stop there. Forty-five years later, at the end of the ninth century, shortly after the death of Charles the Fat, the last of the Carlovingians who appears to have re-united for a while...", "...prosperous and flourishing, with a better business than that of any other State, proportionately. Notwithstanding the fact that in Portland a great conflagration destroyed ten millions of dollars in 1866, burned down half the town, and turned ten thousand people out of doors, the prosperity of the city has been steadily on the increase. Its valuation, in 1860, was twenty-one millions eight hundred and sixty-six thousand dollars, and in 1870, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> millions four hundred and thirty-nine thousand two hundred and fifty-seven dollars. In the last year the increase in valuation, in spite of the hard times, was four hundred and eighty thousand dollars, while Boston, with free rum, has lost more than eight millions, and New York and Brooklyn has experienced an immense depreciation.

It consisted of three lines of batteries and intrenchments. The second was the most formidable; but the first was so strong, also, that Wellington determined to defend this, instead of falling back to the stronger line. At the foot of the line of mountains on which the army was posted, stretching from the Tagus to the sea, ran two streams; the Zandre, a deep river, which extended nearly halfway along the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles of lines, covered the left of the position; while a stream running into the Tagus protected the right. The centre, therefore, was almost the only part at which the line could be attacked with any chance of success; and this was defended by such tremendous fortifications as to be almost impregnable. Massena, who had only heard vague rumours of the existence of these fortifications, four days before, was astounded at the unexpected obstacle which barred his way.

Decade after decade, as that struggle waxed and waned but went remorselessly on, the Navy grew in ships, the ships in tonnage and weight of metal, and with their growth the demand for men, imperative as the very existence of the nation, mounted ever higher and higher. In 1756 fifty thousand sufficed for the nation's needs. By 1780 the number had reached ninety-two thousand; and with 1802 it touched high-water mark in the unprecedented total of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> thousand men in actual sea pay.

With doctor Sands was imprisoned Mr. Bradford; they were kept close in prison <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> weeks. John Fowler, their keeper, was a perverse papist, yet, by often persuading him, at length he began to favour the gospel, and was so persuaded in the true religion, that on a Sunday, when they had mass in the chapel, Dr. Sands administered the communion to Bradford and to Fowler. Thus Fowler was their son begotten in bonds. To make room for Wyat and his accomplices, Dr. Sands and nine other preachers were sent to the Marshalsea. The keeper of the Marshalsea...", "...[Illustration: A LECTURE IN THE BANQUET HALL OF THE WASHINGTON SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS. Formerly occupied by the French Embassy.] The report of Mrs. Walter McNab Miller (Mo.) first vice-president, described a year of continuous work, almost from ocean to ocean, speaking to State suffrage conventions, federations of women's clubs, federations of labor, trade unions, universities, normal schools, churches, meetings of all kinds and without number. In the two Dakotas she spoke <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> times. She referred to her visit to Jefferson City, Mo., her luncheon with the wife of Governor Frederick D. Gardner, the suffrage meeting \"which put the State capital in a ferment and caused the politicians to sit up and take notice\" and the Governor's declaration for woman suffrage. Mrs. Miller said of the work during the five months when she was chairman of the Congressional Committee: After mature consideration the board decided that, for various reasons,...", "...valerian, bishop's-weed, bayberries, long and white pepper, xylobalsamum, carnabadium, macedonian, parsley seeds, lovage, the seeds of rue, and sinon, of each a dram and a half; of pure gold, pure silver, pearls not perforated, the blatta byzantina, the bone of the stag's heart, of each the quantity of fourteen grains of wheat; of sapphire, emerald and jasper stones, each one dram; of hazel-nuts, two drams; of pellitory of Spain, shavings of ivory, calamus odoratus, each the quantity of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> grains of wheat; of honey or sugar a sufficient quantity.

For why should a man build a big steel vault and live in it unless he had portable property worth a burglar's while? I reconnoitered the place for a week before I considered myself possessed of sufficient knowledge for my undertaking. In view of what transpired at the time of my visit, a brief description of the castle, taken from my memorandum book, will prove of interest. The structure was cigar-shaped, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> feet from base to apex and twenty feet in diameter through its largest part. It was divided into two stories by means of a steel floor, leaving head-room of ten feet in the lower story. Four windows pierced the circular walls of the nether room, and two gave light to the room above; these six openings being guarded on the outer sides with latticework of steel. The door was an oblong piece of boiler plate--the entire building was a shell composed of plates riveted...", "...get?\" asked Rathburn sharply. \"Twenty-two thousand eight hundred and seventy dollars in cash.\" Rathburn stared at the mine manager and whistled softly. \"What's the sense in sending it up there at all?\" he asked suddenly. \"Why not pay off down here in town?\" Sautee sighed with an air of resignation. \"That's been argued several times,\" he complained. \"The men demand their pay in cash. They want it at the mine, for more than half of them have refused to come down here for it. It is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles up there to the mine, and it would take all the trucks we've got and two days to bring them down here and take them back. Besides, if we got them down here it would be a week before we could get half of them back up there and at work again.\" \"But why won't they take checks?\" Rathburn demanded. \"It would be the same proposition,\" Sautee explained. \"There is a little village up there--pool room, soft-drink parlor, lunch room, store, and all that--and the men, or a...", "...utensils fall upon the floor.\" Granting the appositeness of the illustration, we must add that the alarm mentioned by the critic was of brief duration; while that of the Rationalists and their adherents is like the long-standing despair of a circle of chemists, whose laboratory has been entered through a door left open by themselves, their carefully prepared combinations destroyed, and all their retorts and crucibles shattered into irreparable fragments. After a long absence of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years, Strauss has again appeared as the biographer of Christ. In his former work he wrote for the theological public, but we are now assured that he had ever kept in mind a purpose to do for the masses what he had achieved for critical minds.

The importance of submitting our faculties to measurement lies in the curious unconsciousness in which we are apt to live of our personal peculiarities, and which our intimate friends often fail to remark. I have spoken of the ignorance of elderly persons of their deafness to high notes, but even the existence of such a peculiarity as colour blindness was not suspected until the memoir of Dalton in 1794. That one person out of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> or thereabouts should be unable to distinguish a red from a green, without knowing that he had any deficiency of colour sense, and without betraying his deficiency to his friends, seems perfectly incredible to the other twenty-eight; yet as a matter of fact he rarely does either the one or the other. It is hard to convince the colour-blind of their own infirmity. I have seen curious instances of this: one was that of a person by no means unpractised in physical research,...", "...up a small tent to live in the rest of the time. It began raining and rained hard the most of the time for two or three weeks. Everything was so damp, but God's hallowed presence made all things bearable. My husband planned to take two teams and have me drive one. I knew almost nothing about driving, and the roads were as bad as they could be, up and down mountains, over rocks, and through mud, and I could scarcely make a move of any kind to please my husband. He also decided to take <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> goats, which he intended having the children drive. The morning we started I had been sick all night, and it began raining and the wagon sheet began to leak; but I kept trusting, and it stopped raining.

No damage was done, however, except that Husband found a roll of papers which I had intended for distribution, and threw them into the river.

Mr. Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> endemic genera, no less than twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Dezertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted...", "...and master.

Schouten was master and pilot of the expedition, and James Lemaire, the son of Isaac, supercargo.

And so they were married, and lived happily afterward. Josiah was thirty-four, and Sarah <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> when they were married. The ten years of Laban service was not without its compensation. The lovers had lived in an ideal world long enough to crystallize their dreams. In just a year after the marriage a daughter was born to Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Wedgwood, and they called her name Susannah. And Susannah grew up and became the mother of Charles Darwin, the greatest scientist the world has ever produced.

There are many localities in which these pittances are not more than doubled by the fees, and some localities in which they are even less than doubled; and so a preponderating majority of the schoolmasters of...", "...was a singer of some renown. KREUTZER, RUDOLPH (1766-1831), French violinist, of German extraction, was born at Versailles, his father being a musician in the royal chapel. Rudolph gradually became famous as a violinist, playing with great success at various continental capitals. It was to him that in 1803 Beethoven dedicated his famous violin sonata (_op._ 47) known as the \"Kreutzer.\" Apart, however, from his fame as a violinist, Kreutzer was also a prolific composer; he wrote <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> operas, many of which were successfully produced, besides nineteen violin concertos and chamber music.

At that time the cession of the Louisiana Territory had not been completed; but matters were in train to that end, and before the expedition was fairly started on its long journey across the continent, the Territory was formally ceded to the United States. Meriwether Lewis, a captain in the army, was selected by Jefferson to lead the expedition. Captain Lewis was a native of Virginia, and at that time was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years old. He had been Jefferson's private secretary for two years and was, of course, familiar with the President's plans and expectations as these regarded the wonder-land which Lewis was to enter. It is pleasant to quote here Mr. Jefferson's words concerning Captain Lewis. In a memoir of that distinguished young officer, written after his death, Jefferson said: \"Of courage undaunted; possessing a firmness and perseverance of purpose which nothing but impossibilities...", "...framers of the ecclesiastical calendar adopted the period of Meton, or lunar cycle, which they supposed to be exact. A different arrangement has, however, been followed with respect to the distribution of the months. The lunations are supposed to consist of twenty-nine and thirty days alternately, or the lunar year of 354 days; and in order to make up nineteen solar years, six embolismic or intercalary months, of thirty days each, are introduced in the course of the cycle, and one of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days is added at the end. This gives (19 x 354) + (6 x 30) + 29 = 6935 days, to be distributed among 235 lunar months. But every leap-year one day must be added to the lunar month in which the 29th of February is included. Now if leap-year happened on the first, second or third year of the period, there will be five leap-years in the period, but only four when the first leap-year falls on the fourth.

Fourteen of these cities served in this manner during one half of the year, and fifteen during the other half.

The truth of the matter is that there are but few who can boast of knowing him well, and the masses as well as the classes both at home and abroad seem to take a peculiarly keen delight in accepting for gospel truth any sweeping statements made about him by the press of all civilized countries. Although <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years of age when he ascended the throne on June 15, 1888, he may be said to have been at that time still but a raw youth, continually kept in the background, and treated more or less like a child, without any consequence or weight.

The 1st United States regiment, under Major Hamtranck, was detached to march back beyond Fort Jefferson, apprehend these deserters, if possible, and, at all events, prevent the provisions that might be on the way, from being rifled.

Medicine always interested him, and he learned enough of it to be very useful to him during his travels; indeed, it was owing to his fame as a doctor that he was summoned to see a young Russian lady dying of fever, which, according to many, infected him, and caused his own death.

Very like this, as to the form of the story, is the anecdote in Pauli's Schimpf und Ernst, LV, p. 46, ed. Oesterley (c. 1522).

How far apart are good and bad luck? A swineherd answers for him: Since Christ was sold for thirty pence, I rate the emperor at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> and you at twenty-eight; my church is the mid-point of the world, and, if you will not believe me, measure for yourself; good and bad luck are but one night apart, for yesterday I was a swineherd, to-day I am an abbot.

Winter as well as summer the work went on; and the task of cutting out a vessel wrecked in an ice-gorge, or of raising one from beneath the ice, must have been as trying as walking the river bottom in search of a wreck.

It is better to try for the right flies with a list of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> than whip over a list of a thousand or more.

Stephenson was next employed to help construct a railway between Liverpool and Manchester. The most eminent engineers of the day predicted that the road could not be built. But it was built. On the fifteenth of September, 1830, Stephenson made a trial trip over the road with an improved locomotive named the \"Rocket.\" On the trial trip the \"Rocket\" made <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> miles an hour.

To say nothing of the equipments, a wide divergence in the size, color, and quality of the horses, hastily gathered from the four quarters of the prairie, gave to these improvised dragoons rather a ludicrous appearance it must be confessed; yet marching afoot or standing to horse, the 4th Wisconsin was always ready and equal to the work cut out for it. From his advanced camp, on Shields's plantation, twenty-three miles beyond Washington and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> from Opelousas, Dwight fell back on the 28th of April to his bivouac at Washington and waited for the movement of the army to begin. In preparation for this, on the evening of the 1st of May, Bean, with the 4th Wisconsin, mounted, was sent forward to join the main body of the cavalry, under Major Robinson, in front of Washington. That night Dwight, with the cavalry, his own brigade, and a section of Nims's battery, marched out some distance to discover the position of...", "...scarcely time to escape, with a handful of his men, in the direction of the Potomac.

The captures in two days had been more than four thousand prisoners and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> cannon, with four hundred horses and a large amount of stores. Ewell continued then to advance, and, entering Maryland, sent a portion of his cavalry, under General Imboden, westward, to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and another body, under General Jenkins, in advance, toward Chambersburg. Meanwhile, the rest of the army was moving to join him.

It is estimated that thirty-five thousand Christians of different nations perished in the glorious defense of the place. The struggle between Louis XIV., Holland, and England gives examples of great maritime operations, but no remarkable descents. That of James II. in Ireland (1690) was composed of only six thousand Frenchmen, although De Tourville's fleet contained seventy-three ships of the line, carrying five thousand eight hundred cannon and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> thousand sailors. A grave fault was committed in not throwing at least twenty thousand men into Ireland with such means as were disposable. Two years later, De Tourville had been conquered in the famous day of La Hogue, and the remains of the troops which had landed were enabled to return through the instrumentality of a treaty which required their evacuation of the island. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Swedes and Russians undertook two expeditions very...", "...Huber has described, their slaves in their jaws. Another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of F. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized, and carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late combat.

It must however be remarked, that the ration at Norfolk Island was often uncertain, being regulated by the plenty or scarcity of the Mount Pitt birds. Great numbers...", "...Cuvier, in anatomy. Most of the time from 1808 to 1827, nineteen years, he remained in Paris, devoting his time to his great work. In the forenoons he usually studied and experimented; from twelve to seven he wrote, and then, if his evenings were spent socially, he wrote again from midnight till half-past two, usually allowing himself only four hours for sleep. So popular was he that he often went to five receptions in an evening. Year after year his works on America appeared, till <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> volumes were published!

FOREIGN PROGRESS. When we look abroad the most encouraging progress is in the race to which this republic owes its origin. In spite of the cruel oppression in Ireland, Great Britain has been prospering in the last twelve years.

Hence there is a marked increase of knowledge and wealth. During this period the natural increase of population has been 1200 daily and the immigration to the United States and Colonies has averaged 600 daily. In addition to the national increase, there has been an immigration of 1,317,000, consisting of foreign settlers and returned colonists.

At least four German machines were shot down. On June 11, 1917, a British patrol boat sighted five German aeroplanes off Dover.

In thirty-two unions under one set of regulations, and in eighty-one and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> unions under others, it was permitted on conditions. But it was with regard to the relief of women and children dependent on able-bodied persons that the two geographical areas differed most markedly. In the 396 unions, these dependents of able-bodied persons could not be relieved otherwise than in the workhouse.

Six of their months have thirty days, and six <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days, making three hundred and fifty-four days to the year, which lacks eleven days of a full solar year. To compensate this deficiency, they have an intercalary month of thirty days, every two or three years.

It was decided to give to January, March, May, July, September and November each thirty-one days; and the other months thirty, excepting February, which in common years should have but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days, but every fourth year thirty; so that the average length of the Julian year was 365-1/4 days.

The only exception is where the player chances to hold two deuces or aces, in which case it will be worth while to make <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> or thirty respectively with one of such cards, on the chance of the opponent holding no deuce or ace, in which case the first player will himself gain the advantage of the double score.

I have disinterred an Osteolepis from a fish bed near Cromarty only thirty-three feet over the great conglomerate, and only a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> feet over the granitic gneiss beneath; whereas the Cephalaspis beds occur high above the primary base of the system in the south,--at some distance over even the thick conglomerate of Stonehaven and Dunnottar; and under this conglomerate, as shown in the section furnished by the valley of the North Esk, there lies a pale red sandstone member of the system, estimated by Colonel Imrie at seven hundred and eighty feet in thickness. The conglomerate itself he estimates at...", "...the insertion of Italian opera songs. _Israel in Egypt_ is the most conspicuous example of a strange and almost unaccountable habit which from about this period began to show itself in Handel's methods of composition--the incorporation of large quantities of music by other composers. Samuel Wesley was the first person to draw attention to this practice of Handel's, though only in a private letter of 1808. In 1831 Dr. Crotch, in his professorial lectures at Oxford, named no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> composers whom Handel had \"quoted or copied.\" The researches of Chrysander, Dr. Max Seiffert, Ebenezer Prout, and Sedley Taylor eventually proved beyond dispute that not only _Israel_, but several other works of Handel were largely made up from the music of other men. Chrysander maintained that Handel began appropriating other men's ideas as early as 1707, for not only _Rodrigo_ and _Agrippina_, but also _La Resurrezione_ and the _Laudate pueri_ show obvious reminiscences...", "...were made in many towns, and there is proof that there were inhabitants here in 1633. There was a recognition of the place as a sort of municipality in 1634, for Bare Cove was assessed in that year. Rev. Peter Hobart, of Hingham, England, the first minister, arrived at Charlestown in June, 1635, and soon after settled in this town where many of his friends from Hingham, England, had already settled, from which fact the name of their old home was given to the new. Mr. Hobart and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> others drew for house-lots on the 18th of September, 1635. Grants of land were made at various times during the year 1635, and for several succeeding years. Hence it will be seen that, in this present year, two hundred and fifty years of the town's history will have been completed, and the anniversary will be celebrated during the present month of September.

Many foolish stories have been told of her coming between him and his first wife. The reader of this volume can see for himself that there is not the slightest foundation for these tales.

But it should be said that Cosima Wagner gave to her husband a loyalty, a devotion, and a sympathetic comprehension which made him a wholly happy man in...", "...to turn in one UFO report after another, it was difficult to believe the old \"hoax, hallucination, and misidentification of known objects\" routine. In April, May, and June of 1950 there were over thirty-five good reports from airline crews.

MERCURY and VENUS, having their orbits so far within that of the earth, appear to us as attendants upon the sun. Mercury never appears further from the sun than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> degrees, and seldom so far; and Venus, never more than about forty-seven degrees. Both planets, therefore, appear either in the west soon after sunset, or in the east a little before sunrise.

During the next fifteen years, which was the period of Waite's chief justiceship, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> cases reached the Court in which State legislation was set aside under the clause. Twenty-four of these involved public contracts. The decline of the importance of the clause as a title in Constitutional Law began under Chief Justice Fuller (1888 to 1910). During this period less than 25% of the cases involving the validity of State legislation involved this rubric. In twenty-eight of these cases, of which only two involved private contracts, the statute involved was set...", "...ought to be already sufficiently intense at the depth of only seven or eight leagues to hold in fusion all known substances,--there arises the question, what is its precise value at the surface of the earth; what weight are we to attach to it in the determination of terrestrial temperatures; what part does it play in the phenomena of life? According to Mairan, Buffon, and Bailly, this part is immense. For France, they estimate the heat which escapes from the interior of the earth, at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> times in summer, and four hundred times in winter, the heat which comes to us from the sun. Thus, contrary to general opinion, the heat of the body which illuminates us would form only a very small part of that whose propitious influence we feel.

The universal spiritual empire of the Popes came to a sudden end and the whole of western Europe was turned into a battle-field, where Protestants and Catholics killed each other for the greater glory of...", "...One of his wives was in the habit of treating him extremely ill, frequently beating and other ways insulting him, which, for a long time, he very patiently put up with; but once his anger was so much aroused, that he sprung upon her like a fury, got her down, and buffeted her with his stumps within an inch of her life; nor would he suffer her to arise until she promised amendment in future, which it seems she prudently adopted, through fear of another thrashing.

The insects that frequent the waters, require predaceous animals to keep them within due limits, as well as those that inhabit the earth; and the water-spider (_Argyroneta aquatica_) is one of the most remarkable upon whom that office is devolved. To this end, her instinct instructs her to fabricate a kind of diving-bell in the bosom of that element. She usually selects still waters for this purpose....", "...they have no interest. When there is reading aloud in the family circle, if every unfamiliar word is looked up in a dictionary, which should always lie easily accessible upon the table, they will get unconsciously a widening of their vocabulary and a knowledge of the use of English which will be an invaluable supplement to the work of their teacher of English in the school.

In another sacred grove he reports finding several other very interesting stone objects: \"Here within a small space surrounded by a low wall there is a ring of holy stones,\" he writes, \"some of them very valuable. Firstly, there is a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> and a half inch long sandstone block of no very remarkable general aspect, weather-worn and abraded, but ending in a jagged crowned head of some such animal as a fish.

And yet to part with the companion of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years when so very ill--that I did not, could not foresee.[267] It withers my heart to think of it, and to recollect that I can hardly hope again to seek confidence and counsel from that ear to which all might be safely confided.

Surrounding Arezzo, they devastated the territory within a circuit of six miles, for the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days, but without achieving any farther result. At that period all cities were fortified, and before the invention of gunpowder siege operations had no chance of success, save by treason, against a resolute defence.

If the MacGregors lost, as is averred, only two men slain in the action, they had slight provocation for an indiscriminate massacre. It is said that their fury extended itself to a party of students for clerical orders, who had imprudently come to see the battle. Some doubt is thrown on this fact, from the indictment against the chief of the clan Gregor being silent on the subject, as is the historian Johnston, and a Professor Ross, who wrote an account of the battle <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> years after it was fought.

At the jubilee of the year 1420, just after the victory of Agincourt, no less than a hundred thousand pilgrims are said to have been present. On such occasions every available corner was occupied; the inns, which were exceedingly numerous, the hospitals, and, above all, the religious houses, were thronged with strangers.

The reason of this is, that the intercalary month, inserted at the end of the cycle, contains only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-nine</span> days instead of thirty; whence, after 11 has been added to the epact of the year corresponding to the golden number 19, we must reject twenty-nine instead of thirty, in order to have the epact of the succeeding year; or, which comes to the same thing, we must add twelve to the epact of the last year of the cycle, and then reject thirty as before.

The receptacle was kept constantly cooled by a jet of water, this water and the water of condensation, together with any air or uncondensed steam that might remain in the receptacle, being constantly removed with the aid of an air pump. The apparatus at once demonstrated its practical efficiency,--and the modern steam engine had come into existence.
