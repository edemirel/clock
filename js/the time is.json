In the castle most of its old defences have not been used for many years, perhaps centuries, and old Ben Martlet sets about restoring them, cleaning up the armour, teaching young Roy the arts of self-defence, by putting him through a course of fencing, by restoring the portcullis and draw-bridge, and by training the men from the neighbouring farms to be soldiers.

The great outstanding fact and feature of our time is Monopoly.* [* April 25, 1925.] I have already referred to a debate on Monopoly between Chesterton and Mr. Gordon Selfridge, in which Selfridge, with the familiar unreality of the millionaire, maintained that there was no such thing.

His work alone has sufficed, for him, at least, though <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> past when he can bury himself in his professional work and, in the vernacular, get away with it. Men of the stamp of Herbert Hoover have demonstrated the very great need for men of scientific training in public affairs. Such places heretofore have been filled with business men and lawyers. These men served and served well.

The Guille-Alles Library is proving such an immense boon to our little insular community, that very naturally, many inquiries are from time to time made--especially by strangers--as to how its existence came about. In order to answer these questions we must go as far back as the year 1834. At that time Mr. Guille--who is a...", "...and obtain a charter which united the Colonies yet gave to all the first official right to liberty of conscience ever granted in Europe or America. Prior to that a man's conscience had a brass collar on it with the royal arms engraved thereon, and was kept picketed out in the king's grounds.

With the advent of freedom of political opinion, the individual use of the conscience has become popularized, and <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> coming when it will grow to a great size under our wise institutions and fostering skies.

If I have aided in a proper comprehension of these problems, and, by collecting certain experiences in taxation among other peoples and in different stages of civilization, contributed toward a proper solution, the end of this work will have been attained.

Yet a hundred and fifteen English houses were founded in Stephen's reign, and a hundred and thirteen in the reign of Henry II., and the power of the monastic bodies was still almost...", "...of the same names; and if to this is added the variation of a fortnight or three weeks, which may occur in any season in the ripening of a fruit, \"apricocks\" might well be sometimes gathered on their Midsummer day.

But <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> rapidly approaching when there will be no excuse for ignorance, even if it is not yet time to say that preventable ignorance is vicious. How many mothers, for example, realize that the desire on the part of the child to touch, to do--to get into mischief--is a fundamental characteristic of childhood, and not an indication of perversity in her particular Johnny or Mary? How many know that these instincts are the most useful and the most usable traits that the child has;...", "...and conical mirrors, in both their concave and convex aspects.

He realized that rays of light pass so much faster than those of sound or smell that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> imperceptible to humans. He knew that rays of heat and sound penetrate all matter without our awareness and that opaque bodies offered resistance to passage of light rays.

Mr. HARCOURT: Perhaps the hon. member will allow me to complete my statement as <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> short.* The suspension of the Act would be worse than useless at the present stage. It would suspend the Inquiry which is taking place at this moment in the interests of the Natives themselves. I cannot believe that any further Commission is necessary, as the existing one seems to me both efficient and sufficient. -- * Mr. Harcourt would have shortened the time considerably, had he said \"Yes\" or \"No\", instead of replying in sixteen words. -- == It is not clear...", "...face p._ 12 _The Magician's Wife whistles to the Parrot_ \" 22 _The Dragon Discomfited_ \" 28 '_Will you lend me your ox, fair maiden?_' \" 38 _Abeille finds herself among the Little Men_ \" 46 _King Loc carries Abeille away from her Mother_ \" 56 _The Bunniah's Story_ \" 66 '_Quick! prince! quick! <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> flying, comb me at once_' \" 94 _Samba found skulking by his Wife_ \" 110 _The Princess changes Clothes with the Goose-girl_ \" 162 '_What think you, O mortal, of my fair and lovely wife?_' \" 170 _The Prince has pity on the Gold-headed Fish_ \" 178 '_He never could persuade her to say a...", "...region of horsemen. For the first time in nearly twenty years I swung to the saddle, and by that act recovered a power and a joy which only verse could express. I found myself among men of such endurance and hardihood that I was ashamed to complain of my aching bones and overstrained muscles--men to whom dark nights, precipitous trails, noxious insects, mud and storms were all \"a part of the game.\" In those few days I absorbed the essential outlines of a new world. My note-book of <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> proof of it--and \"The Prairie in the Sky,\" which was the title of the article I wrote for _Harper's Weekly_, is further evidence of it. How beautiful it all was! As I look back upon it I see green parks lit with larkspur and painter's brush. I taste the marvelous freshness of the air. The ptarmigan scuttles away among the rocks, the marmot whistles, the conies utter their slender wistful cries. That trail led me back to the hunter's cabin, to the miner's shack on whose...", "...author of the book. Remember that I must have the title simply _A Man's Life_, and that I should like to have as many copies for my friends as you can get from Colburn--ten, I hope--and that you will continue to report progress, and tell me when it is come out. You must have a copy, Horace Smith one, and Jane and Lady Burghersh; she is to be heard of at Apsley House--Duke of Wellington's--and then I have some friends here; you must send me a parcel by sea. If <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> unfavourable for publication, from men's minds being engrossed with politics, yet it is so far an advantage that my politics go with the times, and not as they would have been some years back, obnoxious and premature.

Annette's spirits gradually revived. She began to deck her person with unusual care; and bringing forth a basket of artificial flowers, she went to work to wreathe a bridal chaplet of white roses. Her companions asked her why she prepared the chaplet. \"What!\" said she with a smile, \"have you not noticed the trees putting on their wedding dresses of blossoms? Has not the swallow flown back over the sea? Do you not know that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> come for Eugene to return? that he will be home to-morrow, and that on Sunday we are to be married?\" Her words were repeated to the physician, and he seized on them at once. He directed that her idea should be encouraged and acted upon. Her words were echoed through the house. Every one talked of the return of Eugene, as a matter of course; they congratulated her upon her approaching happiness, and assisted her in her preparations.

The signs of approval that greeted this proposal showed clearly enough that other members of the deputation had sympathetic leanings towards the larger policy of the minority.

Your position is logical, moderate, and just. All can admit that, although we may not all exactly agree as to whether <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> ripe for the measure.

As experimenters they were valuable; but their pictures, to those unsentimental persons whose appreciations of art are wholly aesthetic, mean little more than records of how a cabbage patch appears at sunrise, a lily pond at midday, or a country lane at twilight. The Impressionists did not amalgamate and express the dreams of their forerunners. They were one of those transitional generations whose vitality is spent in a stupendous endeavour to conceive before <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> ripe. The need for a great birth had not yet made itself felt; for only when the period of embryo is complete can great art be born. Renoir brought forth that issue; and with him evolution seems to halt a moment before plunging onward. The meagre aesthetics of the early Impressionists could not lead to the highest artistic results. Indeed, their animating aims had to be abandoned before Renoir could attain to true significance.

I am glad to say that I suppressed the desire to ask him to use his influence, if any, with Professor Derrick to effect a reconciliation.

A slack time, prolonged beyond a week or so, bores most boys consumedly and ought to bore them all. We are not thinking here of the favoured few who get their fill of fishing and field sports.

Most boys, however, live in quiet homes in towns, far from the opportunity for such things, and how these pass <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> a mystery even to themselves, as many have confessed to us. In plain words, they _kill_ the time, and thereby acquire a most dangerous accomplishment. Some few, it is true, make themselves endlessly useful to their parents, and nothing could be better.

Thus Dr. Cook found among the Eskimo that during the long winter nights the secretions are diminished, muscular power is weak, and the passions are depressed. Soon after the sun appears a kind of rut affects the young population. They tremble with the intensity of sexual passion, and for several weeks much of <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> taken up with courtship and love. Hence, the majority of the children are born nine months later, when the four months of perpetual night are beginning. A marked seasonal periodicity of this kind is not confined to the Arctic regions. We may also find it in the tropics. In Cambodia, Mondiere has found that twice a year, in April and September, men seem to experience a \"veritable rut,\" and will sometimes even kill women who resist them.[129] These two periods, spring and...", "...as one goes to church.

Wednesday I had dinner again with Roger Burns. He told me that the chain store for which he was manager had opened in good shape, and that on the opening day they had given a clock calendar to the visitors as a souvenir.

Above the clock had been written the slogan: \"All <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> the right time to buy kitchen goods from the New England Hardware Company.\" Below the face of the clock was the address and Roger Burns' name as manager. Roger said something, that night, that interested me mightily. \"One reason why chain stores make a success is that they try to dominate the field in one direction. For example, look at the five-and-ten-cent stores. Notice how they all dominate any other store of their kind.

It is as {116} ministering to Jesus Christ that the angel calls himself a \"fellow-servant\" of prophets and apostles, and, generally, of those who keep the words of this revelation. For these reasons in the following remarks I take _vv._ 10 and 11 as spoken by Jesus Christ.

In Sussex that bad repute attaches to the moon that changes on Saturday: \"A Saturday's moon, If it comes once in seven years, it comes too soon.\" It may be hoped that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> not far distant when a scientific meteorology will dissipate the errors of the traditional code now in existence. Of these errors none have greater or more extensive prevalence than the superstitions regarding the influence of the moon on the atmospheric phenomena of wet and dry weather. Howard, the author of _The Climate of London_, after twenty years of close observation, could not determine that the moon had any perceptible influence on the weather. And the best...", "...acknowledged his obligations for aid in his chemical studies. Almost needless to say it has been impossible, in a brief sketch of this kind limited to a single chapter, to give anything like an adequate idea of what the enthusiastic graduate students and professors of the Thirteenth Century succeeded in accomplishing. It is probably this department of University life, however, that has been least understood, or rather we should say most persistently misunderstood. The education of <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> usually supposed to be eminently unpractical, and great advances in the departments of knowledge that had important bearings on human life and its relations were not therefore thought possible. It is just here, however, that sympathetic interpretation and the pointing out of the coordination of intellectual work often considered to be quite distinct from university influences were needed. It is hoped then that this short sketch will prove sufficient to call the attention of...", "...which I had promised him, ushered in a tall friar, habited in the flowing robes of the Dominican Order. \"I bowed to him with that courtesy which, I trust, has always distinguished me in dealing with my equals, even when they also happen to be my enemies. \"'I regret, my father,' I said, 'having to receive you in so unworthy an apartment. Nothing but the most stern necessity compels me.' \"The speech surprised him. He had evidently expected a more abject attitude. \"'My son, <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> short,' he answered, 'and as I doubt not that your sins are many, it were well to waste none of it in idle words.' \"I watched him intently while he spoke, and took his measure. It was important, since the success of the great _coup_ that I projected depended wholly upon the nature of the man with whom I had to deal. \"He was tall, as I have said, but frail and spare of build. I read superstition in the shape of his forehead, which was high, and narrow. His thin lips,...", "...stands; and although, from time to time, parties and men may refuse to observe the spirit of that great provision in the constitution, there it will stand, and in time--and I trust a not far distant time--it will be recognized by every man and woman and child in this broad land, white or black, north or south. It is not safe for it to be otherwise. A right plainly given by the constitution and the laws, withheld or denied, is an uneasy grievance which will never rest. And, therefore, <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> not far distant, when those now strongly actuated by the prejudices and feelings of race will recognize this important doctrine. They will feel that it is for their own safety and for their own good. Blacks and whites are spread all over the south.

The health of the mind is of far more consequence to us than the health of the body. The Ardernes were never yet drivellers. Go forth, man, like your forefathers. I in some sort feel anguish of mind, as well as thou; but I give not way to it. Afflictions are sent by Providence. Let your head contrive and your hand execute, and you will forget your particular griefs in blows given and taken; nay, <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> coming when we shall all have to belt on the brand--that I foresee plainly enough. The Spaniard despises all other nations except the English; we have the honour of his hate because he cannot despise us; and we shall shortly feel the weight of his whole force against us.

Twelve miles from the railroad, in the slight village of Hesperia, a one-street village, one side of the street being in one county and the other side in another, for three days and evenings in midwinter each year, in a ramshackle building, eight hundred people from all parts of the two counties sit in reserved seats, for which they pay a good price, and listen to one or two notable speakers and a number of local functionaries.

It is a great idea, well worked out, and after fourteen years it maintains its lustiness, but I confess to disappointment that the idea has not spread more extensively. It is so useful there, and the idea is so suggestive, that it should have been well-nigh universal, and yet despite occasional bluffs at it, I know of no serious effort to adopt it elsewhere, unless the midwinter...", "...to consolidate with others. This is one of the difficulties. Consolidation will bring about uniformity of taxation in the whole territory affected. This is an advantage in itself.

This is another situation which always complicates the problem. If the old buildings are worthless and if they must be replaced in any event by new buildings, then <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> opportune for considering consolidation. Even after the reorganization is effected, and the new central building located, the cost of education, all things considered, is not increased. It is undoubtedly true that a larger amount of money may be needed to maintain the consolidated school than to maintain all the various small schools which have previously existed. But other factors must be taken into account.

An imperial policy does not necessarily imply such vagaries as the forcible detention of the forcibly annexed Boer republic. But everybody sees that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> near when England must say definitely as to the imperial policy generally whether it will pursue it or abandon it. And it may be remarked in passing that the Gladstone government, thus far, though pursuing this policy more moderately than the Beaconsfield government, shows no intention of abandoning it. Almost everybody admits that if it is abandoned England must sink to the position of a third-rate power like Holland. For what does abandonment mean? It means to have no...", "...purposes, and also incidentally furnish the votes to elect their friends.

It remains to consider how we are to assure ourselves of its truth even within those limits; after what quantity of experience a generalization which rests solely on the Method of Agreement can be considered sufficiently established, even as an empirical law. In a former chapter, when treating of the Methods of Direct Induction, we expressly reserved this question,(174) and <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> now come for endeavoring to solve it. We found that the Method of Agreement has the defect of not proving causation, and can, therefore, only be employed for the ascertainment of empirical laws. But we also found that besides this deficiency, it labors under a characteristic imperfection, tending to render uncertain even such conclusions as it is in itself adapted to prove. This imperfection arises from Plurality of Causes.

Some will have it the tales came wholly from the Celts of Brittany, others that they are derived only from those of Wales. But there is reason in both theories, and the tendency now is to unite them.

They affirmed enthusiastically God's revelation to the universe and to individual man through the Logos. Their imitation of Philo's allegorism serves to mark the important place that he occupied in the learned world during the seventeenth century; and supports, however slightly, the suggestion that he influenced, directly or indirectly, the supreme Jewish philosopher of the age, Baruch de Spinoza. That he was well known in Holland at <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> shown in divers ways.

An imperial policy does not necessarily imply such vagaries as the forcible detention of the forcibly annexed Boer republic. But everybody sees that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> near when England must say definitely as to the imperial policy generally whether it will pursue it or abandon it. And it may be remarked in passing that the Gladstone government, thus far, though pursuing this policy more moderately than the Beaconsfield government, shows no intention of abandoning it. Almost everybody admits that if it is abandoned England must sink to the position of a third-rate power like Holland. For what does abandonment mean? It means to have no...", "...Meanwhile the scientific movement had been proving its power. Science had come to fill the place left void by religion. The period of the Regency (1715-23) is one of transition from the past to the newer age, shameless in morals, degraded in art; the period of Voltaire followed, when intellect sapped and mined the old beliefs; with Rousseau came the explosion of sentiment and an effort towards reconstruction. A great political and social revolution closed the century. The life of <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> seen in many memoirs, and in the correspondence of many distinguished persons, both men and women. Among the former the _Memoires_ of Mdlle. Delaunay, afterwards Mme. de Staal (1684-1750) are remarkable for the vein of melancholy, subdued by irony, underlying a style which is formed for fine and clear exactness. The Duchesse du Maine's lady-in-waiting, daughter of a poor painter, but educated with care, drew delicately in her literary art with an etcher's tool, and her hand...", "...there is for Schindler's story of \"a serious illness in the first months of this year for which he was treated by the highly esteemed physician Dr. Schmidt.\" The remarkable list of compositions and publications belonging to this year is proof sufficient that he suffered no physical disability of such a nature as seriously to interrupt his ordinary vocations; as is also the utter silence of Ries, Breuning, Czerny, Dolezalek and Beethoven himself. The tone of the letters written at <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> also significant on this point. Concerning the failure of his project to follow the example set in 1800 and give a concert towards the close of the winter in the theatre we learn all we know from a letter from his brother Carl to Breitkopf and Haertel dated April 22, 1802. Therein we read: My brother would himself have written to you, but he is ill-disposed towards everything because the Director of the Theatre, Baron von Braun, who, as is known, is a...", "...judgment, (which is the perfectest sort,) is yet to come: and therefore you have still reason enough to review and repent of all that is past, and still pray for the pardon of all the sins that ever you committed, which were forgiven you before.

The important question, therefore, should be: \"Is he ready to receive them?\" If not, if the time is unpropitious, the mental condition inauspicious, better do, say, nothing, than make matters worse. But, unfortunately, it generally happens that at such times the critic is far more concerned at unbosoming himself of his just and wise admonitions than he is as to whether <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> ripe, the conditions the best possible, for the word to be spoken. The sacred writer has something very wise and illuminating to say upon this subject. Solomon says: \"A word spoken in due season, how good is it!\" Note, however, that it must be spoken \"in due season,\" to be good. The same word spoken out of season may be, and often is, exceedingly bad. Again he says: \"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.\" But it must be _fitly_ spoken to be...", "...is only 600 feet above sea-level.

The charmingly artistic wood-carving of the consecration of St. Eloi in the Church of Notre Dame at Bruges is a striking example.

Perhaps one of the best examples of the wood-carving of <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> the pulpit of the Cathedral at Leyden, which was made in this century. The tombs of Mary of Burgundy and of Charles the Bold in the Church of Notre Dame, Bruges, still further emphasize the sculptural capacity of these generations, though, from the rarity of large masterpieces, there were apparently but few opportunities to display it on a monumental scale.

But leaving that which philosophers and medical men write concerning it, and returning to the proper argument, we may say that, in most men in whom one can and ought to be guided by natural judgment, that age lasts for twenty years.

This question is an important one, and has very generally been decided in the negative by the Grand Lodges of this country. But as I unfortunately differ from these high authorities, I cannot refrain, as an apology for this difference of opinion, from presenting the considerations which have led me to the conclusion which I have adopted. I cannot, it is true, in the face of the mass of opposing authority, offer this conclusion as masonic law. But I would fain hope that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> not far distant when it will become so, by the change on the part of Grand Lodges of the contrary decisions which they have made.

My own opinion, in contradiction to this, is, that when a Grand Lodge restores an expelled Mason, on the ground that the punishment of expulsion...", "...Spain, France, Germany, England, etc., did not at once revive the classic lines in woman's clothes.

I have known the time when a pugilistic encounter between two noted champions was almost considered in the light of a national affair; when tens of thousands of individuals, high and low, meditated and brooded upon it, the first thing in the morning and the last at night, until the great event was decided. But <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> past, and many people will say, thank God that it is; all I have to say is, that the French still live on the other side of the water, and are still casting their eyes hitherward--and that in the days of pugilism it was no vain boast to say, that one Englishman was a match for two of t'other race; at present it would be a vain boast to say so, for these are not the days of pugilism.

No doubt the strain on the attention of the audience and on the ingenuity of the playwright is much less; but I find in practice that the Greek form is inevitable when drama reaches a certain point in poetic and intellectual evolution. Its adoption was not, on my part, a deliberate display of virtuosity in form, but simply the spontaneous falling of a play of ideas into the form most suitable to it, which turned out to...", "...earthly use.

For a generation after the death of Augustus no new original literary force appeared. The later poetry of the Augustan age had ended in trifling dilettantism, for the continuance of which the atmosphere of the court was no longer favourable. The class by which literature was encouraged had become both enervated and terrorized. The most remarkable poetical product of <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> the long-neglected astrological poem of Manilius which was written at the beginning of Tiberius's reign. Its vigour and originality have had scanty justice done to them owing to the difficulty of the subject-matter and the style, and the corruptions which still disfigure its text. Very different has been the fate of the _Fables_ of Phaedrus.

A family inhabiting a castle in Shetland, a group of islands to the north of Scotland, is also apparently entitled to a title and lands in Spain and elsewhere. But who of the Shetland family is the rightful heir? The Spanish usurpers are well aware that the true heir is in Shetland, and their agent is a priest who appears several times in the book.

It is a story. There are two characters--a middle-aged married couple living in a plain farmhouse; one point on the field of human nature is located; at that point one subject is treated; in the treatment one movement is directed toward one climax; no external event whatsoever is introduced; and <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> about forty hours. A second story of equal length, laid in the same house, is expected to appear within a twelvemonth. The same father and mother are characters, and the family friend the country doctor; but subordinately all. The main story concerns itself with the four children of the two households. It is an American children's story: \"A Brood of The Eagle.\" During the year a third work, not fiction, will be published, entitled: \"The Christmas Tree: An...", "...before he'd come for him again, and he went away.

And then he sent to the house that had been spoken of to know how was the man of it, and word came back that he was dead. I remember when he was dying, a friend of his, one Cooney, came in to see him, and said: \"Well, Raftery, <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> not up yet that death gave you to live.\" And he said: \"The Church and myself have it made out that it was not death that was there, but the devil that came to tempt me.\" His description of death in his poem on the 'Vision,' is vivid and unconventional:-- 'I had a vision in my sleep last night, between sleeping and waking, a figure standing beside me, thin, miserable, sad, and sorrowful; the shadow of night upon his face, the tracks of the tears down...", "...my opinion that Captain Fritz was in charge of the removal of Oswald from the city jail to the county jail.

In examining the scientific evidence of these scriptural views concerning a spiritual existence, it will be necessary to inquire into the origin of {203} life as exhibited in physiology.

Certainly there were ugly-looking incidents which appeared to indicate a close co-operation with the Germans.

The first semi-chorus sides with Antigone; the second declares its resolution to follow to its last resting-place the body of Eteocles. And thus the play ends.

Associations are being accumulated also by the New York Publisher, who, accompanied by his son, the Young Publisher, and by his birds, arrives every year with the first breath of spring. It is chiefly to artists that his house is open, though he gives the literary...", "...is this?\" It was a small half-circle of fine white gauze, edged with a fringe of frosted silver, while a tiny chain of the same material was attached to each end. \"Oh! that is the mask,\" said Mrs. Goddard. \"The mask?\" repeated Edith, surprised. \"Yes; I don't wonder you look astonished, to find such a thing among the outfit of a bride,\" said madam, with a peculiar little laugh; \"but although it is a profound secret to everybody outside the actors, I will explain it to you, as <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> so near. You understand this is a play that I have myself written.\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I have entitled it 'The Masked Bridal,' and it is a very cunningly devised plot, on the part of a pair of lovers whose obdurate parents refuse to allow them to marry,\" Madam explained. \"Edith Lancaster is an American girl, and Henri Bernard is a Frenchman. They have a couple of friends whose wedding is set for a certain date, and who plan to help them outwit the parents of Edith and...", "...turn out to be very indifferent blossoms. DAM. Ah! your autumnal maiden is so near a neighbour of your wintery one, that when you have folded the full blown blossom to your heart, you will find to your dismay, that all its leaves are falling at your feet; but I understand your rhapsody--you have betrayed yourself, and now I ask you a plain question--are you going to be married? NIG. To make a plain reply, what is it to you? _(Knocking without.)_ Another call, what shall I do? How <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> getting on--my only chance is to drop out of the window into the road. _MR. NARCISSUS BOSS, without, F.E.L._ BOSS. Mr. Niggle at home? Oh, very well. [_Enters._] Good morning to you, Niggle. Ah! Damper, _you_ here. _(Crosses to C.)_ Ladies, your most obedient, I dropped in to see my friend. Mr. Niggle, the strangest bit of gossip you ever heard--while I was at my tailor's, suggesting an alteration in my arm-holes--clumsy fellow has made me thirty coats and can't fit me...", "...Louis, that, not to compromise either France or Holland, I would tempt fortune myself in person, as I had already done, with two hundred gentlemen, if he would give them to me; and a million, if he would lend it me.\" \"Well, sire?\" \"Well, monsieur, I am suffering at this moment something strange, and that is, the satisfaction of despair. There is in certain souls,--and I have just discovered that mine is of the number,--a real satisfaction in the assurance that all is lost, and <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> come to yield.\" \"Oh, I hope,\" said Athos, \"that your majesty is not come to that extremity.\" \"To say so, my lord count, to endeavor to revive hope in my heart, you must have ill understood what I have just told you. I came to Blois to ask of my brother Louis the alms of a million, with which I had the hopes of re-establishing my affairs; and my brother Louis has refused me. You see, then, plainly, that all is lost.\" \"Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary...", "...their attention was attracted by a bustle outside, and they moved to the window. It was the carriage coming round for Lady Isabel--the late earl's chariot, which was to convey her to the railway station six or seven miles off. It had four post-horses to it, the number having been designated by Lord Mount Severn, who appeared to wish Isabel to leave the neighborhood in as much state as she had entered it. The carriage was packed, and Marvel was perched outside. \"All is ready,\" she said, \"and <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> come for me to go. Mr. Carlyle I am going to leave you a legacy--those pretty gold and silver fish that I bought a few weeks back.\" \"But why do you not take them?\" \"Take them to Lady Mount Severn! No, I would rather leave them with you. Throw a few crumbs into the globe now and then.\" Her face was wet with tears, and he knew that she was talking hurriedly to cover her emotion. \"Sit down a few minutes,\" he said. \"No--no. I had better go at once.\" He took her hand to conduct...", "...One dream comes to me every night--whenever I sleep--and I wake, all over perspiration, and with a terror I'm ashamed of. In this dream I see my brother always, and always with the same expression. He looks at me long and mournfully, and his finger is uplifted, as if in warning. I hear no word from his lips, but they are in motion as if he spoke, and then he walks slowly away. Thus, for several nights, has my mind been haunted, and I'm sure it is not for nothing. It warns me that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> not very far distant when I shall receive the wages of a life like mine--the wages of sin--the death, perhaps--who knows?--the death of the felon!\" \"These are fearful fancies, indeed, Mr. Munro; and, whether we think on them or not, will have their influence over the strongest-minded of us all: but the thoughts which they occasion to your mind, while they must be painful enough, may be the most useful, if they awaken regret of the past, and incite to amendment in the...", "...opera of the gods,\" he answered. \"But we digress far from our point, Jehu, which is a discussion concerning the implementation of our plans of action formed in preparation of our current situation.\" \"So I had surmised,\" I smiled at the reminder, \"But tell me, what are your plans, and what is the current situation?\" \"This is a time of fulfillment, with the events of many of our prophecies coming to pass. Now is a time of action and of hope. You, our kinsman redeemer, have come, and <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> ripe for victory and domination, ripe, in short, for a return to natural existence, harmony between forces interior and exterior. Our plan, my dear Jehu, is to attack the Zards swiftly and fiercely and break their strongholds like the walls of Jericho, literally.\" \"It sounds daring, certainly,\" I said, \"But is it not overly so? I was under the impression that the Zards were much superior in force than the Canitaurs.\" \"In the southern regions, where you landed, yes,...", "...smarter boy than I am, after all.\" The teacher answered,-- \"I am free and single, and have time to think about it for a while.\" To himself he said, \"Before I get into the clutches of one of these peasant-camels, I'll run away with a baboon.\" \"Well, you must excuse me now,\" said Buchmaier. \"I must go afield: I'm just trading for a horse, and must see how he behaves in harness. See you to-night, I hope. Goodbye, meanwhile. Going up street, Mat?\" \"Yes. Good-bye, Mr. Teacher, and if <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> long take it double.\" The teacher did not quite understand the last speech of Mat, which was a figure derived from a long thread or string. When the door closed upon the peasants he gave it another push, as if to assure himself that he was now alone. He was oppressed in spirit, though without knowing why. At length the story of the Lauterbacher recurred to him. He regarded it as a piece of coarse vulgarity, sufficient to make him forget all the well-meant attentions...", "...you know, there's really a chance that we may see her before long! She'll have a holiday at Easter, from the Thursday night to Monday night, and I have all but got her to promise that she'll come over here. Wouldn't it be fun to let her see the Black Country? You remember her talk about it. I could get her a room, and if it's at all bearable weather, we would all have a day somewhere. Wouldn't you like that?\" \"Yes; but I should greatly prefer a day with you alone.\" \"Oh, of course, <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> coming for that, Would you let us come here one day?\" With a persistence not to be mistaken Eve avoided all intimate topics; at the same time her manner grew more cordial. Through February and March, she decidedly improved in health. Hilliard saw her seldom, but she wrote frequent letters, and their note was as that of her conversation, lively, all but sportive. Once again she had become a mystery to her lover; he pondered over her very much as in the days when they were...", "...She had received many such epistles of late, and the novelty was wearing off. \"You know its contents, I presume. Read it for me. What says his Holiness?\" Ravenna broke the seal and unfolded the letter which was a somewhat lengthy one, and written in the choicest Latinity. \"The Holy Father greets you as his dear daughter _in Christo_, and, as you are now firmly established upon the throne\"--Barbara could not repress a smile in view of the recent menace of the Czar--\"he deems that <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> ripe for the public avowal of your faith.\" \"At last the Pope and I are at one. This night shall Radzivil make known my faith to the Diet. I ever loathed this garb of secrecy and hypocrisy.\" \"Its assumption was necessary. The saints themselves must bow in the house of Rimmon at times.\" \"Would that I could drop the other deception and reign in my own name!\" murmured Barbara to herself. \"His Holiness,\" proceeded the cardinal, glancing at the papal missive,...", "...lift it; with teeth fierce-clenched he strove against his weakness until his breath waxed short and the sweat ran from him, but ever the great blade grew the heavier. Then he groaned to find himself so feeble, and cried aloud an exceeding bitter cry, and cast the sword from him, and, staggering, fell into Roger's waiting arms. Forthwith Roger bare him to the cave and laid him down upon his bed. \"Master,\" quoth he, \"O master, grieve not thyself, thou shalt be hale and strong anon, but <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> not yet. Comfort ye, comfort ye, my lord--ere long thou shalt be strong, aye, and mightier e'en than aforetime. So grieve not nor repine, my master!\" But Beltane lay heeding not, nor would he eat despite all Roger's wheedling arts; but being fevered and athirst, drank deep of the sleeping draught, and thereafter, falling to his black humour, turned his face to the shadows, and, lying thus, straightway fell to weeping, very silently, because of his so great weakness,...", "...Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 66:001:002 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 66:001:003 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> at hand. 66:001:004 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 66:001:005 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his...", "...who was altogether too easy-going to molest him, there was not one of the animals that could thrash him, and they all knew it and let him alone. You can often manage very well without brains if only you have the necessary teeth and muscle and claws; and the old lynx had them, without a doubt. But I fear that Nature, in adapting a wild animal to his environment, now and then forgets to allow for the human element in the problem. Brains are a good thing to have, after all. Even to a lynx <span class=\"clocktext\">the time is</span> pretty sure to come, sooner or later, when he needs them in his business. Your fellow-citizens of the woods may treat you with all due respect, but the trapper won't, and he'll get you if you don't watch out. One day he found some more snow-shoe tracks, just like those that the shanty-boy had left, and instead of running away, as he ought to have done, and as most of the animals would have had sense enough to do, he followed them up to see where they led. He wasn't..."]
