Four forms of teeth are recognised in the Mammals: the incisors in the front of the jaw, the pointed, round canines or \"eye-teeth\" next to them, and at the sides the cheek teeth, separated into premolars and molars. In describing the teeth in any species a simple formula is adopted which shows at a glance the number of each kind in one side of each jaw.
