Frau Hadebusch appeared in the hall, wringing her hands. Behind her stood Philippina. Two men forced their way in, ran up to Daniel and the American, and tried to separate them. But they had bitten into each other like two mad dogs; and it was necessary to call for help.

Immediately afterwards she said--and subsequently it seemed to me marvellous: \"You are something more than the chorus to the play this time, Dr. Marmion.\" A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> after, and Justine was dragged into our boat, and was followed by Mrs. Falchion, whose first words to Roscoe were: \"It is not such a meeting as one would plan.\" And he replied: \"I am glad no harm has come to you.\" The man was duly helped in. A poor creature he was, to pass from this tale as he entered it, ignominiously and finally here. I even hide his nationality, for his race are generally more gallant. But he was wealthy, had an intense admiration for Mrs. Falchion,...", "...cut off part of the stem, and Liza will put it on his dresser for him to wear. _Sister!_ wouldn't it be fun to write him an invitation exactly like the kind Mother sends when she has a dinner party?

We shall seal it and paste an old stamp on it and make a postmark just as the girls at Maryvale did with the letters they sent me by Aunt Mary. Liza will lay it on the hall table where Uncle will see it the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he comes in.\" Sister Julia seated herself at Mary's little desk and soon had the following invitation written: Miss Mary Selwyn requests the pleasure of Doctor Francis P.

'They won't come, dear. Get into bed, and I'll go and tell them directly.' She could have wept for misery, but she must be strong for Thyrza's sake. Whatever hope remained depended now upon her own self-command and prudence. When Thyrza had lain down, Lydia succeeded in showing almost a cheerful face. 'I'll just go down and say you're poorly. You won't move till I come back?' Thyrza shook her head. Her sister was only away for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. She reentered the room panting with the speed she had made. And she sat down at the bedside. There was no word for a long time. Thyrza's eyes were closed; her lips quivered every now and then with a faint sob. The golden braid, which Lydia had not troubled to undo, lay under her cheek. Lydia held counsel with herself. Something had happened, something worse, she thought, than a mere fit of wretchedness in the suffering heart. There was no explaining the disordered...", "...is the House of Commons way of saying that people are very anxious to hear what is about to be said. Mr. Mellor gives an answer that satisfies Mr. Shaw. Mr. Dalziel--another sturdy Scotch Radical--is also satisfied; and so we have all the Liberal vote, with the single exception of Labby--who quickly--furtively--almost shamefacedly--rushes off into the Tory lobby. [Sidenote: Hoisting the numbers.] And now the division takes place. There have been several speeches--usually of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> each--before the final hour comes; but we are all so anxious to know what fate is in store for us, that we cannot stand the strain any longer. The division--the division--let us know the worst. Be it good, or be it ill--let it come at once.

The water is then rubbed over the bodies of those present, and a few drops sprinkled on the walls of the house as a ceremony of purification. The priest's great toes are then washed in a cup of water, and he dips the lingam he wears into this, and then sips a few drops of the water, each person present doing the same. This is called karuna or sanctification. He then dips a new lingam into the holy water, and ties it round the child's neck for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, afterwards handing it to the mother to be kept till the child is old enough to wear it. The dead are buried in a sitting posture, the lingam being placed in the palm of the hand.

It was comfortably hung with a sort of warm-coloured worsted, manufactured in Scotland, approaching in trexture to what is now called shalloon.

Mr. and Mrs. Vale and the grandmother, an upright old lady with a China-crape shawl and white hair, us five and a man and maid-servant behind. The river lay on the right, the church was in front of us; people dotted the fields on their way to it, and the bells were ringing as they do at a wedding. \"This is a different sort of Sunday from what we thought last Thursday it would be,\" I said in Tod's ear when we were together for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> at the gate. \"Johnny, if I were older, and went in for that kind of thing, as perhaps I shall do sometime, I should like to put up a public thanksgiving in church to-day.\" \"A public thanksgiving?\" \"For mercies received.\" I stared at Tod.

Perhaps this might be called the beginning of the end of the chain of events that...", "...the colouring of the subjects they represent. To some extent this defect has been remedied by painting them by hand, but this method is too expensive for general adoption, and moreover does not yield very satisfactory results. Attempts to adapt three-colour photography, by using simultaneously three films, each with a source of light of appropriate colour, and combining the three images on the screen, have to overcome great difficulties in regard to maintenance of register, because very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> errors of adjustment between the pictures on the films are magnified to an intolerable extent by projection. In a process devised by G.A. Smith, the results of which were exhibited at the Society of Arts, London, in December 1908, the number of colour records was reduced to two. The films were specially treated to increase their sensitiveness to red. The photographs were taken through two colour filters alternately interposed in front of the film; both admitted white and yellow,...", "...and he looks as if he'd treat me decently.\" She laid her hand on Alison's arm, and seemed to hesitate. \"A neighbor, another farmer, came in with him--and he hasn't found anybody yet.\" Alison shrank from her, white in face now, with an almost intolerable sense of disgust, but in another moment or two the blood surged into her cheeks, and her companion made a half-ashamed gesture. \"Oh, well,\" she said, \"I think you're foolish, but I won't say any more about it. Besides, I had only a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. Charley's waiting in the street for me now.\" She withdrew somewhat hastily, and Alison sat still, almost too troubled to be capable of indignation, forcing herself to think. One thing was becoming clear; she must escape from Winnipeg before the unpleasant suggestion was made to her again, perhaps by some man in person, and go on farther West. After all, she had one friend, the one her mother had persecuted, living somewhere within reach of a station which she had...", "...want anything said about it; Hayes and I are old pals; but it's a damned nuisance to have an acting manager who's always boozed.

'I hope he won't get into any trouble.' 'It's nothing at all. We never, you know, take the full number of tickets, for it is impossible for the guard to count us all; and besides, there are some members who always run down the platform; and in that way we save a good deal of coin, which is spent in drinks all round.' But guessing what was...", "...of knowledge in things where our faculties can fully reach, yet we should not assume to ourselves sounder judgements than those of our fathers; I will therefore venture to relate that Paoli has at times extraordinary impressions of distant and future events. The way in which I discovered it was this: Being very desirous of studying so exalted a character, I so far presumed upon his goodness to me, as to take the liberty of asking him a thousand questions with regard to the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and private circumstances of his life. Having asked him one day when some of his nobles were present, whether a mind so active as his was employed even in sleep, and if he used to dream much, Signor Casa Bianca said, with an air and tone which implied something of importance, \"Si, si sogna. Yes, he dreams.\" And upon my asking him to explain his meaning, he told me that the General had often seen in his dreams, what afterwards came to pass. Paoli confirmed this by several...", "...gave her a quick look. She longed to ask her about her brother's plans, but it would not be right to do so. And besides, Miss Agnace might not know, and might not tell her if she did. \"After all He has brought you through to these happy days, you are surely not forgetting to bring your trouble to Him, are you?\" It was not just the way Miss Agnace was wont to speak; but even Miss Agnace was beginning to see things differently, in the new light that was shining on them, and for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Frederica forgot her own trouble, looking at her wistfully. \"Are you glad to be here, Miss Agnace? Are you happy here?\" said she. \"Will you never go away from us any more?\" \"Oh! as to going away--no, while my young lady needs me,\" said Miss Agnace. \"Not even if Father Jerome said you must?\" The name had not been mentioned for a long time between them. An odd look came over Miss Agnace's face. \"He will not say it,\" said she. \"Did he wish you to come? I am very...", "...she still thought it an impossible duty in her own particular case. \"I do indeed, my daughter,\" repeated Mrs. Montgomery; \"that does not make my love to you the less, but the more, Ellen.\" \"Oh, mamma, mamma,\" said Ellen, clinging to her, \"I wish you would teach me! I have only you, and I am going to lose you. What shall I do, mamma?\" With a voice that strove to be calm Mrs. Montgomery answered, \"'I love them that love Me, and they that seek Me early shall find Me.'\" And after a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two she added, \"He who says this has promised too that He will 'gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.'\" The words fell soothingly on Ellen's ear, and the slight tremor in the voice reminded her also that her mother must not be agitated. She checked herself instantly, and soon lay as before, quiet and still on her mother's bosom, with her eyes fixed on the fire; and Mrs. Montgomery did not know that when she now and then pressed a kiss upon the forehead...", "...louder mutterings of thunder following each dull flash from out the cloudy, cavernous depths. In the silence he could hear an occasional click as of some iron implement, and he opined that the pirates were burying the chest, though just where they were at work he could neither see nor tell. Still he lay there watching and listening, and by and by a puff of warm air blew across the sand, and a thumping tumble of louder thunder leaped from out the belly of the storm cloud, which every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> was coming nearer and nearer. Still Tom Chist lay watching. Suddenly, almost unexpectedly, the three figures reappeared from behind the sand hill, the pirate captain leading the way, and the negro and white man following close behind him. They had gone about halfway across the white, sandy level between the hill and the hummock behind which Tom Chist lay, when the white man stopped and bent over as though to tie his shoe. This brought the negro a few steps in front of his...", "...warning and remonstrance came in vain to the man who, comparing Lucretia's mental power to Susan's, had learned to despise the unlearned, timid sense of the latter. It is unnecessary to trace this change in Mainwaring step by step, or to measure the time which sufficed to dazzle his reason and blind his honour. In the midst of schemes and hopes which the lust of gold now pervaded came a thunderbolt. An anonymous letter to the head partner of the bank provoked suspicions that led to <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> examination of the accounts. It seemed that sums had been irregularly advanced (upon bills drawn by men of straw) to the speculator by Mainwaring; and the destination of these sums could be traced to gambling operations in trade in which Mainwaring had a private interest and partnership. So great, as we have said, had been the confidence placed in William's abilities and honour that the facilities afforded him in the disposal of the joint stock far exceeded those usually granted...", "...to kill. A moment before he had been shrouded in gloom, for the sun was already fast setting, and the roof of leaves overhead cast a deep shadow upon everything beneath. Suddenly, however, he came into clear view, and Hal and Gerald, who were crouching within five or six paces of him, saw him distinctly. Click! An excited negro pulled back his trigger in readiness, and Pedro, hearing the sound, stood suddenly still, rooted to the spot, and listening with all his ears. For more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> a death-like silence reigned, while the half-caste peered into the forest, doubtful whether to advance or retire. Prudence told him to hasten back to his friends, for the young fellow he was in search of had already proved that he was capable of looking well after himself. But fierce longing for revenge, the feeling that this was an opportunity not to be missed--one, too, that would enable him to attain his end without much danger to himself, for he hoped for a complete...", "...seen on the top of the ridge. The stranger was old Sass. At a glance he took in the state of affairs. Instead of descending, however, he turned round and shouted loudly in Cree-- \"Come on, come on! Here are your enemies, here are your enemies! We've a fine band of them in our power. Quick, quick, or they will escape us!\" Then, as if his followers were close behind, he began to descend almost as rapidly as had the younger men. The Blackfeet, evidently believing that in another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> a large body of their foes would be upon them, turned their horses' heads, and without looking again at the top of the ridge, began a rapid retreat, carrying Mysticoose along with them, their flight hastened by the loud shout which, Hector and Norman setting the example, was raised by the white men. Norman had not forgotten the poor fellow who had fallen in his defence, and succeeded in catching him as he came to the surface, and dragging him to the shore. \"We must get to...", "...troopers, stationed behind the stack, galloped off the horses. The man with the flag was the last to go, closing the procession with rather more dignity. But in ten seconds the whole lot had decamped, and the only men we could see were the dragoons of the patrol, who rode back to the ridge at full speed. But just as they reached it the second battery opened fire, and this time the sighting was just right. The four white puffs appeared exactly over the spot where the Staff had stood a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before--two to the right and two to the left of the stack. And all we now saw of the patrol was two riderless horses galloping madly towards the woods. Then the two batteries pounded away with a will. When I had received orders to resume the forward movement and my good Chasseurs had taken up the pursuit again, the gunners had lengthened their range with mathematical precision, and the shells burst on the farther side of the ridge. I took a grim pleasure in imagining what...", "...leant across the mattress. Without looking round he took up the instruments he wanted, knowing the order in which they lay. He had been excellently taught. The noiseless movements of his white fingers were marvellously dexterous--neat, rapid, and finished. The evil-looking instruments gleamed and flashed beneath the gaslight. He had a peculiar little habit of wiping each one on his shirt-sleeve before and after use, leaving a series of thin red stripes there. After the lapse of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he raised his head, wiped something which he held in his fingers, and passed it across to the Provincial. \"That is the bullet, my father,\" he said, without ceasing his occupation, and without raising his eyes from the wounded man. \"Will he live?\" asked the Jesuit casually, while he examined the bullet. \"If he tries, my father,\" was the meaning reply. The young doctor was bandaging now, skilfully and rapidly. \"This would be the death of a dog,\" said the Provincial, as...", "...Achilles his conquerer.--FELTON. Footnotes for Book XIII: 1. We are hurried through this book by the warlike ardor of the poet. Battle succeeds battle with animating rapidity. The speeches are in fine keeping with the scenes, and the similes are drawn from the most imposing natural phenomena. The descriptions possess a wonderful distinctness and vigor, presenting the images to the mind by a few bold and grand lines, thus shunning the confusion of intricate and <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> detail.--FELTON. 2.

The following simile is...", "...me, I was speechless for five days, and they had no thought that I would ever speak again,--in Congress or any where else. And so the woman, who had a bottle of Batesman's draps, thought if they killed me, I would only die any how, and so she would try it with me. She gave me the whole bottle, which throwed me into a sweat that continued on me all night; when at last I seemed to make up, and spoke, and asked her for a drink of water. This almost alarmed her, for she was looking every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> for me to die. She gave me the water, and, from that time, I began slowly to mend, and so kept on till I was able at last to walk about a little. I might easily have been mistaken for one of the Kitchen Cabinet, I looked so much like a ghost.

But if I should be forced to take the \"white house,\" then it will...", "...and in defiance of the law against giving liquor to natives, I made a great tin of brandy toddy, of which all partook, along with tinned salmon and dough-nuts.

But that was not to be thought of while those terrible machine guns were able to rain their hail of death down from the tops, and the quick-firing cannon were hurling their thirty shots a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> across the intervening space of water. The French cruiser had so far taken no notice of the sudden annihilation of her second torpedo-boat by the air-ship, but as soon as the latter made her way astern of her she seemed to scent mischief, and turned one of her three-barrelled Nordenfeldts on to her.

If you are buying a special dynamo for direct drive, your manufacturer can supply you with a machine that will maintain constant voltage under the normal variations in speed of your wheel. _A System of Resistances_ (2) Constant load systems. This system provides that the dynamo shall be delivering a fixed amount of current at all times, under which circumstances the water wheel would not require regulation, as the demands on it would not vary from minute to <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or hour to hour. This system is very simply arranged. It consists of having a set of \"resistances\" to throw into the circuit, in proportion to the amount of current used. Let us say, as an example, that a 50-ampere generator is used at a pressure of 110 volts; and that it is desirable to work this plant at 80 per cent load, or 40 amperes current draft.

She ended by saying: \"Oh, I am well off now. I don't have to worry.\" Then she became confused again, and said in a lower tone: \"It is to you that I owe it, anyhow; and you know I do not want any wages. No, indeed! No, indeed!

Farther along the same passage I found the kitchen and other domestic offices. The kitchen clock was just on the point of six as I went in. One servant alone had come down. From her I inquired my way into the garden, and next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> I was on the lawn.

I had gone through enough unhappiness during these past weeks to last me a lifetime, but all that I had endured would be as nothing by comparison with this. I could not blind myself to one fact--I had poisoned old Taylor deliberately. Had I, by some hideous miscalculation, the result of ignorance, overdosed him, and brought his poor old life to a premature end?

The important part played by the centrosome in fertilization,[26] first described by van Beneden and Theodor Boveri in their papers of 1887-1888, together with the behaviour of this structure in mitosis, led these authors to regard the centrosome not only as the dynamic centre of the cell but as a permanent cell-organ, which, like the nucleus, passed by division from...", "...transport of the Shans, which make thirty-four stages from Mongnai to Kengtung.

Moreover, baggage of all sorts and shapes can be loaded on mules, whereas bullocks cannot carry any that will not fit into their baskets.

Fake plays were riddled by swift and sagacious end rushes, for one side or the other, hurling attacks against the center were crushed and flung back; and, more and more as the battle raged, it became evident that the regular eleven, while good, were no whit better than the scrubs. The fight in the first half was carried into the last <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of the play. The whistle separated the combatants, and neither side had scored. During the interval that followed Ballard sought to tell his dream, Merriwell and Clancy, however, were in close and earnest conversation regarding the players and had no time for anything not connected with the game. \"With material like that to choose from, Chip,\" said Clancy, \"it ought not to be much of a trick to select an eleven that would put it all over Gold Hill.\" \"From all I can hear,...", "...vessel. She came on swiftly, sheering the water with her sharp bow. And Clif could see half a dozen men standing in the bow watching them. \"Perhaps they have heard of our escape,\" he growled, \"and come after us.\" The vessel was not coming from Havana, but the cadet knew that a telegram might have sent it out. At any rate, they were recaptured; and the horrors of Morro were before them again. Steadily the gunboat drew nearer; the two half-drowned Americans were reached in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. And the vessel slowed up and a rope was thrown to them. Clif desperate from despair, seized it and drew himself close. A couple of Spanish sailors leaned down from the low side and lifted first the half unconscious girl and then the cadet up to the deck. And then, weak and pale and dripping wet, they confronted a tall, ugly-looking Spaniard with an officer's chevrons. He stared at them curiously. \"Who are you?\" he demanded. And Clif, grim with desperation,...", "...through my frame with a tender, reviving influence--the same influence which the sunshine had, weeks afterwards, when I enjoyed it for the first time out of doors. The next sound that came to me was audible in my room; audible sometimes, close at my pillow. It was the simplest sound imaginable--nothing but the soft rustling of a woman's dress. And yet, I heard in it innumerable harmonies, sweet changes, and pauses minute beyond all definition. I could only open my eyes for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> at a time, and even then, could not fix them steadily on anything; but I knew that the rustling dress was Clara's; and fresh sensations seemed to throng upon me, as I listened to the sound which told me that she was in the room.

The Russian vessels now swept round, apparently with the intention of running across the bay, firing their broadsides at the _Tornado_, but with little effect; and she, in return, as they exposed their sterns in flight, kept up a brisk fire at them with shot and shell. One of them now burst into flames, and in half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> blew up, destroying the greater number of her unhappy crew. The other two, however, still continued on their course, hoping, apparently, to get out of the bay ahead of the _Giaour_, not being aware, it was evident, that another English ship was near at hand to cut them off.

There was, however, a particular rock on the spur of the mountain from whence we always watched the sun set; there was a much wider view from thence.

We had bade a final adieu to the summer land, and the rigor of the south polar regions was ahead. Darkness was coming down upon us, as well as the cold, and occasional masses of floating ice were seen from time to time.

CELL THEORY. It had, indeed, long been recognized that the tissues of plants were to a large extent composed of minute vesicular bodies, technically called cells (Hooke, Malpighi, Grew). In 1831 the discovery was made by the great botanist, Robert Brown, that in many families of plants a circular spot, which he named areola or nucleus, was present in each cell; and in 1838 M. J.

In November, 1774, a company of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> men was raised and placed under the command of Isaac Davis.

Then he got out and dragged the boat back upstream and tied the rope to the tree just where we...", "...my very head. I then realized what extraordinary effect fear can have on the mind, for I fancied that, if I was not annihilated by the fires of heaven which were flashing all around me, it was only because they could not enter my magic ring.

But what chiefly riveted their attention was a small basin-like pool with a smooth level sandy bottom, as they could clearly see from their elevated stand-point.

The plug is a square-threaded worm, the length of which and the distance which it enters the barrel of the baffler determining the amount of flow. The greater the number of turns which the water must pass through in the worm the less will flow against the step-pressure. [Illustration: FIG. 23] The engineers who have settled upon the flow and the pressure decided that a flow of from 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 gallons per <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and a step-pressure of from 425 to 450 pounds is correct. These factors are so dependent upon each other and upon the conditions of the step-bearing itself that they are sometimes difficult to realize in every-day work; nor is it necessary. If the machine turns freely with a lower pressure than that prescribed by the engineers, there is no reason for raising this pressure; and there is only one way of doing it without reducing the area of the step-bearing, and that is by...", "...bravado).

The ability to read a chart must include an understanding of all its features, such as scale, projection, geographic position, directions, depths, plane of reference, aids to navigation, tides, currents, elevations, topography, and date of survey and publication. #Scale.# For American and British charts the scale is usually expressed by the inches or fractions of an inch to the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or degree of latitude, or by the fractional proportion of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance on the earth. These fractions are sometimes stated on the British charts, and nearly always on those of the United States Coast Survey. The chart catalogues give the scale in one or the other form. A familiarity with the meaning of scales is of value in selecting the most suitable chart, in judging of the relative uses of charts, and in estimating distances.

Your father generally wore a straw hat. Can't you make out his face?\" \"No,\" said Nic, taking his eye from the glass quickly, and gazing at the boat, which seemed to have suddenly gone back some distance. \"I want to look without the glass,\" he added, after a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or so; and then, forgetful of the glorious panorama spread around beyond the blue lake-like harbour, he held on by the rail, gazing hard at the approaching boat, seeing neither of the others, only that one with the white jacketed men who made the water flash at each dip of the oars. Then by degrees Nic began to make out the faces, which grew clearer and clearer, till the figure wearing the straw hat rose up and waved it, and the officer in uniform rose up then and took off his...", "...RESOLVE. \"I beg pardon,\" said Ella, upon seeing who occupied the room. \"I thought that Mrs Bray would be here.\" \"No, not here now, Miss Bedford,\" said Max, in his best style. \"But take a chair; she won't be long first.

It is variously described, sometimes as a reticulate network, sometimes as a mass of threads or fibres, and sometimes as a mass of foam (Fig. 23, _a_).

There is no question, however, that all protoplasm is permeated when alive by a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> delicate mass of material, which may take the form of threads or fibres or may assume other forms. Within the meshes of this thread or reticulum there is found a liquid, perfectly clear and transparent, to whose presence the liquid character of the protoplasm is due (Fig. 23, _b_). In this liquid no structure can be determined, and, so far as we know, it is homogeneous. Still further study discloses other complexities.

As a rule they are dry and precise, though here and there rays of glory appear which prove that the master was capable of poetic expression even in prose. A rather fine hymn has been ascribed to him.

He was royally clad, his breast gleaming with jewels. He was certainly handsome; he had the carriage...", "...nothing to do but sit and watch him, and so I saw more of him than the ones who came and went all the time. As long as there was any one in the room, he complained dreadfully about his sore foot, and then cheered up and talked, and he could tell interesting things.

Well, I hadn't made over eight or ten miles the first morning, when, as I rounded a turn in the trail, a man stepped out from behind a rock, threw a gun in my face, and ordered me to hold up my hands. Then another appeared from the opposite side with his gun leveled on me. Inside of half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> a dozen men galloped up from every quarter, all armed to the teeth. The man on leaving had given me his gun for company, one of these old smoke-pole, cap-and-ball six-shooters, but I must have forgotten what guns were for, for I elevated my little hands nicely.

Englishmen are aware of the fact, merely as a fact; but they seldom seem to appreciate its full significance. Let us consider for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> what would be the effect on the British people if it suddenly came into possession of such an estate. We are not talking now of distant colonies: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa--these may be equal together to more than another United States, and they are working out their own destiny.

It was almost a relief to Lycidas to hear at last the sound of a human voice from one of those phantom-like toilers by night. He who spoke was the fiercest-looking of the band, with something of the wildness of Ishmael's race on features whose high strongly-marked outlines showed the Hebrew cast of countenance in its most exaggerated type. \"There's more thunder in the air,\" he observed, resting for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> on his spade, and addressing himself to him whom Lycidas had mentally named \"the Hebrew prince,\" on account of his commanding height and noble demeanour, and the deference with which his order had been received. No answer was returned to the remark, and the wild-looking Jew spoke again,-- \"Have you heard that Apelles starts to-morrow for Modin, charged with a mission from the tyrant to compel its inhabitants to do sacrifice to one of his accursed idol-gods?\" \"Is it so?...", "...'s a true bill this time.

Sigismund, Emperor (p. 205) of Germany, first visited the King of France in his capital, and then extended his journey to England, with a view of bringing about a peace, though all his efforts proved unavailing. On his approach towards England, the utmost pains seem to have been taken to make his reception worthy of his high dignity and of the English people. The orders of council are very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and interesting;[155] and the arrival of Sigismund seems to have occupied the time and thoughts of the whole nation. The Earl of Warwick was then Captain of Calais, whose character for gallantry and courteous bearing was so distinguished on this, as on all other occasions, that he was called the Father of courtesy.

At the first sound, Mrs. Bindle moved swiftly to the door, where she paused uncertainly. She was in a quandary. Her conception of good manners did not admit of a hostess leaving her guests; still something had to be done. At the conclusion of the verse the voice ceased; but the concertina wailed on. Mrs. Bindle drew...", "...man is the noblest of all created things, the author proceeds to give a list of the parts of his body, which recalls the old riming vocabularies. This, however, is the only portion in which conversation is sacrificed to vocabulary. In the rest of the work, though the vocabulary is increased by alternative phrases wherever possible, it is never allowed to encroach too much on the conversation. The second chapter presents a scene between a lord and his page, in which the page receives <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> instructions for commissions to the draper, the mercer, and upholsterer--an excellent opportunity of introducing a large choice of words. Conversation for travellers is the subject of the third chapter, the most important, and certainly the most interesting in the whole book.

Some of the channels were lined with a very fine, delicate yellow, silky material, which vibrates at every movement of the waters. Mr. Thomas Moran, the distinguished artist, obtained studies of these beautiful springs, and from his well-known reputation as a colorist, we look for a painting that will convey some conception to the mind of the exquisite variety of colors around this spring.

How can you expect a man to perform on such a miserable instrument?

At this precise moment Drummond dashed up and drew rein. There was not a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to lose. The leading Americans were coming on in excellent order, only a musket-shot away; Pearson's thousand were just in the act of giving up the key to the whole position; and Drummond's eight hundred were plodding along a mile or so in rear. But within that fleeting minute Drummond made the plan that brought on the most desperately contested battle of the war. He ordered Pearson's thousand back again. He brought his own eight hundred forward at full speed. He sent...", "...Kean are called great actors, makes the English newspaper-criticisms of little value. In default of this, I have been reading M. Fechter's acting edition of \"Othello,\" which a friend kindly sent me from London. It is a curiosity,--not the text, which is incorrect, full of arbitrary changes, and punctuated in a way almost unintelligible to an English eye: colons being scattered about with truly French profusion. The stage-directions are the interest of the book. They are so many and so <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that it seems a wonder why they were printed, if M. Fechter is sincere in declaring that he has no desire to force others to follow in his exact footsteps in this part. But they are generally so judicious, as well as original, that actors born with English tongues in their heads may well be ashamed that a foreigner could find so many new and effective resources on their own ground.

Mr. Foker's behaviour was quite different. He inquired for Rincer and the cold in his nose, told Mrs. Rincer a riddle, asked Miss Rincer when she would be ready to marry him, and paid his compliments to Miss Brett, the other young lady in the bar, all in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of time, and with a liveliness and facetiousness which set all these ladies in a giggle; and he gave a cluck, expressive of great satisfaction, as he tossed off his mixture which Miss Rincer prepared and handed to him. \"Have a drop,\" said he to Pen, \"it's recommended to me by the faculty as a what-do-you-call-'em--a stomatic, old boy.

It was difficult to perform this task; only by toiling incessantly every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> could he succeed.

After indulging in this unseemly mirth for about a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and a half, the personage resumed,-- \"The Crab did for her.\" Upon hearing the mystic word Madame crept stealthily a pace or two nearer to the door, while the Prophet exclaimed,-- \"The dressed Crab?\" \"Ah, what do _you_ think?

On the way Jenard explained to Rallywood that the procedure decided upon as being best suited to the requirements of the case was simply alternate shots at twenty paces. Rallywood and Unziar being placed, one of the men sent a coin spinning up into the air. Then followed a long <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of silence. St. Anthony's Cloister looks inward towards a quadrangle; the outer side bordering the river has been glazed in, but in the interval of waiting Rallywood could hear the water plashing and sobbing against the foundations of the old walls, and the wild sound of the _tsa_, sweeping down from the snowy frontier above Kofn Ford, as it wailed and howled drearily along the dark waters.

The sieves beneath the thresher shook back and forth, back and forth, tirelessly, while chaff poured away from the open jaws at the side in a fine dusty column of pale gold, from which the topmost husks blew up into the air, so that it was always filled with a whirling cloud that danced and gleamed in the sunlight like a swarm of golden bees.

A pulley of two feet in diameter upon this counter shaft was belted to the pulley of one foot in diameter upon the dynamo--thus giving its armature a speed of 480 revolutions per minute. We had to fix a governor upon the water-wheel to keep this speed constant at varying loads. The voltage is very sensitive to slight changes in the speed of the generator. We had next to plan what equipment we should need for the machine shop and to decide where to locate...", "...signs of decay at this period.

This liquid is colourless in its natural condition, but if the sponge is plunged into alcohol the liquid turns of a dark brown colour which stains both the alcohol and the sponge almost instantaneously.

During the succeeding fifteen years he became famous as a prolific and accomplished illustrator, but about 1861 abandoned illustration for painting, and gained wide popularity by his pictures, chiefly in water colours, of landscapes and rustic subjects, with figures, mainly of children. He was elected in 1860 associate and in 1862 full member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.

But with a supreme effort he managed to catch breath, and then there was a moment of respite, and Kate could see that he was thinking of the next struggle, for he breathed avariciously, letting the air that had cost him so much agony pass slowly through his lips.

He appeared to pore over the quantities of wine in the decanters, which he carried carefully and rather high, letting his heard droop over them protectingly. When he had finished, he stood for over a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> watching his master, and in his greenish eyes there was a look of contempt: After all, this master of his was an old buffer, who hadn't much left in him!

I will suggest a simple one, which illustrates very forcibly what I am endeavouring to show you. Take some particles of copper, and scatter them at intervals over the surface of an object-glass, and pour some sulphuric acid upon the glass. Now, what is the result? A beautiful network of apparently golden texture spreads itself gradually over the whole area of the glass. Steadily it pursues its way, and the result is beautiful to behold. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> particles of copper were the original settlements scattered over the land; the sulphuric acid the civilizing agent; and the final picture of a united civilized homogeneous nation is well represented by the progressive and finally glorious network of gold.

As an instance of the attractive force exercised by small communities upon each other, I may mention the united kingdom of...", "...the eldest brother faced the crowd. \"I heard last night,\" he said, \"that more 'n one man has hired a room in this hotel and never been seen again.

Nobody!\" It was Roundy who carried on the refrain. \"That song is pretty near right; don't you think so, Bunny?\" \"I've stopped thinking,\" said Bunny shortly. \"It's about...", "...in greyish garments. Sometimes she was said to be wrapped in a sort of mantle, with her head depressed and her hands crossed on her lap. Walton Abbey had its headless lady who used to haunt a certain wainscotted chamber, dressed in blood-stained garments, with her infant in her arms; and, in short, most of the ghosts that have tenanted our country-houses have been noted for their distinctive dress. Daniel de Foe, in his 'Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions,' has given many <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details as to the dress of a ghost. He tells a laughable and highly amusing story of some robbers who broke into a mansion in the country, and, whilst ransacking one of the rooms, they saw, in a chair, 'a grave, ancient man, with a long full-bottomed wig, and a rich brocaded gown,' &c. One of the robbers threatened to tear off his 'rich brocaded gown'; another hit at him with a firelock, and was alarmed at seeing it pass through the air; and then the old man 'changed into the...", "...enemy's hand, so long as the king's forces were too much occupied at a distance to provide for its safety. As diplomatic conferences were about to begin in which--even more than in that age, at least, was usually the case--the object of the two conferring powers was to deceive each other, and at the same time still more decidedly to defraud other states, Sancy accepted the royal explanation, although Henry's special messenger, Lomenie, had just brought him from the camp at Boulogne a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> account of the propositions of Sidney. The envoy had, immediately afterwards, an interview with Lord Burghley, and at once perceived that he was no friend to his master. Cecil observed that the queen had formerly been much bound to the king for religion's sake. As this tie no longer existed, there was nothing now to unite them save the proximity of the two States to each other and their ancient alliances, a bond purely of interest which existed only so long as princes found...", "...fresh series of adventures. We must now consider the water which with carbonic acid gas makes up sugar, etc. All plants contain a large percentage of water. This may be as much as 95 to 98 per cent in water plants, and 50 to 70 per cent. in ordinary tissues; it is contained in every sort of vegetable substance. But there is also a stream of water or sap which is almost always entering the roots, rising up the stem, and passing into the leaves. On these leaves there are hundreds of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> openings called stomata, by which the water escapes as water-vapour into the atmosphere. A single oak leaf may have 2,000,000 of these stomata. It is this current of sap which keeps the leaf fresh and vigorous; it is also by this current that every living cell is supplied with water and kept in a strong, healthy condition. The amount of water used in this way is very great; in four months an acre of cabbages will transpire or give out through its leaves 3,500,000 pints of...", "...her hand again, and repeated her number. \"When will you come in? I'm nearly always at home about five. Good-bye; I'm going to the Army and Navy, and I shall be late.\" Kent continued his way cheerfully. The brief interchange of conventionalities had diverted his thoughts, and his glimpse of this woman who took her debts with a shrug, and had candidly adapted her ideals to her requirements till the former had all gone, acted as a fillip to him. She typified success, of a kind, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he had seemed to acquire something of her own vigour. It made him happy, also, to observe that the manner of their parting had had no sequel; and, in recalling the mood in which he had walked through the Champs Elysees, he decided that he had been extremely stupid to attach so much importance to it. She was an agreeable woman towards whom his feeling was a friendship that he had once been in danger of exaggerating; he would certainly call upon her at the first opportunity! It...", "...the motive, she saw that he meant to go to Gaspe. Her heart seemed to contract till the pain of it hurt her; then, as a new thought flashed into her mind, it was freed again and began pounding hard against her breast. She must prevent him from leaving Jersey, from leaving her. What she might feel personally would have no effect upon him; she would appeal to him from a different stand-point. \"You must not go,\" she said. \"You must not leave your father alone, Maitre Ranulph.\" For a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he did not reply. Through his dark wretchedness one thought pierced its way: this girl was his good friend. \"Then I'll take him with me,\" he said. \"He would die in the awful cold,\" she answered. \"Nannin-gia, you must stay.\" \"Eh ben, I will think!\" he said presently, with an air of heavy resignation, and, turning, walked away. Her eyes followed him. As she went back to her booth she smiled: he had come one step her way. He would not go. CHAPTER XIII When...", "...two vessels aimed at would be sunk at once. When he was thoroughly satisfied, he drew back and gave the order to fire. The two reports sounded as if one, and were mingled with the explosion of shells as they struck the prahus exactly on the waterline. There was a momentary silence, and then a wild hubbub of yells of surprise and fury, while a loud cheer broke from the British, as they saw the success of the shots. Almost instantly the two craft struck began to settle down, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> disappeared, the water being covered with the heads of the crew, who were swimming to the other prahus. The guns of these had evidently been kept loaded, for before the two eighteen pounders were again ready, a fire was opened by the four craft, one or two balls striking the sandbags, while the rest went crashing into the forest behind. Every shot from the British guns struck the prahus, but none effected such damage as the first two fired. \"They are taking to their boats,...", "...his Hottentot servants. Why had they so suddenly become such favourites with the field-cornet? That you will understand by knowing the reflections that were just then passing through his mind. They were as follows:-- Might not a number of these animals be caught and broken in?--Why not? Might they not be trained to the saddle?--Why not? Might they not serve him for hunting the elephant just as well as horses?--Why not? Von Bloom asked these three questions of himself. Half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> served to answer them all in the affirmative. There was neither impossibility nor improbability in any of the three propositions. It was clear that the thing could be done, and without difficulty. A new hope sprang up in the heart of the field-cornet. Once more his countenance became radiant with joy. He communicated his thoughts both to the Bushman and \"Bush-boys\"--all of whom highly approved of the idea, and only wondered that none of them had thought of it before....", "...asked Father d'Aigrigny. \"He would not tell his name; but he says that he comes from M. Van Dael, a merchant in Java.\" Father d'Aigrigny and Rodin exchanged a glance of surprise, almost of alarm. \"See what this man is,\" said D'Aigrigny to Rodin, unable to conceal his uneasiness, \"and then come and give me an account of it.\" Then, addressing the servant, he added: \"Show him in\"--and exchanging another expressive sign with Rodin, Father d'Aigrigny disappeared by a side-door. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> after, Faringhea, the ex-chief of the Stranglers, appeared before Rodin, who instantly remembered having seen him at Cardoville Castle. The socius started, but he did not wish to appear to recollect his visitor. Still bending over his desk, he seemed not to seen Faringhea, but wrote hastily some words on a sheet of paper that lay before him. \"Sir,\" said the servant, astonished at the silence of Rodin, \"here is the person.\" Rodin folded the note that he had so...", "...know, could never know; yet there he was, strangest figure in a land that knew only the bizarre, with whom the unbelievable was the normal. Slowly now, weary to death with the long, long day, depressed with the inevitable reaction from the excitement of the past hours, they moved away, to the south, to the west. In front of them, glittering in the moonlight, seemingly infinite, stretched the waves of the rolling prairie, bare as the sea in a calm. Behind them, growing lesser and lesser <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> by minute, merging into the infinite white, were three black dots like tiny boats on the horizon's edge. On they went, a half mile, a mile, looked behind; and, with an awe no familiarity could prevent, faced ahead anew. Back of them now as well as before, uniformly endless, uniformly magnificent, stretched that giant ocean: silent, serene, as mother nature, as nature's master, God himself.

No...", "...good for me, Mag; keeps me humble and for ever grateful that I'm so happy. \"Nance, you'll never be able to carry all these things and lift your buful train, too. And there's never a hansom round when it's snowing and--\" And then I caught sight of the carriage. Yes, Maggie, the same fat, low, comfortable, elegant, sober carriage, wide and well-kept, with rubber-tired wheels. And the two heavy horses, fat and elegant and sober, too, and wide and well-kept. I knew whose it was the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> my eyes lighted on it, and I couldn't--I just couldn't resist it. The man on the box-still wide and well-kept--was wide-awake this time. I nodded to him as I slipped in and closed the door after me. \"I'll wait for the Bishop,\" I said, with a red-coated assurance that left him no alternative but to accept the situation respectfully. Oh, dear, dear! It was soft and warm inside as it had been that long, long-ago day. The seat was wide and roomy. The cushions had been done...", "...\"I have known you for a hardy rogue,\" I said, with my hand upon it; \"now I know you for a faithless one as well. If I gave you credit for all the vices of the soldier, I gave you credit also for his virtues. I was the more deceived. The disobedient servant I might pardon, but the soldier who is faithless to his trust\"-- I raised the whip and brought it down again and again across his shoulders. He stood without a word, his face dark red and his hands clenched at his sides. For a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or more there was no sound in the room save the sound of the blows; then my wife suddenly cried out: \"It is enough! You have beaten him enough! Let him go, sir!\" I threw down the whip. \"Begone, sirrah!\" I ordered. \"And keep out of my sight to-morrow!\" With his face still dark red and with a pulse beating fiercely in his cheek, he moved slowly toward the door, turned when he had reached it and saluted, then went out and closed it after him. \"Now he too will be your enemy,\"...", "...which then brought tears to my eyes. He spent a few days with Mr. Savage, and they rode about over the familiar hills; on cloudy days tried the trout brooks, but without their early success; wandered off to old farm-houses where they used to \"attend parties,\" and to and from which they used to escort the girls; and, in fact, lived over their young days together quite gleefully. But it was not alone for old memories' sake that Mr. Brooks lingered there. He had made an observation the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he arrived at Mr. Savage's which constantly impressed him. Mr. Brooks had only a family of daughters living. He had lost two sons,--one in the South and one in New York,--the latter of whom having grown to nineteen years of age he had set his heart upon, had educated him at Columbia College, and was about to send him to Germany to add to his education, intending him for the bar, or for financial business, as the son might decide on his return, when the young man, one day, was...", "...trust that your errand was one of which you need not be ashamed. Do I walk too fast for you? There is so little time to lose.\" When they came opposite the marble column that marked the grave of Dannie's mother, they stopped instinctively. \"This is Gran'pap's graveyard,\" said the boy, simply, \"and that is where my mother is buried.\" The man did not answer. He had removed his hat and stood gazing intently at the white shaft and at the vine-covered mound at its base. For a full <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he stood there, motionless as the monument itself. Then he turned to the boy. \"Let the thought of her be as dear and sweet to you always as your own life,\" he said. \"Come!\" With Dannie's hand still in his, he hastened on. The other members of the party were far ahead. The morning glow was spreading in the east, and in the west the paling moon was dropping down behind the far-off hills. The autumn mist came up and compassed them about, and now and then some sound betokening...", "...known you'd behave like this.

And that reminds me you must take her up to London immediately, and have her put into proper clothes.\" \"Oh, I say----\" Barnaby was beginning.

In the English, Scotish, and Irish series it is equally true that the preponderance of bindings are unidentified. The monastic liveries, in which so many venerable tomes have come down to us, were executed within the walls of the buildings which held the books, and had perhaps produced them; and analogously most of our early printers were binders of their own stocks, as well as of any other works brought to them.

Freckles considered the advisability of bursting forth and telling him how much better it would be to stick with the reform fellows; but just as the boy got his courage screwed up to speaking point, Senator Stacy got off. About ten minutes later Freckles had the elevator on the ground floor, and was sitting there reading a paper, when he heard a step that made him prick up his ears. The next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Mr. Ludlow turned the corner. He was immaculately dressed, as usual, and his iron-grey moustache seemed to stand out just a little more pompously than ever. There was a sneering look in his eyes as he stepped into the car. It seemed to be saying: \"They thought they could beat me, did they? Oh, they're easy, they are!\" Freckles McGrath slammed the door of the cage and started the car up.

For quite half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Dacres felt as if he were seized by an invisible arm round his waist and was being forced backwards. Then the tension ceased as the inertia was overcome, he was part and parcel of a mass flying through the air at more than twice the speed of an express train. Dacres glanced at his watch--it was twenty-five minutes past nine--then, lurching along the alley-way, for the \"Meteor\" was trembling and swaying as she cleft the air, he made his way for'ard. He found Whittinghame...", "...our familiar spaceships. In effect, it was itself a gigantic globular vehicle.

This could have caused the blurring of the image of Wandl when viewed telescopically from other worlds. Again, for a moment of the contact, there was that bursting light in the sky. The contact with the Venus beam lasted a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. Snap and I, on the cauldron rim, were engulfed in the blaze of reflected light and the wild scream of sound. Then presently the turmoil subsided. The contact in the sky was broken. The tow-rope of Venus jerked itself away. But on the next Venus rotation it would be attacked again.

It was the mail-cart, rushing to Knype. She did not move. She had said `good night' and shaken hands; and yet she remained. They stood speechless. Then without warning, after perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that seemed like ten minutes, she walked away, slowly, into the rain. And as she did so, Edwin could just see her straightening her spine and throwing back her shoulders with a proud gesture. \"I say, Miss Lessways!\" he called in a low voice. But he had no notion of what he wanted to say. Only her departure had unlocked his throat. She made no sign. Again he grinned awkwardly, a little ashamed of her and a little ashamed of himself, because neither had behaved as woman...", "...and golden daffodils run loose in the untidy courtyards, where strangely shaped pots and bright rags of carpets lie about in picturesque disorder.

In winter these villages are covered with snow; each hut is a white padded heap; all corners are rounded off so that every cottage has the aspect of being packed in cotton-wool.

We strained our eyes to the utmost but could not, in this eerie light, tell head from tail end of this great serpent. It moved very slowly, and with a motion which perfectly confounded our perception. Its progress seemed no faster than the hour hand of a watch, but we knew that it moved, yet so close to the white sand that the whole trail seemed to move with it. The eye refused to admit any motion except in sudden shifts, like widely separated films of a motion-picture. For <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> after minute it seemed quiescent; then we would blink and realize that it was two feet higher up the bank. One thing we could see--a great thickening near the centre of the snake: it had fed recently and to repletion, and slowly it was making its way to some hidden lair, perhaps to lie motionless until another moon should silver the jungle. Was there any stranger life in the world? Whether it was a giant bushmaster or a constrictor, we could not tell in the diffused light.

The pendulum had apparently no escapement and the puzzle was how it was maintained in motion. It was impossible to detect the mystery by the aid of the eye alone; the truth, however, was that the whole figure swung to and fro at each oscillation of the pendulum, to an amount of 1/400 of an inch on the outside rim of the base. A movement of 1/400 of an inch per half second of time is imperceptible; it would be equivalent to perception of motion of the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> hand of a clock about 6 in. in diameter, which is almost impossible. The connexion of the figure to the anchor of the escapement was very complicated, but clocks of the kind kept fair time.

On one occasion I happened to shoot the leader, a young zebra mare, which at some former time had been bitten on the hind leg by a carnivorous animal, and, thereby made unusually wary, had, in consequence, become a leader.

Cooking also improves or develops flavors in food, especially in animal foods, and thus makes them attractive and pleasant to the palate.

Its similarity in this respect with the lines of hydrogen led him to recognize the existence of a new and very light gas, unknown to terrestrial chemistry.

In 1896 Ramsay at last succeeded in separating helium, recognized by the same yellow line in its spectrum, in <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> quantities from the mineral uraninite. Once available for study under electrical excitation in vacuum tubes, helium was found to have many other lines in its spectrum, which have been identified in the spectra of solar prominences, gaseous nebulae, and hot stars. Indeed, there is a stellar class known as helium stars, because of the dominance of this gas in their atmospheres. [Illustration: Fig. 30.

Let the record show that Mr. Mayo wanted to acquaint me with the general nature of another matter, but that after he had spoken a few sentences, it became apparent to me that it should be a matter of record, so, I will ask you now, Mr. Mayo, just simply to repeat what you have said to me in the last few sentences off the record.

He chose his direction at random, crushing an easily discernible path behind him in the surprisingly brittle grass. The warm sun baked his back comfortably, the soft-stirring wind caressed his cheeks. Of Arkalion he found not a trace. Two hours later Temple reached the hills and started climbing their gentle slopes. It was then that he saw the figure approaching on the run.

The feeling of weight returned, but weight as she never had felt it before. It was as if someone was sitting on every inch of her body, crushing her down.

She lost consciousness, coming to some time later with a...", "...receipt for the stuff, with an undertaking to deliver it in cloaks, at 11 Primrose Lane, in such a time. Porter retreated.

I have met a Snob on a dromedary in the desert, and picnicking under the Pyramid of Cheops.

We had a most uncomfortable passage, for Cardozo was quite tipsy, and had not attended to the loading of the boat. The cargo had been placed too far forward, and to make matters worse, my heavy friend obstinately insisted on sitting astride on the top of the pile, instead of taking his place near the stern, singing from his perch a most indecent love-song, and disregarding the inconvenience of having to bend down almost every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to pass under the boughs of hanging sipos as we sped rapidly along. The canoe leaked but not, at first, alarmingly. Long before sunset, darkness began to close in under those gloomy shades, and our steersman could not avoid now and then running the boat into the thicket. The first time this happened a piece was broken off the square prow (rodella); the second time we got squeezed between two trees. A short time after this latter accident, being seated near the stern with my...", "...for your sake, old girl.'

It was the gentleman Clennam had seen on the night of his own accidental detention there, who had that impalpable grievance about the misappropriated Fund on which the Marshal was supposed to batten.

Their troops were formed by the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed the Alps with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign.

Maybe, for instance, Barnes'd be out taking tea with a friend, and just when everybody else was quiet it'd suddenly occur to his frog to tune-up, and the next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> you'd hear something go 'Blo-o-o-ood-a-noun!

Keep going next time. Never mind if you use up all the water in the lagoon. Plenty more in the river, you know!\" Nick felt much encouraged, and that was half the battle. \"I'm going to keep at it every chance I get, till I've mastered all the kinks,\" he declared enthusiastically a short time later, as he came out and began to rub himself industriously with a towel. \"Yes, siree, before this...", "...asked as he came up, intense anxiety in his voice. \"No,\" answered Paul, putting, on a bold face, \"but they did give me a run for it.\" \"'T was a wonderful close call!\" exclaimed Dan. \"I were comin' t' meet you when I hears you holler.

The girls collected in little companies to seek the homeward way. Every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> five or six white coifs were to be seen bowing and bending in farewell salute, separating from the others, and going off to the right hand or the left. Felicite, left alone for some minutes, joined one of the groups going west of Sallertaine, towards the high Marais; she was received with some embarrassment, as one whom they did not want to fall out with, yet who was somewhat compromising, and whose company their mothers did not desire for them.

A few minutes later they started in a fine drizzle of rain. That, however, soon stopped and the sun came out, and by the time they had reached the bungalow, to find Father Blossom just coming up from the wharf and Mother Blossom, not a bit frightened by the storm, on the porch, the only trace of the thunderstorm was the wet grass and the dripping eaves of the pretty bungalow.

It was some fifty feet wide, and the roof overhead nearly as much, while right in front, at the distance of a couple of hundred yards, and facing us as it now sent ever-changing flashes and reflections of light into the cavern, was the great fall whose waters thundered as they dived from somewhere out of sight into a huge basin whose overflowings formed the underground river along which we journeyed. The scene became more beautiful <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> by minute, the noise more deafening; and at last we stopped short, warned by the increasing depth of the water, and the sight of the great pool into which the cascade thundered down. We were standing in the beautiful green twilight water to the middle, but no one for a time wished to stir, the scene was so grand, made more beautiful as it was from time to time by a gleam of sunshine shooting down across the faint mist of spray which floated upwards, and wherever this bright...", "...Since the foregoing was written, I have made some further observations on this subject. In August, 1852, I noticed, on passing under some willow trees, (_Salix Vitellina_,) that leaves, grass, and stones, were covered with a wet or shining substance.

I _guessed_ this might be the honey-dew. As this was early in the morning, I resolved to visit this place again, as soon as the sun got up far enough to start out the bees, and see if they collected any of it. On my return I found not only bees in hundreds, but ants, hornets, and wasps. Some were on the branches with the _aphis_, others on the leaves and larger branches. Some of them were even on the stones...", "...tons or more of transfer freight at Cincinnati daily as well as all the sub-station work, with the slight increase of twenty-four bodies to the 201 already in service and without the increase of a single chassis to its present operating fleet of fifteen.

These are really conflicting propositions. They are only alike in the fact that in each case a moral cause is given for the position in which the individual finds himself now; and the moral cause is his own act.

The new body happened to be there, ready, with no soul in it. The soul did not make the body. In the Buddhist adaptation of this theory no soul, no consciousness, no memory, goes over from one body to the other. It is the grasping, the craving, still existing at the death of the one body that causes the new set of _Skandhas_, that is, the new...", "...in the study, he need not betray himself.

The unconscious or <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> ideas, which in noetics had served to break the force of Locke's objections against the innateness of the principles of reason, are in ethics brought into the field against indeterminism.

And as if in some degree still a child, her two lady friends seemed to regard her. She stayed with them scarce a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> ere she tripped off again; nor did I observe that she favoured me with a single glance. But what else could be expected by an ungainly, dust-besprinkled mechanic in his shirt sleeves, and with a leathern apron before him? Nor _did_ the mechanic expect aught else; and when informed long after, by one whose testimony was conclusive on the point, that he had been pointed out to the young lady by some such distinguished name as \"the Cromarty Poet,\" and that she had come up to her...", "...from the impression of castration he has received in discovering the female genital. It is, moreover, in no way impossible that the little child, so long as he is not credited with any understanding or memory, will, even in families outside the proletariat, become a witness to the sexual act between his parents or some other group-ups, and it cannot be disproved that the child _subsequently_ understands this impression, and may react upon it. But when this intercourse is described with <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details which could hardly have been observed, or if it turns out to be, as it so frequently does, an intercourse which was not face to face, _more ferarum_, there is no longer any doubt that this phantasy is derived from the observation of the intercourse of animals (dogs) and the unsatisfied curiosity of the child in his period of puberty. The greatest feat of the imagination is the phantasy of having witnessed the coitus of the parents while still unborn in the mother's womb....", "...on analysis. The soil is a strong loam, on a brick clay subsoil, in which there is little or no lime, although the stony clays, which form the subsoil in a great part of the district, abound in it, containing from twenty to thirty per cent. of carbonate of lime. I had always believed that lime was used in great excess in this neighbourhood, and had, in fact, an idea that its good qualities were overrated, inasmuch as it does not enter into the composition of the plant, except in very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> proportion; but last winter I saw a paper (by Mr. Briggs of Overton) on the possibility of growing wheat on the same land year after year, in which the utility of lime in preventing rust was incidentally touched upon.

Sir Albert did not choose to say that her sister was not there, but he made many <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> inquiries about her health, and left Mrs. Munro much impressed by his manner, and the thoughtful remarks he made. \"He is a real bonny man,\" she said afterwards, \"and, my certie, he kens how to put questions.

There was no one near to bias her choice; so she decided for herself, and took the left path, uttering the self-comforting ejaculation--\"I am sure that this is the right.\" Therefore she walked briskly on, till visited by unpleasant misgivings that her steps had deviated too far to the left; and then followed...", "...TEA Use the best tea.

With the fifty men in the road, the officer then pushed forward; and was soon greeted by a shout of welcome from the defenders of the defile. There was not a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to be lost; for the Afghans, when they recovered from their first scare, would renew the attack; and the party pressing down the defile on their rear--ignorant of what had taken place below--were still keeping up an incessant fire.

After he had cut a little while, Rollo asked him why he did not begin the bridge. \"I am beginning it,\" said he. Rollo laughed at this, but in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Jonas called to him to stand back, away from the bank; and then, after a few strokes more, the top of the tree began to bend slowly over, and then it fell faster and faster, until it came down with a great crash, directly across the brook. \"There!\" said Jonas, \"there is your bridge.\" Rollo looked at it with astonishment and pleasure. \"Now,\" said Jonas, \"I will come and help you over.\" \"No,\" said Rollo, \"I can come over myself.

He was in no easy frame of mind, for he could plainly see that the letter had disturbed the ranch owner greatly and that the man was suspicious. \"I hope I haven't made a mess of it,\" he reasoned. \"I wonder where Sam and Dick are?\" Had he had an opportunity, he would have left the...", "...may be his true name and he may publish under a nom de plume.

There's no other outlet for it, so my guess is that they're holding it for a rise in price. There's only one way that could happen, and that, literally, would be over Steve Ravick's dead body. It could be that they expect Steve's dead body to be around for a price...", "...\"I looked quick to the dogs, and they was froze stiff with horror for at least another second. Then they made one scramble for the open door, and Kate made a beautiful spring for the bunch, landing on the back of the last one with a yell of triumph. Mother shrieked, too, and we all rushed to the door to see one of the prettiest chases you'd want to look at, with old Kate handing out the side wipes every time he could get near one of the dogs. They fled down over the creek bank and a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later we could see the pack legging it up the other side to beat the cars, losing Kate--I guess because he didn't like to get his hide wet. \"When the first shock of this wore off, here was silly old Egbert, in a weak voice, calling: 'Kitty, Kitty, Kitty!

Accordingly, he astonished all the leading proprietors of the department at the meeting next day, by his <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> knowledge of the prices of good and bad cyder, and of the produce and other circumstances of the various districts of the department.

Then, taking a coil of strong rope in his hand, and followed by the two men, he again mounted the ladder.

The major entered the room noiselessly, and dropped at once on to his hands and knees; and was, a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> after, joined by his follower. He now crawled forward--groping his way with the greatest caution, so as to make no noise--until he found the bed. Then, rising to his feet, he threw himself upon the sleeping man and, in a moment, had him tightly by the throat with one hand, while the other was placed firmly on his mouth.

To these celebrated names of French binders of the eighteenth century we may add Le Monnier, who worked for the Orleans princes; Tessier, his successor; Laferte, who decorated the small volumes of the Duc de la Valliere as Chamot covered the large ones; in 1766 Chamot was royal binder. There was also Pierre Engerrand, then Biziaux, an original, who worked for Madame de Pompadour and Beaumarchais. Boyet, or Boyer, worked (1670-80) in the style of Le Gascon, with the same <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> tooling, but simpler in character. Duseuil put very elaborate and delicate tooling on his covers from about 1710 to 1720. The Revolution effaced many of the fine works which displayed the symbols \"of a royalty justly detested,\" and Mercier wrote certain wicked little poems against binding. Lesne was the poet of bookbinding, and he invented the process of plain calf without boards. Certainly from Grolier to Lesne there were numerous changes, so numerous that, in spite of the...", "...observed on the water on the starboard bow approaching the ship, but it did not look like a boat. When it was at the distance of seventy or eighty yards, it was hailed by the sentry. An answer was returned, but too indistinctly for the officers aft to understand what was said.

Mr Dew was forward. Whether or not he knew the person who was in peril of his life, I cannot say; probably any human being would equally have claimed his aid; but without a moment's hesitation he jumped fearlessly overboard, and swam to the assistance of the man he supposed was drowning.

In reading it, I feel it a distinction that my <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> plot in the poetic field should have attracted the gaze of one who is able to traverse its widest ranges with so much command.

Then I have an idea to make something out of this light. The case is lighted within; if I were to peep through those holes? I creep toward the case. A single apprehension chills my brain. If the light were suddenly extinguished! I am against the panel, which I take care not to touch, and I put my eyes close to one of the holes....", "...fireworks and pistol-shootings for the evening. Already one or two of those well-known German carts (in the shape of a V) were standing near the vineyard gates, the patient oxen meekly waiting while basketful after basketful of grapes were being emptied into the leaf-lined receptacle. As I sat down in my easy-chair close to the open window through which I had entered, I could see the men and women on the hill-side drawing to a centre, and all stand round the pastor, bareheaded, for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or so. I guessed that some words of holy thanksgiving were being said, and I wished that I had stayed to hear them, and mark my especial gratitude for having been spared to see that day. Then I heard the distant voices, the deep tones of the men, the shriller pipes of women and children, join in the German harvest-hymn, which is generally sung on such occasions;[1] then silence, while I concluded that a blessing was spoken by the pastor, with outstretched arms; and then they...", "...to another family, bears the true Partridgeberry, albeit the wintergreen shares with it a number of popular names. In a strict sense neither of these plants produces a berry; for the fruit of the true partridge[berry] vine (Mitchella repens) is a double drupe, or stone bearer, each half containing four hard, seed-like nutlets; while the wintergreen's so called berry is merely the calyx grown thick, fleshy, and gaily colored - only a coating for the five-celled ovary that contains the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> seeds. Little baskets of wintergreen berries bring none too high prices in the fancy fruit and grocery shops when we calculate how many charming plants such unnatural use of them sacrifices. Closely allied to the wintergreen is the RED BEARBERRY, KINNIKINIC, BEAR'S GRAPE, FOXBERRY or MEALBERRY, as it is variously called (Arctostaphylos-uva-ursi = bearberry).

The game was set for two o'clock, but at one, Grace put on her raincoat and set out for the High School. She knew she was early, but she felt that she couldn't stay in the house a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> longer. One by one the sophomore team and its substitutes assembled, but the rain had dampened their spirits and the enthusiasm of the past few days had left them. Grace looked worried, as she noticed how listless her players seemed. She wished it had been one of those cold, crisp days that set the blood tingling and make the heart beat high with hope. Still Grace felt confident that her team would rise to the occasion when the game was called. They were two well-trained,...", "...handkerchief. Then paddling was proposed, and a merry time ensued of splashing about, off and on the large flat rocks with which the sand was thickly studded at that particular spot. \"What's the time, Monica?\" Amethyst enquired at length. \"Why, past three already,\" was the horrified reply; \"how quickly the time has flown! We must give this up, girls, and get our shoes and stockings on.\" The drying process was accomplished as satisfactorily as was compatible with only two very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> handkerchiefs, and seizing the bundle of shells, the girls reluctantly bade farewell to the charming and secluded little cove. \"I vote we find some other way up the cliff,\" suggested Monica; and the idea was received with acclamation by Olive, on account of variety, also by Amethyst, who thought any other means would be preferable to the last. \"There's no other way nearer the caves,\" said Olive, as her glance swept the dangerous-looking rocky cliffs, which seemed to be...", "...Mary, so up she gets, and sends the daughter to her own bed, and lies down herself in the daughter's. \"In the mane time, Finigan got up, and after lighting a candle, opened the door at once.

He snorted again when he had the suit on, and surveyed it with a dissatisfied, downward glance. In his opinion he looked like a preacher trying to disguise himself as a sport, but to complete the combination he unearthed a pair of tan shoes and put them on. After that he stood for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> staring down the fresh-creased gray trousers to his toes. \"Looks like the very devil!\" he snorted again. \"But anyway, it's different.\" He dusted the cap by the simple expedient of slapping it several times against his leg.

Helen May, for instance, would have needed a...", "...In the boat I could see another figure, slimmer and smaller, which might be that of a boy; and this companion gave assistance when the helmeted one descended into the water over the side of the boat. For an instant I saw--or fancied that I saw--that he had something queer in his hand--something resembling a big bird-cage. Then he plunged under the surface, and was gone. We were steaming slowly enough, however, for me to observe in retrospect, that the huge round head bobbed up a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later, and that the black figure climbed back into the boat. But the cage-like object was no longer visible. \"Some repairs to the buoy, perhaps,\" I said, as the yacht took us on. But it seemed odd, I couldn't put the episode out of my mind. By and by I asked the yacht's captain to turn, and let us anchor not too far from the landing at Hasletowers, for me to go ashore comfortably when I wished to do so next day. The boat with the two figures had vanished. The bell buoy...", "...felt blindly for the rope. Then hands seized him and Joe and Han, clinging to the cable, dragged him ashore. Phil found himself under the frowning battlement of the huge cliff on a ledge of sand and shingle scarcely twenty feet wide.

Steve had made the shore end of the cable fast to a boulder that stood, half out of the shingle, at the base of the cliff. For a long <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the six boys huddled there in the storm and disconsolately gazed at the boat. It was Han who voiced the thought of most of them. \"She won't stay together long, I guess,\" he said sorrowfully. \"Those waves will batter her to pieces.\" \"She'll stand a lot of battering,\" answered Steve hopefully. \"It's hitting her on the beam and she hasn't swung much since I left her. The tide's still coming in and--\" He stopped. Then: \"I ought to have dropped the stern anchor over,\" he went...", "...what Watt really did. Lord Brougham has this to say of Watt: One of the most astonishing circumstances in this truly great man was the versatility of his talents. His accomplishments were so various, the powers of his mind were so vast, and yet of such universal application, that it was hard to say whether we should most admire the extraordinary grasp of his understanding, or the accuracy of nice research with which he could bring it to bear upon the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> objects of investigation. I forget of whom it was said, that his mind resembled the trunk of an elephant, which can pick up straws and tear up trees by the roots. Mr. Watt in some sort resembled the greatest and most celebrated of his own inventions; of which we are at a loss whether most to wonder at the power of grappling with the mightiest objects, or of handling the most minute; so that while nothing seems too large for its grasp, nothing seems...", "...cry. \"Oh!

That day, when Phosy and her father had sat down to their Christmas dinner, he rose again, and taking her up as she sat, chair and all, set her down close to him, on the other side of the corner of the table. It was the first of a new covenant between them.

Was that a clip or the handle of the landing-net; in other words, was it a salmon or a kelt that was fighting them there? He swept the dull waters of the loch with his glass; but could make out no splashing or springing anywhere near them. And then he could see by the curve of the rod that the fish was close at hand; there was a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two longer of anxiety; then a sudden movement on the part of the crouching person--and behold a silver-white object gleams for a moment in the air and then disappears! 'Good!' he says to himself--with a kind of sigh of satisfaction as if he had himself taken part in the struggle and capture. How peaceful looks the little hamlet of Inver-Mudal!

Even in <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details the difference is strongly marked. The romances are in octosyllabic couplets or in prose, and their language is different from that of the chansons, and contains much fewer of the usual epic repetitions and stock phrases.

Nibet looked curiously at Gurn, a certain sympathy in his quick brown eyes. \"Ready, Gurn?\" Gurn growled an answer and pulled on his coat again.

We have observed that the same face is turned towards us during the whole of the moon's revolution, and that the other half of her surface is never visible to us. This arises from the two motions we have noticed, which, with regard to our view of the moon, appear to counteract each other.

Lieutenant REVILL. Yes; I did. Mr. HUBERT. Newman said that he had not recognized Jack Ruby? Lieutenant REVILL. Yes; he did not recognize the man coming down the ramp, and the distance involved, I can readily see why he could not identify him. Mr. HUBERT. Did Newman mention to you in your interview that as a matter of fact, there were two people he saw in the basement area. One, a man coming down the ramp about a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before the shooting, and another person who jumped the rail down there from the parking area into the ramp on the Main Street side, but that he could not identify either? Lieutenant REVILL. Yes. Mr. HUBERT. And that, as to the man jumping the rail he didn't know whether it was before the shooting or after. Lieutenant REVILL. The man that he is making reference to jumping over the rail was an electrician, and this was prior to the shooting. Mr. HUBERT.

Thor! What's the matter?

Very well did Red Fox know the...", "...spare supper his friend Gassendi, \"content,\" says that amiable philosopher, \"to have me for his guest.\" PEIRESC, like PINELLI, never published any work. These men of letters derived their pleasure, and perhaps their pride, from those vast strata of knowledge which their curiosity had heaped together in their mighty collections. They either were not endowed with that faculty of genius which strikes out aggregate views, or were destitute of the talent of composition which embellishes <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> ones. This deficiency in the minds of such men may be attributed to a thirst of learning, which the very means to allay can only inflame. From all sides they are gathering information; and that knowledge seems never perfect to which every day brings new acquisitions. With these men, to compose is to hesitate; and to revise is to be mortified by fresh doubts and unsupplied omissions. PEIRESC was employed all his life on a history of Provence; but, observes Gassendi, \"He could not...", "...at home to get back his strength.\" \"I beg pardon, sir,\" said a hard, acid voice; \"it is quite time Mr Bracy had his lunch.\" Roberts turned quickly upon the stern, frowning, youngish woman who had entered silently in a pair of home-made list slippers, and stood in the doorway gazing at him fixedly. \"That's right, Mrs Gee,\" said Roberts; \"bring it in, and feed him up well, for he wants it, poor fellow!\" \"Mr Bracy has everything, sir,\" said the woman coldly, \"and given him to the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> when there's no one here.\" \"Oh, I'm nobody,\" said Roberts good-humouredly. \"No, sir.\" \"Eh?

Also unpublished, written in lovingly <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> characters, he has a Hebrew prayer-book in many volumes. He has written hundreds of articles for the Hebrew weeklies and monthlies, which are fairly numerous in this country, but which seldom can afford to pay their contributors.

Punctual to a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in his lessons, and of extreme delicacy.' It was my happiness to hear, amongst other things, his readings of many of the forty-eight preludes and fugues, and his playing of them, and especially of the preludes, impressed me with such force and vividness that I can hear it in memory still.

It is sometimes as <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> as one of Lovelace's letters; yet it is never prolix. He never fails to contract and to expand it in the right place.

She does not hesitate for a single <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> what to do, for the old man in the gray house has told her so many stories about other people who have been lost in the snow.

When Tess ceased on a high note, held until it drifted softly to the furthermost corner of the room, a round of applause went up to the high ceiling, and Miss Young, glancing around proudly at Tess, smiled and nodded. The girl felt another song thrust into her hands. This time she was less tremulous and sent back to Deforrest Young a charming, youthful smile. Helen's fingers rippled over the keys softly for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, and once more Tess began to sing. \"That I may know the largeness of God's love, teach me the fullness of thine own,\" she thrilled forth. A groan forced its way almost to Deforrest Young's lips. What a child she was! Yet she sang that song with the abandonment of passion known only to a woman. How beautifully, lithely young she looked, standing there with those flowing, shimmering curls and the tender, throbbing voice pleading to be taught the fullness of human love,...", "...They are certainly short of arms; if they could procure one or two hundred thousand muskets, the affair would be closed immediately.

However, I found no inconvenience; the roads were quite safe; and if it were not for the guerillas, whom one expects every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to issue from the woods, the thing would go on, for a stranger, comfortably enough.

Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success, and into every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced, to use the language of my heart; to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul; and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise.

Keeping a keen watch, after a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two of rest or wing-cleaning, I saw it fly in wide circles round the tops of the trees nearest the honey-box, and, after apparently satisfying itself, make a bee-line for the hive.

Our frontispiece shows an interesting group, about ten miles from the foot of the canyon. These are situated only about forty feet above the bed of the creek, but still in a secure position. Here a bed of shale had been weathered out of the sandstone, leaving a sort of horizontal groove four feet high and from four to six feet deep. In this a row of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> houses had been built. They had been made to occupy the full height and depth of the crevice, so that when one reaches it at the only accessible point he is between two houses, and must pass through these to get at the others. Besides the cliff-houses, the explorers found that these people had made use of little cave-like openings in the cliffs, and, by walling up the openings, had converted them into houses. These were very common in the Mancos, and of all sizes. Some were...", "...pressed the trigger. There came no spurt of flame. There was no sound--save perhaps a faint clicking noise.

His eyes were like balls of fire. There was a frightful grin of triumph twisting his mouth in this <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of punishment. In the first second of the tragedy, Dick had not understood. Indeed, he was still dazed by the suddenness of it all. But the falling of Griggs before the leveled weapon of the other man, there to lie in that ghastly immobility, made him to understand. He leaped toward Garson--would have wrenched the pistol from the other's grasp. In the struggle, it fell to the floor. Before either could pick it up, there came an interruption. Even in the stress of this...", "...an answer about the same. Tell him how his brother Bill died, and how you carried him off when the blacks were yelling round.

The confidence and firmness with which the boy spoke, surprised and greatly diverted the old manager, who after eyeing him attentively a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, exclaimed, \"You an actor, you young rascal!\" then laughed heartily, and continued, \"An actor indeed! and what the devil part would you think of acting?\" By this time some of those who attended the theatre, doorkeepers or supernumeraries, came up, and Mr. K. said to them, laughing, \"Here's a gentleman proposes to be an actor.\" And again addressing the boy he said to him with an affected solemnity, \"Pray, sir, what character have you yet thought of enacting?\" The jibing...", "...mystical idea of the influence exercised by vapors or spirits in living organisms.

A cell is a living particle, so <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that it needs a microscope for its examination; it grows in size, maintains itself in a state of activity, responds to the action of stimuli, reproduces its kind and in the course of time it degenerates and dies.

The original conception of a cell, based upon the study of the vegetable tissues, was a minute vesicle inclosed by a definite...", "...have been too much overjoyed to speak, Alfred,\" replied Emma, extending her hand to him, \"but no one welcomes your return more sincerely than I do, and no one is more grateful to you for having brought Mary back.\" \"Now, Alfred, I am calm,\" said Mrs. Campbell, \"so let me hear at once all you know.\" \"I see you are calm, my dear mother, and I therefore now tell you that Percival is not far off.\" \"Alfred! he is here; I am sure he is.\" \"He is with Malachi and the Strawberry; in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> I will bring him.\" Alfred left the house: the intelligence was almost too overpowering for Mrs. Campbell. Mary and Emma hastened to her, and supported her. In another minute Alfred returned with Percival, and the mother embraced and wept over her long lost child,--and then gave him to his father's arms. \"How this has happened, and by what merciful interference he has been preserved and restored to us,\" said Mr. Campbell, when their first emotions were over, \"we have yet to...", "...even from the _back_ of the herd? _Buffalo Sentinels_ Let us see what the two buffaloes at the two ends of the crescent are doing. They are the watchers, or _sentinels_, as they are sometimes called. They keep a lookout nearly all the time. Do you see the one on our left? After every two or three mouthfuls he stops, and takes a look around; he even looks right to the back. Then he takes four or five strides to catch up with the herd, and starts grazing again. Then in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two he takes another look around in the same way. And the sentinel on our right is doing just the same. Yes, the herd is quite safe; the two sentinels are sure to see if any danger comes from their side or from the back. \"But will not the sentinels have less to eat, if they are watching half the time?\" you may ask. Yes, that is quite true. So all the Papa buffaloes take turns being sentinels. After a while the two sentinels from the ends move up toward the middle, and...", "...hung,\" said August. \"The one would follow the other in five minutes. Give back that money and I will go away.\" The gambler trembled a minute. He was fairly at bay. He took out a roll of bills and handed it to August. There was but five hundred. Smith had the other four hundred and fifty, he said. But August had a quiet German steadiness of nerve. He said that unless the other four hundred and fifty were paid at once he should call in the sheriff or the crowd. Parkins knew that every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> August stood there increased his peril, and human nature is now very much like human nature in the days of Job. The devil understood the subject very well when he said that all that a man hath will he give for his life. Parkins paid the four hundred and fifty in gold-pieces.

He spent two weeks at Mount Vernon with Washington, taking casts of his face, head and upper portion of the body, with <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> measurements, and then returned to Paris.

Lewis's hands almost refused their office; he was unsteady on his...", "...I'll start with fifty cents.\" The box was passed from one to another, each contributing what she could, and each contribution meaning more or less of a sacrifice to the donor.

These earlier observations, however perfect the instruments and however skilful the observer, are liable to errors which it seems impossible to avoid.

Another source of error is due to atmospheric refraction, which is subject to changes both from hour to hour and at different seasons.

What he knew of antiquity, I suspect him to have gathered from modern compilers; but, though he could not boast of much critical knowledge, his mind was stored with general principles, and he left <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> researches to those whom he considered as little minds. With this disposition he wrote most of his poems.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> I looked at this one I knew that nobody but a blind man would mistake one for the other, and Mr. Thoburn wasn't blind.

The most successful expert is he who observes most closely and accurately, and the faculty needs only the spur of an objective point for it to be developed.

For example, photographic enlargements can be and are utilised with great advantage by bringing out <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details, especially in signatures, erasures and alterations. Interesting experiments can be made with a view to discovering the effect of different kinds of ink--important in settling the question whether the whole of a particular writing was done with one fluid, and at the same time, or at intervals. The study of erasures and alterations of figures or characters also comes within the scope of developments of the art which it is not deemed necessary to deal with at length in...", "...however, another chance was offered to Harry, as I shall now describe. As the family were sitting around the kitchen table, on which was placed the humble tallow candle by which the room was lighted, there was heard a scraping at the door, and presently a knock.

'Cabin, cabin,' the captain repeated.

Joe touched my arm, which, in as friendly a way as I could assume, I bade him not do a second time; for I could ill contain myself as it was, and beginning to think I had been duped and tricked, I was ready for hostilities.

When Lord Kitchener was inspecting an aerodrome in France in 1914 he said: \"One day you will be flying and evoluting in squadrons like the navy;\" and the aviators, then feeling their way step by step, smiled doubtfully, convinced that \"K\" had an imagination.

He did not seem flurried at all, but I saw that no time was to be lost, for a man was trying to cut or untie a rope which still held the boat to the steamer. Then she would be off. There was a light line on the deck near me--I had caught my foot in it, a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before. It was strong enough to hold Corny. I got hold of one end of it and tied it around her, under her arms. She had a great shawl, as well as a life-preserver, tied around her, and looked dreadfully bundled up. She did not say a word, but let Rectus and me do as we chose, and we got her over the railing in no time. I braced myself against the seat that ran around the deck, and lowered. Rectus leaned over and directed, holding on to the line as well. I felt strong enough to...", "...been kinder to her than ever. He said complimentary things to her.

It is a young heifer this time--most difficult of animals to drive. She runs like a deer: in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> she is far ahead of the boy. She takes the wrong road: the boy makes frightful efforts to overtake her--enters the fields to follow her unseen, and cuts across lots to head her off. She, being a bright creature, is aware of his manoeuvres. She watches him over the fences, and contrives to keep beyond his reach, spite of all he can do. To hold her on the homeward route is a miracle: still, the trio of farmer, boy and heifer do manage to reach the home village, where the farmer,...", "...at the same time with pleasurable emotion, and with the continuance of that very state of curiosity and awe which had been thus excited.

We lost time badly here, for down on the flat of the dale a giant lorry was turning, while a waggon was creeping by.

It seems as if the _vallista_ is even more cunning in protecting himself from his neighbour than in dealing with nature. The water-customs of these Andean valleys are worth an extensive study.

To me the word appears to be eminently appropriate, and I think it would be exceedingly difficult to find one which better expresses the succession of extremely <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> variations by means of which progress has been effected. That the successive individual units of improvement, which when linked together form the chain of advancement, _are_ exceedingly small is a fact which any one can prove for himself if he will study _in detail_ the growth of a modern so-called 'invention'.

The phosphate of ammonia is much more powerful than the nitrate.

Kirby's right hand instinctively sought a pocket in his cloak. Warrington felt for his pistol, too. For thirty or more seconds--say, three steps--they went up like conspirators, trying to move silently and holding to the rail; then the absurdity of the situation appealed to both, and without a word said each stepped forward like a man, so that the staircase resounded. They stumbled on a little landing after twenty steps, and wasted about a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> knocking on what felt like the panels of a door; but then Warrington peered into the gloom higher up and saw dim light. So they essayed a second flight of stairs, in single file as before, and presently--when they had climbed some ten steps and had turned to negotiate ten more that ascended at an angle--a curtain moved a little, and the dim light changed to a sudden shaft that nearly blinded them. Then a heavy black curtain was drawn back on rings, and a hundred lights,...", "...wonted tranquillity of mind and mien. \"Several days passed before I ventured again to visit the Ganapati, and this at last I did in the full belief that the whole affair had been naught but an idle dream.

Still holding the letter unopened in her hand, she drew a chair before the fire, and sat back in it, and closed her eyes. Why this strange feeling of depression? Why was she so sick at heart? Radford's kisses were still warm upon her lips, his words still rang in her ears. Almost mechanically she broke the seal of the letter which had been brought, and glanced carelessly at it. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later her eyes became riveted to the paper. As she read, one expression followed another on her face--wonder, indignation, shame, passion, in turn possessed her. She read the letter a second time, then a third, then a fourth.

Of all calamities that occur in the voyage of a slaver, this is the most dreaded and unmanageable. The news appalled me. Impetuous with anxiety I rushed to the captain, and regardless of fever or insanity, disclosed the dreadful fact.

The fungal growth spreads through the substance to the leaf, robbing the leaf of its nourishment and causing it to wither and fall.

The ironclad loomed portentously near, but Dave felt that, no mishap occurring, he would win the race. \"They've got me, I guess,\" he gasped a second later.

It had struck the stern of the launch, splintering it clear open. A great shower of water deluged Dave and his insensible...", "...heels over head, down the shaft, and disappeared.

All sorts of strange sounds seemed to grow louder and louder, and still he sat, gazing helplessly in a sort of despair at that motionless letter, which he had not lifted from the stair. At last,...", "...I could not doubt that she had understood me. She looked so beautiful that I stood staring at her without moving. What the servants could have been about that not one of them crossed the hall, I can't think. \"At last Kate laughed and said--'Well?' I started, and I dare say took my turn at blushing. At least I did not know what to say. I had forgotten all about the guests inside. 'Where's the port?' said Kate. I caught hold of her hand again and kissed it.\" \"You needn't be quite so <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in your account, my dear,\" said my mother, smiling. \"I will be more careful in future, my love,\" returned my father. \"'What do you want me to do?' said Kate. \"'Only to hold the candle for me,' I answered, restored to my seven senses at last; and, taking it from her, I led the way, and she followed, till we had passed through the kitchen and reached the cellar-stairs. These were steep and awkward, and she let me help her down.\" \"Now, Edward!\" said my mother. \"Yes,...", "...her. And so thinking, she hardened toward him and recklessly permitted herself to flame toward Graham. The crowd, the gayety, the excitement, the closeness and tenderness of contact in the dancing, the summer-warm of the evening, the streaming moonlight, and the night-scents of flowers--all fanned her ardency, and she looked forward eagerly to the at least one more dance she might dare with Graham. \"No flash light is necessary,\" Dick was explaining. \"It's a German invention. Half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> exposure under the ordinary lighting is sufficient. And the best of it is that the plate can be immediately developed just like an ordinary blue print. Of course, the drawback is one cannot print from the plate.\" \"But if it's good, an ordinary plate can be copied from it from which prints can be made,\" Ernestine amplified. She knew the huge, twenty-foot, spring snake coiled inside the camera and ready to leap out like a jack-in-the-box when Dick squeezed the bulb. And there...", "...the back?\" he said shrilly. \"An unarmed man! I will not turn my back!\" \"Then walk backward!\" said Garth, with his laconic start of laughter. Mabyn went like a crab down the rise, with his head over his shoulder, a ludicrous and deplorable figure. He was unable to drag his eyes from the gun, consequently he stumbled and lurched over every obstacle. Once he fell flat; and a sharp scream of fright was forced from him. Garth sickened at the sight, while he laughed. He had to give him a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in which to recover himself. Mabyn, scarcely coherent, ceaselessly begged for mercy. \"Do not kill me!\" he whimpered. \"I _can't_ die! Oh, God! Not like this! I never had a chance! You kill Natalie if you kill me--the breed will fix her!--and my mother! You'll have three murders on your soul! I _can't_ die yet!\" \"Get up!\" commanded Garth. Reaching the edge of the water, he ordered him into the dugout. Mabyn fell on his knees on the stones. \"Not in the water! Not in the...", "...Latitude, longitude and steaming direction of the Black Fleet he gave rapidly, and the information knifed back to the bridge of the Blue Fleet flagship, a hundred miles behind, where a white-haired admiral said: \"Ah! Good boy! Get those bombers up--pronto!\" Chris commanded a superb view of the ZX-2, whose gleaming shape, showering rays of sunlight, hung like a thing in a painting over the Black Fleet. He stared at the far-off dirigible, lost in admiration of her trim lines, pausing a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before returning to his own ZX-1. At that distance, the mammoth craft seemed no more than four inches long, yet, through his telescopic sight, he could discern her markings, machine-gun batteries and the airplane rack along her belly plainly. One plane, he saw, was suspended from the rack; the others were scouting for the Blue Fleet, even as he had scouted for the Black. He wondered if something were wrong with the plane left behind. Somehow, it did not look quite familiar....", "...and chickadees. Flitting droves of bush-tit dropped on to slender weeds, scarcely bending them, so light were they. Then in a minute they were gone. In the swamps or marshes were countless red-winged blackbirds. The most unobservant person could not help but see birds here. I had expected to find water-fowl, for the Colorado delta is their breeding place; but I little expected to find so many land birds in the trees along the river. Instead of having a lonesome trip, every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> was filled with something new, interesting, and beautiful and I was having the time of my life. I camped that night at Picachio,--meaning the Pocket,--eighty miles below Ahrenburg. This is still a mining district, but the pockets containing nuggets of gold which gave the place its name seem to have all been discovered at the time of the boom; the mining now done is in quartz ledges up on the sides of grim, mineral-stained hills.

All microscopic life embodies the essential characteristics of activity and form that distinguish many of the distinct types of animal and vegetable life.

In these two types of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> organic being we see the first stages of life in planetary formation. And the induced electric energy on the animalculine organism compelled it to both growth and activity, and, obedient to that principle, it added cell to cell in any direction that that electric energy in that form sought relief, thus producing different types of organic structure. The influence of the pent-up currents of electric energy was destined to have a moulding power upon the higher types of organic...", "...a secretion unconnected with flowers; but was not honey-dew, as it has been described. I was passing a bush of Witch-hazel, (_Hamamelis Virginiana_,) and was arrested by an unusual humming of bees. At first I supposed that a swarm was about me, yet it was late in the season, (it being about the 25th July.) On close inspection, I found the bush contained numerous warty excrescences, the size and shape of a hickory-nut. These proved to be only a shell--the inside lined with thousands of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> insects, a species of aphis. These appeared to be engaged sucking the juices, and discharging a clear, transparent fluid. Near the stem was an orifice about an eighth of an inch in diameter, out of which this liquid would gradually exude. So eager were the bees for this secretion, that several would crowd around one orifice at a time, each endeavoring to thrust the other away. This occurred several years ago, and I never have been able to find anything like it since; neither...", "...doubt intended for a savage growl, though it was more like the purring of a cat: and Uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped over the mat, and was heard to fall heavily outside--an accident to which even his doting mother paid no heed, in the excitement of the moment. The Vice-Warden shut and bolted the door. \"Off with the disguises!\" he panted. \"There's not a moment to lose. He's sure to fetch the Professor, and we couldn't take him in, you know!\" And in another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the disguises were stowed away in the cupboard, the door unbolted, and the two Conspirators seated lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly discussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily snatched off the table, which proved to be the City-Directory of the capital of Outland. The door opened, very slowly and cautiously, and the Professor peeped in, Uggug's stupid face being just visible behind him. \"It is a beautiful arrangement!\" the Vice-warden was saying with...", "...from the manner of it, and the place, it did not seem to be accidental; she pushed the man away several times, but their words were inaudible to the captain, who began to feel all the discomfort of being an unintentional observer.

In another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the captain was at the side of the dastardly fellow, whom he seized by the neck with the left hand, while with the right he administered a hearty blow to his ribs. The man turned round fiercely, and grappled with his assailant; and then Captain Bunting became aware that his antagonist was no other than Smith, _alias_ Black Jim, the murderer.

Still the eager tones of conjecture, the faintest-spoken whispers of renewed hope, were better than the dead stillness, the heavy hush of despair. And the queen's apartments, in which at sunset all her friends had assembled, presented less decided sounds of mourning and of wail, than the previous day. Margaret was indeed still one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> plunged in tears and sobs, and the next hoping more, believing more than any one around her. Agnes had tacitly accompanied her mother and Lady Mary to the royal boudoir, but she had turned in very sickness of heart from all her companions, and remained standing in a deep recess formed by the high and narrow casement, alone, save Isoline, who still clung to her side, pale, motionless as the marble statue near her, whose unconscious repose she envied. \"Speak, Isabella, why will...", "...to have gone so far in comment on the Vervains. He added recklessly, \"Don't you see that Mrs. Vervain sometimes does and says things that embarrass her daughter, and that Miss Vervain seems to try to restrain her?\" \"I thought,\" returned Don Ippolito meditatively, \"that the signorina was always very tenderly submissive to her mother.\" \"Yes, so she is,\" said the painter dryly, and looked in annoyance from the priest to the picture, and from the picture to the priest. After a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Don Ippolito said, \"They must be very rich to live as they do.\" \"I don't know about that,\" replied Ferris. \"Americans spend and save in ways different from the Italians. I dare say the Vervains find Venice very cheap after London and Paris and Berlin.\" \"Perhaps,\" said Don Ippolito, \"if they were rich you would be in a position to marry her.\" \"I should not marry Miss Vervain for her money,\" answered the painter, sharply. \"No, but if you loved her, the money would enable...", "...For the first time in minutes Roberts looked at the other, looked steadily, blankly. \"I'm sorry genuinely, Armstrong, but I can't tell you now. Don't misunderstand, please. I'd tell you if I were not under obligation; but I'm not at liberty yet to say.\" His glance left the other's face. \"I trust you understand.\" \"Yes, certainly.\" The voice was short. \"No offence, I'm sure.\" That there was offence was obvious, yet Roberts made no further comment or explanation. For perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> there was silence; in characteristic change of thought absolute Armstrong shifted. \"As long as we're in the confidant business,\" he digressed, \"there's still one question I'd like to ask, Darley. Elice and I have been intimate now for a number of years. I've asked you repeatedly to call with me and you've always refused. Even yet you've barely met her.

He could not meet that glance, a cold shudder passed over his frame ere he could reply. \"Mine own Agnes,\" and even then he paused, for his quivering lip could not give utterance to his thoughts, and a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> rolled in that deep stillness, and still those anxious eyes moved not from his face.

We know little with absolute certainty of Jesus, and even if we reject the diagnosis which Professor Binet-Sangle (in his _Folie de Jesus_) has built up from a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> study of the Gospels, there are many reasons why we should refrain from emphasizing the example of his sexual abstinence; Newton, apart from his stupendous genius in a special field, was an incomplete and unsatisfactory human being who ultimately reached a condition very like insanity; Beethoven was a thoroughly morbid and diseased man, who led an intensely unhappy existence; Kant, from first to last, was a feeble valetudinarian. It would probably...", "...offers when viewed by itself. In spite of the exceedingly simple composition of their constituent cells, which are but little differentiated, the Algae show an extraordinary variety of different forms. To them belong the simplest and most imperfect of all forms, as well as very highly developed and peculiar forms. The different groups of Algae are distinguished as much by size of body as by the perfection and variety of their outer form. At the lowest stage we find such species as the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Protococcus, several hundred thousands of which occupy a space no larger than a pin's head. At the highest stage we marvel at the gigantic Macrocysts, which attain a length of from 300 to 400 feet, the longest of all forms in the vegetable kingdom. It is possible that a large portion of the coal has been formed out of Algae. If not for these reasons, yet the Algae must excite our special attention from the fact that they form the beginning of vegetable life, and contain the...", "...the Bat, how would he, Jimmie Dale, know it? The man would have been crafty enough to have left no sign behind him. Was it to the Sanctuary that Whitey Mack meant to lead Lannigan that evening--or did Whitey Mack know him as Jimmie Dale, and to make it the more sensational, plan to carry out the coup, say, at the St. James Club? Whitey Mack and Lannigan were still at Bristol Bob's; he had probably time, if he so elected, to reach the Sanctuary, change, and get away again. But every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> was priceless now. What should he do? Run from the city as he was for cover--or take the gambler's chance? Whitey Mack knew him as Larry the Bat--it was not certain that Whitey Mack knew him as Jimmie Dale. He had halted, absorbed, in front of a moving-picture theatre. Great placards, at first but a blur of colour, suddenly forced themselves in concrete form upon his consciousness.

They had to fight for every fathom, and once or twice the little craft nearly rolled over with them. It became apparent by degrees that, as they could not have reached the schooner had they attempted it, they were pulling for their lives, and that the one way of escape open to them was to find an egress of some kind around the point, the ragged tongue of which was horribly close to lee of them. When the snow cleared for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, they saw that Dampier had driven the _Selache_ further off the ice. The schooner was hove to now, and there was a black figure high up in her shrouds. A bitter rush of wind hurled the spray about them, and the boat fell off almost beam-on to the sea, in spite of all that they could do. The icy brine washed into the boat, and it seemed almost certain that she would swamp or roll over before they could get way on her. Still, pulling desperately, they drove her around...", "...Sylvia, who disliked what she called \"vague\" people. \"Well, the fact is,\" explained the curate, in a burst of shy confidence--\"I always take four when I am alone in my lodgings. But when I go out to tea anywhere, four always seems such a fearful lot to ask for, that--oh, I beg your pardon!\" He had stepped heavily back into a cake-stand, and _patisserie_ strewed the hearthrug.

Not a sign of humanity was visible save one white villa, far away. It was perched on a promontory of heliotrope-tinted trachyte; struck by the morning beams it flashed and glowed like a jewel in the sunshine. He knew the place: Madame Steynlin's abode. The sight of it reminded him of a promise to attend her picnic next week; all Nepenthe would be invited, after the feast of Saint Eulalia. And hard by the shore, at its foot, he discerned certain <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> scarlet specks. What could they be? Why, of course! They were recognizable, even at this distance, as the blouses of the Sacred Sixty-three, who frequented this somewhat public spot for bathing purposes, blandly indifferent, or resigned, to the gaze of inquisitive onlookers. Mr. Heard, among others, had witnessed their aquatic diversions. The Messiah was hindered by age and growing infirmities from taking part in the proceedings; moreover, he had been sickening lately, it...", "...Academy Hill, where Miss Farwell saw the old school building--ghostly and still in the mists that hung about it like a shroud, the tumble-down fence with the gap leading into the weed-grown yard, the grassy knoll and the oak--all wet and sodden now, and--below, the valley--with its homes and fields hidden in the thick fog, suggestive of hidden and mysterious depths. \"Is yo' cold, Miss? We's mos dar, now.\" The nurse had shivered as with a sudden chill. Turning sharply to the north a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later they entered the square of Old Town where a herd of lean cows were just getting up from their beds to pick a scanty breakfast from the grass that grew where once the farmer folk had tied their teams, and in front of the ruined structure that had once been the principal store of the village, a mother sow grunted to her squealing brood. Long without touch of painter's brush, the few wretched buildings that remained were the color of the mist. To the nurse--like the fog...", "...such peaches! such pears!\" she exclaimed, feeling in the pocket of her sacque for some loose money, which she usually carried there. \"Oh! Margaret--\" Here she turned to the woman next her, and blushed with vexation when she remembered that Margaret was no longer there to take her commands. \"Dear me! I forgot. No matter. Oh, mercy! what have I done?\" She had done nothing but what was most likely to obtain her object, for Lord Hilton had pushed open the door, leaped out, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two returned with his hands full of the peaches and pears she had craved so. She was blushing scarlet when he came back and dropped the luscious fruit into her lap, as if they had been acquainted fifty years. \"Oh, you are too kind!

From minute to <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the men never knew but that the next roaring billow would engulf them also, as already they had seen it roll over and swallow up their neighbours.

There was always plenty to see in these little southern towns whilst the judges were at work. In one village there was a perfume factory, where essential oils of sweet-scented geranium, verbena, lavender, and thyme were distilled for the wholesale Paris perfumers; a fragrant place, where every operation was carried on with that <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> attention to detail which the French carry into most things that they do, for, unlike the inhabitants of an adjacent island, they consider that if a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth taking trouble over. In another village there was a wholesale dealer in silkworms' eggs, imported direct from China. Besides the eggs, he had a host of Chinese curios to dispose of, besides quaint little objects in everyday use in China. Above all there was Grignan, with its huge and...", "...to France, a motion was made by Mr. Giles to expunge all those paragraphs which expressed attachment to the person and character of the President, approbation of his administration, or regret at his retiring from office. After a very animated debate the motion to strike out was lost and the answer was carried by a great majority. Early in the session Washington communicated to Congress the copy of a letter addressed by the Secretary of State to General Pinckney, containing a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and comprehensive detail of all the points of controversy which had arisen between the United States and France, and defending the measures which had been adopted by America with a clearness and a strength of argument believed to be irresistible. The letter was intended to enable General Pinckney to remove from the government of France all impressions unfavorable to the fairness of intention which had influenced the conduct of the United States, and to efface from the bosoms of...", "...Miss Forrest gave a scream of delight. \"There, villain,\" I said, \"is the man whom you say I've murdered.\" \"How dare you come here?\" said Voltaire to Kaffar. \"Because I brought him,\" I said, \"to save this lady and expose you. Now, where is your power, and where are the charges you have brought?\" Had he a pistol I believe he would have shot me dead. His ground was cut from under him. The man who destroyed his every hope stood before us all, and refuted his terrible charges. For a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he stood as if irresolute; then he turned to Miss Forrest and spoke as coolly as if nothing had happened. \"May I claim your pardon, your forgiveness?\" he said. \"Believe me, lady, it was all because I loved you that I have acted as I have. Say, then, now that all is against me, that you forgive me.\" She hesitated a minute before replying; then she said slowly, \"It is difficult for me to speak to you without shuddering. Never did I believe such villainy possible; but--but I...", "...she could summon, hour after hour, until the afternoon had advanced far toward evening. So anxious and restless had she now become, that she could no longer sit at her work. She had been standing at the window looking out and watching each approaching vehicle for some time, until she felt sick from constantly awakening hope subsiding in disappointment, when she turned away, and, seating herself by the bed, buried her face despondingly in the pillow. She had been sitting thus only a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, when a slight noise at the door caused her to lift her head and turn in that direction. There stood a boy, with his eyes fixed upon her. For an instant she did not know him. Suffering, and privation, and cruel treatment had so changed him, even after all the doctor's efforts to eradicate their sad effects, that the mother did not at first recognize her own child, until his plaintive voice, uttering her name, fell upon her ear.

After a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two it became evident, from the footing, that they were upon the paved work of a causeway overgrown with weeds and rank herbage; huge mounds showed where fortifications had once existed, and shortly, broken pillars and ruined walls appeared at irregular intervals. They had little time to look around them, for the storm had come rapidly up, and the glare of the lightning was incessant, while the rain poured down in absolute torrents. Before them rose a huge ruin covered with...", "...Ben. \"It's got to be money, I am obliged to say,\" replied Mr. Edson. \"I shall need all the ready cash I can get hold of in taking my new position, for I have a lot of debts to clean up.

Of course, I don't expect you, a boy to have any great amount of money to invest, but I had an idea that some of your relatives or friends might help you.\" Tom was silent, deeply thoughtful for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. His eyes wandered wistfully over the apparatus that so fascinated him. Then, very timorously, he asked: \"How much would it take, Mr. Edson?\" \"One hundred dollars to you, Tom,\" said Mr. Edson.

I hope you can make it, Tom. I like you very much. You are the right sort, and...", "...old fight.\" Dan gritted his teeth and tried harder than ever. He leaped for a high one, and fastening upon the ball, ran full tilt into a Purple Five guard. He pivoted, faked a pass to Chub, and dropped the ball through the basket. After that, playing as if inspired, he scored again. Once he tangled briefly with a Purple Five guard, and the referee called a personal foul on both players. The Purple Five player missed the free throw, while the Cubs again scored. With less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to play, the tally now was: 12 to 11 in favor of the Purple Five. \"One basket would do it,\" Dan thought desperately. \"If we don't snag it, we'll lose by a single point.\" How much time was left? A minute at best. Perhaps only seconds. Assured of victory, Pat and his teammates were playing a delaying game. Without trying to make another basket, they merely sought to prevent a Cub from getting his hands on the ball. It seemed to the frantic Cubs that they couldn't shatter...", "...needed neither pan nor cradle to tell him so. He knew it at a glance, knew it by the light of his solitary candle. So far the wash-dirt had yielded a little more or a little less to the tub; its outward characteristics had not altered; but they always might. At any moment, after the next blow with the driving-pick, or the next--or the next--a change might be observable. It could hardly be a change for the better; thus each unchanged handful was to the good, and the uncertainty of every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> its fascination. Leads and gutters were notoriously capricious, and Denis was prepared for any caprice but the one that he encountered this very morning. He had prolonged the roof a few more inches; the new chain of holes had resolved itself into another semicircular crevice, and to the knuckles the fresh roof was as firm as the old. Denis was dealing the random blows which were always a relief to him after this niggling work, when suddenly nothing fell, but the pick-handle...", "...and 1in. to 11/2in. across.

The leaves of the root are very large and stalked, of irregular shape, but for the most part broadly oval or lance-shaped. The edges are slightly toothed, having <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> glands; those of the stems are much smaller, sessile, and long egg-shaped; all the foliage is smooth, and of a dark green colour; the main stems are very stout, and sometimes grow to the height of 7ft.

Much has been said about the complexion of the women of England, which has been greatly praised. I have not found it exceptionally beautiful. It is often fresh, oftener ruddy, but still oftener coarse. A delicate, finely-graduated bloom is not common. The rosy cheeks when looked at closely are often streaked with fine lines and mottled with <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> spots of red; and the white is still oftener not like that of a lily, or, better, of a white rose, but of some much coarser object in nature. It is true that in making these odious comparisons I cannot forget certain women, too common in \"America,\" who seem to be composed in equal parts of mind and leather, the elements of body and soul being left out so far as is consistent with existence in human form.

He had never seen any of the day-birds or the animals that awaken in the morning.

Lady Lushington was silent for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two; then she said: \"To be frank with you, Mabel, I don't at the present moment like her at all. Whether I change my mind or not remains to be proved.

What she did take up the next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> was the question of Sir Claude. \"Where is he? Won't he come?\" Mrs. Beale's consideration of this oscillated with a smile between the two expectancies with which she was flanked: it was conspicuous, it was extraordinary, her unblinking acceptance of Mrs. Wix, a miracle of which Maisie had even now begun to read a reflexion in that lady's long visage. \"He'll come, but we must MAKE him!\" she gaily brought forth. \"Make him?\" Maisie echoed. \"We must give him time.

SELBORNE, _Aug._ 15_th_, 1775.

Many horses, though quiet with company, will not stay one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in a field by themselves: the strongest fences cannot restrain them. My neighbour's horse will not only not stay by himself abroad, but he will not bear to be left alone in a strange stable without discovering the utmost impatience, and endeavouring to break the rack and manger with his fore feet. He has been known to leap out at a stable-window, through which dung was thrown, after company; and yet in other respects is remarkably quiet.

One part of coarse or fine sand made from fusible stones should be mixed with two parts of soda or of rock-salt or of herb salts, to which are added <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> particles of _magnes_.[16] It is true that in our day, as much as in ancient times, there exists the belief in the singular power of the latter to attract to itself the vitreous liquid just as it does iron, and by attracting it to purify and transform green or yellow into white; and afterward fire consumes the _magnes_.

In the band that went round the low crown, a ribbon was knotted; a piece of that same ribbon which Philip had chosen out, with such tender hope, to give to Sylvia for the Corneys' party on new year's eve. He knew every delicate thread that made up the briar-rose pattern; and a spasm of hatred towards Kinraid contracted his heart. He had been almost relenting into pity for the man captured before his eyes; now he abhorred him. Kinraid did not speak for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. The sailors, who had begun to take him into favour, were all agog with curiosity to hear the message to his sweetheart, which they believed he was going to send. Hepburn's perceptions, quickened with his vehement agitation of soul, were aware of this feeling of theirs; and it increased his rage against Kinraid, who had exposed the idea of Sylvia to be the subject of ribald whispers.

Neison subsequently found that the black pit is a crater-cone. It would perhaps be rash, with our limited knowledge of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> lunar detail, to assert that Madler over-estimated the brightness of this area, which may have been due to a _recent_ deposit round the orifice of the crater-cone.

In landscape, where the many accidentals appeared to lack cohesion, the Impressionists achieved co-ordination by a unity of light which welded all the objects into an interdependent group.

He will take care of you and the poor--' Tom could say no more. Big man though he was, he burst into tears, at the thought of leaving his wife and dear little children, never to see them any more.

She could now see the house, smokeless, apparently lifeless, frowning down from a snow-clad ridge. But when, a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later, she knocked, Leslie answered, and she entered. The living-room, with its associations of gayety, was dank, cold, cheerless. Ash littered the fireless stove; the floor was unswept; the air gave back her breath in a steamy cloud. Through the bedroom door she saw drawers and boxes wide open, their contents tossed and tumbled as though some one had rummaged them for valuable contents. And amid these ruins of a home Leslie sat, head bowed in his hands. \"You poor man!\"...", "...He stood squarely in the President's way and laughed good naturedly. \"Say--Mister!\" \"Well, sir?\" \"Say--now--ain't yo' name Jeff'son Davis?\" The President nodded in a friendly way. \"It is.\" \"I knowed it,\" the trooper laughed. \"By Gum, I knowed it, the minute I laid my eyes on ye--\" He moved closer with insinuating joy. \"I bet ye could never guess how I knowed it--could ye?\" \"Hardly--\" \"Ye want me ter tell ye?\" The trooper laughed again. \"I knowed ye the very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> I seed ye--'cause ye look thez ezactly like a Confederate postage stamp!

After a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or so, she gave directions in a calm voice, as to the best mode of retrieving the evil, and then left, without a word said to the offender. After the company left, she sent for the girl, alone, and in a calm and kind manner pointed out the aggravations of the case, and described the trouble which had been caused to her husband, her visitors, and herself. She then portrayed the future evils which would result from such habits of neglect and inattention, and the modes of...", "...acknowledged purpose of pleading his own suit, it would be impossible for her not to yield.

To find the horse-power required to drive a battery, multiply the weight of one stamp by the number of stamps in the battery; the height of lift in feet by the number of lifts per minute; add one-third of the product for friction, and the result will be the number of feet-lbs. per minute; divide this by 33,000 which is the number of feet-lbs. per <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> equal to 1 h.-p. and the result will be the h.-p. required. Thus if a stamp weighs 800 lb. and you have five in the box, and each stamp has a lift of 9 in. = 0.75 ft. and strikes 80 blows per minute, then 800 x 5 x 0.75 x 80 = 240,000; one-third of 240,000 = 80,000 which added to 240,000 = 320,000; and 320,000 divided by 33,000 = 9.7 h.-p. or 1.9 h.-p. each stamp.

But a busy shopping centre always being amusing, the Merceria and Frezzeria become attractive haunts of the stranger; the Merceria particularly so.

He entered the yard--it was empty. He went to the door of the Fort, opened it, entered, shut it, locked it softly, and put the key in his pocket. Then he passed through into a room at the end of the small hallway. Three men rose from seats by the fire as he did so, and one said: \"Hullo, who're you?\" Another added: \"It's Pretty Pierre.\" Pierre looked at...", "...it is carried unanimously. How will Aunt behave to poor Deering, when he comes down.\" \"Same as she behaves to every one, uncle,\" cried Vane, laughing. \"There, old lady,\" said the doctor, \"and as for the money, bah! let it take wings and fly away, and--\" The doctor's further speech was checked by Aunt Hannah throwing her arms about his neck and burying her face in his breast, while Vane made a rush out into the garden and then ran rapidly down the avenue. \"If I'd stopped a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> longer, I should have begun blubbering like a great girl,\" he muttered. \"Why, hanged if my eyes aren't quite wet.\" CHAPTER THIRTY ONE. HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF. Vane made his way straight to the rectory, with a fixed intention in his mind. The idea had been growing for days: now it was quite ripe, consequent, perhaps, on the state of mind produced by the scene at the manor. \"It will be more frank and manly,\" he said to himself. \"He's different to us and can't help...", "...the Zoo, and (horridest thought of all!) by the worst patients in the mental-disease ward. He pulled himself up in speechless horror, and looked once more into the big mirror. Yes, there was positively no mistaking the fact: it was he, Arthur Greatrex, fellow of Catherine's, who was making these hideous and meaningless distortions of his own countenance. With a terrible effort of will he pulled his face quite straight again, and assumed his usual grave and quiet demeanour. For a full <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he stood looking at himself in the glass; and then, fearful that some one else would come and surprise him, he hurried down the remaining steps, and rushed out into the streets of London. Which way he turned he did not know or care; all he knew was that he was repressing by sheer force of muscular strain a deadly impulse to pucker up his mouth and draw down the corners of his lips into one-sided grimaces. As he passed down the streets, he watched his own image faintly reflected...", "...over the ice. Twice it almost upset, but Ford, struggling to keep the course, never shut down the power. He finished the mile in 39-1/5 seconds, beating the world's record by seven seconds. The success of next year's sales was certain. The following day when Ford reached the factory, Wills met him with an anxious face. It was pay day and there was no money. \"We didn't bother you about it last week because you were so busy with the race,\" Wills said. \"We thought up to the last <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that the check from Chicago would come. It was due two days ago. We wired yesterday and got no answer. Mr. Couzens left this morning on the early train to find out what is wrong. You know how it is; the men want their money for over Christmas. The ---- Company wants men and they're offering more money than we can pay. I'm afraid our men will quit, and if they do and we can't get out the Cincinnati order next week----\" Ford knew that to raise more money from the stockholders...", "...a creature occupying a tiny shell formed of minute particles of sand, has a long projection of its substance, like a feeler or tendril, with which it searches on the bottom of the sea for sandy material with which to build the shell or outer covering for its offspring, which are born by division from the parent body. It grasps the particle of sand by the feeler, and passes it into its body by enclosing it. Verworn removed the sand from the bottom of the tank, replacing it by very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> particles of highly colored glass. Shortly afterward he noticed a collection of these particles of glass in the body of the creature, and a little later he saw a tiny speck of protoplasm emitted from the parent by separation. At the same time he noticed that the bits of glass collected by the mother creature were passed out and placed around the body of the new creature, and cemented together by a substance secreted by the body of the parent, thus forming a shell and covering...", "...a beauty and so many lions to show. One evening Lizzie went to her room with one of the maids, carrying half a dozen candles between them. Heaven forbid that I should cross that virgin threshold--for the present! But we will wait. We will allow them two hours. At the end of that time, having gently knocked, we will enter the sanctuary. Glory of glories! The faithful attendant has done her work. Our lady is robed, crowned, ready for worshippers. I trust I shall not be held to a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> description of our dear Lizzie's person and costume. Who is so great a recluse as never to have beheld young ladyhood in full dress? Many of us have sisters and daughters. Not a few of us, I hope, have female connections of another degree, yet no less dear. Others have looking-glasses. I give you my word for it that Elizabeth made as pretty a show as it is possible to see. She was of course well-dressed. Her skirt was of voluminous white, puffed and trimmed in wondrous sort. Her...", "...possible. A great position like that naturally makes people think differently. And, after all, the woman is married now. But no use talking about it! The twins have effectually knocked that possibility on the head. They say she nearly went mad with fury when she heard the news. It seems he had never given her a hint before the wedding. Wise man! He evidently knew his Mrs. Chepstow. Nevertheless, to give the devil her due, I hear she seems quite wrapped up in her husband. I saw him for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the other day, when I was crossing to go to the tombs of the Kings. He was looking awfully ill, I thought, such an extraordinary colour!

When he had finished it, he took out from a drawer Nigel's...", "...from anything unworthy. It was a long stroll in the fields that Walter took that day, listening to the birds, and the Sunday bells, and the softened murmur of the town--breathing sweet scents; glancing sometimes at the dim horizon beyond which his voyage and his place of destination lay; then looking round on the green English grass and the home landscape. But he hardly once thought, even of going away, distinctly; and seemed to put off reflection idly, from hour to hour, and from <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to minute, while he yet went on reflecting all the time. Walter had left the fields behind him, and was plodding homeward in the same abstracted mood, when he heard a shout from a man, and then a woman's voice calling to him loudly by name. Turning quickly in his surprise, he saw that a hackney-coach, going in the contrary direction, had stopped at no great distance; that the coachman was looking back from his box and making signals to him with his whip; and that a young...", "...four seats together, so for them to set where they was the last time and we're goin' elsewheres.\" \"It don't seem fair,\" says my wife. \"I should worry about bein' fair with Hatch,\" I says. \"If he's ever left with more than a dime's worth o' cards you got to look under the table for his hand.\" \"It don't seem fair,\" says the Missus. \"You should worry!\" I says. So we ast them over the followin' night and it looked for a minute like we was goin' to clean up.

He saw round the neck a dark navy handkerchief, and down the front of the coat brass buttons that shook and trembled as their owner's chest heaved. And what a chest! Jeremy had never conceived that any human being could be so thick and so broad. The back, spreading to the farthest limits of the shiny seams of the coat, was like a wall. The thighs were pillows, the arms bolsters and yet not fat, mind you, simply muscle, all of it. One could see in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that it was all muscle, the chest thrust forward, the legs spread wide, the bull-neck bursting the handkerchief, everything that Jeremy himself most wished to be. A sailor, a monument of strength, with the scent of his \"shag\" strong enough to smell a mile away, and--yes, most marvellous of all, gold rings in his ears! His chest would be tatooed probably, and perhaps his legs also! There, on the back of his hand, was a blue anchor.... Jeremy looked up and trembled lest the...", "...of alarm, \"Look yourself, Chief; this seems to me inconceivable.\" Flying Eagle stooped down in his turn, and remained a long time examining the marks which seemed to trouble the hunter so greatly. At length he rose. \"Well?\" Marksman asked him. \"A band of horsemen has passed by here this very day,\" he replied. \"Yes,\" the hunter said; \"but who are the horsemen? Where do they come from? That is what I want to know.\" The Indian resumed his inspection, with an attention more <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> than before. \"They are Palefaces,\" after a pause, he said. \"What! Palefaces!\" Marksman exclaimed, with a voice prudently suppressed; \"it is impossible! Think where we are. Never has a white man, excepting myself, penetrated into these regions.\" \"They are Palefaces,\" the Chief insisted, \"Look, one of them stopped here and dismounted; here is the mark of his steps; his foot crushed that tuft of grass; one of his nails in his shoe left a black line on that stone.\" \"That is...", "...attended only to the errands on which they were sent, and brought back absolutely no knowledge of the distant countries that they visited, except that which they were specially directed to fetch.

He made copious and <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> notes of all that he saw and heard, for the benefit of his imperial master. These notes afterward served him a good purpose, as we shall see; for they were the basis of the book that has made the name of Marco Polo famous throughout the world.

The latter, however, on being subsequently moistened with saliva or given bits of meat, became incurved, though with extreme slowness; and this shows that they had been injured.

It was Tom who first opened his eyes with the indefinable but distinct idea that something was wrong. It was almost dark, so he knew that it must be after midnight. What the trouble he vaguely guessed at could be, he was at an utter loss to determine, but the feeling was so strong that he slipped on some clothes and emerged on deck. He looked about him for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and almost decided that he had been the victim of one of those transient impressions that often come to those abruptly awakened from sleep. But almost simultaneously with this idea the truth broke sharply upon him like a thunderclap. \"Uncle!\" he shouted. \"Boys! Wake up! We are drifting down stream!\" The others were awake in an instant, and in all sorts of costumes they crowded out on deck. Jack carried a rifle under the impression that they had been attacked. \"What's...", "...man. Presently a young stag rushed into one of the bags with such force as to break both his horns close off.

That's a deer: no, it can't be: do you see how it slouches along? Depend upon it it's not a deer.\" \"Well, at any rate it's coming this way; we shall soon get a look at it.\" Another pause of half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and the beast was concealed in a little patch of jungle a few hundred yards from us.

The dust raised by this crowd was so great that I could not see anything beyond our zeriba for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, and it was impossible to say what might happen. The men behaved splendidly, and stood quite still. It was about the highest test of discipline I shall ever see, as in my opinion nothing could beat it.\" The stampede of the transport train is thus described by another writer:-- \"Suddenly from the bush all along the face of the zeriba fronting Tamaai burst out a clamour of savage cries, and the next instant the whole assemblage of transport...", "...a difficult patient, and I very much fear that even I shall have little influence with him.

Then when the king turned against George, Anthony, good courtier that he was, turned likewise, and there is no bitterness that may be compared with that of an apostate brother.

Although the poet has interwoven in it a tale of merest fancy, it is essentially realistic, differing notably in this respect from Calendau. This realism descends to the merest details, and the poetic quality of the work suffers considerably in many passages.

In a tiny little room out of the bedroom--the so-called little drawing-room, though their big drawing-room was little too--Elena Ivanovna was sitting, in some half-transparent morning wrapper, on a smart little sofa before a little tea-table, drinking coffee out of a little cup in which she was dipping a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> biscuit. She was ravishingly pretty, but struck me as being at the same time rather pensive. \"Ah, that's you, naughty man!\" she said, greeting me with an absent-minded smile. \"Sit down, feather-head, have some coffee.

Besides, yesterday I was visiting our captive....\" I sighed and assumed a pious expression as I took the coffee. \"Whom?... What captive?... Oh, yes!

The measurement is already made and costs nothing; and as it was made to pay a duty on tonnage, we are very sure that Government will...", "...Peggy looking at me with a curious awakened expression, and then I wonder if she has begun to suspect. I cannot tell how it will end. III. THE GRANDMOTHER, by Mary Heaton Vorse The position of an older woman in her daughter's house is often difficult. It makes no difference to me that Ada is a mother herself; she might be even a great-grandmother, and yet in my eyes she would still be Ada, my little girl. I feel the need of guiding her and protecting her just as much this <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> as when she was a baby in the nursery; only now the task is much more difficult. That is why I say that the position of women placed as I am is often hard, harder than if I lived somewhere else, because although I am with Ada I can no longer protect her from anything--not even from myself, my illnesses and weaknesses. It sometimes seems to me, so eagerly do I follow the lights and shadows of my daughter's life, as if I were living a second existence together with my own. Only as...", "...Marco which really adds anything decisive to European knowledge before the fifteenth century; the advance of trade intercourse between India and the Italian Republics, the gradual liberation of Russia the use made of the caravan routes by some of the most active of the Western clergy, are the chief notes of the time between the Polos and Prince Henry; and the flimsy fabrications of Mandeville--\"of all liars that type of the first magnitude\"--would be fairly left without a word even in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> history of discovery, if he had not, like Ktesias with Herodotus, won a hearing for himself and drawn men's minds away from the truth-telling original that he travestied, by the sheer force of impudence. The Indian travels of the Italian Nicolo Conti and the Russian merchant Athanasius Nikitin belong to a later time, to the age of the Portuguese voyages; they are not part of the preparation for our central subject, they are only a somewhat obscure parallel to that subject....", "...doc,\" said Barry, and was off at a run. At the casualty clearing station there was no excitement, the doctors and orderlies \"carrying on\" as usual, receiving the wounded, dressing their wounds, sending them down with the smoothness and despatch characteristic of their department. \"Cameron?\" said the doctor in answer to Barry's question. \"Why certainly, I'll show you.\" And he led him to Cameron's cot. \"Well, old chap,\" said the doctor cheerily, \"we're going to send you down in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two. Now don't talk.\" Cameron's eyes welcomed Barry. \"Dear old boy,\" said Barry, dropping on his knees beside him. \"I'm awfully sorry.\" \"It's all right,\" whispered Cameron. \"They--never--knew.--You'll write dad--and tell him--I kept--\" The voice trailed off into silence. The morphia was doing its merciful work. \"Kept the faith,\" said Barry. \"Yes,\" whispered Cameron with a smile, faint but exultant. \"Good old boy,\" whispered Barry. \"Yes, I--kept--I kept--\"...", "...on doctoring, the doctor's on business, and my business-man's -- that is, yours -- on morals.\" \"And on love -- -- \" \"My own.\" \"I'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument.\" said Oak, with a grave smile. She did not reply at once, and then saying, \"Good evening Mr. Oak.\" went away. She had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor ex- pected any reply from Gabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained. Yet in the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> a little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not allow herself to recognize. Oak had not once wished her free that he might marry her himself -- had not once said, \"I could wait for you as well as he.\" That was the insect sting. Not that she would have listened to any such hypothesis. O no -- for wasn't she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future were improper, and wasn't Gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her? Yet he might have just...", "...grasped their purpose when they swept in close beneath the dazzling wall, while Appleby, who stood upright, with the glasses at his eyes, said something hoarsely in evident approbation. Once more there was a crackle of firing, and the smoke grew thick, while when it cleared the dusty strip was empty save for the white objects which lay still here and there. Tony surmised that the others had found entrance into the town by a narrow lane, or through the house of a friendly citizen. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two later this became evident, for the crash of firing grew furious on the roofs above the gap, and Appleby, who thrust his glasses into their case, was shouting hoarsely. Rising by twos and threes the men sprang out from among the flowering shrubs, and Tony saw the low walls and clumps of aloes become alive with scurrying forms. They seemed to move independently and without formation, though Appleby, with hand swung up, was shouting in Castilian, and Maccario went by pointing...", "...things pointed to but one conclusion; still that one was so horrible that I would not, even while I doubted and distrusted her, I would not, I could not accept it. I put it from me, and refused to believe it, although during the rest of that night it kept coming back to me and knocking for admission at my brain. All this flashed through my mind while I was fixing on Pavannes' badges. Not that I lost time about it, for from the moment I grasped the position as he conceived it, every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> we had wasted on explanations seemed to me an hour. I reproached myself for having forgotten even for an instant that which had brought us to town--the rescue of Kit's lover. We had small chance now of reaching him in time, misled as we had been by this miserable mistake in identity. If my companion's fears were well founded, Louis would fall in the general massacre of the Huguenots, probably before we could reach him. If ill-founded, still we had small reason to hope....", "...more especially aloft. At length Sir Hotham Ward was heard in the affair. He let fly his whole broadside, almost simultaneously; and a spiteful, threatening roar it was. The smoke now began to hide his ship, though la Desiree, by moving towards us, kept ahead of her own sulphurous canopy. The Speedy soon opened on the French Commodore; then, by the roar astern, I knew Le Cerf was at work in the smoke. All four ships shivered their top-sails, to pass more slowly; and there was a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> during which, as it appeared to me, all four actually stopped under the fiery cloud they had raised, in order to do each other all the harm they could. The Frenchmen, however, soon issued from behind the curtain, and the cessation in the firing announced that the ships had parted. I could not see much of the English, at first, on account of the smoke; but their antagonists came out of the fray, short as it had been, with torn sails, crippled yards, and Le Cerf had her mizen...", "...which would no doubt follow him to the grave, \"that assurance I can easily give you. I was the sole criminal in the hideous outrage which brought so much sorrow upon you. Had I the least hope that God would hear the prayer of so despicable a villain as I am I would beg of Him to grant you oblivion of my deed.

I would not forget one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of the last four days.\" \"To-morrow then you can take the remembrance with you to the gallows,\" said Stoutenburg sullenly. Though a sense of intense relief pervaded him now, since by his assertions Diogenes had completely vindicated him as well as Nicolaes in Gilda's sight, his dark face showed no signs of brightening. That fierce jealousy of this nameless adventurer which had assailed him awhile ago was gnawing at his heart more insistently than before; he could not...", "...by a wager. \"Whoever loses the race,\" I said, \"shall have to do whatever the winner asks.\" \"Agreed!\" We marked the winning-post, and made a fair start. I was certain to win, but I lost on purpose, so as to see what she would ask me to do. At first she ran with all her might while I reserved my strength, and she was the first to reach the goal. As she was trying to recover her breath, she thought of sentencing me to a good penance: she hid herself behind a tree and told me, a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> afterwards, that I had to find her ring. She had concealed it about her, and that was putting me in possession of all her person. I thought it was a delightful forfeit, for I could easily see that she had chosen it with intentional mischief; but I felt that I ought not to take too much advantage of her, because her artless confidence required to be encouraged. We sat on the grass, I visited her pockets, the folds of her stays, of her petticoat; then I looked in her shoes, and...", "...with the breath knocked out of him. He dimly heard the union break again into cries; feet trampled him; he felt a keen shooting pain. Then he was conscious that some force was turning the edge of the mob from its path; then he was lifted up and placed at the window out of which he had just dragged Foley; and then, Petersen's arm supporting him, he stood weakly on one foot holding to the sill. For an instant he had a glimpse of Foley, on the platform, his back to the wall. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Tom had been on the floor a group of Foley's roughs, moved by some strange reawakening of loyalty, had rushed to his aid, but they had gone down; and now Foley stood alone, behind a table, sneering at the crowd. \"Come on!\" he shouted, with something between a snarl and a laugh, shaking his clenched fist. \"Come on, one at a time, an' I'll do up every one o' youse!\" The next instant he went down, and at the spot where he sank the crowd swayed and writhed as the vortex of a...", "...he began again: \"My great-aunt--\" The doctor fell back in his chair with a groan and a laugh. \"Yes; the same one you may have heard me mention before. She told me that all through her childhood her family was saving and pulling together to build a fine big house. They worked along for years until, when she was a young lady, they finally accomplished it; built a big three-story house that was the admiration of the countryside. Then they moved in. And it took the women-folks every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of their time, and more, to keep it clean and in order; it cost as much to keep it up, heated, furnished, repaired, painted, and everything the way a fine house should be, as their entire living used to cost.

After a varying number of hours of excessive toil the travellers were wont to arrive at some fearsome chasm spoken of as a 'bergschrund.' On this, if the subject-matter of their narrative was insufficient in quantity, they were wont to descant and enlarge at length; sometimes, as we judge, in their descriptions they enlarged the bergschrund itself. They then crossed it. Immediately after this incident they were in the habit of eating, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and instructive details commonly given enable us to form a tolerably accurate opinion as to the nature of the diet with which they supported their exhausted frames. Next they traversed strange localities for which there appear to have been no adequately descriptive expressions in their own language. In fact the difficulty of deciphering these records is greatly increased by the fact that the writers were versatile linguists, for they constantly make use of words of a hybrid...", "...\"And you stood up for me?\" \"You know I did!\" \"All right, I don't give a tinker's damn what anybody says if you stand by me!

I recall no more about it until I heard Lady Ragnall tell Moxley to see that there was a good fire in the museum where we were going to study that night and must not be disturbed.

The string fell off from where she hung it, and she picked it up and hung it up a second time, this time more slowly and carefully. Then she took out the postmarking machine.

His heart seemed to jump into his mouth at the sight. He almost snatched it from the postmaster's hand, and without stopping to answer the jesting remark of that functionary on his sudden accession of color, hurried away, never stopping till he reached the privacy of his own room, thankful that he succeeded in doing so without being seen by any of the family.

Evidently it had been only a passing impulse. If he had really cared, now that he knew I was free, he would have forgotten himself again at once. Then a new explanation occurred to me.

Then we set ourselves to wait for six o'clock. The hour came; and <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> after minute went by before we heard in the distance the tapping of the crutches on the stones. Little by little the sound grew louder, and then fainter, and when I judged he was nearly at my back, I stooped and thrust our curious messenger into the pipe. Then we sat down to await the result. As the mouse, only too glad to escape, ran into the aperture, the thread, on which our very lives depended, swiftly followed, dragging its message after it.

I know only that he knelt upon my chest, still gripping my throat with his left hand, and began to reach out for his revolver, which had dropped beneath the table in our struggle.

The scream was from the woman who had come to Piccadilly the day before, and it was followed by a...", "...In the shadow of the porch he stood again, and gazed upon the moonlit scene. Down the hill was the darkness of the forest, giving the appearance of an unfathomable pit. Above rose its sides, shimmering in the cold moonlight. Above the forest line the eternal snows glinted like burnished steel, for the yellow rays of the rising moon had given place to the silvery gleam of its maturity. The diamond-studded sky had nothing of darkness in it; a grey light, the sheen of the star myriads too <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to be visible to the naked eye, shone down upon the earth, and the still air had the sharp snap of the spring frost in it. Nick was oblivious to all but the forest cries and the crowd of stealing forms moving from the woodland shelter, and circling upward, ever nearer and nearer towards the feast which lay spread out within sight of their cruel eyes. Nearer they drew, lean, scraggy, but withal large beasts.

At last she stopped in front of the warehouse beyond Mr. Tiernan's shop, staring at the darkened windows of the flat--of the front room in which her mother now slept alone.

And more than another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> had passed before the earth beneath me was wrenched and jarred as if by an earthquake and the most thunderous detonations I had ever heard burst over me in a prolonged series. Let me emphasize that none of this had the quality of a dream; it was clear-cut, as vivid as anything I had ever experienced; my mind worked with an unusual precision and clarity, and not even a fleeting doubt came to me of the reality of my observations. \"This is some sort of bombing attack,\" I remember...", "...you see he might task his heart with heavier work than it can perform.

Donal gave her a Euclid, and set her a task: she began at once to learn it--and after a while so brief that Davie stared incredulous, said, \"If you please, Mr. Grant, I think I could be questioned upon it now.\" Less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> sufficed to show Donal that she thoroughly understood what she had been learning, and he set her then a little more. By the time their work was over he had not a doubt left that suchlike intellectual occupation would greatly subserve all phases of her health.

Impatiently waiting for perhaps a full <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that his conceit might be pampered, the officer drew his sword again and peremptorily ordered the trail cleared for his passing. The muleteers did their best, but it was not good enough for the puffed-up captain, and he spurred his horse against a faggot-burdened animal.

The proportion of capacity of the lifting buckets for such a wheel becomes of as great importance as its...", "...lil yam.\" \"Ha--ha--ha--ha--ha!\" I burst out, for I could contain myself no longer. The comparison to the \"lil yam\" was too much for me, and as I faced round, good-humoured once more, and ready to go and bathe or do anything with the boy who was my only companion, he showed his teeth at me fiercely, made a run, jumped over the fence into the garden, and I saw him dash down the middle path toward the forest as hard as he could go. I stood looking in the direction he had taken for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, and felt disposed to go after him; but I had seen him get into a temper before, and get out of it again, and I knew that next time we met all this would have passed away from both of us like a cloud. \"No, I won't go after him,\" I said to myself; \"it will make him vain and conceited, and he's bad enough as it is. Poor ole Pomp! Poor lil nigger! What a rum fellow he can be when he likes!\" This little episode had quite carried off the sour feeling from which I had...", "...for about a week. Will you write to me at the end of that time?--Always yours, my dear Grail, 'WALTER EGREMONT.' Mrs. Grail showed no curiosity about the letter; the subject of the interrupted conversation held her musing. When Gilbert had folded the sheets, and, in the manner of one who receives few letters, returned it to its envelope, he said: 'Yes, it's about the library. He's taken the house for seven years.' His mother murmured an expression of interest. For another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the clock on the mantel-piece ticked loud; then Gilbert rose, and without saying anything, went out. He entered his bedroom. The darkness was complete, but he moved with the certainty of habit to a chair by the head of the bed, and there seated himself. Presently he felt a painful surging in his throat, then a gush of warm tears forced its way to his eyes. It cost him a great effort to resist the tendency to sob aloud. He was hot and cold alternately, and trembled as though a...", "...thousand, and steady as a clock; but he had a fireman who couldn't stand prosperity, Steve Horigan, a cousin of Johnnie's. The glory was too great for Steve, and he spent Friday night in Gallagher's place celebrating, telling the boys what the 1012 would do to the Yellow Mail. Not a thing, Steve claimed after five drinks, but pull the stamps clean off the letters the minute they struck the foothills. But when Steve showed up at five A.M. to superintend the movement, he was seasick. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Sollers set eyes on him he objected to taking him out. Mr. Sollers was not looking for any unnecessary chances on one of Bucks's personal matters, and for the general manager the Yellow Mail test had become exceedingly personal. Practically everybody East and West had said it would fail; Bucks said no. Neighbor himself was on the Piedmont platform that morning, watching things. The McCloud despatchers had promised the train to our division on time, and her smoke was due with...", "...found him delightful and was sorry when he had to leave. (Berri insisted that he was driven rapidly to town to the Palace Theatre, where he was due to appear at 10.50--between a trick bicyclist and a Dutch comedian.) When we had said good-by to him, Fleetwood came up bringing a pleasant-looking chap with spectacles. (I had often seen him in the Yard.) \"This is Mr. Paul,\" Fleetwood said to me, \"and he wants to have words with you.\" Mr. Paul talked about the old gentleman for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, and then said quite abruptly,-- \"We 've been reading your stuff in English 83, Mr. Wood, and the fellows think it's darned good. I wish you 'd let us have some of it for the Advocate.\" I was so astonished I just looked at him. Then he went on to say that he wanted to print two of my themes--The Jimsons, and a description of something I saw one night in town--and that if I wrote a third and it turned out to be good, they would make me an editor! He had said that...", "...to do with it?\" \"Both. I'm coming to the parcel in a minute. Well, as I was saying, I was just about fed up with things in general. Books in particular. Nice state of mind for an author with his living to earn to begin the week in! I remember stopping shaving to have a good hard look at myself. I remember saying to myself in the glass, 'You're young, you're a perfect miracle of youth; you've got quite a good brain as brains go; and yet instead of getting out of doors and living every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of one of God's good days you'll sit down there, and make scratches on bits of paper that have got to be just like the scratches everybody else makes or you won't sell 'em; isn't there something wrong somewhere?' I asked myself that in the glass. And mind you, I was feeling extraordinarily fit physically. That's important. I'd felt like that for days past. Who wants to work when he feels like that?\" I sighed a little. Even I, with my modicum of health, have occasionally felt...", "...that, young man as he was, I had never yet heard irreverently and thoughtlessly on his lips. It was a sight that would move any one to cry for pity unto the Great Father of the human family. Abel Fletcher sat on his remaining bags, in an exhaustion that I think was not all physical pain. The paroxysm of anger past, he, ever a just man, could not fail to be struck with what he had done. He seemed subdued, even to something like remorse. John looked at him, and looked away. For a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he listened in silence to the shouting outside, and then turned to my father. \"Sir, you must come now. Not a second to lose--they will fire the mill next.\" \"Let them.\" \"Let them?--and Phineas is here!\" My poor father! He rose at once. We got him down-stairs--he was very lame--his ruddy face all drawn and white with pain; but he did not speak one word of opposition, or utter a groan of complaint.

He pleaded a headache, ate little to bear evidence to his sincerity, and after breakfast retired to his tent with the honest intention of keeping it till noon at least for very consistency's sake. Through its open sides, he could view Mrs. Collingwood at her daily routine. She came out upon the broad veranda, made a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> examination of the flower-pots, pulled a few dead fronds from a great air-fern which hung in one of the windows, and cut a nosegay from the hedge of golden cannas. Afterwards he saw her through the open casement, sitting at her desk, and apparently making entries in an account book. At nine o'clock, six or eight children between the ages of seven and fourteen arrived and squatted down on the veranda. Charlotte came out with an armful of books, which she distributed; and with the...", "...They whirled past little stations with a sudden roar. At Brushingham a passenger train lay on the siding. There was a mottled flash of yellow, then they were by, and for an instant Jawn smiled. He hadn't passed Jack Martin like that for years. Then they struck the hills. Up with a snort, over with a groan, and down with a rumble and slide, they flew. Here Jawn's eyes shifted to the water gauge. Jim locked one arm around the window post, and sat with eyes fixed on his watch. The <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> hand crept around to eleven, passed it, and on to five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five. At thirty-five clusters of cottages began to shoot by. Jawn's arm began to straighten--the roar diminished a trifle. Thirty-seven they passed rows of coal-laden flat cars; thirty-nine, they slackened through a tangle of tracks; forty-one, the big engine rolled under the train shed and stopped in a cloud of steam. Jim stepped down and stretched himself. The fireman had staggered back...", "...evening--your guest--your friend's glove!

His voice sounded broken and disturbed. \"Oh!\" I muttered. \"It's nothing!\"' \"You are very good,\" he sighed; \"but I feel that I must explain. I consider I owe this to you, but I must tell you I should not have the courage if it were not for another reason. You see I have no friend.\" He looked at me with an uncertain smile.

From a convenient position on the steps leading up to an orchestra, the fringe of her mask confined by her hand, so as to prohibit even a glimpse of her ivory chin, she subjected to a rigid scrutiny all who issued from the conservatory. Suddenly, from the door nearest to her, the hussar and his companion made their appearance, and, as they passed, she shrouded herself behind the portly figure and sumptuous embroideries of a Venetian doge. Then she resumed her watch, and a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> had not elapsed when she saw the tall black domino, whom she had observed during the evening, re-enter the dancing-room and make his way as fast as the crowd would allow him to the nearest door of exit, with a hurried and irregular step, hardly to be explained otherwise than by sudden illness or violent emotion. She followed him to the head of the staircase, down which he rushed, disappearing at its foot through the crowd of lackeys in the hall. Having seen this, she re-entered...", "...out of sight long before assistance could reach them. But the Bradys were cheered up wonderfully. They kept on shouting, and the track-walker finally found them by being guided by the tones of their voices. Only their heads stuck above the water.

Standing on the embankment, he reached out the end to Old King Brady, who lifted his hands above the water and grasped it. \"Pull!\" gasped the detective. The track-walker used all his strength, for the sand clung to the old detective tenaciously, and dragged him up. Around him the sand stirred up and the water bubbled and eddied as it rushed into the opening...", "...all to be boiled down for preserving the following day.

The Northbury people did not stand on ceremony with each other, nor wait in each other's drawing-rooms, for the return of an absent hostess. A wild idea came across Mrs. Bell's brain.

Dressed most elegant.\" \"Dear, dear, dear! Then I...", "...together. First, the engagement Philip had had on the day of his death with the Boys' Farm Committee; at that he would have had to account for the five thousand dollars, and his embezzlement would have been laid open. Second, the certainty of exposure from Lillian Drew, since he had no more money to ward it off. Third, was it not remarkable that Morton's heart trouble, if heart trouble there had been, with fifteen hundred minutes in the day in which to strike, had selected the single <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he spent in his bath? As David struck the sum of these, there crawled into his heart another awful fear. Would a man who had not had the courage to face the danger of one exposure, have the courage to face a double exposure? Had Morton's death been natural, or---- Sickened, David let his head fall forward upon his arms, folded on the desk--and so he sat, motionless, as twilight, then darkness, crept into the room.

The sense which is less a belief than an intimate knowledge of immortality belonged to him now, and he realised that so far as he lived at all he lived not in the hour alone, but in eternity, that so far as he had won peace it was bound up in a passionate conviction of the survival of the universe within his soul. To-day or to-morrow, in the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or in eternity, he saw that wherever God is there will always be immortal life. Turning back into the room he looked again at Laura's picture with a longing which had not freed itself as yet from the idea of renouncement. Even now he realised that he had been strong enough to live without her, and with the admission, he was aware again of that wider sympathy which had been his compensation in a forefeiture of personal love. His happiness he had told himself a year ago...", "...of not possessing--so execrable as sign-paintings even! 'Are there worse poets in their way than painters?' Yet the melancholy business is here--that the bad poet goes out of his way, writes his verses in the language he learned in order to do a hundred other things with it, all of which he can go on and do afterwards--but the painter has spent the best of his life in learning even how to produce such monstrosities as these, and to what other good do his acquisitions go?

Eymerich composed a book entitled \"The Guide of Inquisitors,\" in which the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details of his judgments, and those of other inquisitors of Aragon, are found. It is not certain whether the provincial of Castile exercised his privilege of naming inquisitors; perhaps heresy had not penetrated into the states of Castile.

In 1803, a notice...", "...corpse. A man may be very unhappy, and yet exceedingly affected.

The equal diffusion of its light on earth is owing to the refraction of the rays by the atmosphere, and their reflection from other bodies. Light consists either of vibrations propagated through a subtle medium, or of numerous <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> particles repelled in all directions from the luminous body. Its velocity greatly exceeds that of any substance with which we are acquainted: observations on the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites have demonstrated that light takes up no more than 8 minutes 7 seconds in passing from the sun to the earth, a distance of 95,000,000 miles.--Some idea may be gained of the immense distance of the fixed stars when it is computed that many years would elapse before light could reach this...", "...himself.

Kralinsky disdained flight, and was looking out of a window. Lady Maud had sat down again. For the first time in her life she felt weak. In less than one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the door opened and Stemp appeared, impassive and respectful. Behind him was the boatswain, a huge Northumbrian, and five young seamen in perfectly new guernseys, with fair quiet faces. 'Stemp.' 'Yes, sir.' 'Take that man somewhere and shave him. Leave his moustache on.' Van Torp pointed to Kralinsky. For once in his life Stemp gasped for breath. Kralinsky turned a greenish white, and seemed paralysed with rage. 'Take his beard off, sir, you mean?' 'Yes. Leave his...", "...was not your custom to see any here, and that if he had aught to say he should call at your house in St. Mary Axe; but he said that he had but just arrived from Hedingham, and that your honour would excuse his intrusion when you saw him.\" \"Bring him up; he may be the bearer of a message from my father,\" Geoffrey said; and the servant went back to the man, whom he had left a short distance off. \"Master Vickars will speak with you.\" The sailor approached the party. He stood for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before Geoffrey without speaking. Geoffrey looked at him with some surprise, and saw that the muscles of his face were twitching, and that he was much agitated. As he looked at him remembrance suddenly flashed upon him, and he sprang to his feet. \"Stephen Boldero!\" he exclaimed. \"Ay, ay, Geoffrey, it is me.\" For a time the men stood with their right hands clasped and the left on each other's shoulders. Tears fell down the sailor's weather-beaten cheeks, and Geoffrey himself...", "...are fairly plentiful, but are not by any means always managed by the municipality of the place. None of the town councils do anything for the education of the people, and but few think of their entertainment.

The control of hospitals and charitable aid, though entirely a public function not left in any way to private bounty, is entrusted to distinct boards. Indeed, the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> subdivision of local administration has been carried to extreme lengths in New Zealand, where the hundreds of petty local bodies, each with its functions, officers, and circle of friends and enemies, are so many stumbling-blocks to thorough--going amalgamation and rearrangement. In New Zealand the English conditions are reversed; the municipal lags far behind the central authority on the path of experiment. This is no doubt due, at least in part, to the difference in the...", "...locality for some time; the large black with purple wings was a constant visitor. When about making a nest to lay their eggs, they would fly into my waggon, examine every part minutely, and after fixing upon a particular corner, would fly away and return with a ball of mud the size of a pea, and commence to plaster the side of the waggon fixed upon. This would go on for two or three days, the two wasps, male and female, bringing in these little balls of mud, going and returning every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> until it was completed, leaving a little circular hole to each cavity in the clay nest, one-eighth of an inch in diameter when so completed. They would commence with one of the holes, there being five; the female would deposit the eggs, then the two would go out and return with a green caterpillar each, which they would push into the hole containing the eggs, then leave and return with balls of clay, and plaster up the hole so cleverly that it would be impossible to find it...", "...and refreshment!

They reached the station in good time, and punctually to the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the lights of the London express were seen in the distance. The train drew up, and among the few passengers who alighted the figure of Peggy, in her scarlet-trimmed hat, was easily distinguished. She was assisted out of the carriage by an elderly gentleman, in a big travelling coat, who stood by her side as she looked about for her friends. As Mr Asplin and Arthur approached, they only heard his hearty, \"Now you are all right!\" and Peggy's elegant rejoinder, \"Exceedingly...", "...of Griffith, determined Tom to advance and reconnoitre the scene more closely. The reader will anticipate that when he paused in the shadow, the doubting old seaman stood once more near the threshold which he had so lately crossed, when conducted to the room of Borroughcliffe. The seat of that gentleman was now occupied by Dillon, and Colonel Howard had resumed his wonted station at the foot of the table. The noise was chiefly made by the latter, who had evidently been enjoying a more <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> relation of the means by which his kinsman had entrapped his unwary enemy. \"A noble ruse!\" cried the veteran, as Tom assumed his post, in ambush; \"a most noble and ingenious ruse, and such a one as would have baffled Caesar!

The moment Matt realized that the cart was afloat and the oxen swimming for their lives, his impulse was not to save himself, but the unfortunate animals that, through his rashness, had been brought into danger. Springing, therefore, between them, he caught hold of the yoke with one hand, and with the other wrenched out the iron pin that fastened it to the tongue, and thus freed them from the cart. In the effort, however, he lost his hold upon the yoke, and the next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> found himself left alone, struggling with the angry billows. He was now forced to look out for himself and could not watch the fate of the oxen, even had he had an inclination to do so, indeed with his water-soaked clothing, which greatly impeded his efforts, there was already a serious question whether he would be able to reach the shore, good swimmer though he was. With a strength born from the very sense of the danger that overwhelmed him, he turned his face toward the...", "...About sunrise, a Mormon boy, belonging to a freighter outfit, which was camped over in town, going out after the horses which had been taken across the river the night before to graze, came whistling down the road to the bridge, and started to cross. As soon as his footfalls were heard on the flooring of the structure, the almost helpless men below roused and began to call as loudly as they were able with their numb lips and jaws chattering like castanets. It took him a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two to locate the voices. The lad took one hasty look over the railing of the bridge, and, with a shriek of horror, fled toward town as fast as his feet could carry him. Here he told the first man he met that he had seen two bodies hanging to the bridge, and a crowd was soon on the way to the river, expecting to find the results of a vigilance committee suspended from the stringers. The two men were quickly pulled up on to the bridge and the ropes that bound them like...", "...and masterful once more. \"Of course,\" he went on, \"the credit belongs to Parker, who worked the bridge out in each detail--he's marvelous--and to Mellen, who actually built it, but I helped a little.

Strictly speaking, we haven't as yet, for there's still the break-up to face; but the bridge will come through it without a scratch.

I think you've suffered under it as much as I have.\" A little wistfully she answered: \"You're going to realize that dream you told me about the day of the storm at Kyak.

A. I could hardly tell--it was a very short time. I don't think you could count a minute. Q.

I think it was about one o'clock in the afternoon that the Germans broke through the trench on our right, where Major Bing-Hall was in command; and some of the survivors from that trench came over to ours. One of them ran right to where I was, and pushed through the hole I had made in the hedge, to get a shot at the enemy. I called to him to be careful, but some sniper evidently saw him, for in less than half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he was shot dead, and fell at my side. An order to \"retreat if necessary\" had been received before this, but for some reason, which I have never been able to understand, was not put into effect until quite a while after being received. When the order came, we began to move down the trench as fast as we could, but as the trench was narrow and there were wounded and dead men in it, our progress was slow. Soon I saw Robinson, Smith, and Ward climbing out of the trench and...", "...On my part, I did my utmost to inspire her with hopes I myself scarce dared to entertain; when, as she stood beside me, her hand clasped in mine, a smile of affection upon her countenance, the door suddenly opened, and, before we had time to separate, Victor de Berg, a lieutenant in my regiment, and a suitor of Bertha's, made a step into the room.

My endeavours were vain as to the former; but the small one broke into many fragments, and proved to contain <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> prismatic crystals, which were quite transparent; some white, others of a deep yellow. [2] So I understand the original, which is _Lapis marmoreus polyzonos_. Before the next post-house, I noticed on the right a little farm, and on the other side of the way a small ditch used to wash in. Here stood a plain sloping stone of white granite, in which were three large dark-grey squares, seeming to have been inlaid by a skilful stone-cutter. It was evident, however, on...", "...History\":--\"A harbour of great extent on our southern coast has an island near the middle, of considerable size, the nearest point of which is a mile distant from the mainland at high water, and with which point there is frequent communication by a ferry. Early one morning in spring two hares were observed to come down from the hills of the mainland towards the seaside, one of which from time to time left its companion, and proceeding to the very edge of the water, stopped there a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, and then returned to its mate. The tide was rising, and after waiting some time, one of them, exactly at high water, took to the sea, and swam rapidly over, in a straight line, to the opposite projecting point of land. The observer on this occasion, who was near the spot, but remained unperceived by the hares, had no doubt that they were of different sexes, and that it was the male--like another Leander--which swam across the water, as he had probably done many times...", "...not made it any part of this undertaking to print the passages which refer to purely physical principles, it has also been necessary to exclude those practical researches which, in accordance with indications given in_ 920, _ought to come in as Books_ 13, 14 _and_ 15. _I can only incidentally mention here that Leonardo--as it seems to me, especially in his youth--devoted a great deal of attention to the construction of mills.

Nor was it possible to include his considerations on the regulation of rivers, the making of canals and so forth (No._ 920, _Books_ 10, 11 _and_ 12_); but those passages in which the structure of a canal is directly connected with notices of particular places will be found duly inserted under section XVII (Topographical notes).

It was Marcos Ramero and Eloise St. Vrain. They were talking earnestly; and in a very lover-like manner the young man bent down to catch his companion's words. Something seemed to snap asunder in my brain, and from that moment I knew myself; knew how futile is the belief that miles of prairie trail and strength of busy days can ever cast down and break an idol of the heart.

Of these, the armor of the stoics was found to be of the firmest temper; and it was chiefly worn, both for use and ornament, in the schools of jurisprudence.

The superiority of _form_ to _matter_ was introduced to ascertain the right of property: and the equality of crimes is countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius, that he who touches the ear, touches the whole body; and that he who steals from a heap of corn, or a hogshead of wine, is guilty of the entire theft.

The man looked at him curiously, said nothing, but went over to some others and began to whisper.

Taking care not to injure the motor compartments of the other ships, using only the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> explosion-quantities, he jockeyed each ship around until all their noses pointed in one direction. The exhausts pointed out through the wide doorway. It was well that the beast had formed curved corners in the room, otherwise the scheme would not have worked.

This time Flitch did not go back, but toppled forward, clawing at Bullard's waistcoat, and reached the floor with a thud and a single gasp. And there was a silence, a period of petrifaction, that might have lasted for one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or ten: Bullard could not have gauged it. At last he came to himself. His teeth were chattering slightly. He examined the ruler, drew it through his fingers; it was quite clean, and he replaced it on the desk, softly, as though to avoid disturbing any one.

The faithless conduct of Pompeius towards the Parthians has been already mentioned;(1) he had not respected the stipulated frontier of the Euphrates and had...", "...a manly and comprehensive policy. We must penetrate the mountains, ascend the rivers, and reach the seats of sovereignty. We must, by a large and generous self-interest, combine the good, the knowledge, and the virtue of the population with our own; and we must lay the foundation of our permanent influence over this fourth of the globe, by showing that we are the fittest to communicate the benefits, and establish the example of civilized society.

Acton dropped to the ground like a bludgeoned dog. Phil, like a gentleman, backed a yard or so away, waiting for Acton to get up again, but he made no sign. Vercoe and I then counted him out with all due formality, and Phil had won at the very moment he was about to be beaten. We did our best for Acton, who was unconscious, and, just when we began to despair of bringing him round, he opened his eyes with the usual vacant stare. In a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he recovered his thoughts, and said eagerly, \"Then I've won.\" \"Not quite,\" said Vercoe, grimly. \"You've jolly well lost.\" Acton tottered to his feet blind with rage--diabolic rage--but hate and fury couldn't give him strength to stand. Vercoe gently caught him, and laid him quietly on his back, and sponged his face where the awful force of Phil's blow was becoming plainer every moment. He compressed his lips with rage and pain, and looked at Phil with such a look of...", "...from the sun into the shade and back again; or sitting for hours with her in the big darkened bedroom when Adeline had one of the bad headaches that attacked her now, brushing her hair, and putting handkerchiefs soaked in eau-de-cologne on her hot forehead.

The flames rose above the eaves on one side, and flared higher and hotter. Soon they grew scorching, and Agnes said, with quickened breathing: \"We couldn't stay here long.\" He looked at her, and the side of her face toward the fire glowed bright red. He took off his coat, moved close to her, and held it up between their faces and the flames; and they sat together so, breathing audibly, but not speaking, till the head of a ladder rose suddenly above the eaves, and a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later the head and shoulders of Jeffrey Coleman.

His fingers closed on something--bridle, or saddle, or stirrup--and he clung with a stiffened grasp, while his feet were torn from under him and a rifle flashed. Exactly what happened after that he did not know, but he was hurled forward, still clutching at something, with feet that scraped the snowy ice of the creek; and then there was a heavy crash, and what he held was torn away from him. He felt himself driven into a bank of snow, and lay there for perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> wondering vaguely if the life had all been smashed out of him, and listening to a sound of scuffling and floundering close by.

That done, he raised himself shakily, and, scrambling to one of the birches, leaned against it, gasping a little. A few seconds earlier he had been almost certain that he would never stand up again. In the meanwhile the...", "...here!\" gasped Tom, as he hurried on to the dark room. \"That man on board! I must tell Captain Steerit!\" CHAPTER VII THE STORM Filled with his new idea, and alarmed at the possible menace to himself, Tom turned, and was about to retrace his steps up on deck to speak to the captain. Then he paused. \"Hold on a minute, Tom Fairfield,\" he told himself. \"And don't do anything in a hurry. You came off on this voyage in a rush, and maybe that was a good thing. But just wait a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> now, and see if this is the best step to take.\" He turned again, and once more walked past the stateroom of the suspected man. The door was closed this time, and Tom was rather glad of it, for he did not want to meet the passenger, now that he knew who he was. \"I'll just wait a bit about telling the captain,\" reflected Tom. \"When I tell him the story he's bound to take some action, seeing that Mr. Trendell is sailing under false colors. And that's bound to make a row.

It proved to be the diminutive _Hapalocercus flaviventris_; and I was much amused to see the little thing fly directly to its larger foster-offspring and, alighting on its back, drop a worm into the upturned open mouth. After remaining a moment on its singular perch, the Flycatcher flew away, but in less than half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> returned and perched again on the young bird's back. I continued watching them until the _Molothrus_ flew off, but not before I had seen him fed seven or eight times in the same manner. In the foregoing anecdotes may be seen the peculiar habits of the young _Molothrus_. As the nests in which it is hatched, from those of the little _Serpophaga_ and Wren to those of _Mimus_, vary so much in size and materials, and are placed in such different situations, the young _Molothrus_...", "...I have some explanations to make to you.\" \"I am not asking you for any.\" \"Pray listen to me!\" It was not his fault in any way.

From time to time there was a cry of, \"Long live Napoleon! Long live Barbes! Down with Marie!\" The countless throng kept talking in very loud tones; and all these voices, echoing through the houses, made, so to speak, the continuous ripple of...", "...she won't, I've got a dark lantern on purpose; it don't give much light, and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming,\" said Dan. This idea struck Nat as a fine one, and lent an air of romance to the thing.

He will be asleep, so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again.\" Nat obeyed, and returned in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> with Tommy half dressed, rather tousled about the head and very sleepy, but quite ready for fun as usual. \"Now, keep quiet, and I'll show you how to play a first-rate game called 'Poker,'\" said Dan, as the three revellers gathered round the table, on which were set forth the bottle, the cigar, and the cards. \"First we'll all have a drink, then we'll take a go at the 'weed,' and then we'll play.

The sick person replied by stating that its advances were gradual, and at first not of a terrible or even disagreeable character. To illustrate this, he gave the following account of the progress of...", "...The piebald was a good horse, but a fidgetty one; so she saddled and bridled him at his stall. She then led him out to the stone steps in the stable-yard, and tried to mount him. But he sidled away; she had nobody to square him; and she could get nothing to mount but his head.

Foldeen shook his head. \"It is much worse,\" he murmured back. \"I have my flute lost.\" The boy could not but smile. \"We can thank our stars we weren't both smashed to atoms,\" he observed. \"Sh-h! don't talk!\" Foldeen adjured him, and indicated with a sidewise nod of the head that special reasons for silence...", "...are you going, Sanders?\" said the knight, sharply. \"Back,\" said Sanders--\"'taint garden here.\" His domain extended no farther. \"Come along this moment, sir; and stop till I dismiss you.\" The knight looked purple as the gardener slowly unlatched the gate, and followed him about a quarter of a mile, to where the estate joined that of the Trevors; and here, as they neared the pastures, angry voices were heard. \"Quick, Sanders,\" cried Sir Hampton--\"trespassers!\" The next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> they were upon an angry group, consisting of Trevor, Pratt, Humphrey, a man with a sinister look and a mouth like a rat-trap, and a stumpy fellow, who was armed with a long plashing hook. \"Er-rum! what's this?\" exclaimed Sir Hampton, with the voice of authority. \"These men of yours, Sir Hampton,\" said Humphrey, flushed and angry, \"always trespassing across our ground.\" \"My servants would do nothing of the sort, fellow,\" said Sir Hampton. \"But they have done it, Sir...", "...hungered before; and scarcely knowing whether I feared or not, whether to laugh or cry, but with all the wonder and terror of that great remove sweeping suddenly upon me I staggered back to my seat, and dropping my arms upon the table, leant my head heavily upon them and strove to choke back the passion which beset me. CHAPTER III It was the light touch of the boy An upon my shoulder which roused me. He was bending down, his pretty face full of concernful sympathy, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> said--knowing nothing of my thoughts, of course. \"It is the wine, stranger, the pink oblivion, it sometimes makes one feel like that until enough is taken; you stopped just short of what you should have had, and the next cup would have been delight--I should have told you.\" \"Ay,\" I answered, glad he should think so, \"it was the wine, no doubt; your quaint drink, sir, tangled up my senses for the moment, but they are clearer now, and I am eager past expression to learn a...", "...and dispositions of their citizens indicate that, in this government, liberty shall reign triumphant. Such, indeed, have been the general opinions and wishes entertained since the era of independence. If those opinions and wishes are as well founded as they have been general, the late Convention were justified in proposing to their constituents one confederate republic, as the best system of a national government for the United States. \"In forming this system, it was proper to give <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> attention to the interest of all the parts; but there was a duty of still higher import,--to feel and to show a predominating regard to the superior interests of the whole.

The same principle that was so necessary in forming it is equally necessary in our deliberations, whether we should reject or ratify it. \"I make these observations with a design to prove and illustrate this...", "...part of it built as far back as the eleven hundreds, and yet in good condition and fit to live in.

The Bagatelles, Op. 126, belong to this period, though their completion fell later. Taking up earlier sketches probably, Beethoven worked on them after the Ninth Symphony was practically complete in his mind and the sketchbooks--at the close of 1823 at the earliest. It is likely that they were not finished until the middle of 1824. Nottebohm had subjected them to a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> study which leads him to the conclusion that the pieces were conceived as a homogeneous series, the numbers being linked together by key-relationship. On the margin of a sketch for the first one Beethoven wrote \"Cycle of Trifles\" (\"Kleinigkeiten\"), which fact, their separation from each other (all but the first two) by the uniform distance of a major third, taken in connection with their unity of style, establishes a cyclical bond. When he offered them to Schott in 1824 he...", "...was music, the kind of which Fay never heard before--interlaced songs, each one grown out of the hearts of millions of people through thousands of years, songs breathing life, as different from the music she had heard to then as a photograph is to the object it tends to portray. The water going down hill, the trees of the forest spreading their wings, the wheat actually swaying like golden waves. Her own life passed before her as she heard the music; from early childhood to the very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of her thought. How had she ever dared to insult Marco? How had she dared bunch him together with her other admirers? She looked at him and her eyes pleaded forgiveness, but Marco was oblivious to everything. And as the music continued Fay saw Marco's eyes brighten. Every line of his face became full with an inner life she had never seen before in any one. Suddenly he started to sing a song as sad as the world's woes.

A large turning wheel was pushed around by a man holding a bar extending from it. The motion of this large wheel was transmitted to other smaller ones. The number of revolutions per <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> hardly exceeded a few hundred, while in modern times a speed of from 2000 to 2500 revolutions per minute is attained. The diamond cutting industry was largely in the hands of Jews in Lisbon. The gem-cutting processes were not greatly modified for many years after Shakespeare's death, so that a representation of the wheel and mill used in 1750 gives a fairly good general idea of the _modus operandi_. The large wooden wheel, whose axis is the second pillar within the frame, is...", "...mistaken about the child.\" \"I may have said that for a purpose. You got the soft side of me yesterday, and---- But I tell you I haven't made up my mind.\" \"You haven't altered your opinion about my being an honourable man and wishing to do the right thing, I hope?\" and I did my best to draw a vivid picture of my state of mind and appeal to her good nature. This appeared to have a softening effect; but not enough for the purpose. \"Why does one day make such a difference?\" \"Every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> makes a difference, Anna.

Then it was left dangling against the closed port, leaving me to infer that she was reading the hasty note.

There was no time to do otherwise, and I released my grasp of the rope, letting it drop silently into the water. I had barely turned my back to the rail when Henley emerged within six feet of me. For an instant his gaze was forward, and then, as his eyes accustomed themselves to the darkness, he turned slightly and perceived me, peering at me in uncertainty. \"Who is this? Oh, you, Craig,\" he questioned sharply. \"Not asleep yet?\" \"Not even drowsy,\" I...", "...own veins. But he succeeded only in part. Sand was already in the air. There was reverberation, rhythm, measure; there was almost the breaking of the stream into great syllables. But was it due, this strange reverberation, to the countless particles of sand meeting in mid-air about him, or--to larger bodies, whose surfaces caught this friction of the sand and threw it back against his ears? The wind, now rising, brought particles that stung his face and hands, and filled his eyes with a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> fine dust that partially veiled the moonlight. But was not something larger, vaster these particles composed now also on the way? Movement and sound and flying sand thus merged themselves more and more in a single, whirling torrent.

This action is of great importance whether the metal is to be used as cast iron or is to be converted into wrought iron or steel. In the former case there is no later chance to remove sulphur, a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> quantity of which does great harm by leading to the formation of cementite instead of graphite and ferrite, and thus making the cast-iron castings too hard to be cut to exact shape with steel tools; in the latter case the converting or purifying processes, which are essentially oxidizing ones, though they remove the other impurities, carbon, silicon, phosphorus and manganese, are not well adapted to desulphurizing, which needs rather deoxidizing conditions, so as...", "...and make him pay a good price for it. Johnny was a big man, whose head was very bald; therefore he wore a red curly wig to cover his baldness and make him look younger. When he got to the brook he saw no one about, and so he hid in a clump of bushes. After a time the little man woke up, and in looking around for the drake he saw Johnny's red wig sticking out of the top of the bushes. \"That is surely the drake,\" he thought, \"for I can see a curl and something red;\" and the next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> \"bang!\" went the gun, and Johnny Sprigg gave a great yell and jumped out of the bushes. As for his beautiful wig, it was shot right off his head, and fell into the water of the brook a good ten yards away! \"What are you trying to do?\" he cried, shaking his fist at the little man. \"Why, I was only shooting at the drake,\" replied Jimson; \"and I hit it, too, for there it is in the water.\" \"That's my wig, sir!\" said Johnny Sprigg, \"and you shall pay for it, or I'll have the...", "...strong.

Before he had gone far the main body in the watercourse, surprised at the sudden withdrawal of the greater portion of the English force, and missing the presence of Clive himself, began to lose heart. They no longer replied energetically to the fire of the French infantry. A movement of retreat began, the fire ceased, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two they would have broken in flight. At this moment, Clive returned. As he moved forward, he had marked the dying away of the English fire, and guessing what had happened, had given over the command of the column to Lieutenant Keene, the senior officer, and hurried back to the watercourse. He arrived there just as the troops had commenced to run away. Throwing himself among them, with shouts and exhortations, he succeeded in arresting their flight; and, by assurances...", "...idea of his character. He would rejoice and triumph to do so! Oh, the bitterness of it! It overwhelmed him so that the little matter of getting into his bunk without being seen by the officer in charge was utterly overlooked by him. Perhaps some good angel arranged the way for him so that he was able to slip past the guards without being challenged. Two of the guards were talking at the corner of the barracks with their backs to him at the particular second when he came in sight. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later they turned back to their monotonous march and the shadow of the vanishing corporal had just disappeared from among the other dark shadows of the night landscape. Inside the barracks another guard welcomed him eagerly without questioning his presence there at that hour: \"Say, Cam, how about day after to-morrow? Are you free? Will you take my place on guard? I want to go up to Philadelphia and see my girl, and I'm sure of a pass, but I'm listed for guard duty. I'll do the...", "...he now gently drew off hers, and the two warm hands clasped. \"Here's our everlasting friendship,\" he said, with a little thrill in his low voice. \"Nothing shall come between us except--love.\" \"Jimps!

Is it your desire for liberty?\" \"No.\" \"Is it--_another man_?\" As he spoke he saw in her eyes that he had guessed the truth. For a full <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he sat there like a statue, one arm extended on the table, the bony hand clenched. After a long while he lifted his head and turned upon her a visage terrifying in its pallour and rigidity. \"Is it--Guild?\" he asked with an effort. \"Kurt!\" \"_Is_ it?\" The heavy colour suddenly flooded his face; lie drew a deep, sharp breath. \"Is he still in this neighbourhood?

There was also a hamper containing extra clothes for Aunt Betty, Dorothy and Molly. It was two sleepy-eyed girls who came slowly down the back stairway to eat hominy, biscuits and coffee, prepared by Chloe and Dinah in the big kitchen--sleepy-eyed, because the chums had lain awake more than half the night talking over old times. Molly's trip to California had been told of to the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> detail, and at the end of the discourse Dorothy had started on her adventures at Oak Knowe. Then to sleep at half past one, to rise at four! It was no wonder Dorothy said, as they entered the kitchen: \"I feel like the last rose of summer.

To transport this mountain of potential destruction required 240 trains, each carrying 200 tons of projectiles.

The batteries would fire a round per gun per <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> for days on end, the gunners working in shifts, two hours on and two hours off. So thickly did the shells fall upon the German lines that the British observing officers were frequently unable to spot their own bursts.

As guns firing with such rapidity wear out their tubes and their springs in a few days, it is necessary to rush entire batteries to the...", "...off, and would have gone on to console the son; but just then I beheld Sheytan approaching with a broken head-rope.

He returned in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, white, scared, and breathless. Pulling his moustache fiercely, he made a gallant effort to compose himself; but when he spoke, his voice was so changed, Tom looked with surprise in his face. \"You saw it too, Tom!\" he said at last, in a hoarse whisper. \"Saw it!--saw what?\" repeated Tom, with an admirable assumption of ignorance, innocence, and dismay. \"Saw Lady Bearwarden in that cab with Dick Stanmore!\" answered his lordship, steadying himself bravely like a good...", "...My voice trembles at his delay, but I fear betraying my anxiety by renewed questioning. He passes me, and I feel sick with disappointment. Now he pauses. \"Aleck,\" he calls, \"I mislaid a letter for you yesterday. Here it is.\" With shaking hand I unfold the sheet. In a fever of hope and fear, I pore over it in the solitude of the cell. My heart palpitates violently as I scan each word and letter, seeking hidden meaning, analyzing every flourish and dash, carefully distilling the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> lines, fusing the significant dots into the structure of meaning. Glorious! A house has been rented--28 Sterling Street--almost opposite the gate of the south wall. Funds are on hand, work is to begin at once! With nimble step I walk the range.

Perhaps within a month, or two at most, the tunnel will be...", "...anything to tell me?\" \"No, sir, I have not; it's all true. I got awful mad, and I said mad things. I--I did worse than that.\" Tip's voice sank to a solemn whisper. Mr. Holbrook, too, was silent and sad; at last he said,-- \"What, Edward! do you mean to give up, and go back to the old life?\" And he remembered, years after, just how painfully his heart throbbed while he waited for Tip's answer; it was prompt and plain: \"No, sir; God wouldn't even let me do that.\" And then for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Mr. Holbrook did not speak for very thankfulness, that, through all this maze of sin, God was leading Tip into the light again. \"Do you feel that you have God's forgiveness?\" he asked, speaking gently. \"Yes, sir.\" Tip could not give very long answers that evening. \"Why were you so quiet to-night in prayer-meeting?\" \"Because,\" said Tip, speaking low, \"I was ashamed to say anything before you or Mr. Burrows or the boys, after what happened today.\" \"More ashamed with us...", "...does the leg.

After a week of checking and reconditioning the _Space Devil_ in the wild Venusian jungles, Roger had become more and more disgusted with himself. Being a wanted spaceman had had its disadvantages on Spaceman's Row, but working in the steaming jungles, fighting deadly reptiles and insects, with Loring and Mason on his neck every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> had soured his appetite for adventure. Several times, when Roger had suggested a certain part be replaced, Loring and he had argued violently, and Roger had threatened to quit. Now, after the long tedious trip through space, Roger's relationship with the others was more strained than ever. The sure dependability of Tom on the control deck and Astro on the power deck made the work of Loring and Mason sloppy by comparison. Once, when Roger had been on radar watch, while the ship...", "...reporter. \"Run!\" exclaimed Pencroft. And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot from whence the cries proceeded. They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being, apparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm. To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch Herbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> for Pencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the reporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster's resistance he was firmly tied so that he could not even move. \"You are not hurt, Herbert?\" asked Spilett. \"No, no!\" \"Oh, if this ape had wounded him!\" exclaimed Pencroft. \"But he is not an ape,\" answered Herbert. At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being who lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it...", "...is like this little portion you see. But it is not all the same. There are great rivers which you cannot cross by swimming; mountains you cannot climb; forests you cannot penetrate--dark, and inhabited by dangerous beasts, and so vast that all this space your eyes look on is a mere speck of earth in comparison.\" She listened excitedly. \"Oh, do you know all that?\" she cried, with a strangely brightening look; and then half turning from me, she added, with sudden petulance: \"Yet only a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> ago you knew nothing of the world--because it is so large! Is anything to be gained by speaking to one who says such contrary things?\" I explained that I had not contradicted myself, that she had not rightly interpreted my words. I knew, I said, something about the principal features of the different countries of the world, as, for instance, the largest mountain ranges, and rivers, and the cities. Also something, but very little, about the tribes of savage men. She heard me...", "...I can do for you,\" he said at last. \"You know Father Dollier de Casson?\" To her assent, he added: \"Then go to him. Ask no questions. If anything can be done, he may do it for you; that he will I do not know.\" She could not solve the riddle, but she must work it out. There was the one great fact: her husband had escaped. \"You will do all you can do, your excellency?\" she said. \"Indeed, madame, I have done all I can,\" he said. With impulse she caught his hand and kissed it. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> afterwards she was gone with Maurice Joval, who had orders to bring her to the abbe's house--that, and no more. The governor, left alone, looked at the hand that she had kissed and said: \"Well, well, I am but a fool still. Yet--a woman in a million!\" He took out his watch. \"Too late,\" he added. \"Poor lady!\" A few minutes afterwards Jessica met the abbe on his own doorstep. Maurice Joval disappeared, and the priest and the woman were alone together. She told him what had...", "...Well, they went into the service, and both of her older boys were very, very fine boys.

His father never did care to see the child, the way I understand it, and at 18 I think he quit supporting him, or something like that.

And still the adjutant came not. Two, three hours elapsed beyond the appointed time. Noon approached; each <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> seemed an eternity. At last hoofs clattered in the court. Hasty steps and jingling spurs were heard upon the stairs. All eyes were fixed upon the door.... It opened, the adjutant appeared, pale, dusty, exhausted, the sweat streaming over his face. \"Remain without!\" cried the bridegroom. \"You bring a message of death--enter not here!\" \"No message of death do I bring,\" replied the officer hoarsely, \"but a hundred times worse.

I thought mebbe you'd read a wee bit more to me. _Willie Reilly_, it was.\" \"I'll get it for you,\" John replied, going to the door. He called to his mother, and she told him that she had brought the book downstairs with her. \"Wait a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and I'll fetch it,\" she said. She returned in a moment or two, carrying the book in her hand, and mounted half-way up the staircase to meet him. She pointed to a place in the book. \"I read up to there to him in the night,\" she said. John looked at his mother, as he took the book from her hands, and saw how tired she looked. \"Did you not get any sleep at all, ma?\" he asked with concern. \"I'm all right, son,\" she answered. \"No, you're not,\" he insisted. \"You'll just go to...", "...improvements as most people would concur in.\" Any impression, however, which I might have made soon faded away, the Society within three weeks again urging their plan, under the erroneous notion that they had found an answer to my objection, and pressing me to undertake it, \"as the only man capable of giving it effect.\" Of course I could only point out the error and decline their request. \"_August 7th._--Summoned to the Treasury.

The name of Bayard was well known among us, belonging to a family of which there were several branches spread through the Middle States, as far south as Delaware; but I did not happen to know a single individual of them all. What, then, could my return have to do with the smiles or frowns of any of the name of Bayard? It was natural enough, after ruminating a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two on the subject, that I should utter some of my ideas, on such a subject, to my companion. \"What could the old woman mean, Kate,\" I abruptly commenced, \"by saying there would now be light hearts and happy ones among the Bayards?\" \"Poor Mrs. Light is a great gossip, Mordaunt, and it may be questioned if she know her own meaning half the time.

She half rose from her chair, and then dropped back again, still faintly smiling, while the light which only one man's coming can kindle upon any woman's face shone upon hers, erasing all weariness and bitterness while it lingered. At the opening of the door she turned without rising. \"So you have come after all! But I knew you would. Sit down a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and wait while I finish this tiresome letter.

Her own face reflected in a wavering image, sometimes shaped itself to her gaze in the likeness of the pale lady of her childhood, who seemed to look up at her from the waters with dark, mysterious eyes of tender longing. Once or twice this dreamy effect grew so vivid that she shivered, and drawing herself up from the water, tried to take an interest in a very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> account which Mrs. Kittridge was giving of the way to make corn-fritters which should taste exactly like oysters. The closing direction about the quantity of mace Mrs. Kittridge felt was too sacred for common ears, and therefore whispered it into Mrs. Pennel's bonnet with a knowing nod and a look from her black spectacles which would not have been bad for a priestess of Dodona in giving out an oracle.

Her vision blurred, and her breath came in short gasps. \"Dolly\" had now slowed down to a walk, but to Mary this was the wildest of gaits.

In seizing it, however, the alternatives were difficult. She was without a cent, a shelter, a job, a friend, or the prospect of a meal. It was probable that there was not at that <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in New York a human being so destitute. Before nightfall she would have to find some nominal motive for living or be arrested as a vagrant. She was not appalled. For the first time in her life she was relatively free from fear.

The word \"embryo\" is a valuable one to use later, and its precise meaning can easily be fixed by always calling the young plant tucked away in the seed the embryo. The difficulty of learning new words does not lie in their length, but in not knowing what they mean. A child who has been to the circus...", "...<plw><b>Particularities</b></plw> (#). [Cf.

Finally, when my patience was well-nigh exhausted,--for the afternoon was wearing away and I had some distance to walk,--a swift flew past me from behind, and, with none of that poising over the entrance such as is commonly seen when a swift goes down a chimney, went straight into the trunk. In half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or less he reappeared without a sound, and was out of sight in a second. Then I picked up my rubber coat, and with a blessing on the wren and the tanager, and a malediction on the mosquitoes (so unjust does self-interest make us), started homeward.

For a moment there was some hesitation, for the rule of the Church in favour of unanimity was absolute; but the Apostle fixed his piercing eyes on Job Grimshaw, and after a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or so Job Grimshaw too rose slowly, like one compelled by an unseen power, and cast in his vote grudgingly with the rest.

Still our brave captain did not despair, and promised that, should the ice open again, it would not be his fault if the ship failed to make her way through it. The object of the voyage, for the time, was entirely forgotten, all we thought of was to effect our escape. Never for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> night or day was the crow's nest empty, some one being always on the look-out to report the state of the ice. I frequently went aloft.

When the man who accompanied him came back, he brought the doctor's favorite student, who had directions to devote himself to the 'case,' in which the doctor took so strong an interest. The good man had another motive. He believed the fever was about to attack Joel, and he determined to exert his skill to save him, if possible. To have advised him of his fears, would have been injudicious. He therefore dispatched a young man in whom he had great confidence, after giving him <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> instructions. Little Sarah, watched and tended with great care, grew rapidly better. But when the excitement produced by the scenes through which Joel had passed was at an end, a great reaction took place, which left him in a very weak state.

Quivering, throbbing with the tremendous effort, she dashed on, the water climbing her sides and lashing to spume at her stern. \"Time!\" shouted several together, as the second pair of posts came in line, marking the finish of the mile. The word was passed to the frantically struggling firemen and engineers below, while those on deck compared watches. \"One <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and thirty-two seconds,\" said one. \"Right,\" answered the others.

These solar days and hours and minutes are therefore a little longer than the corresponding sidereal ones, and this furnishes the explanation why the stars come to the meridian a little earlier, by solar time, every night than on the night before, and why sidereal time gains steadily upon solar time, this gain amounting to approximately 3m. 56.5s. per...", "...published! Vella had the adroitness to change the Arabic MSS. he possessed, which entirely related to Mahomet, to matters relative to Sicily; he bestowed several weeks' labour to disfigure the whole, altering page for page, line for line, and word for word, but interspersed numberless dots, strokes, and flourishes; so that when he published a fac-simile, every one admired the learning of Vella, who could translate what no one else could read.

Everything prospered about him, except his eye, which some thought was not so bad neither.

Suddenly a trap appeared in the road in front of them, and the driver, seeing the runaway, set his horses at right angles to the road. It served the purpose only to provide another danger. Not far from where the trap was drawn, and between it and the runaway, was a lane, which ended at a farmyard in a cul-de-sac. The horse swerved into it, not slacking its pace, and in the fraction of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> came to the farmyard. But now the fever was in Lali's blood. She did not care whether she lived or died. A high hedge formed the cul-de-sac. When she saw the horse slacking she cut it savagely across the head twice with a whip, and drove him at the green wall. He was of too good make to refuse it, stiff as it was. He rose to it magnificently, and cleared it; but almost as he struck the ground squarely, he staggered and fell--the girl beneath him.

It would be best to settle it at once--the sooner the better. He went to his desk and took out a telegraph blank. He addressed it to Phyllis, pondered a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in a great hush in the storm, and wrote, \"I am sure now. May I come?

It was a chance if the line was not out of business, but he lifted the receiver and listened to the thump of his heart as he waited.

I anticipated a pleasant walk home, but was somewhat alarmed when heavy wind and drift came down from the direction of the Hutton Cliffs.

It was amazing suddenly to walk out of the wall of drift into light airs at Little Razorback Island. One <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> it was blowing and drifting hard and I could see almost nothing, the next it was calm, save for little whirlwinds of snow formed by eddies of air drawn in from the north.

Mr. Robb showed him a slip of paper to be signed by the manager of the branch left and the branch arrived at, also by the transient clerk. This slip records the time to a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and allows no stop-over or visits en route. Neither does it permit of delay in leaving. Evan suddenly decided he would not bother going home. He explained to Watson later that he considered it crooked to tamper with the travel-slip and thought he would be a cad to let the manager run the chance of further incurring head office displeasure by altering it. \"By heck,\" said Bill, \"you've got to let some of that good conscience run out if you ever expect to stay in the...", "...The man hesitated for a moment, but by this time Natalie, accompanied by her mother, had passed through the cool gray archway into the spacious tessellated court, from which rose on each hand a wide marble staircase. \"Will the signorina and the signora her mother condescend to follow me?\" the porter said, leading the way up one of the staircases, the big iron keys still in his hand.

Certainly Monsieur would; and he was ushered into the lift and carried aloft.

A film which occupies a month to photograph, and entails an exposure once every thirty minutes, produces a film only 90 feet in length.

But at first sight the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and a half seems a very slight return for the time and labour expended. This is one of the principal reasons why the professional cinematographer displays a marked aversion to the recording of slow movements.

The kinsman professed to know nothing of the course Bemis had taken, leaving the detectives almost as much in the dark as they were before. Having the Denver name of the man, they were enabled to ascertain something of his conduct while in Denver, to pick up information as to his habits, and to get a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> description of him. They found that he had been \"one of the boys;\" inclined to be a little loose and reckless, and considerably addicted to card playing. While still looking about for information as to the direction the man had taken, they received a note one day from Mr. Nat Hickman, who at that time was a confidential agent of the association, dated at Santa Fe, N. M., and telling them that there was a young stranger in that city going by the name of John L. Jerome, whose...", "...sign on it saying, 'Who threw this brick through our window, and knocked ten per cent. off the price of everything?'\" It sounded silly; but, somehow, it interested me. I think the thing that interested me most was that Jimmie should be looking for some way to turn misfortune into profit. At any rate, I put that sign in the window just as Jimmie suggested, with the added line that, as soon as the window was repaired, prices would go back to normal. I believe that Jimmie spent every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of his spare time out of the store telling people to come and see his big selling idea, for numbers of people said to me, \"Yes, I heard about your window with the brick from your errand boy--smart kid that!\" and then they would grin. It got me some business, and started a lot of talking. I remembered what Barlow had once said: \"Keep them talking about you; and be thankful when people pitch into you. Nobody ever bothers to kick a dead dog.\" I was mighty glad it had not been our...", "...obtained a specimen, and found its stomach crammed full of insects. This bird is smaller than the _U. dumetaria_, and has a much shorter bill; moreover, in flying, the secondary feathers, which are of a brick-red colour, are very conspicuous. Sometimes, when walking over a riddled patch of ground, one heard a curious half-smothered \"took, took,\" not unlike the cry of a ctenomys; and on treading firmly over the place from whence the noise seemed to issue, no sound would be audible for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, when the same noise would go on again from a place a yard or so away. The bird, of course, had moved along, for the tunnels communicate so that it is able to travel underground over a considerable area. The burrows of the ctenomys are larger and otherwise different from those now referred to. At the time of our visit the birds were not at all shy, allowing one to approach within a few yards of them. These are gregarious--at least at this time of the year--moving in...", "...and come down to the _patina_. Your next step must be, to ascertain whether that patina is hard, or soft and friable; in which latter case you will have to use all diligence not to poke your penknife in Crispina's eyeball, nor to wound her husband, with a few days' beard upon his chin. No _healing process_ can help you here to undo your clumsy surgery and want of skill. He will remain _cicatrised_, and she _lippa_ for life. Each separate feature requires renewed care. When your <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> manipulations have brought out the eyeball _unspecked_, then comes the nose; and to remove the closely sticking plaster from its side, and expose uninjured the curling nostril underneath, requires more than Taliacotian sleight of hand to manage properly. You must not trifle with Faustina's _hair_, nor with Philip's _beard_. The \"_flava coma_,\" which we do not consider as ornamental at any time, looks far worse in _brass_ than in _golden_ tresses.

Seeing the dog-fox thus surrounded by vixen and cubs was too much for Mr. Tebrick; in spite of all his philosophy a pang of jealousy shot through him. He could see that Silvia had been hunting with her cubs, and also that she had forgotten that he would come that morning, for she started when she saw him, and though she carelessly licked his hand, he could see that her thoughts were not with him. Very soon...", "...he was about he had seized her by the waist and lifted her down. She stood on the grass beside him and surveyed him with amazed eyes. \"Well!\" she said. \"It was by far the easier way,\" he excused himself. \"I have a couple of chairs fixed up under the trees. It's jolly and cool in the garden.\" He led her to the spot he had selected and settled her in one of the two canvas chairs, which faced towards a little arbour covered with a pale, cool-looking creeper with long sprays of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> white blossoms thrusting out between the leaves. The chairs had been placed at the end of the roughly made path, and stood side by side with their backs towards the house. Esme dropped into one, and looked about her with lazy satisfaction. It was restful out here under the trees, and strangely quiet. The hum of the bees sounded reposeful in the sunny stillness. She felt very tired, and was glad to sit still. She did not want to talk. But it was not possible to sit in...", "...some twelve summers. This lady, having gathered, from George's conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight's trip on a steamboat. George's chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him. \"Do you know,\" said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \"of any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\" \"There is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my...", "...been kept so long at it without a change; better than the faithful Serang, whom he had brought over from his last ship to keep the captain's watch; better than he himself, who had been her captain for the last three years only.

Swiftly, his eyes went to number eight. \"No. 8. October Copley.\" That was the entry. A full <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> passed before he stooped and recovered the memorandum book which had slipped from his grasp, together with the second telegram. He shook his head impatiently in an effort to clear it of the stupor which numbed his brain. Why should he be affected like this? he demanded angrily of himself. What was there here that couldn't be explained in the light of facts already known? It was no news to him now that Ocky was aiding Janet to escape the consequences of her crime, and it was...", "...be here, and I am to take you home, if you will do me the honor to come in my carriage.\" \"But I ought not to be tracked,\" said Violet, with the quick petulance which already was music for David. \"There is the question of tea and dinner,\" remarked Van Hupfeldt. \"If a lady will not eat, she must expect to be plagued.\" \"I prefer to walk home.\" \"That couldn't be done; it is too far,\" said Van Hupfeldt. \"Oh, come, come!\" he went on pleadingly, with a fond gaze into her eyes. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> afterward they left the grave together. Van Hupfeldt, as he passed David on the path, frowned momentarily; Violet slightly inclined her head. He looked after them, and admitted to himself that they made a handsome pair, tall, like children of the gods. But three yards away after they had passed him something fell from Violet--a card--whether by accident or design David did not know; but the thought that it might be by design sent a thrill through his frame. He picked it up. It...", "...is not a part of that organ. The Pineal Body (Epiphysis)--a still smaller structure, located within the brain substance, having, however, no relationship to the brain. This gland has only lately acquired a significance. Descartes thought it the seat of the soul because it is situated in the middle of the brain. The Thyroid gland, a somewhat larger body, situated in the front of the neck, just beneath the larynx. We shall deal with this in some detail later on. The Parathyroids, <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> organs, four in number, just behind the thyroid. The Thymus, a gland placed just within the thorax, which reaches its maximum size at birth and then gradually recedes until at twenty it has almost disappeared. The Adrenal glands, one on each side of the body, above and adjacent to the kidney. These glands, which are each made up of two opposing structures, stand in intimate relation to the sympathetic nervous system and secrete a substance called adrenalin. The Sex...", "...In one of the latest examples, the inner splint-bone, answering to the second metacarpal of the pentadactyle foot, supported phalanges and a terminal hoof resembling the corresponding one in hipparion. And the pairing of horses with the meterpodials bearing, according to type, phalanges and hoofs might restore the race of hipparions. Now, the fact suggesting such possibility teaches that the change would be sudden and considerable; it opposes the idea that species are transmuted by <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and slow degrees. It also shows that a species might originate independently of the operation of any external influence; that change of structure would precede that of use and habit; that appetency, impulse, ambient medium, fortuitous fitness of surrounding circumstances, or a personified \"selecting nature\" would have had no share in the transmutative act. Thus I have been led to recognise species as exemplifying the continuous operation of natural law, or secondary cause; and...", "...a trace of precious metal, and next to no trace of bronze has been discovered. Fire at Knossos was accompanied by plunder, and the plundering was thorough. A few scraps of gold-leaf, and the little deposit of bronze vessels that had been preserved from the plunderers by the fact that the floor of the room in which they were found had sunk in the ruin of the conflagration, are evidences, better than absolute barrenness would have been, to the fact that the place was pillaged with <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> thoroughness, and the unfinished stone jar in the sculptor's workshop tells its own tale of a sudden summons from peaceful and happy toil to the stern realities of warfare. The evidence from Phaestos and Hagia Triada tallies with that from Knossos. Everywhere there are the traces of fire on the walls, and a sudden interruption of quiet and luxurious life. The very stone lamps still stand in the rooms at Hagia Triada, and on the stairs of the Basilica at Knossos, as they stood...", "...the loveliness and blessings around?\" \"The height of ingratitude, dear Louis,\" said Hamilton, emphatically. \"But I am sure you understand me.\" \"To be sure,\" said Louis. \"Many good gifts our Almighty Father has given us, and one perfect gift, and the good gifts should lead us to think more of the perfect ONE.

Those filaments which are situated on the margin of the leaf are longest, and spread outwards, while the others are erect and decrease in length from the edge towards the middle. Each filament is swollen at its extremity, and supports an enticing globule of glistening fluid which it secretes, for the enlarged extremity is really a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> gland. The fluid, though quite clear, is so viscid that it can be drawn out into threads, and it serves a purpose similar to that of the sticky globules on the spiral thread of a spider's web. If some grains of sand or other inorganic material be sprinkled on the leaf, the sticky secretion of the glands is appreciably increased, and at the same time assumes an acid character; but it contains no digestive ferment, nor do the filaments change their position to any considerable...", "...before she set sail. She had to meet Dr Justin face-to-face, and give him his answer. She was not many minutes in his company, but they were full of pain to her. Strangely enough, she caught her first glimpse of him from a window, as she had done that day in Eastwood from Miss Abby's room; and, more strangely still, he was walking as he had been walking that day, by Miss Avery's side, looking down upon her, while she, with smiles and pretty eager gestures, looked up at him.

She listened till she heard them enter the house; and, when she knew them to be safe in the parlour, she went softly downstairs and out into the street; and, though she felt a...", "...to the old hunter, who was standing by a dead tree--a small one, lying on the ground. \"Try that one,\" he said. The boy struck it with the ax and it showed up alive with beetles and grubs and honeycombed with galleries. \"Gee,\" said the boy, \"that's a bad one.\" \"That's very like the way I found the other,\" said the old hunter; \"one very bad one lyin' on the ground an' just a few around it bad, while just a short distance away there was no signs.\" He stood and thought for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, but aside from the coincidence, Wilbur could not see that there was anything strange in that. They worked busily for a few moments, girdling the infected trees, and also girdling some small useless trees near by, because, as the hunter explained, when the beetles flew out seeking a new tree to destroy, they would prefer one that was dying, as a tree from which all the bark has been cut away all round always does, and then these trees could be burned. \"Have you noticed...", "...room.\" \"Have you ever seen him before?\" I asked. \"Never to my recollection.\" \"Neither have I,\" remarked the concierge. \"He seemed very afraid of being seen. I noticed him in the lounge last night.

A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later, after exchanging a few words in Spanish, he turned to me, saying: \"You will find the manager's office on the first floor. If you take the lift the man will direct you, senor.\" A few minutes later I was seated in the office of an elderly bald-headed man, a typical _hotelier_, courteous, smiling, and eager to hear any complaint that I might have to make. At once I told him of my curious adventure of the previous night, and of the sudden flight of the mysterious...", "...room, and his groans of agony reached me through the thin panels of the locked door. I stumbled up-stairs. On the landing I met George. His hair was ruffled; his eyes red and sunk into his head. He had evidently been crying--crying, hard man that he was, until his eyelids were swelled and blistered. \"So you have come, Rose,\" he said; \"that is well. You will put everything right, of course?\" \"You have seen Mr Gray, too,\" I whispered. \"Yes, yes; for God's sake don't lose a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in putting things straight.\" \"But can I?\" I whispered back. \"Even money cannot always, always save.\" \"You can but try,\" retorted George. \"Go and speak to the doctors. Our mother's life depends on your actions I am firmly convinced. Here is Dr Johnson. Will you talk to my sister, doctor?\" The family physician motioned me into a spare bedroom. He introduced me to the London doctor, and they began a semi-technical explanation of my mother's case. \"Things are bad,...", "...dresses--a blue gingham which she often wore and which her uncle loved.

His breech-clout caught in a rocky projection, causing the body to hang headlong against the side of the cliff. His rifle fell from his nerveless hands, clattering and breaking on the rocks below.

It was evident that Madge had determined to make his life miserable if it could be done, and when Nick recalled the substance of the letter she had sent him he decided in his own mind that the bullet had not really been intended to take his life, but only to warn him of the dangers that were hovering over him every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that he lived. In the meantime--or, rather, during the time that has already been mentioned--the detective and his assistants had not been idle. There had not been a day or a night when he and Chick and Patsy and Ten-Ichi had not been engaged in searching some part of the city for Black Madge, or for some trace of her. They had visited the dens in the lower part of the city; they had questioned the policemen and the stool pigeons of the detective bureau, and they had even...", "...knew no Castilian, in spite of the fact that I was even then addressing him with unhesitating glibness. Motioning to me to be seated, he raced away into the depths of the fonda calling for \"Pasquale.\" That youth soon appeared, in tuxedo and dazzling expanse of shirt-front, extolling as he came the uncounted virtues of his house, in a flowing, unblushing imitation of French. Among those things that I had not come to Spain to hear was Spanish mutilation of the Gaelic tongue. For a long <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> I gazed at the speaker with every possible evidence of astonishment. Then turning to the landlord I inquired in most solemn Castilian. \"Esta loco, senor? Is he insane that he jabbers such a jargon?\" \"Como, senor!\" gasped Pasquale in his own tongue. \"You are not then a Frenchman?\" \"Frenchman, indeed!\" I retorted. \"Yo, senor, soy americano.\" \"Senor!\" cried the landlord, bowing profoundly, \"I ask your pardon on bended knee.

Did you see that, Mr. Knapp?\" The question was so sudden and so sharp that the detective came near replying to it; but he bethought himself, and said nothing. \"That settles which of the two gnawed the loaf,\" continued Sweetwater. The next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he was hovering over the still more pathetic figure of John, sitting in the chair. \"Sad! Sad!\" he murmured. Suddenly he laid his finger on a small rent in the old man's faded vest. \"You saw this, of course,\" said he, with a quick glance over his shoulder at the silent detective. No answer, as before. \"It's a new slit,\" declared the officious youth, looking closer, \"and--yes--there's blood on its edges.

Both of them make rapid dashes to the rail, and nervously scan the river for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and then return to some occupation, only to dash from it to the rail again. During breakfast their conduct is nerve-shaking. Hastily taking a few mouthfuls, the Captain drops his knife and fork and simply hurls his seamanlike form through the nearest door out on to the deck.

Then for some reason her thoughts travelled away to William Menire, and the memory of her brother's words, \"William is very sensitive where you are concerned,\" brought a warm rush of colour to her cheeks. Why should William be so sensitive where she was concerned? Why should he be so shy and diffident when in her presence? Why was he ever so ready to sing the praises of his cousin?

I will now give my reason for choosing Bromine as a combination. The study of mineral waters is an old pet of mine; many of them contain Arsenic in combination with Bromine, and are all well known for their roborating and alterating qualities. I begun, therefore, my experiments with <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> doses of _Brom. arsen._; gradually these were increased, and I felt astonished what large doses were well borne, and how long I could use this preparation without injurious consequences. After a few drops of my solution I could prove Arsenic in all secretions, an experiment easily made by Marsh's test. Experiments on animals with toxic doses of either solution (Clemens and Fowler) showed that the same quantity _Arsenicum brom._ is less poisonous (one has to be careful with the...", "...and fold it over.

At last, in a momentary pause, she faltered out a leading remark in such a low voice that no one attended to it. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later, she tried again,--\"I hope Captain Du Meresq is better.\" \"How red you have got, 'Boobell!'\" said Freddy. \"Look, mamma!\" \"What did you say, my dear--Bertie? Oh, yes, he is very lame still; but he was obliged to go yesterday.\" The sudden colour left Bluebell's cheek, and she sat for some minutes in a relaxed, drooping attitude, oblivious of all around, till becoming sensible of Cecil's gaze rivetted on her.

For some reason I thought there was something wrong in here.\" \"Want me to scream?\" smiled Helen. \"I can do a good job of that and I guarantee to get someone here in less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> with one scream.\" In spite of the banter Janet was far from reassured for a feeling of unrest had settled down upon her.

Perhaps without that fear upon us we might have reached the house, but as it was we felt as one feels in a nightmare, unable to run though in an agony of terror. Getting over the wall was the worst, for there Hugh stumbled badly, and I had to turn and help him, watching the man bounding ever nearer, signing to us to stay for him. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later, as we slipped and stumbled through the scrub of the wood, we heard him close behind us, crying to us in a smothered voice to stop. We ran on, terrified; and then Hugh's foot caught in a briar, so that he fell headlong with a little cry.

He was tired and sleepy, so he went into the log to bed, and for an hour he never stirred. They were becoming anxious, for the light soon would be gone, and they had so wanted to try for the picture. At last Little Chicken lifted his head, opened his beak, and gaped widely. He dozed a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two more. The Angel said that was his beauty sleep. Then he lazily gaped again and stood up, stretching and yawning. He ambled leisurely toward the gateway, and the Angel said: \"Now, we may have a chance, at last.\" \"I do hope so,\" shivered Freckles. With one accord they arose to their knees and trained their eyes on the mouth of the log. The light was full and strong. Little Chicken prospected again with no results.

Under this modest title, the American public is presented with a work of uncommon research, and of great practical utility and value. Its author is well known as a skilful and most successful inventor, in whose admirable power-looms nearly all the carpets of the world are now woven. On the subject of manufactures few can speak with more authority, whether in reference to its general bearings or its <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details. The work before us affords ample proof of his ability to discuss one of the most important questions in political economy. The hundred pages of text are followed by two hundred and thirty-four pages of tabular statistics. This large and well-arranged body of invaluable information, though styled an appendix, was, in fact, the precursor of the argument, and constitutes the solid base on which it rests. These tables are \"not mere copies or abstracts, but the result of...", "...she could not. Well, Janet, I may as good confess that there is something wrong that she does not like to speak of yet.

On his return to Paris he resumed his administrative work, literary recreations and historical researches. While spending a part of his time writing vaudevilles and comic operas, he began to collect old essays and rare pamphlets by old French historians. His office was preserved to him by the Restoration, and Leber put his literary gifts at the service of the government. When the question of the coronation of Louis XVIII. arose, he wrote, as an answer to Volney, a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> treatise on the _Ceremonies du sacre_, which was published at the time of the coronation of Charles X. Towards the end of Villele's ministry, when there was a movement of public opinion in favour of extending municipal liberties, he undertook the defence of the threatened system of centralization, and composed, in answer to Raynouard, an _Histoire critique du pouvoir municipal depuis l'origine de la monarchie jusqu'a nos jours_ (1828). He also wrote a treatise entitled _De...", "...of her faithlessness now wrought upon him in the office of Death, to let him know what he had lost. It magnified her beauty in his eyes, her gentleness, her grace; and he thought with a pang how little he had made of her or it.

For by law the child was his, whoever might be the father of it. During a whole <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he felt on the point of tying a stone about its neck, carrying it out, and throwing it into the river Lea. Then, with the laugh of a hyena, he set about arranging in his mind the proofs of her guilt.

The babe, in this case, was conveyed to the church in a grand procession. The mayor and other civic authorities in London came down to Greenwich in barges, tastefully ornamented, to join in the ceremony. The lords and ladies of King Henry's court were also there, in attendance at the palace. When all were assembled, and every thing was ready, the procession moved...", "...knowing the real reason why. It is the same, too, with the lower animals. They know nothing of the matter either, but this does not prevent their having a natural relish for salt, as any one will tell you who has the charge of cattle; for their stomachs require for their cooking the very same seasoning as our own, and therefore their porter above has received the same orders. Salt is not the only thing, however, that exists in that liquid in the stomach. Learned men, after making <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> researches, have found in it another equally powerful material, which is also found in milk. Therefore cheese, which contains this material as well as salt, is quite in its place at the end of dinner. It furnishes reinforcements for the stomach in cooking, and this is why you so often hear people say that a little cheese helps the digestion. The _digestion_! Yes, that is the word I ought to have begun with. It is the real name of all this cooking; an operation after which I...", "...first rays of the silver moon fell athwart the chamber. Christopher felt that the dead silence of the house betokened the coming of the crisis in the play, and he was strung to the expectation of something out of the common. Watching from his own dark standing-place, he could see the actor draw towards him a violin case, and he silently drew forth his own instrument to be in readiness. Whilst he waited and watched, Carl's stealthy footstep sounded behind him. 'You will see her in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two,' whispered Carl. 'I will touch you once, when you shall make ready, and once when you shall begin.' For half a minute or nearly, everything was still on the stage and in the house. Then the player's voice, passionate and low, broke again upon the silence, and in a second or two Carl touched Christopher upon the shoulder. There was a curiously _crisp_ feeling in the-composer's nerves, and he was a little excited. He tucked his violin under his chin, and stood prepared....", "...Jackson at once! Where is he?\" Harry's manner was enough to impress his comrade, who knew him so well. \"This way,\" he said. \"Not more than four or five hundred yards. There, that's General Jackson's tent!\" Harry leaped from his horse as he came near and made a rush for the tent. The flap was open, but a sentinel who stood in front put up his rifle, and barred the way. A low monotone came from within the tent. \"The General's praying,\" he said. \"I can't let you in for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two.\" Harry took off his hat and stood in silence while the two minutes lasted. All his haste was suddenly gone from him. The strong affection that he felt for Jackson was tinged at times with awe, and this awe was always strongest when the general was praying. He knew that the prayer was no affectation, that it came from the bottom of his soul, like that of a crusader, asking forgiveness for his sins. The monotone ceased, the soldier took down his rifle which was...", "...she is distinguished for her exalted piety and extreme charity. Even when on the stage this lady devoted her leisure to charitable works. She was always remarked for her modesty of manner: her dress was simplicity itself. At the theatre she wore costumes rich and elegant, suited to the parts she enacted, but in society she invariably appeared in plain white muslin or dark silk. It would be impossible to exaggerate her goodness. Her whole life has been passed amongst the poor, in the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> fulfillment of her duties, and on her knees in church. After acting one part of the evening, she would hasten, on the fall of the curtain, to pass the rest of it watching by the bedside of some poor wretch stricken low perhaps by some infectious disease. During the war of 1870, Madame Volnis's conduct was angelical. If there was some awful operation to be performed upon any of the wounded soldiers sent to Nice from the field of battle, it was she who was present, who held the...", "...her from me for her gratitude. LUCIE. Oh, don't be angry. BRIGNAC. Well, if you are able to hear news like this perfectly calmly, you are certainly endowed with unusual self-control. LUCIE. It was the child's innocence that made the thing possible. BRIGNAC. I daresay. Go and tell that to the Chateauneuf people! Besides, if she was so innocent, why didn't you look after her better? LUCIE. But it was _you_ who were always urging her to go to the Bernins. BRIGNAC. In another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> it's going to be all my fault! I was glad she should go to their house because I thought old Bernin might be useful to us. How should I know that the girl couldn't behave herself? LUCIE [_indignantly_] Oh, hush! I tell you Annette is the victim of this wretch. If you are going to do nothing but insult her, we had better stop discussing the matter. BRIGNAC. I'm in a nice fix now! There's nothing left for us but to pack our trunks and be off.

We regret more than words can express that he never enjoyed the felicity of having a Sutler. If one were accessible he should be introduced to him, even now! The impression which seems to be somewhat currently prevalent, in circles usually well informed on financial topics, that many of the largest fortunes of our present era were founded on the war-profits of army Sutlers, is manifestly erroneous. It is at all times easier to get poor in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> than rich in a month, according to one of the wise saws of the transcendental orientals. The wealthy widow who has wasted her substance in riotous trolley parties can verify it. Fortunes have originated in the profits of army contracts, judiciously invested in well-slanted real estate at Pittsburg or Cincinnati. Their inheritors have perhaps reached congress where they speak speeches prescribed for them by a scrivener.

The anchorage lies abreast of the middle Hummock, where the depth is six fathoms, and may be approached by passing round either the north or south end of the island. Some low islets lie a mile and a half off the latter, with a narrow passage between; and a reef extends three quarters of a mile off the north point, which is in latitude 40 degrees 1 <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> South, longitude 3 degrees 27 minutes West of Sydney, or 147 degrees 49 minutes East. It is distant three miles and a half from the nearest point of Flinders, where is situated the settlement of Tasmanian natives. A tide of from half to one knot sets through between, and the flood-stream comes from the northward. The outline of Hummock Island is so remarkable that it cannot fail of being recognised. In thick weather the navigator may know he is approaching this, and the other...", "...lodgings, and took the woman Springate with her, paying the rent which she owed, Wood and Billings also accompanying her; and her chief occupation now was that of collecting the debts due to her husband; by means of which she continued to supply her diabolical assistants with money and clothes. Amongst the incredible numbers of people who resorted to see the head was a poor woman from Kingsland, whose husband had been absent from the very time that the murder was perpetrated. After a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> survey of the head, she believed it to be that of her husband, though she could not be absolutely positive, but her suspicions were so strong, that strict search was made after the body, on a presumption that the clothes might help her to ascertain it. Meanwhile, Mr. Hayes not being visible for a considerable time, his friends could not help making inquiry after him; and a Mr. Ashby, in particular, who had been on the most friendly terms with him, called on Mrs. Hayes, and...", "...added. \"Perhaps he'll tell you.\" Crawshay appeared, hugging his lifebelt, on which he seated himself gingerly. \"Can't imagine what the captain's up to,\" he complained. \"A chap who understands those little flags has just told me that they've threatened to blow us to pieces if we go on.--Here comes another shell!\" he groaned. \"Two to one they've got us this time!--Ugh!\" They all ducked to avoid a shower of spray. When they stood upright again, Katharine studied the newcomer for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> critically. There was a certain air of strain about most of the passengers. Even Jocelyn Thew's firm hand had trembled, a moment ago, as he had lowered his glasses. Crawshay, seated upon his lifebelt, with a mackintosh buttoned around him, his eyeglass firmly adjusted, his mouth querulous, was not exactly an impressive-looking object. Yet she wondered. \"Give me your hand,\" she asked suddenly. He obeyed at once. The fingers were cool and firm. \"Why do you pretend to be...", "...down a little path from some deep woods on the right. A setter dog played in front of him. The man was reading a freshly printed notice. The ink was smeared from handling. The man spelled it out aloud. \"Escaped from the hulks; a dangerous prisoner; a wild American Indian; ten pounds reward,\" and much more of it. All of a sudden the dog stopped; then with a short bark, he sprang forward. At the same instant the gamekeeper dropped the printed notice that had been handed to him but a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> previously by a horseman on the road. Surely he could not be mistaken, something had dodged down behind yonder hedge; and as the setter sprang forward, barking viciously, a strange figure arose, a man with a copper-colored face, and streaming, unkempt, black locks; he wore big gold ear-rings, and he was clad in a torn canvas shirt and trousers, with a sailor's neckerchief around his throat. The dog was bounding forward when suddenly the figure raised its arm. No cricketer that...", "...of the higher clouds. The layer of the atmosphere lying between sea-level and the upper cloud level has certain characteristics that distinguish it from the air above it, and is known as the _troposphere_. The heating of the atmosphere by the sun is the beginning of all weather, and the temperature of the air is the most important weather element. As soon as we begin to study atmospheric temperature, we encounter a paradox. The heat of the air is all derived from the sun (except a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> quantity from the interior of the earth, and an infinitesimal quantity from other heavenly bodies), and it would therefore seem at first glance that the upper layers of the atmosphere should be warmer than the lower. Experience proves the reverse to be the case. A mountain overgrown with tropical vegetation on its lower slopes is, if high enough, crowned with eternal snows. A thermometer carried upward in the air shows under average conditions a fall of temperature of one degree...", "...dull dreary morning, while regarding the silent flowing waters of the dark river and the long unbroken forest frontage, that nature in this region seems to be waiting the long expected trumpet-call of civilization--that appointed time when she shall awake to her duties, as in other portions of the earth. I compared this waiting attitude to the stillness preceding the dawn, before the insect and animal life is astir to fret the air with its murmur, before the day has awakened the million <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> passions of the wilds; at that hour when even Time seems to be drowsy and nodding, our inmost thoughts appear to be loud, and the heart throbs to be clamorous. But when the young day peeps forth white and gray in the East the eyelids of the world lift up. There is a movement and a hum of invisible life, and all the earth seems wakened from its brooding. But withal, the forest world remains restful, and Nature bides her day, and the river shows no life; unlike Rip Van Winkle,...", "...O U... it would be of use there.... What else shall I take? They think I am ill! They don't know that I can walk, ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch there--policemen! What's this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a bottle, cold!\" He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast. But in another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old, ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing sleep. He woke...", "...and we set off. As we went we discussed our next movements, and while we were doing so I idly glanced at the paper I held in my hand. There was a lamp in the cab, and the light showed me on the bottom right-hand corner a round blue india-rubber stamp mark, \"W. E. Maxwell, stationer and newsagent, 23, Ipswell Street, Woolahra.\" \"Stop the cab!\" I almost shouted. \"Tell the man to drive us back to the _Canary Bird_ quickly.\" The order was given, the cab faced round, and in less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> we were on our way back. \"What's up now?\" asked the astonished Inspector. \"Only that I believe I've got a clue,\" I cried. I did not explain any further, and in five minutes we had brought the landlord downstairs again. \"I'm sorry to trouble you in this fashion,\" I cried, \"but life and death depend on it. I want you to let me see No. 5 again.\" He conducted us to the room, and once more the gas was lit. The small strip of envelope lay upon the table just as I had...", "...any results of such comparisons anywhere referred to. But if, for example, it could be shown that in their minute anatomy the tissues of an ape so closely resembled those of a dog on the one hand, and of a man on the other, as that they could not be distinguished by the microscope, the fact would be of the highest importance, and would add enormously to the evidence already adduced to Mr. Darwin who lays much stress upon the close correspondence between the tissues of man and animals in <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> structure, but never tells us that such comparison has been actually made by himself or by others. It is certainly remarkable that a fact which Mr. Darwin evidently considers of vast importance, and which is capable of being easily put to the test of observation, should be stated without the results of a single observation being recorded. Surely an appeal to actual experiment should have been made in at least a few instances, which would illustrate not only the close...", "...want her any more; she could not tell what she had done! The picture was finished, she knew, but Mrs. Dallison had said she was going to paint her again in another picture.... Hilary did not reply. \"....That old gentleman, Mr.--Mr. Stone, had been to see her. He wanted her to come and copy out his book for two hours a day, from four to six, at a shilling an hour. Ought she to come, please? He said his book would take him years.\" Before answering her Hilary stood for a full <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> staring at the fire. The little model stole a look at him. He suddenly turned and faced her. His glance was evidently disconcerting to the girl. It was, indeed, a critical and dubious look, such as he might have bent on a folio of doubtful origin. \"Don't you think,\" he said at last, \"that it would be much better for you to go back into the country?\" The little model shook her head vehemently. \"Oh no!\" \"Well, but why not? This is a most unsatisfactory sort of...", "...he was too late to see them, and he looked as if he knew it. He stared angrily at the girl, but she lifted her chin slightly and refused to admit that he was alive. A very small boy was trying to push a large india-rubber ball into his mouth, but his mouth was not big enough to hold it, and he wept because of his limitations. He was towed along by his sister, a girl so tall that one might say her legs reached to heaven, and maybe they did. He looked again at the hour. It was one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to two o'clock; and then something happened. The whole white world became red. The oldest seas in the world went suddenly lashing into storm. An ocean of blood thundered into his head, and the noise of that primitive flood, roaring from what prehistoric gulfs, deafened him at an instant. The waves whirled his feet from under him. He went foaming up the steps, was swept violently into the ticket office, and was swirled away like a bobbing cork into the train. A guard tried to...", "...are. And why not, I'm asking.\" \"Only that I've a message for the McMurrough it will be well for him to have.\" \"Sure,\" O'Sullivan Og answered, his manner half wheedling, half truculent, \"'tis no time for messages and trifles and the like now, Colonel. No time at all, I tell you. Ye can see that for yourself, I'm thinking, such a morning as this.\" \"I'm thinking nothing of the kind,\" the Colonel answered, and he hung back, looking towards the house. Fortunately Darby chose that <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to appear at the door. The butler's face was pale, and showed fatigue; his hair hung in wisps; his clothes were ill-fastened. He threw a glance of contempt, the contempt of the indoor servant, at the sleeping figures, lying here and there in the wet. Thence his eyes travelled on and took in the group by the gate. He started, and wrung his hands in sudden, irrepressible distress. It was as if a spasm seized the man. The Colonel called him. \"Darby,\" he cried. \"Come here, my...", "...for his services. On the advance of Edward, Margaret escaped to her ships, which were scattered by a tempest, and a portion of her forces, being cast on Holy Island, were pursued and destroyed. For a time the country was comparatively tranquil, and Sir Peter Legh, if he did not turn his sword into a pruning hook, was content to lay it aside and repair to his home at Bradley, where he employed his leisure in adorning his mansion and improving his estate. While so engaged he drew up a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> account of the territorial possessions of the family in Lancashire and Cheshire, which is still preserved among the muniments at Lyme. It is closely written in Latin on vellum, and forms a thick volume of 333 folios.

Out of that room I went into yet another, where a fat woman with a hooked nose was seated holding something white in front of her. I bolted under the thing on which she was seated and lay there. She saw me come and began to shriek also, and presently a most terrible noise arose outside. All the spotted dogs were in the house, baying and barking, and everybody was yelling. Then for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the dogs stopped their clamour, and I heard a great clatter of things breaking and of teeth crunching and of the Red-faced Man shouting-- \"Those cursed brutes are eating the hunt lunch.

Is any one murdering her?\" I suppose that they couldn't get them out, or at least when they did they all came into the other room where I was under the seat on which the fat woman was now...", "...'It is coming this evening,' she said in her mind. A minute later, at the end of the hymn, when the congregation began to move out, Manston came down the aisle. He was opposite the end of her seat as she stepped from it, the remainder of their progress to the door being in contact with each other. Miss Aldclyffe had lingered behind. 'Don't let's hurry,' he said, when Cytherea was about to enter the private path to the House as usual. 'Would you mind turning down this way for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> till Miss Aldclyffe has passed?' She could not very well refuse now. They turned into a secluded path on their left, leading round through a thicket of laurels to the other gate of the church-yard, walking very slowly. By the time the further gate was reached, the church was closed. They met the sexton with the keys in his hand.

In the English method, where necessary, a priming or undercoat is employed. It is customary to fill up any uneven surface, any <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> holes or pores, and to render the surface to be japanned uniformly smooth. But such an undercoat or priming is not always applied, the coloured varnish or a proper japan ground being applied directly on the surface to be japanned. Formerly this surface usually, if not always, received a priming coat, and it does so still where the surface is coarse, uneven, rough, and porous. But where the surface is impervious and smooth, as in the case of metallic surfaces, a priming coat is...", "...chairs, a mantel-piece of solid-looking marble on which were a few somber-looking ornaments, and a marble clock, and in the center of the room, a heavy round mahogany table on which were a few books, and the lamp, which seemed only to show the darkness of the room.

PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION I have gladly used the opportunity afforded by a new edition of this book to give the text a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> revision from beginning to end, and to make numerous changes both in its substance and in its form. During the eleven years that have passed since it first came from the press, considerable additions have been made to our documentary materials for the period covered by it, the most important for our purpose being the publication, for the first time, of the correspondence and the speeches of Patrick Henry and of George Mason, the former with a life, in three volumes, by William...", "...consider themselves as assenting and subscribing to all the mischiefs which Bengal had presented to them for four years past.\"[11] Notwithstanding this solemn declaration, in their letter of 24th December, 1776, they approve the plan of Mr. Hastings, and say, \"that the monopoly, _on its present footing_, can be no considerable grievance to the country,\" &c. This, however, was a rigorous monopoly. The account given of it by General Clavering, Colonel Monson, and Mr. Francis, in their <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of 11th January, 1775, in which the situation of the _molungees_, or persons employed in the salt manufacture, is particularly described, is stated at length in the Appendix. Mr. Hastings himself says, \"The power of obliging molungees to work has been customary from time immemorial.\" Nothing but great and clear advantage to government could account for, and nothing at all perhaps could justify, the revival of a monopoly thus circumstanced. The advantage proposed by its revival...", "...left the office. \"Relative of one of the directors,\" said West quickly; \"and I've noticed several things lately to make me think he does not like us.\" \"Oh, if you come to that,\" said Ingleborough, \"so have I.

In this perplexity he remained till day appeared, that day must advance with his undoing, while _Sylvia_ and _Antonet_ were preparing for the design concluded on the last night. This he heard, and every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that approached gave him new torments, so that now he would have given himself to the Prince of Darkness for a kind disappointment: he was often ready to go and throw himself at her feet, and plead against her enterprise in hand, and to urge the unlawfulness of a double marriage, ready to make vows for the fidelity of _Philander_, though before so much against his own interest, and to tell her all those letters from him were forged: he thought on all things, but nothing remained...", "...arose. \"Miss Wilson, Miss Hobart will be your roommate. I shall put her in your care.\" The girl extended her hand. She was not nearly so tall as Elizabeth. Her yellow hair without ribbon or comb hung about her ears. She shook her head and flung back her locks like a spirited young horse tossing its mane. Her eyes were brown and dancing and her face was brimming over with fun. Her voice was high pitched and so cheery that her hearers were compelled to believe that she was at that <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> having the best time of her life. \"I have been expecting you,\" she cried. \"I was hoping you would come to-day so that we could get to housekeeping to-morrow, for lessons begin the next day.\" She led the way into the hall.

Francis, I don't think we'd better think any more of ever trying to be married to each other. It's too hard on the nervous system.\" Francis colored deeply. \"What do you want to do?\" he demanded. Marjorie paused a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before she answered. The truth was, she didn't know. She had definitely given up her New York position. She liked it up here, very much indeed. She liked the O'Maras and the house, and she was wild to get outdoors and explore the woods. Leaving Francis out of the question, she was freer than she had been for years. Altogether it was a bit hard to be entirely moved by lofty considerations. She wanted to stay; she knew that. \"Canada's a nice place,\" she began, dimpling a...", "...marched up and down the scant space, and then stopped short and laughed drily, continuing her smothered soliloquy. \"'Do you love me?' they ask, and, 'I will make you happy!' they say; and you get married--and after that it's Housework!\" \"They don't say, 'Will you be my Cook?'

For the first <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the crowd was too breathless with pleasure to think of applause. But the goddess seemed to require due homage; and when she folded her arms across her bosom, and stood motionless for an instant, as if to demand the worship of the universe, every tongue was loosed, and a thunder-clap of 'Aphrodite!' rang out across the roofs of Alexandria, and startled Cyril in his chamber at the Serapeium, and weary muleteers on distant sand-hills, and dozing mariners far out at sea.

That he should have spoken of himself at great length and with many and <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details is a circumstance most favourable to the formation of an accurate judgment respecting him. Such is fortunately our position with regard to Father John Gerard, the author of the Narrative of the Gunpowder Plot.

Now and then he shivered all over with an agonising, feverish tremor. Disconnected and irrelevant things kept coming into his mind: at one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he thought of the old clock which used to hang on his wall fifteen years ago in Petersburg and had lost the minute-hand; at another of the cheerful clerk, Millebois, and how they had once caught a sparrow together in Alexandrovsky Park and had laughed so that they could be heard all over the park, remembering that one of them was already a college assessor.

Brett opened his mouth to call--and went rigid, as a translucent shape of mud shot from the door, rose up to tower before him. Brett stood, mouth half open, eyes staring, leaning forward with hands outflung. The Gel loomed, its surface flickering--waiting. Brett caught an acrid odor of geraniums.

He seemed to greet the lapse of minute after <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> with stern acquiescence in the inevitable order. His expression was so severe, so serene, so immobile, that it seemed obvious that for him at least there was a grandeur in the departing hour which no petty irritation on his part was to mar, although the wasting time wasted also high private hopes of his own. His face was no bad index to what went on within him. He was in a condition of mind rather too exalted for the trivialities of daily life. He could not accept the fact...", "...would be familiar. Thus did Plato in his Dialogues, Christ in his Parables. Therefore it seems doubtful whether it was judicious to make a German Professor the hero of _Sartor_.

In short, there is not a sufficient basis of the common to justify the amount of peculiarity in the work.

Leaning against the woodwork, her fingers curving through the tiny openings, she stared toward the west. The sky was flushing. Broken by the circles, the squares, the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> interstices of the mashrubiyeh, she saw the city taking on the hues of sunset.

These are the Monads, they are strictly putrefactive organisms, they are midway in size between the least and largest Bacteria, and are, from their form and other conditions, more amenable to research, and twelve years ago I resolved, with the highest power lenses and considerable practice in their use, to attack the problem of their origin; whether as physical products of the not-living, or as the natural progeny of parents.

This minute drop has to be covered with a minute film of glass not more than the 1/200 of an inch thick. The highest lenses are employed, working so near as almost to touch the delicate cover.

To prevent this an arrangement was devised by which the lens and the covered fluid under examination were used in an...", "...up on the beach. Before him were the deep woods.

I am led, however, to reject this hypothesis, because in Sarsia, where segmentation entails a comparatively small amount of tube-section, there is no constant rule as to the larger segments showing more endurance than the smaller ones--the converse case, in fact, being of nearly as frequent occurrence. I can only account for this fact by supposing that the endurance of the segments of Sarsia is determined by the degree in which the three or four <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> open tube-ends become accidentally blocked. This supposition is the only one I can think of to account for the astonishing contrasts as to endurance that are presented by different segments of the same individual, and, I may add, of different individuals when deprived of their margins and afterwards submitted to the same conditions. For instance, a number of equally vigorous specimens had their margins removed, and were then suspended in a glass cage attached to a...", "...disposition and thou shalt turn stones into gold.

The train halted for but a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and our hero alighted, suit-case in hand. Much to his surprise, not a soul was about the little depot, which looked old and dilapidated. There was a stretch of fields beyond the track, and farther on he made out the glistening waters of the river, and in the center the woodland stretch known as Moosetail Island. \"Well, this surely is Lonesome Land!\" Dave murmured to himself, as the train rumbled out of sight and he was left utterly alone. \"And not another train until eight...", "...white lines becomes better crystallised in these cavities, and Professor Miller was fortunate enough, after several trials, to ascertain that the white crystals, which are the largest, were of quartz (Professor Miller informs me that the crystals which he measured had the faces P, z, m of the figure (147) given by Haidinger in his Translation of Mohs; and he adds, that it is remarkable, that none of them had the slightest trace of faces r of the regular six-sided prism.), and that the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> green transparent needles were augite, or, as they would more generally be called, diopside: besides these crystals, there are some minute, dark specks without a trace of crystalline, and some fine, white, granular, crystalline matter which is probably feldspar.

From the left the soldiers were falling like wood, from the right like whole forests. In less than an hour the entire army vanished. Some of them remained upon the spot, dead; some of them fled. Prince Kindhearted and the Knight Invisible met upon the battle-field, shook hands in a friendly way, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> the Knight Invisible and his horse turned into a bright red flame, then into thick smoke, which disappeared in the darkness. The prince returned quietly to the palace. The young princess felt very sad that evening. She could not sleep and so leaned out of her window, whence she overheard the conversation between the prince and the servant. Then she saw what was going on behind the city walls. She also saw the Knight Invisible disappear in the darkness, and Prince Kindhearted...", "...back against the wall for fear that he might look even around a corner or through the earth and discover us.

He was watched, and he did not hesitate a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to act. He seized the bag and picked his way quickly through the passage as if thoroughly familiar with every turn of the walls and roughness of the floor. We were discovered and if we were to accomplish anything, it was now or never. Kennedy dashed forward and I followed close after him. We were making much better time than our strange visitor and were gaining on him rapidly. Nearer and nearer we came to him, for, in spite of his familiarity with the cavern he was...", "...care: the man is dead.\" To my inexperienced eyes he indeed seemed past all human help. His skin was icy cold, and as wet as if he had been lying out in the dew. No flutter of pulse, nor sign of breath, could my trembling efforts discover; but I fancied there was the least little sign of pulsation about his heart. Of course I had not the vaguest notion of what was the matter with the man, for all Pepper could tell me was that \"Fenwick's been powerful bad, you bet.\" This does not sound a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> diagnosis to go on, and the only remedies which presented themselves to my mind were those I had studied as being useful for the recovery of drowned persons. So to work I set, as if the poor fellow had just been fished out of the creek; and whenever any one wanted to teaze me afterwards they would declare I had insisted on Fenwick's being held up by his heels. But of course that was all nonsense. What I did really do was this, and a doctor in Christchurch, whom I afterwards...", "...certainly do it; she can't stop your pay, because you don't get any; and as you have your meals with the youngsters, she can't dock your rations.

Daddy Bunker and Mr. Armatage looked at each other pretty seriously. \"We didn't get here a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> too soon,\" said the planter. \"I believe you,\" returned Mr. Bunker gravely. \"This might have been a very serious affair.\" But in the morning, after Russ and Rose were refreshed by sleep and had told the particulars of their adventure at the breakfast table, the youngsters really took pride in what had happened to them. The smaller children looked upon Russ and Rose as being very wonderful. \"What would you have done, Russ, if that big cat had got into the house with you and...", "...hand that took the Moonstone.

Don't let Rachel see me.\" I noticed a bluish tinge in her face which alarmed me. She saw I was startled. \"The drops will put me right in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two,\" she said, and so closed her eyes, and waited a little. While this was going on, I heard dear Mr. Godfrey still gently remonstrating. \"You must not appear publicly in such a thing as this,\" he said. \"YOUR reputation, dearest Rachel, is something too pure and too sacred to be trifled with.\" \"MY reputation!\" She burst out laughing. \"Why, I am accused, Godfrey, as well as you.

A young girl's face at such moments is apt to be a happy one, but Rose's was very grave as she worked, and now and then she threw a parcel into the drawer with a careless toss, as if no love made the gift precious. So unusual was this expression that it struck Dr. Alec as he came in and brought an anxious look to his eyes, for any cloud on that other countenance dropped its shadow over his. \"Can you spare a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> from your pretty work to take a stitch in my old glove?\" he asked, coming up to the table strewn with ribbon, lace, and colored papers. \"Yes, Uncle, as many as you please.\" The face brightened with sudden sunshine; both hands were put out to receive the shabby driving glove, and the voice was full of that affectionate alacrity which makes the smallest service sweet. \"My Lady Bountiful is hard at work, I see.

I felt, even if she has to go back to bed the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> she gets home, home is the proper place for her, any way of it. And though she was leaving her little sister and all, she seemed to cheer up when we were off; and I know she felt a relief when we had got through London and were fair on our way. We had to steal out of the house as careful as anything, for Miss Pansy was not started for the parade front, it being so early. Fortunately, Mr. Tony was off for the day with his friend.\" \"Tony?

Mr. Harris, the mate, was doing the final work of getting the steamer ready to sail, and was preparing to cast off the lines, when a dray, loaded with boxes, pulled up alongside the vessel. \"What ye got there?\" demanded Harris. \"That ain't for this packet--git out the way thar!\" Just then a man in white darted out of the office of the harbour-police station, and, holding up his hand, cried to Harris: \"One minute--one minute!\" \"One <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> yer grandmother!\" retorted Harris angrily. \"Who be you to hold up this ship! Vamose!\" he roared to the driver of the dray. The man in white ran up the gangplank with a paper in one hand and a malacca cane in the other, and I recognized him as Mr. Trego, the man to whom I had been introduced in the bank. He met Harris at the foot of the ladder to the hurricane-deck, and they were right below me, so I could not avoid hearing what took place between them. \"Call the captain, Mr....", "...he almost gave a shout. To one side of the bridge he saw that the banks of the stream were low and sloped gently. It might be possible to run the auto across the stream that way. At any rate he decided to try. As the auto reached the point at which the road widened, the boy swung the speeding machine over and whizzed by the wagon so closely that wisps of hay clung to the auto's side. But the lead horses--there were four of them--blocked access to the bridge. The next <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> there was a shout of alarm from the boys, as they saw that Frank meant to dash across the stream. The auto struck the bank, seemed to bound into the air, and then crashed down into the water with a force that threw a cloud of spray high above it and thoroughly drenched its occupants. But to Frank's great joy the machine did not overturn, nor did it seem damaged, as it kept right on through the water, which, luckily, was not deep, and dashed up the other bank. Here Frank...", "...means only that he will be best occupied, speaking generally, in a conscientious attempt to see the man as he was, to \"experience the savor of him\", and to understand the national temperament to which he has endeared himself.

The only means of preventing this would be to secure that those who held the King in custody should be loyal to Minna; and it was for this part of the scheme that I had hoped to make use of the two men, Kummell and Beilager. I set out to find them, therefore. I chanced upon them together at the house of Kummell, and it did not take me a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to perceive that there was a decided restraint in their manner toward me. I had meant to be perfectly frank with them, telling them, indeed, all I knew; but their attitude made this impossible, and for a moment I was at a loss what line to take.

The memorable enterprise of Barendz and Heemskerk has been thought worthy of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> description because it was a voyage of discovery, and because, however barren of immediate practical results it may, seem to superficial eyes, it forms a great landmark in the history of human progress and the advancement of science.

It only increased the excitement from which he suffered, and, with his eyes flashing in his eagerness, he kept on showing the Boers where he lay by firing at every opportunity, religiously keeping his aim for the ponies, in the full belief that before long the Boers would retire. \"It's no good to play that game!\" cried Ingleborough suddenly, and he made a quick movement, turning a little to his right and firing....", "...realistic speech. \"Walker of Murphy's blew a hole through Peters For telling him he lied; Then up and dusted out of South Hornitos Across the long Divide. \"We ran him out of Strong's, and up through Eden, And 'cross the ford below; And up this canon (Peters' brother leadin'), And me and Clark and Joe. \"He fou't us game: somehow, I disremember Jest how the thing kem round; Some say 'twas wadding, some a scattered ember From fires on the ground. \"But in one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> all the hill below him Was just one sheet of flame; Guardin' the crest, Sam Clark and I called to him.

Artificial automata and natural bodies are distinguished only in degree. Machines fashioned by the hand of man perform their functions by means of visible and tangible instruments, while natural bodies employ organs which, for the most part, are too <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to be perceived. As the clock-maker constructs a clock from wheels and weights so that it is able to go of itself, so God has made man's body out of dust, only, being a far superior artist, he produces a work of art which is better constructed and capable of far more wonderful movements. The cause of death is the destruction of some important part of the machine, which prevents it from running longer; a corpse is a broken clock, and the departure of the soul comes only as a...", "...nothing more to do,\" was the response; \"the varmints are travelling faster than this horse can go, though he was one of their animals.\" \"How was that?\" \"I got it in the neck--that is my critter did.

[Illustration] Soon they were making a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> inspection of these objects which for some inexplicable reason had been abandoned by their owners. The uniforms and caps were of worn blue cloth, and the latter had visors and braids of gold around them. The sleeves of the coats likewise were braided with gold.

During that tight-stretched moment the pair upon the settee, their hands just unclasped, sat motionless, fully aware of each other for the first time, almost unendurably aware, thrilling with the just-arrived sense of the amazing intimacy of the experience they had shared.

It was quite ridiculous, but she could not leave them to lie there all night and be swept into the rubbish-basket in the morning.

A pleasant inadvertence marked the choice of eating-places at Hopefield Manor; I was never quite sure where I should find a table spread.

We daren't leave home for a single <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> now, for fear that minute should be THE minute.'

At the one extreme we see every facility. The new individuals can be conveyed in the shape of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> germs; these are infinite in their numbers; they are diffused in the sea; they are perpetually being carried in all directions to great distances by ocean-currents; they can survive such long journeys unharmed; they can find nutriment wherever they arrive; and the resulting organisms can multiply asexually with great rapidity. At the other extreme, we see every difficulty. The new individuals must be conveyed in their adult forms; their numbers are, in comparison, utterly...", "...for the impurities to fall through. The water-gauge glass and the lower gauge cock are usually set so as to have a margin of about three inches of water above the tubes or crown sheet of the fire box, hence if it is known that the water is but just below the bottom of the gauge glass or gauge cock, there is no positive danger, although it is improper to let it get so low. If the water is out of sight, and it is not known exactly how low it is, then it is dangerously low, and every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> is of vital importance. Should the water get dangerously low in the boiler, the most dangerous thing to do is to lift the safety valve or pump in cold water, especially if it is not known how much water there is in the boiler.

Already the monoplane was a mere speck in the distance. \"Take cover!\" hissed Dick breathlessly. \"They're on our track.\" Once again the two comrades sought shelter in a thicket. They were not a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> too soon, for amid a cloud of dust about fifty Turkish irregulars galloped madly down the path.

A gasp of amazement went up from every one.

When the boat reached him his unconscious burden was a dead weight and his own strength was almost gone. Another <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two and both would have gone to the bottom. As they hauled Monty over the side he shivered for an instant, grasped the first little hand that sought his so frantically, and then turned to look upon the half-dead sailor. \"Find out the boy's name, Mr. Abertz, and see that he has the best of care.

We have nothing to fear from them at least.\" They pushed their craft gently into the shallows, till they were almost beneath the trees. Then, giving one lusty push, Dick stepped over the side and waded, dragging the boat after him. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> later both were ashore, and were inspecting the other craft. \"We were just in time,\" said Mr Pepson, in tones of the greatest satisfaction. \"Another few minutes and they would have got clear away, and then good-bye to the expedition, for a time at any rate.

It was the buried chamber in which was hidden the Great Secret of the race of Mahars.

One declared that she had been offered eight shillings ($2) for the goose and had refused it. This is one proof of the high figure at which all animals, birds and beasts, common to a farm are held. Although this goose was exceptionally valuable, yet a goose is worth five shillings or $1.25.

The Puritan clergy adopted a costume which differed little, if at all, from that of the laity of the same school. But it is curious that this question of clerical dress continued to be one of complaint on one side, and resistance on the other, down to the end of our ecclesiastical legislation.

I was going!\" He looked so radiant as he said it, his eyes gradually opening, revealing the rapture of perfect delight. Rousille, more grave, for she had...", "...from the place where his presence was so urgently required. Two minutes later he was on horseback and galloping towards the scene of disturbance. Reaching the Hatton parsonage within half an hour, he entered it by a back door, and at once swore in as special deputies the gentlemen whom he found there assembled, and undecided, not having authority, as to how they should act in the present emergency. Then Sheriff Hardy stepped to the front porch, took a survey of the situation, and for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> listened to the significant interchange of remarks between the owner of the shops and the leaders of the mob. He was there when the crowd tore down the fence and made their rush towards the house. Until this moment they had not suspected his presence, but now, at the sound of his sharp \"Halt!\" their advance was checked as effectually as though it had encountered a twenty-foot stone wall. \"Stand where you are!\" he commanded. \"Any man who advances so much as a single step...", "...did not speak, and that silence somehow gave her answer an undue significance. \"Yes,\" she said at last. He opened his lips to speak, then suddenly his expression changed and he moved away from the window. \"Wretched night! Wretched night!\" he said, walking briskly on. Caroline sat back in her chair, almost feeling as if she had been struck in the face--for a question had been asked and answered during that silence which involved all sorts of joys, fears, infidelities; then in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he banished them so utterly that she could scarcely believe they had ever been in question. The next moment Mr. and Mrs. Graham were at the window. \"Oh, dreadful night, is it not? You must feel the wind here.\" Then they were merged into the shadow of the hall, warning each other as they went along against taking cold. Caroline saw what had happened now. Wilson had no doubt caught sight of the Grahams over his shoulder, and had not wished them to see him talking to...", "...\"It's poetry, I can see that, because the lines are so short.\" \"It's about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of yesterday,\" he answered, resting his head on his hand, and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to be interrupted. Maggie, in her absent way, continued to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet about, while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if she had quite forgotten Philip and his book. \"Maggie,\" said Philip, after a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, still leaning on his elbow and looking at her, \"if you had had a brother like me, do you think you should have loved him as well as Tom?\" Maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie, and said, \"What?\" Philip repeated his question. \"Oh, yes, better,\" she answered immediately. \"No, not better; because I don't think I _could_ love you better than Tom. But I should be so sorry,--_so sorry_ for you.\" Philip colored; he had meant to imply, would she love...", "...I'm helpless,\" Captain Scraggs answered with deadly calm. \"But the minute we hit the dock you an' me parts company.\" \"I don't know whether we will or not, Scraggsy. I ain't heeled right financially to hit the beach on such short notice.\" \"That ain't no skin off'n my nose, Gib.\" \"Well, you can fire all you want, but you won't fire me. I won't go.\" \"I'll get the police to remove you, you blistered pirate,\" Scraggs screamed, now quite beside himself. \"Yes? Well, the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> they let go o' me I'll come back to the S.S. _Maggie_ and tear her apart just to see what makes her go.\" He leaned out the pilot house window and sniffed. \"Tule fog, all right, Scraggs. Still, that ain't no reason why the ship's company should fast, is it? Quit bickerin' with me, little one, an' see if you can't wrastle up some ham an' eggs.

The passage was long, and there were two wings; one led to the cellars proper, the other to the vaults. Opposite to the steps there was a cross passage, at the end of which, by ascending some seven or eight steps and passing through a lattice door, you could get into the open air. This lattice served likewise as a means of ventilating the passages, and on this particular night there was such a strong current of air that the light in the lantern was in danger every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of being blown out. It would have been well if that were all. The sacristan hadn't taken three steps in the direction of the vault before a terrible sight revealed itself to both men. At the other end of the passage a blue flame burned; before the flame there stood, or sat, or jumped, a dwarfish figure all in white. It was not three feet in height, and, nevertheless, its head was of monstrous size. As the sacristan, with the pastor, drew near this horrid appearance, the blue...", "...bottom, where the explosive force is greater.... This grand eruption continued for twenty minutes, and was the most magnificent sight we ever witnessed. We were standing on the side of the geyser nearest the sun, the gleams of which filled the sparkling column of water and spray with myriads of rainbows, whose arches were constantly changing,--dipping and fluttering hither and thither and disappearing only to be succeeded by others, again and again, amid the aqueous column, while the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> globules into which the spent jets were diffused when falling sparkled like a shower of diamonds, and around every shadow which the denser clouds of vapor, interrupting the sun's rays, cast upon the column, could be seen a luminous circle radiant with all the colors of the prism, and resembling the halo of glory represented in paintings as encircling the head of Divinity. All that we had previously witnessed seemed tame in comparison with the perfect grandeur and beauty of this...", "...must have been in possession of the gipsy after my brother's death; and if it did not come to me from you, it must at all events have come through some one who received it of the gipsy.\" Nor in this assertion did he speak falsely; for the note was one of those which he had sent to the gipsy by Sir William Ryder, and which had accidentally returned to his own possession. It is wonderful how easily men can sometimes satisfy their conscience. Sir Roger did not pause to ask any very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> explanation: the vehemence with which his noble entertainer spoke convinced him that in some sense he spoke sincerely; and he would have been very sorry, by any indiscreet question, to have discovered that there was any thing like a double meaning in the words. \"Well, well,\" he said, \"I think I do remember something of the transaction, my lord; and I doubt not that a few moments' thought will bring it all back clearly to my memory.\" The peer pressed his hand. \"Well, then, Sir...", "...saw, or he had seen with his own eyes, the reality of the pagan worship, and the most repellent of all to our modern delicacy--the sacrifices. At the period when he wrote _The City of God_, private sacrifices, as well as public, were forbidden. This did not prevent the devout from breaking the law whenever a chance offered. They hid themselves more or less when they sacrificed before a temple, a chapel, or on some private estate. The rites could not be carried out according to all the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> instructions of the pontifical books. It was no more than a shadow of the ceremonies of former times. But in his childhood, in the reign of Julian, for instance, Augustin could have attended sacrifices which were celebrated with full pomp and according to all the ritual forms. They were veritable scenes of butchery. For Heaven's sake let us forget the frieze of the Parthenon, and its sacrificers with their graceful lines!

The whole force on the pier was on the qui vive, and one of the most expert women searchers on the pay-roll was detailed to give her special attention the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> she set foot on shore; but instead of doing as they all believed she would do, and giving the inspectors a chance to catch her at trying to evade the duties, to their very great profit, she calmly and coolly declared the stuff, paid her little sixty-five per cent. like a major, and drove off to the Castoria in full possession of her jewels.

At this period every yolk cell is itself like a whole yolk; for each cell is as full of lesser cells as the yolk-bag itself. When the mesoblast has become thus infinitely subdivided into hundreds of <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> spheres, the ectoblast bursts, and the new generations of cells thus set free collect in that part of the egg where the embryonic disk is to arise. This process of segmentation continues to go on downward till the whole yolk is taken in. These myriad cells are in fact the component parts of the little Turtle that is to be.

Just as the thought had formed itself in my mind, she had turned toward the cabinet and vanished before the curtain. But hardly a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> had elapsed before she sprang out again from the cabinet, like a new-born seraph, and, opening her hands before all the company present, her arms being entirely bare to the shoulder, she extended them above her head, began to manipulate something apparently in the air, and soon handed me a most exquisite rose, with the moisture oozing from the stem where it had apparently been twisted off from the stock. \"When at Miss Helen Berry's seance, a...", "...Several women now came hurrying out to see what was the matter. One of them held out her arms to the child, but she hid her face on Elizabeth's shoulder, and still kept up her frightened wailing. \"How d'ye know her arm's out o' joint?\" one of the women demanded when Peggy had repeated what Elizabeth had said. \"I do know because I pulled my little sister's arm out just that way once, lifting her over a crossing. O, I _wish_ I knew how to slip it in again! It wouldn't take a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> if we only knew how. Now we must get her to a doctor--quick.

While waiting for them to return, Chaudoreille promenaded before the theatre, swinging himself in the manner which he judged the most noble, and striking his belt every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to make his gold pieces chink. The two men returned presently, they had obtained a chair, and would themselves have the honor of carrying Chaudoreille, or so they said to him on their arrival, exclaiming,-- \"Here, master! get in, master, you'll be pleased with us.\" Chaudoreille, whom nobody had ever called master, felt much pleased, and was about to bow low to the porters, but he restrained himself and darted into the chair, quivering with delight on the cushion which was...", "...the friction of certain elastic parts of the body, as Grasshoppers and Crickets; others employ the vibration of certain parts in the air, whilst others impress a rapid motion on portions of air inclosed in certain parts of their bodies.

I should think he had left the theatre.\" Grimaldi ran to the stage-door, and asked the porter if his brother had passed. The man said he had, not a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> back; he could not have got out of the street by that time. He ran out at the door, and then up and down the street several times, but saw nothing of him. Where could he be gone to? Possibly, finding him longer gone than he had anticipated, he might have stepped out to call upon one of his old friends close by, whom he had not seen for so many years, with the intention of returning to the theatre.

This process, which is as yet imperfectly understood, is attended by the consumption of oxygen, the liberation of energy in the form of heat, and the exhalation of carbon dioxide and water vapour. Transpiration is loss of water by the plant by evaporation, chiefly from the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> pores or stomata on the leaves. In xerophytic plants (_e.g._ cacti, euphorbias, &c.) from hot, dry and almost waterless regions where evaporation would be excessive, the leaf surface, and consequently the number of stomata, are reduced to a minimum, as it would be fatal to such plants to exhale vapour as freely in those regions as the broad-leaved plants that grow in places where there is abundance of moisture.

And at the sound of that wailing cry, so unmistakably the cry of a youngling for its parent, the bear drew back discreetly behind a bush, and glanced uneasily up and down the stream to see if the parent would come in answer to the appeal.

The _Historia Apologetica_ treats of the natural history, the climate, the flora, fauna, and various products of the Indies, as well as of the different races inhabiting the several countries; their character, costumes, habits, and forms of government. Though its purpose bore less directly upon the injustices under which the natives suffered, it was none the less educational, the author's purpose being to put before his countrymen a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and accurate description of the New World and its inhabitants that should vindicate the latter's right to equitable treatment at the hands of their conquerors. Misrepresented and defamed, as he maintained the Indians were, by the mendacious reports sent to Spain, Las Casas composed this interesting apology as one part of his scheme of defence.

Often he sent a portion of the copy of an essay, and wrote the remainder while the earlier part was printing. His \"Life of Savage\" was dashed off at one sitting.

The congested patches at the dental margins of the gums may become overlaid by opalescent masses of desquamated epithelium, followed by their actual ulceration, and even by detachment of the teeth....", "...this?\" \"I venture to say so,\" replied Picq. \"He knows we should never forget his birthday; he knows that.\" \"If--he is alive,\" she said in a whisper. \"Ah, why should we doubt it?\" His arm encouraged her. \"How often we have alarmed ourselves!

But, just as in War the actor obeys these theoretical truths rather because his mind is imbued with them than because he regards them as objective inflexible laws, so criticism must also make use of them, not as an external law or an algebraic formula, of which fresh proof is not required each time they are applied, but it must always throw a light on this proof itself, leaving only to theory the more <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and circumstantial proof. Thus it avoids a mysterious, unintelligible phraseology, and makes its progress in plain language, that is, with a clear and always visible chain of ideas. Certainly this cannot always be completely attained, but it must always be the aim in critical expositions. Such expositions must use complicated forms of science as sparingly as possible, and never resort to the construction of scientific aids as of a truth apparatus of its own, but always be...", "...of the small vessel permitted, I adjourned to the deck once more, in my capacity of pilot, to see how the weather looked. I then returned to the cabin, and having desired the steward, who was comparatively fresh, to call me when the tide turned, I offered up my short but heart-warm prayer of thanksgiving to the God of my fathers for his great mercy vouchsafed to me during the past day; and imploring his gracious protection during the coming night, I lay down in my berth, where in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> I was as sound asleep as the others. CHAPTER V. AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SERJEANT QUACCO. I had scarcely, to my conception, been asleep at all, when I was called again. \"If ever I practise the calling of a pilot in this wide world after this!\" said I to myself as I stumbled, yawning and stretching, about the confined cabin. It might have been about eleven at night when I got on deck. There was a heavy ground-swell tumbling in upon us over the bar, which made the little...", "...There was here a remarkably fine microscope, which attracted general attention. The doctor was the person who used it most, devoting much of his time to investigations in histology. The manager requested him to show the Duke's guests some of his preparations. First he exhibited some diatoms--the ladies were charmed by their various forms; he also showed them specimens of the animalcule which wrought the destruction of the famous bridge at Milan; they could not cease marvelling that so <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> a creature should be able to demolish so huge a structure. \"And think of the myriads of these creatures which must have laboured to produce such an effect,\" said an engineer. Quiroga, so the doctor was called, ended by showing them a drop of water. One by one they all looked at the invisible world revealed by the microscope. \"I see one animal larger than the others,\" said the Duke, as he applied one of his prominent eyes to the tube of the instrument. \"And you will see...", "...the ranks of the Royalists. \"_Mil demonios_!\" exclaimed Caldelas, \"if Regules prove the cause of our defeat, I shall blow out his brains, and afterwards my own!\" As the brigadier pronounced this threat, his soldiers, pressed by a violent movement in front, commenced to give ground; and that which he had foreseen was likely to be realised. His brigade, weakened by the battalions sent as a reinforcement to Regules, was unable to withstand the desperate charges of Galeana; and, in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two after, his troops broke line, fell back, and then scattered in full retreat. Blinded by rage, Caldelas turned his horse, leaving to Don Rafael the duty of collecting the dispersed soldiers, and, furiously plying the spur, he galloped off towards the ground where Regules was still contesting the issue with Trujano. Meanwhile Don Cornelio was going at full speed on his message to Morelos. He was not proceeding in a very direct line, however. Not desiring to get again...", "...other, crashingly, through cage after cage--and then out upon the street through the plate front.

He was not surprised, for this happened twice a year....", "...they are more alive than the living.\" My friend had, as a matter of fact, accustomed himself to speak openly of the weaknesses of the deceased, who, in spite of all, had been a good friend to him. Some days later, as we sat at table in the verandah of a garden-restaurant, one of the guests exclaimed, \"Look at that rat! What a big fellow!\" No one had seen it, and they laughed at the visionary. \"Wait a minute!\" he said, \"you will soon see. It is there under the planks!\" A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> passed, and a cat came from under the planks. \"I think we have had enough of rats,\" my friend exclaimed, apparently much disturbed. After some time has elapsed, one evening I hear a knock at my door after I have gone to bed. I open it, and find myself face to face with my friend, who looks disturbed and excited. He asks to be allowed to stay and rest on a sofa, because there is a woman who screams the whole night in the house where he lives. \"Is it a real woman, or a...", "...storm swept over the emotional nature of Mr. Skippy Bedelle, of the sort which in modern legal etiquette is held to excuse all crimes.

It is especially valuable in so far as it affords points of comparison and contact with the more complete and systematic Rule of St. Benedict. In some things it is exceedingly rigorous and very <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in the penances which it imposes, even on the most venial and semi-deliberate faults. The first six chapters are devoted to the essential virtues of the monastic state--obedience, silence, self-denial in the use of meat and drink, poverty and chastity. The maxim--_cibus monachorum sit vilis et vespertinus_--seems to allow the poor monks only one plain meal in the day, and that after vespers. He inculcates also a daily fast, daily prayer, daily labour, and daily...", "...a sweet, cool tide of fragrance into which she sank. After the glaring heat above it was like stepping into a perfumed bath. She lay by the spring, her hands clasped behind her head, looking up at the trees. The segments of sky between the boughs were as blue as a turquoise and in this thick intense color the little leaves seemed as if inlaid. Then a breeze came and the bits of inlaying shook loose and trembled into silvery confusion. Small secretive noises came from them as if <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> confidences were passing from bough to bough, and through their murmurous undertone the drip of the spring fell with a thin, musical tinkle. Nature was dreaming and Susan dreamed with it. But her dreaming had a certain definiteness, a distinct thought sustained its diffused content.

'T'otherest,' he said, in a low, calm voice, 'are you a lying easy? There's a chill in the air, governor. Shall I put a coat over you?' No answer. 'That's about what it is a'ready, you see,' muttered Riderhood in a lower and a different voice; 'a coat over you, a coat over you!' The sleeper moving an arm, he sat down again in his chair, and feigned to watch the storm from the window. It was a grand spectacle, but not so grand as to keep his eyes, for half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> together, from stealing a look at the man upon the bed. It was at the concealed throat of the sleeper that Riderhood so often looked so curiously, until the sleep seemed to deepen into the stupor of the dead-tired in mind and body. Then, Riderhood came from the window cautiously, and stood by the bed. 'Poor man!' he murmured in a low tone, with a crafty face, and a very watchful eye and ready foot, lest he should start up; 'this here coat of his must make him uneasy in his...", "...to raise and elevate their suffering kind to a higher plane, should be the only thinkers to claim our considerate attention and command our homage. THEME UNDER CONSIDERATION. In the theme I have chosen for this paper, I shall endeavor to show that the latent and active attributes of the negro eminently adapt him to be classed among the survivals of the fittest in the family of races. Before proceeding, however, to a formal discussion of the subject, it might not be amiss for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, to take a running retrospect of the race since its advent into its present civil life. The three decades which mark the close of our Civil War have perhaps not only written history more broadly in the behalf of humanity in general as interpreted by Christian civilization, than any other similar period, but they have been the most momentous in shaping the national life by moulding and settling policies of a lasting nature. The admission of millions, of what is termed an...", "...in interstate commerce upon certain conditions. The law should be so framed as to give to the Interstate Commerce Commission power to pass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means should be provided to enable the Commission, whenever in its judgment it is necessary, to make a physical valuation of any railroad. As I stated in my Message to the Congress a year ago, railroads should be given power to enter into agreements, subject to these agreements being made public in <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> detail and to the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission being first obtained. Until the National Government assumes proper control of interstate commerce, in the exercise of the authority it already possesses, it will be impossible either to give to or to get from the railroads full justice. The railroads and all other great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must come; the only question is as to what governmental body can most wisely exercise it....", "...to fail!\" she said. \"Just as everything is fixed, and we're recovering from you're being here for the Holadays, you come back and stir up a lot of trouble.

The lady commanded herself through this trial, and instantly another began. The bird alighted near the door, and in less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> changed, she saw not how, into a horribly deformed and dwarfish hag: who, with yellow skin hanging about her face and enormous eyes, swung herself on crutches toward the lady, her mouth foaming with fury, and her grimaces and contortions becoming more and more hideous every moment, till she rolled with a yell on the floor, in a horrible convulsion, at the lady's feet, and then changed into a huge serpent, with crest erect, and quivering tongue. Suddenly, as it seemed on the...", "...Mary persisted. Firio moved the coffee-pot closer to the fire. This seemed to require the concentration of all his faculties, including that of speech. He was a fit servant for one who took duels so casually. \"Where? Where?\" she repeated. \"Where? Have you no tongue?\" snapped Ignacio. Firio gazed all around as if looking for Jack; then nodded in the direction of rising ground which broke at the edge of a depression about fifty yards away. Her impatience had made the delay of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> seem hours, while the brilliance of the light had now become that of broad day. She forgot all constraint. She ran, and as she ran she listened for a shot as if it were something inevitable, past due. And then she uttered a muffled cry of relief, as the scene in a depression which had been the bed of an ancient river flashed before her with theatric completeness. In the bottom of it were five men, two moving and three stationary. Jim Galway and Ropey Smith were walking side...", "...more art and more truth to nature. As a specific example read Cable's _Old Creole Days_ and _Madame Delphine_ with their exquisite pictures of life in the old French city of New Orleans. These are romances or creations of fancy, to be sure; but in their lifelike characters, their natural scenes and soft Creole dialect they are as realistic (that is, as true to a real type of American life) as anything that can be found in literature. They are, in fact, studies as well as stories, such <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and affectionate studies of old people, old names and old customs as the great French novelist Balzac made in preparation for his work. Though time holds its own secrets, one can hardly avoid the conviction that _Old Creole Days_ and _Madame Delphine_ are not books of a day but permanent additions to American fiction. [Sidenote: TYPICAL STORY-WRITERS] Cable was accompanied by so many other good writers that it would require a volume to do them justice.

But if the labours of the Fathers of Trent were to be productive of the good results that might be anticipated, earnest, religious, energetic Popes were required to give a lead to their spiritual children, whose courage had been damped by over thirty years of almost uninterrupted defeats, to put into force the valuable reforms that had been planned with such <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> care, and above all to make the court and city of Rome an example for the princes and people of the world. Here, again, the providence of God watching over His Church was manifested in a striking manner. Pius IV. deserves to be remembered with gratitude by all future generations for the part that he took in bringing to a successful conclusion the Council of Trent in face of almost insuperable difficulties, for having taken such energetic and withal such prudent action to secure...", "...and that all this must be some tipsy frolic.

Then, and not before, 'Good Gracious!' cried Miss Fanny all at once, 'Where's Amy!' Her father had thought she was with her sister. Her sister had thought she was 'somewhere or other.' They had all trusted to finding her, as they had always done, quietly in the right place at the right moment. This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her. A <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> might have been consumed in the ascertaining of these points, when Miss Fanny, who, from her seat in the carriage, commanded the long narrow passage leading to the Lodge, flushed indignantly.

Uppy knew they were on the edge of the big barren of the Lacs Delesse, and he cracked his whip just as the off runner of the sledge struck a hidden snow-blister. There was a sudden lurch, and in a vicious up-shoot of the gee-bar the revolver was knocked from Dolores' hand--and was gone. A shriek rose to her lips, but she stifled it before it was given voice. Until this <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> she had not felt the terror of utter hopelessness upon her. Now it made her faint. The revolver had not only given her hope, but also a steadfast faith in herself. From the beginning she had made up her mind how she would use it in the end, even though a few moments before she had asked Peter what they would do. Crumpled down on the sledge, she clung to Peter, and suddenly the inspiration came to her not to let him know what had happened. Her arms tightened about his...", "...to men. And I failed, of course.

If there were any who doubted, it was because of its marvelously <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> accuracy which the others only admired. Such accuracy, it was sometimes whispered, required absolutely perfect adjustment, and what would happen when the great inventor--\"the poet in steel,\" as Clemens once called him--was no longer at hand to supervise and to correct the slightest variation.

Cash had reminded Bud harshly that they would need that gold to develop their quartz claim, and he had further stated that he wanted no \"truck\" with a gambler and a drunkard, and that Bud had better straighten up if he wanted to keep friends with Cash.

Meantime, he would tell the world he was his own boss, and Cash needn't think for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> that Bud was going to ask permission for what he did or did not do. Cash needn't have any truck with him, either. It suited Bud very well to keep on his own side of the cabin, and he'd thank Cash to mind his own business and not step over the dead line.

A.D. 1709] Mr. Michael Johnson was a man of a large and robust body, and of a strong and active mind; yet, as in the most solid rocks veins of unsound substance are often discovered, there was in him a mixture of that disease, the nature of which eludes the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> enquiry, though the effects are well known to be a weariness of life, an unconcern about those things which agitate the greater part of mankind, and a general sensation of gloomy wretchedness[115].

The store was filled with the odor of coffee, the penetrating smell of print muslins. \"Mr. Simmons wants you a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in the office,\" the clerk responded indirectly to his request for ginger. Gordon instinctively masked a gathering premonition of trouble. \"Fill her up the while,\" he demanded, pushing forward the empty bottle.

In these fluids there exist greater or less quantities of carbonic acid, and a considerable amount of this gas enters into the circulation of the plants and is carried to those parts where it is required for decomposition.

The author of this series has made it his special object to confine himself very strictly, even in the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> details which he records, to historic truth. The narratives are not tales founded upon history, but history itself, without any embellishment, or any deviations from the strict truth so far as it can now be discovered by an attentive examination of the annals written at the time when the events themselves occurred. In writing the narratives, the author has endeavored to avail himself of the best sources of information which this country affords; and though, of course, there must...", "...her own. Liza, Gnekker, then Yegor, came running in at our shouts.... \"Let me alone!\" I cried; \"let me alone! Go away!\" My legs turned numb as though they had ceased to exist; I felt myself falling into someone's arms; for a little while I still heard weeping, then sank into a swoon which lasted two or three hours. Now about Katya; she comes to see me every day towards evening, and of course neither the neighbours nor our acquaintances can avoid noticing it. She comes in for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and carries me off for a drive with her. She has her own horse and a new chaise bought this summer. Altogether she lives in an expensive style; she has taken a big detached villa with a large garden, and has taken all her town retinue with her--two maids, a coachman... I often ask her: \"Katya, what will you live on when you have spent your father's money?\" \"Then we shall see,\" she answers. \"That money, my dear, deserves to be treated more seriously. It was earned by a...", "...and he said that the French country people believed that since the cuckoo had begun calling again it was a sign the war would soon be over--that the cuckoo was calling for peace on earth.\" \"I wonder if he was right,\" I said. \"Well, he was right so far as he personally was concerned. This war for him was nearly over.

But if the same substances be submerged in water, they decompose more gradually; and if buried in earth, still more slowly; as in the familiar example of wooden piles or other buried timber. Now, if as fast as each particle is set free by putrefaction in a fluid or gaseous state, a particle equally <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> of carbonate of lime, flint, or other mineral, is at hand ready to be precipitated, we may imagine this inorganic matter to take the place just before left unoccupied by the organic molecule.

From Dr. Durm's <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> description of the cupola, there seems to be no doubt about the existence of this third vault in Michelangelo's wooden model. He says that the two outer shells are carved out of one piece of wood, while the third or innermost is made of another piece, which has been inserted. The sunk or hollow compartments, which form the laquear of this depressed vault, differ considerably in shape and arrangement from those which were adopted when it was finally rejected.

Hands were again immediately seized, and the jumping, hand-shaking, and singing went on. Minute by minute the excitement increased; faster the worshippers jumped, and louder they sang.

These tubes force their way between the cells of the stigma and style, and enter the ovary. Each tube then finds its way to one of the ovules, which it enters by means of a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> opening in its double coat called the micropyle, penetrates the embryo-sac, and reaches the ovum or egg-cell. The ovule is now impregnated or fertilised, and the result is that the ovum divides and subdivides into more and more cells till at last an embryo plant is built up. The ovule has thus become a seed, and its further development into a mature plant depends on its being transferred to a suitable soil, with proper conditions as to heat and moisture.

If improperly done, no amount of good work with the varnish brush will remove the fault. In fact, good work is impossible after a bad beginning.

If the filling has not been so thorough that no part of the subsequent finishing material can be absorbed by the wood, a rough surface will be sure to follow.

Yes, it was a 'Russian,' but a well-known one, a friend, and, into the bargain, without pigs! Their faces brightened, and they stretched out their hands, welcoming me warmly and frankly, as guests are always welcomed in the North.

I began...", "...the matter lightly, and affecting to be better pleased at the rude man's absence than she had been with his company, he abated his own wrath, and acknowledged that the desertion afforded the best proof of the safety of the road; since he could not believe that the fellow, with all his roughness and inhumanity, would have been so base as to leave them while really surrounded by difficulties.

They had already travelled nearly half the distance to the river, and to accomplish the remainder, they had yet four hours of day-light.

And here,\" he added, holding out his hand with something in it, \"is another shilling to make it twenty-six.

If circumstances regarding the Queen's captivity and Babington's plot have been found to be omitted, as well as many interesting personages in the suite of the captive Queen, it must be remembered that the art of the story-teller makes it needful to curtail some of the incidents which would render the narrative too complicated to be interesting to those who wish more for a view of noted characters in remarkable situations, than for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and accurate sifting of facts and evidence.

It was a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> geographical record of a recent journey through tracts of mountain country hitherto unexplored, a journey which had gained Lenox the letters C.I.E. after his name. Richardson, while failing to emulate the older man's zeal for wanderings that cut him off for months together from intercourse with his kind, was yet keenly interested in their practical outcome. The stronger light in which he now sat revealed him as a big fair man, by no means ill-featured, his soldierly figure...", "...left the castle and was walking down the road, a servant from Vosborg came running after him, shouting, 'The tower is leaning.' \"This was to be the test of his work. If he turned around to look at the tower, the owner of the castle would know that the builder was not sure of his own work. If there were even the smallest doubt in his mind, he would be certain to look around at once. But the English builder was very sure that his work was well done. Not once did he look back. Not for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> did he pause in his journey. But as he walked on, he said to the servant from Vosborg, 'The tower does not lean.

She was with her father, in an automobile, but there was a block in the traffic: a policeman was keeping it back, so he saw her distinctly for several minutes, and he was interested, because his employers told him how important the Gilders were, and how Mr. Gilder used to have his daughter guarded every <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> for fear she might be kidnapped for ransom, as several rich people's children had been. Monny couldn't have been more than fourteen then, as it's seven years ago; and Bedr said that the little girl he saw in the automobile was exactly like _me_--hardly at all like what Monny is now.

He looks upon them as the principal ornaments of the face of creation, and as forming the conservatories of Nature, in which she rears those <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> wonders of her skill, the flowers and smaller plants that will flourish only under their protection, and those insect hosts that charm the student with their beauty and excite his wonder by their mysterious instincts.

Margaret Nicholson was brought before the Privy Council, and the whole proceeding was set forth at great length in the Council Register. There appeared no entry of any sort or kind in the case of Hatfield; and in that of Watson there was a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> in the Home Office, setting forth that the examination had taken place _there_ by Lord Sidmouth, assisted by certain Lords and others of the Privy Council.

But the Romans built with porticos on one front only, which had a greater projection than the Grecian. They generally were projected three columns, while the Greek portico had usually but a single row....", "...Take the reins a little shorter, Eleanor.\" It is difficult to say how much there may be in two short words; but as Mr. Carlisle went round to the other side and mounted, he left his little lady in a state of fume. Those two words said so plainly to Eleanor's ear, that her announcement was neither denied nor disliked. Nay, they expressed pleasure; the sort of pleasure that a man has in a spirited horse of which he is master. It threw Eleanor's mind into a tumult, so great that for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two she hardly knew what she was about. But for the sound, sweet good temper, which in spite of Eleanor's self-characterising was part of her nature, she would have been in a rage. As it was, she only handled Black Maggie in a more stately style than she had cared about at the beginning of the ride; putting her upon her paces; and so rode through all the village, in a way that certainly pleased Mr. Carlisle, though he said nothing about it. He contrived however to aid in the...", "...here--by the M'Mahon mob, I guess,\" returned Sibley huskily. \"Is--is he dead?\" she asked tremblingly. \"No. Hurt bad.\" \"The kindest man--it'd break Kitty's heart--and mine,\" she added hastily, for she might be misunderstood; and John Sibley had shown signs of interest in her daughter. \"Where's the Young Doctor?\" she asked, catching sight of Crozier's face as they laid him on the bed. \"He's done the first aid, and he's off getting what's needed for the operation. He'll be here in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or so,\" said a banker who, a few days before, had refused Crozier credit. \"Gently, gently--don't do it that way,\" said Mrs. Tynan in sharp reproof as they began to take off Crozier's clothes. \"Are you going to stay while we do it?\" asked a maker of mineral waters, who whined at the prayer meetings of a soul saved and roared at his employees like a soul damned. \"Oh, don't be a fool!\" was the impatient reply. \"I've a grown-up girl and I've had a husband. Don't pull at his...", "...I thrilled, it perfectly comes back to me, with the prodigy of this circumstance that I should be admiring Titian in the same breath with Mr. Swinburne--that is in the same breath in which _he_ admired Titian and in which I also admired _him_, the whole constituting on the spot between us, for appreciation, that is for mine, a fact of intercourse, such a fact as could stamp and colour the whole passage ineffaceably, and this even though the more illustrious party to it had within the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> turned off and left me shaken. I was shaken, but I was satisfied--that was the point; I didn't ask more to interweave another touch in my pattern, and as I once more gather in the impression I am struck with my having deserved truly as many of the like as possible. I was welcome to them, it may well be said, on such easy terms--and yet I ask myself whether, after all, it didn't take on my own part some doing, as we nowadays say, to make them so well worth having. They themselves...", "...in the end. But she at least would never marry the man she loved and yet despised. That would be the only difference, yet a fairly essential one. And now her strength was renewed with her resolve, so that she was up and doing within the few seconds aforesaid; her first act was to blow out the candle; her next, to open the door an inch and to take her stand at the opening. Nor was she much too soon. It was as though Rigden had been only waiting for her light to go out. Within a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he appeared in the sandy space between the main building and the store. He was again wearing the yellow silk dust-coat of which enough has been heard; it was almost all that could be seen of him in the real darkness which had fallen with the setting of the moon. Moya heard his key in the heavy door opposite. Should she tell him of Theodore's suspicions, or should she not? While she hesitated, he let himself in, took out the key, and once more locked the door behind him. Next...", "...Salisbury_ (bellatulum x barbatum superbum, Sander's variety).--Dorsal hollow, broadly crimson all round the margin, dusky white inside, striped with crimson and speckled with maroon.

He was a full hour getting it changed. When he finally reached the ball grounds the game had been in progress for some time and, to his great surprise and consternation, this is what he heard: \"Oh! What an eye! Kill that umpire! Git a pop bottle! Git twenty pop bottles! Wreck him! Wreck him!\" The cries were loud and persistent from every corner of the grandstand. \"Trouble is,\" Doug Danby groaned as Johnny came racing up, \"they are liable to break loose any <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and do just that--'wreck the umpire.' And that umpire cost hundreds of dollars. How could we ever pay it back?\" Doug was, he believed, at that moment the most miserable person in the world. They were losing, losing the game they by all odds should be winning. And it was all his fault, or at least he accepted the blame. He, as captain of the team, had stood up for Goggles' mechanical umpire. \"And now look!\" He gave Johnny an appealing glance. Johnny didn't want to look....", "...it, or that it should get abroad, which would have had no other effect than that of convincing my son that his wife had dishonoured him. I must never talk to my son about the conspiracy in the presence of Madame d'Orleans; it would be wounding her in the tenderest place; for all that concerns her brother is to her the law and the prophets. My son has so satisfactorily disproved the accusations of that old Maintenon and the Duc du Maine, that the King has believed him, and, after a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> examination, has done my son justice. But Madame d'Orleans has not conducted herself well in this affair; she has spread by means of her creatures many calumnies against my son, and has even said that he wanted to poison her. By such means she has made her peace with old Maintenon, who could not endure her before. I have often admired the patience with which my son suffers all this, when he knows it just as well as I do. If things had remained as Madame de Maintenon had...", "...smile, which so captivated the good woman that she stood staring at her visitor in a kind of rapture, unable to reply for a minute or two. Minnie was placed in Mrs. Thimbleby's own high-backed chair, with the clean patchwork-covered cushions piled behind her. A horsehair footstool, borrowed for the purpose from Mr. Diamond's parlour, was under her feet. And she declared that she found herself as comfortable as in her own lounging-chair at home. \"You see, miss, I couldn't say to the <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> when Mr. Powell would be back, but between four and five he generally do come in, and I make him swallow a cup of herb tea, or something. And I will not deny that I sometimes puts a pinch of China tea in. But he don't know. This is but a poor place, miss,\" added the widow, glancing round, \"but so long as you can make yourself content to stay in it, so long you will be welcome as the flowers in May, if 'twas to be for a twelvemonth?\" Then Minnie praised the brilliant...", "...there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south. Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole -- of which there was one on each side of the hut. Gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept open -- that chosen being always on the side away from the wind. Closing the slide to windward, he turned to open the other; on second -- thoughts the farmer con- sidered that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, till the temperature of the hut was a little raised. He sat down. His head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak decided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall asleep. He fell asleep, however, without having performed the necessary preliminary. How long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew. During the first stages of his return to percep- tion peculiar deeds...", "...the vessel entering the liver (the vena portae, which, directly or indirectly, receives the gastric veins); no effect ensued until the removal of the ligature, within one minute of which proceeding the poison began to act.

The chief argument in favor of a _sympathetic_ or direct nerve action, is the almost instantaneous manner in which some poisons act; fatal effects occurring, it is said, before sufficient time has elapsed to allow of absorption. It has, however, been proved that the round of the circulation may be accomplished much more speedily than has been imagined. Thus, the ferrocyanide of potassium injected into the jugular vein of a horse was...", "...one that's free send here.\" Kolya growled out something in the back, but Jennka purposely did not listen to him. \"And please make it as quick as possible, housekeeper dear, won't you be so kind?\" \"Right away, right away, miss.\" \"Why, why do you do this, Jennie?\" asked Gladishev with anguish. \"Well, what's that for? ...Is it possible that you want to tell about it? ...\" \"Wait awhile, that's not your business...Wait a while, I won't do anything unpleasant for you.\" After a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> Little White Manka came in her brown, smooth, deliberately modest dress of a high school girl. \"What did you call me for, Jennie? Or have you quarreled?\" \"No, we haven't quarreled, Mannechka, but my head aches very much,\" answered Jennka calmly, \"and for that reason my little friend finds me very cold. Be a friend, Mannechka, stay with him, take my place!\" \"That's enough, Jennie, stop it, darling!\" in a tone of sincere suffering retorted Kolya. \"I understand everything,...", "...of a hot church and dashing off in a touring car. \"Well,\" he said, \"certain unfriendly persons have studiously circulated the impression that I am eligible for the Paresis Club--a chucklehead, in fact. But you will have to admit that I never give Private Views. You must concede that I do not inflict on my friends my opinions about crude color. Why, there must be several hundred things I don't do!\" \"Thank Heaven you don't!\" remarked Miss Maitland. CHAPTER VII It was one <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> before eleven when the card of Mr. Charles Wilkinson was borne gingerly, by a large youth from South Framingham who served as door boy, into the presence of Mr. Hurd. That gentleman, reading the bit of pasteboard with a grunt which might have been indicative of any one of a dozen invidious sentiments, opened the proximate corner of his mouth. \"Send him in,\" came from the brief orifice. A moment later Mr. Wilkinson stood in the presence of his prey. Or perchance--but no,...", "...Evelina could question her about Miss Mellins. \"Did she start up again by herself?\" \"Oh, no; but I couldn't stand not knowing what time it was, I've got so accustomed to having her round; and just after you went upstairs Mrs. Hawkins dropped in, so I asked her to tend the store for a minute, and I clapped on my things and ran right round to Mr. Ramy's. It turned out there wasn't anything the matter with her--nothin' on'y a speck of dust in the works--and he fixed her for me in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> and I brought her right back. Ain't it lovely to hear her going again? But tell me about Miss Mellins, quick!\" For a moment Ann Eliza found no words. Not till she learned that she had missed her chance did she understand how many hopes had hung upon it. Even now she did not know why she had wanted so much to see the clock-maker again. \"I s'pose it's because nothing's ever happened to me,\" she thought, with a twinge of envy for the fate which gave Evelina every opportunity...", "...whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, stir into the batter, dip the tripe in, throw it into a saucepan of boiling fat, let it fry three or four minutes, take it out, and drain.\"[240] [Footnote 240: Tegetmeier's 'Scholar's Handbook of Cookery, &c.,' Macmillan & Co.] =TRIP'OLI.= _Syn._ ROTTEN STONE; ALANA, TERRA CARIOSA, L.

The place had an unpleasant look, and I stopped before it to regard it. It was so grim of aspect and so assured of outline, like a trap for travellers which had hung there from all eternity, that I liked it not, and would not that the child should enter till I had first inspected it. Therefore, I bade him sit and rest upon a bed of crimson mosses which grew at the feet of a great rock, and to remain until he saw me turn to him again; and with many cautions and the most <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> directions for his obedience and his comfort, I left him, and advanced alone. My way had now grown quite or almost dark. The light of heaven and earth alike seemed banished from the dreadful spot. As it narrowed, the footing grew uncertain and slippery, and the air dense and damp. I had to remind myself that I was now become a being for whom physical danger had ceased for ever. \"What a place,\" I thought, \"for one less fortunate!\" As these words were in my mind, I...", "...might, no harm should fall upon her, of that he made mental oath. Eanswyth, having superintended the clearing of the table by the two little Kafir girls who filled the _role_ rather indifferent handmaidens, joined him on the _stoep_. It was a lovely night; warm and balmy. The dark vault above was so crowded with stars that they seemed to hang in golden patches. \"Shall we walk a little way down the kloof and see if we can meet Tom,\" she suggested. \"A good idea. Just half a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> though. I want to get another pipe.\" He went into his room, slipped a \"bull-dog\" revolver of heavy calibre into his pocket, and quickly rejoined her. Then as they walked side by side--they two, alone together in the darkness, alone in the sweet, soft beauty of the Southern night; alone, as it were, outside the very world; in a world apart where none might intrude; the rich shroud of darkness around them--Eustace began to wonder if he were really made of flesh and blood...", "...at, all the time was looking like a red-headed thunder-storm--\"as the kindest-hearted kitten that ever was! \"And now, I assure you, sir, this reprehensible practical joking--for which I beg your indulgence--definitely is ended; and I am glad to promise that you will find in evidence, during the remainder of your stay in Palomitas, only the friendliness and the courtesy which truly are the essential characteristics of our seemingly turbulent little town.\" The Hen stopped for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> to get her wind back--which give the boys a chance to study over what they was told they was, and what kind of a town it turned out to be they was living in--and then off she went again, saying: \"I beg that you will pardon me, sir, for addressing you so informally, without waiting for an introduction. We do not always stand strictly on etiquette here in Palomitas; and I saw that I had to put my cards down quick--I mean that I had to intervene hurriedly--to save you from being...", "...his remark unfinished, disappeared within the vestry. At the organ Mrs. Barter was drawing out stops in readiness to play her husband into church, and her eyes, half-shining and half-anxious, were fixed intently on the vestry door. The Squire and Mrs. Pendyce, now almost abreast, came down the aisle and took their seats beside their daughters and the General in the first pew on the left. It was high and cushioned. They knelt down on tall red hassocks. Mrs. Pendyce remained over a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> buried in thought; Mr. Pendyce rose sooner, and looking down, kicked the hassock that had been put too near the seat. Fixing his glasses on his nose, he consulted a worn old Bible, then rising, walked to the lectern and began to find the Lessons. The bell ceased; a wheezing, growling noise was heard. Mrs. Barter had begun to play; the Rector, in a white surplice, was coming in. Mr. Pendyce, with his back turned, continued to find the Lessons. The service began. Through a...", "...many warriors on this side, which, with the exception of the river, was quite similar in appearance to the other. The shadowy figures were observed moving noiselessly in a dozen different directions, their heads bent down and their bodies crouching, as if in expectation of a shot, but, at the same time, they were not to be frightened off by any fusilade from within. \"We're just too late,\" remarked the Professor, quick to take in every point of the situation; \"we might have done it a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> ago, but they are watching too closely now.\" \"Let's open again,\" suggested the New Englander. \"Better wait awhile; they can be stampeded easier then than now,\" was the reply of the Professor. During this lull, when it may be said the defenders were becoming accustomed to the siege, they had time to give a few minutes' thought to their absent friends, Fred Ashman and Ziffak, regarding whom it was natural to feel great curiosity. They believed themselves warranted in...", "...talking with Mr. Howard for nothing, I see.\" \"No, not for nothing,\" said Helen gently. \"A nice state of affairs!\" continued the other angrily; \"I knew pretty well that his head was full of nonsense, but when I asked him here I thought at least that he would know enough about good manners to mind his own affairs. So he has been talking to you, has he? And now you cannot possibly marry a rich man!\" Mrs. Roberts stopped, quite too angry to find any more words; but as she sat for a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> or two, gazing at Helen, it must have occurred to her that she would not accomplish anything in that way. She made an effort to swallow her emotions. \"Helen, dear,\" she said, sitting down near her niece, \"why will you worry me in this dreadful way, and make me speak so crossly to you? I cannot tell you, Helen, what a torment it is to me to see you throwing yourself away in this fashion; I implore you to stop and think before you take this step, for as sure as you are alive...", "...service shall receive official mention.\" Then he bowed low, and when he rose he was eleven feet high. As he swelled out past me he covertly pulled down the corner of his eye with his finger and muttered part of that defiled refrain, \"Oh, tears, ah, tears, oh, sad sweet tears!--name in General Orders--personal mention to the King, you see!\" I wished Joan could have seen his conduct, but she was busy thinking what she would do. Then she had me fetch the knight Jean de Metz, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">minute</span> he was off for La Hire's quarters with orders for him and the Lord de Villars and Florent d'Illiers to report to her at five o'clock next morning with five hundred picked men well mounted.
