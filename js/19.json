His mother was Anne Becher, whose father was also in the Company's service. She married early in India, and was only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> when her son was born. She was left a widow in 1816, with only one child, and was married a few years afterwards to Major Henry Carmichael Smyth, with whom Thackeray lived on terms of affectionate intercourse till the major died. All who knew William Makepeace remember his mother well, a handsome, spare, gray-haired lady, whom Thackeray treated with a courtly deference as well as constant affection. There was, however, something of discrepancy between them as to matters of...", "...the, to him, eventful day of Wednesday, March 12, 1777. He was visited on Thursday by Monsieur Delaunay, the governor of the Bastile, and on Friday by the lieutenant of police, each accompanied to the cell door by soldiers. Each tried by questions, vague promises, and implied threats, to make him speak of the Brotherhood. Their attempts failing, the governor visited him a week later, thinking imprisonment might have had effect upon him. The governor spoke incidentally of the dungeons, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> feet below the level of the courtyard, and five feet below that of the ditch, their only opening being a narrow loophole to the latter. But Dick only smiled. A fortnight elapsed before the governor's next appearance, and still Dick was as silent on the one topic as ever. The hint as to the dungeon was not carried out. Perhaps the worthy governor received more money for the food of a prisoner in an upper cell than for that of a prisoner in a dungeon, and consequently could make...", "...Ticktock and he seemed interested in it too. After you finished bidding I got three separate and distinct winks from your horse. Since I understand he's a full partner of the firm I considered his bids binding and sold him the saddle.\" Jim was still too troubled to worry whether the colonel was kidding him or not. He wouldn't put it past Ticktock to have winked at the auctioneer. The idea that the mustang might bid on the saddle didn't seem at all absurd to Jim. \"But I have only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> dollars,\" he protested weakly. \"Perfectly all right,\" said the colonel jovially. \"This is one exception we'll make to the rule of cash on the barrel head. I've already paid for the saddle. I'll take it out of your wages. Now quit worrying about the matter.\" Jim quit worrying.

The body resembled a well-preserved mummy. The features were very distinct, and were those of a woman whose age could not at the time of her death have exceeded eighteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years. The head was partially covered with the white dress. Long black hair was still clinging to the scalp, and was parted across the forehead and carried behind the ears.

This technically is what we call profit-sharing.

The rate at which population is likely to increase may, perhaps, be determined by political economists from the following data.

Of these were remaining in 1800, one man and five women, with <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> children, the eldest nine years of age, making in the whole twenty-five. In 1808, Mr. Folger makes the population amount to thirty-five, being an increase of ten in eight years. In 1814, six years afterwards, Sir Thomas Staines states the _adult_ population at forty, which must be a mistake, as fourteen years before, nineteen of the twenty-five then existing were children.

In the remaining twentieth part how few are readers? And among such as are so, twenty amuse themselves with romances to one who studies philosophy.

After some delay, a treaty was entered into between the contending armies, and the Danes agreed to fall back upon York; the river Idel, which is so narrow that the points of two long lances would meet, if held by a tall chieftain on either shore, was the slender barrier that divided the opposing nations; a roe-buck from a rising summit could readily overleap it, and in an hundred places it was fordable.

This forbearance is greatly censured by the early historians, but we must bear in mind that Alfred was not yet king, and that Ethelred but came up as an ally on the side of Mercia.

After <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years in which to learn every line of her face and body, every secret of her nature, she still eluded him; that elusiveness, which had begun by being such a charm, had got on his nerves, and extinguished the flame it had once lighted. He had so often tried to see, and never seen, the essence of her soul. Why was she made like this? Why was she for ever mocking herself, himself, and every other thing? Why was she so hard to her own life, so bitter a foe to her own...", "...elicit from him. \"Father gave it to me; to-day is my birthday.\" \"Your birthday; so?\" said Von Barwig, still marking time. \"Your birthday?\" he repeated. \"Yes, mio maestro; I am nineteen to-day.\" \"Nineteen!

But there was a far-away look in his eyes, as if he were trying to recall something. \"Nineteen to-day; <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> to-day!\" he repeated, as if he had not quite realised what she said. \"One, two, three; one, two, three.\" Was there a break in his voice? \"Nineteen to-day!\" Then he looked at her as she played. \"Where were you born?\" he asked suddenly. \"In Leipsic,\" she replied carelessly. Von Barwig stopped counting, his baton poised in the air. \"In Leipsic!\" he repeated hoarsely. \"In Leipsic? She--would have been nineteen to-day. Ach Gott, Gott!\" Helene turned and looked...", "...for me, the cursed brutality of the man made me angry. \"Very well,\" I said. \"I won't take it.\" CHAPTER XXVI Having burned my ship, I plunged into writing. I am afraid I always was an extremist. Early and late I was at it--writing, typing, studying grammar, studying writing and all the forms of writing, and studying the writers who succeeded in order to find out how they succeeded. I managed on five hours' sleep in the twenty-four, and came pretty close to working the <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> waking hours left to me. My light burned till two and three in the morning, which led a good neighbour woman into a bit of sentimental Sherlock-Holmes deduction. Never seeing me in the day-time, she concluded that I was a gambler, and that the light in my window was placed there by my mother to guide her erring son home. The trouble with the beginner at the writing game is the long, dry spells, when there is never an editor's cheque and everything pawnable is pawned. I...", "...hall will accommodate one thousand. Dr. Cuyler, during the thirty-seven years of his ministry, has delivered five thousand three hundred and forty discourses, and a multitude of platform addresses. He has received four thousand and forty-one persons into church membership, of whom about one-half have been on confession of faith. He has published several volumes and over two thousand articles in the leading religious newspapers. The present membership of the Lafayette Avenue Church is <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred and twenty persons. His congregations are very large on every Sunday, and he is an untiring pastor, especially zealous for temperance. He preaches the old orthodox gospel, with no \"modern improvements.\" His discourses are able and eloquent, while his chief aim in the pulpit is to reach the heart. Justin D.

He was born in 1828, in Sherburne, Madison County, New York, and literally worked his way through...", "...I feel the less inclined to do so because I was ill-advised enough after my return to publish that story in a volume called \"The Land of the Bey.\" The most interesting fact connected with that volume is one that happened in quite recent years. A gentleman from the Inland Revenue Office called upon me, and in a most courteous manner drew my attention to the fact that I had not, in my income-tax returns, included the profit I had received from this book. It had taken the department just <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years to discover the existence of this precious volume. The discovery, though belated, did great credit to the zeal and industry of somebody connected with the Inland Revenue, for I am convinced that he is the only person, myself excepted, who knew that the book had been written. I had clean forgotten its existence myself when it was recalled to my memory in this amusing fashion. My visitor from the Inland Revenue Office smiled sweetly when I explained to him why no profits...", "...A Yankee schoolboy of ten years would have proved to be a veritable Solomon compared with our cockney fellow-passenger.

At the school concert in 1822, Glinka was the show pupil and played Hummel's A minor Concerto, Meyer accompanying him on a second piano. With the violin he made less progress, although he took lessons from Bohm, a distinguished master and virtuoso who had not, however, so Glinka declared, the gift of imparting his own knowledge to others. Bohm would sigh over his pupil's faulty bowing and remark: \"_Messieu Klinka, fous ne chouerez chamais du fiolon._\" Glinka's repertory at <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> contained nothing more profound than the virtuoso music of Steibelt, Herz, Hummel and Kalkbrenner. Although Beethoven had already endowed the world with his entire series of sonatas, and was then at the zenith of his fame, his music only began to make headway in Russia some ten years later. As time went on, Glinka heard and met most of the great pianists of his day, and his criticisms of their various styles are unconventional and interesting, but would lead us far away from...", "...were people after his own heart. In 1803 he took thought for the vexed condition of the Swiss people and summoned to Paris the \"Helvetic Consulta\" of sixty-three Swiss representatives to draw up a new system of government. He presided personally at the meetings of this body, and the constitution agreed upon bears the impress of the grand political sagacity which was associated with Napoleon's military genius. Switzerland, under the Napoleonic constitution, became a Federal Republic of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> cantons, each of which preserved its local autonomy but yielded full control of national matters to the Federal Diet. This new constitution conferred upon Switzerland internal peace and a reasonable instrument of government, under which the material and moral advancement of the nation was greater than at any previous period of history.

The...", "...But the judges declared it to be a phantom sent by the Evil One, since the confession of the criminals was worth more than mere ocular proof, and the women were burnt accordingly. (Horst. Demonomagie, i. p. 349.) The most signal proof of the absurdity of all such charges was obtained in our own country. Here the number of those who complained of being plagued and injured by demoniac agencies became larger in precise proportion as trials increased and condemnations succeeded. But when <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> of the accused had been executed, and the judges becoming appalled at the daily growing number of complaints, set some of the prisoners free, and declined to arrest others, there was suddenly an end of these grievances, no more accounts of enchantment and witchcraft were heard, and soon the evil disappeared entirely. It was a similar return to reason which at last led in Europe also to a reaction. The Doge of Venice and the Great Council appealed to the pope, Leo X., to put...", "...a feast which would leave no beneficial traces behind it. He advocated the application of the fund to the purchase of a tract of three hundred acres of land in the neighbourhood of the city, and to the erection thereon of an asylum for the poor. His motion to this effect was carried by a considerable majority, but it was subsequently rescinded, and the money was spent as had first been proposed. It may be mentioned in this connection that when the Prince of Wales visited Montreal nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years afterwards, Mr. Young was Chairman of the Reception Committee. In politics, as well as in commercial matters, Mr. Young entertained liberal views. At the general election of 1844 he was appointed Returning Officer, a position which was far from being a sinecure. The memorable struggle between Sir Charles Metcalfe and his late ministers was then at its height, and was maintained with relentless bitterness on both sides.

Now, seriously, you will hardly maintain that the hat could not rise to the price of nineteen shillings--or of any higher sum? _X_. Recollect, Philebus, what it is that I maintain; assuredly the hat may rise to the price of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> shillings, or of any higher sum, but not as a consequence of the cause you assign. Taking your case, I _do_ maintain that it is impossible the hat should exceed, or even reach, eighteen shillings. When I say eighteen shillings, however, you must recollect that the particular sum of twelve shillings for labor, and six shillings for profits, were taken only for the sake of illustration; translating the sense of the proposition into universal forms, what I assert is, that the...", "...had come upon her heart when she had been severed from the man she had loved. \"Not but that it has been all for the best,\" she had said. \"Not but that Plantagenet has been to me all that a husband should be. Only if she can be spared what I suffered, let her be spared.\" Even when these things had been said to her, Mrs. Finn had found herself unable to ask questions. She could not bring herself to inquire whether the girl had in truth given her heart to this young Tregear. The one was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and the other as yet but two-and-twenty! But though she asked no questions she almost knew that it must be so. And she knew also that the father, as yet, was quite in the dark on the matter. How was it possible that in such circumstances she should assume the part of the girl's confidential friend and monitress? Were she to do so she must immediately tell the father everything. In such a position no one could be a better friend than Lady Cantrip, and Mrs. Finn had already...", "...put to the test.

She was returning to Brest. The Nottingham had sixty guns and four hundred men. After an engagement of two hours within pistol shot, in which the Mars had twenty-three killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> wounded, she struck. On board the Nottingham only three men were killed and nine wounded, which was attributed to the superior seamanship of the Captain, who obtained an advantageous position in the battle.

He received congratulations from all his friends, and particularly from the Lords...", "...who visits them; and in the Museum of the Breda there are many interesting works. The terra-cotta decoration of the Ospedale excels all other works of this sort in upper Italy, and the immense facade of this edifice is a marvel in its way (Figs. 89, 90). The differences between this hospital and the wonderful Milan Cathedral afford a remarkable contrast in works of the same period. GIOVANNI ANTONIO AMADEO, or OMODEO (1447-1520), was born on a farm near the Certosa of Pavia. When but <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years old his name appears as one of those who were employed upon this splendid edifice, and the records of his payments show that his work was well considered, even then. Omodeo was undoubtedly the best sculptor of his time in all Lombardy, and his sculptures in the Colleoni Chapel at Bergamo would be sufficient to make any artist famous. The whole work may be called his, for he designed the building and the sculptures of the facade, which are in the richest style of the...", "...On the following day she visited the Julius Hospital, a noble institution founded by one of the bishops of Wuerzburg. On the 24th she called on the Princess Lichtenstein, the Duke of Aremberg, and the Prince of Baar, and moreover, attended a sermon preached by Prince Hohenlohe in the Haugh parish church. Her recovery was complete. Now, at first sight, nothing seems more satisfactorily established than this miracle. Let us, however, see what Dr. Heine, who had attended her for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> months, had to say on it.

All went serenely until in July 1767 Morley Unwin was thrown from his horse and killed. A very short time before this event the Unwins had received a visit from the Rev. John Newton (q.v.), the curate of Olney in Buckinghamshire, with whom they became friends. Newton suggested that the widow and her children with Cowper should take up their abode in Olney. This was achieved in the closing months of 1767. Here Cowper was to reside for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years, and he was to render the town and its neighbourhood memorable by his presence and by his poetry. His residence in the Market Place was converted into a Cowper Museum a hundred years after his death, in 1900. Here his life went on its placid course, interrupted only by the death of his brother in 1770, until 1773, when he became again deranged. It can scarcely be doubted that this second attack interrupted the contemplated marriage of Cowper with Mary Unwin, although...", "...forests have preserved two very interesting survivals of antiquity--the mouflon, and the Corsican or Sardinian bandit. The Corsican bandit, like the mouflon of the same island, is nearly extinct. In Sardinia both still flourish. THE ARGALI This animal is found in Siberia and Mongolia, and also in Tibet. It is the largest of all living wild sheep, and is about as big as a large donkey, and has enormous twisted and wrinkled horns, which are sometimes as much as four feet long, and <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> inches round at the base. The male Tibetan argali has a ruff on the throat. The usual color is a stony gray, mingled with white in summer in the case of the old males. The argali rams are very fond of fighting one another, and such fierce conflicts take place that sometimes their horns are broken short off, and left lying upon the ground. And it will give you some idea of the size of these horns when we tell you that more than once a fox has been found lying fast asleep in...", "...side of the church and the other on the Kentucky side; and the men and boys would lean their guns up against the wall, handy, and then all hands would join in with the prayer and praise; though they say the man next the aisle didn't kneel down, along with the rest of the family; kind of stood guard.

Before the rearguard could come up, sixteen of the total American force were killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> badly wounded. This battle of San Pascual, as it was called, is interesting as being the only engagement in which the Californians got the upper hand. Whether their Parthian tactics were the result of a preconceived policy or were merely an expedient of the moment, it is impossible to say. The battle is also notable because the well-known scout, Kit Carson, took part in it.

The Dark Side of Hellfde. That to Christian life in each of the past <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> centuries there is a dark side, is an obvious fact. But as the dark side has been constantly regarded as the bright side by the Christians of each century, our task in discovering it must not consist merely of a study of old records.

At first I believed Mr Miller was a person of means, but one day a man who said he had known him, told me that he was a `crook'. I admit I could not discover what was the source of his income.

She seemed then to be a mere slip of a girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> or so, extremely pretty, with her dark hair dressed low and tied with a broad bow of black ribbon. The men who frequented the place always addressed her as `_Bebe_,' and would sometimes take her boxes of chocolate. One evening after dinner somebody suggested a hand at cards, when suddenly I caught Miller doing a trick, and I stood up and openly denounced him. It may have been foolish of me, but I spoke without reflecting.

The one on the right end had lost his hat through some accident. He had fair hair that caught the sun. This was the critical moment.

And about that time it appears that sickness of some virulent and deadly kind broke out aboard her--the log does not specify what it was, possibly because the skipper did not know--and within twenty-four hours all hands were down with it. The entry conveying this information is the last in the book, and the rest can only be guessed at; but it must have been pretty bad, for there were <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> corpses on board her, which is clear enough evidence that the living were too ill to dispose of the dead. And that, I think, is all I need tell you.

Of the British missing and prisoners, one hundred and sixty-nine were reported by the Americans as in their hands; among them <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> officers.

The Americans had present for duty two thousand six hundred and forty-four, including over four hundred militia; Drummond in his report states that first and last he had upon the field not more than two thousand eight hundred.

As I picked myself up, and to my amazement found myself uninjured, I saw Blenkiron rubbing the dust out of his eyes and arranging a disordered card.

'Say, Major,' he cried, 'I believe this game of mine is coming out.' I was now pretty well mad. The thought that old Peter had won, that we had won beyond our wildest dreams, that if we died there were those coming who would exact the uttermost vengeance, rode my brain like a fever.

The people who joke and talk lightly about marriage do not seem to have the faintest rational conception of the awful nature of the subject. Awful it is; and, as serious men go through life, they become more and more impressed with the momentous results which depend on the choice made by a man or woman. A lad of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> lightly engages himself; he knows nothing of the gloom, the terror, the sordid horror of the fate that lies before him; and the unhappy girl is equally ignorant. In fourteen years the actual substance of that young fellow's very body is twice completely changed; he is a man utterly different from the boy who contracted the marriage; there is not a muscle or a thought in common between the boy and the man--yet the man takes all the consequences of the boy's act. Supposing that...", "...one of the tins in demonstration.

It had two doors, one leading into the passage and another into the dormitory, so that she could keep an eye upon the <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> inmates. It was a very unnecessary arrangement to have her so near, the girls considered, for she would come popping in immediately if they made a noise. They envied the Sixth, who slept in little bedrooms along the corridor, and wished Miss Gibbs had possessed a lesser sense of duty and a greater appreciation of luxury, so that she might have chosen a more comfortable and spacious bedroom elsewhere.

And from the whole passage there comes a picture of what sort of thing a meeting of the primitive Church for worship was, very different from anything that we see nowadays. 'Every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath an exhortation.' I fancy that some of the eminently respectable and utterly dead congregations which call themselves Christian Churches would be very much astonished if they could see what used to be the manner of Christian worship <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred years ago, and would get a new notion of what was meant by 'decently, and in order.' But we may fairly, I suppose, if once we confess that this is so, widen somewhat the scope of these words, and take them rather as expressive of the Apostle's desire and injunction, for the word that he used here, 'I will,' is a very strong one, to all Christian people, be they men or women, that they pray 'everywhere,' in the widest sense of that expression, 'lifting up holy hands...", "...case they are treated as if they were sons.

From that year to 1876 these heroic women of South Newbury persisted in offering their votes at the town, state and presidential elections; and though always refused, they would repair to another room with the few noble men who sustained them, and there duly cast their ballots for justice and equality. On one occasion they polled fifty votes--thirty-one women and <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> men. In 1876 they adopted a series of stirring resolutions with a patriotic declaration of principles. In 1873, large meetings were held, and a memorial sent to the constitutional convention, asking for an amendment, that \"the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged to any adult citizen except for crime, idiocy or lunacy.\" On January 12, 1874, a political club was organized,[294] which has been active in holding meetings and...", "...industry on the lower Columbia and holding a large trade. Improvements followed as a matter of course. In 1876 the Western Union Telegraph Company completed its line between Portland and Astoria, and Robert Mason & Company constructed a building and entered into the production of oil from salmon heads.

At Kinney's from September, 1876, to January, 1877, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> thousand five hundred cases of beef and five hundred cases of mutton were packed. This industry seems never to have gotten beyond the experimental stage in Astoria, owing largely to the difficulty of securing cattle at a fair price and to the lack of facilities for and experience in handling the meat. During the season of 1877 there were eleven canneries in operation in Astoria and more than a thousand fishing boats were in use on the river.

In 1860 he had spent nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years afloat--eighteen years and four months on shore duty, and ten years and ten months either waiting orders or on leave of absence. Forty-eight of his fifty-eight years had been spent in the naval service. In April, 1861, came the rebellion.

He remained a prisoner in England for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years, and became in his prison a student and a famous poet. With the exception of occasional troubles with the Welsh and with the French, the rest of King Henry's reign was quiet enough. But, the King was far from happy, and probably was troubled in his conscience by knowing that he had usurped the crown, and had occasioned the death of his miserable cousin.

The traditional date is 1505; but it has been shown with much reason that the more likely date is 1513 or 1514.

His own preaching continued the work of the martyr until June, 1547, when St. Andrews was captured by the French fleet and Knox was made a galley slave for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> months.

Escaping from prison, Mary fled into England (1568). Here she threw herself upon the generosity of her cousin Elizabeth, and entreated aid in recovering her throne. But the part which she was generally believed to have had in the murder of her husband, her disturbing claims to the English throne, and the fact that she was a Catholic, all conspired to determine her fate. She was placed in confinement, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years she remained a prisoner. During all this time Mary was the centre of innumerable plots and conspiracies on the part of the Catholics, which aimed at setting her upon the English throne.

Her husband was postmaster in the old Danish city Serampoor. He was a highly educated man, about forty years of age, with fine, affable manners. His wife was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years old, and they had been married nine years. With the exception of the queen of Kutch Behar and a few in the Zenana mission, she was the first educated Hindoo woman that I had met. Her husband had given her an excellent education.

The site of the terrace and the covered galleries which were fired were also traced on the ground. _Plate 32_ represents the slope which was the scene of the struggle: the terrace, the tower, and the covered galleries are represented on it, as well as the subterranean gallery, according to a very exact survey made on the spot.

The weather being too cold for them to proceed on the journey, they decided to camp in that locality for the winter.

ARCADIUS, of Antioch, Greek grammarian, flourished in the 2nd century A.D. According to Suidas, he wrote treatises on orthography and syntax, and an onomaticon (vocabulary), described as a wonderful production. An epitome of the great work of Herodian on general prosody in twenty books, wrongly attributed to Arcadius, is probably the work of Theodosius of Alexandria or a grammarian named Aristodemus. This epitome ([Greek: Peri Tonon]) only includes <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> books of the original work; the twentieth is the work of a forger of the 16th century. Although meagre and carelessly put together, it is valuable, since it preserves the order of the original and thus affords a trustworthy foundation for its reconstruction.

When the whole truth was known, it caused much comment. Of course ladies had painted, but to work with the hands in wet clay and be covered with marble dust--to say the least, Miss Conway was eccentric. She at once began the study of anatomy under Cruikshanks, modelling with Cerrachi, and the handling of marble in the studio of Bacon. Unfortunately for her art, she was married at <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> to John Darner, eldest son of Lord Milton, a fop and spendthrift, who had run through a large fortune. He committed suicide nine years after his marriage.

In 1798 there were thirty thousand poor, or about one fifth of the population of Rome, upon the lists of the curates of the several parishes. Under the administration of the French, up to 1814, the proportion had been diminished to one ninth. Since that period it has been on the increase. There are in Rome nineteen hospitals for the treatment of the sick. In eight public hospitals the average number of patients daily is about fourteen hundred, who cost <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> cents each per day. There are fourteen semi-convents where young girls are gratuitously received and educated, receiving a small dowry when they leave to marry or become nuns.

By the courtesy of some members of the Jesuit body in London, I procured a tracing of the signature of Clavius from Rome, and the shapes of the letters, and the modes of junction and disjunction, put the matter beyond question. Even the extra space was explained; he wrote himself Cla_u_ius. Now in 1556, Clavius was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years old: it thus appears probable that the framer of the Gregorian Calendar was selected, not merely as a learned astronomer, but as one who had attended to the calendar, and to works on its reformation, from early youth. When on the subject I found reason to think that Clavius had really read this work, and taken from it a phrase or two and a notion or two.

It was the age at which the Hebrew men ripened and were not only allowed, but obliged to look after their family and other affairs. When the young man had finished the prayers and approached the table to take his place, there was heard a voice from among those present, enouncing the words in such a way that they seemed sung: \"Meir, where have you been for such a long time?

And this was not enough; Colbert went on: 'Those who may seem to have absolutely renounced marriage should be made to bear additional burdens, and be excluded from all honours; it would be well even to add some mark of infamy.' The unfortunate bachelor seems to have been treated somewhat as a public malefactor. Talon issued an order forbidding unmarried...", "...repeated scourgings at the hands of their master.

Now it so fell out that our first supercargo, Gilles Miebas Van Luck, bore me a grudge, although I could recall no act on my part upon which to attribute it, unless it be that I had gained the favour of the captain, of which I could see Van Luck was jealous. From the first Van Luck made no secret of his dislike of me, and more than once he complained to Hartog that by reason of my youth; I being at the time of sailing but <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years old, it would be more seemly if I took my meals with the men in the forecastle instead of in the cabin. But Hartog had overruled his objections. As his secretary he maintained I was entitled to berth with the officers, and after my rescue from the inhospitable shores of Terra Australis I continued to occupy my former place at the captain's table, although I would as lief have messed with the men sooner than have been the cause of a quarrel.

His life has three divisions--thirty years at Florence, nearly twenty years at Milan, then <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of wandering, till he sinks to rest under the protection of Francis the First at the Chateau de Clou. The dishonour of illegitimacy hangs over his birth. Piero Antonio, his father, was of a noble Florentine house, of Vinci in the Val d'Arno, and Leonardo, brought up delicately among the true children of that house, was the love-child of his youth, with the keen, puissant nature such children often have.

Neither the Acropolis of Athens, nor the Larissa of Argos, nor even Gibraltar, can enter into the remotest competition with this gigantic citadel.'

Objects of this class, together with the mournful Pelasgic remains, the ruins or ruined plans which point back to Egypt, and to Phoenicia, these may serve as a further bribe to the tourist in Greece. If a collection of all the objects in every class, according to the best order of succession for the traveller, were arranged skilfully, we believe that a maritime circuit of Greece, with a few landings and short excursions, would bring the whole of what is...", "...which impressed the hand-like foot-prints. At a later period, footprints of birds were discovered upon the surfaces of a thin-bedded sandstone belonging to the New Red formation on the banks of the Connecticut River, in North America. The birds, according to Sir Charles Lyell, must have been of various sizes; some as small as the sand-piper, and others as large as the ostrich, the width of the stride being in proportion to the size of the foot. There is one set, in which the foot is <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> inches long, and the stride between four and five feet, indicating a bird nearly twice the size of the African ostrich. So great a magnitude was at first a cause of incredulity; but the subsequent discovery of the bones of the Moa or Dinornis of New Zealand, proved that, at a much later time, there had been feathered bipeds of even larger bulk, and the credibility of the _Ornithichnites Giganteus_ has accordingly been established.

But the truth of the matter was that he had neither been an outlaw for a fraction of the twentieth year, nor even for anything like <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years. He was outlawed at the Thing held in 1016, his year of outlawry dated from Thing to Thing; this talk befell in 1031, consequently he had been full fifteen years and no fraction of a year in outlawry.

During the day of January 5, 1917, French artillery fire dispersed the attackers, who fled from the field, leaving a number of prisoners in French hands. The British troops along the Somme continued their raids on German positions every night and frequently during the day. In the afternoon of January 7, 1917, they attacked a German trench south of Armentieres, and after bombing the German defenses retired in good order with <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> prisoners. On the same date a German contingent after a preliminary bombardment attempted to penetrate British trenches southwest of Wytschaete. The attackers evidently expected that their heavy gunfire had demoralized the defenders and looked for an easy victory, but they were speedily repulsed with considerable losses. Another attempt made under cover of a heavy bombardment to seize British advance posts to the north of Ypres also met with disaster.

He brought up various animals, highly organized, from a depth of about <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred fathoms. Yet, in spite of this positive evidence added to the former observations of Ehrenberg, and to those of Sir James Ross, who, in the Antarctic Sea, brought up an Euryale on a sounding-line from a depth of eight hundred to a thousand fathoms, naturalists were slow to believe that the distribution of animal life in the ocean was not limited to the shallow depths assigned by Edward Forbes.

With the energy peculiar to his class he set to work. The distance of the rock from the beach was about two hundred and forty yards; the depth of water above it at spring tides about <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> feet. Being exposed to the open sea, a considerable surf is raised on it at times by the prevailing winds, even in summer; while in winter the sea bursts over with such force as to render all operations on it impossible.

At any rate, Burton early showed a love for travel which circumstances strengthened. Although born in Hertfordshire, England, he spent much of his boyhood on the Continent, where he was educated under tutors. He returned for a course at Oxford, after which, at twenty-one, he entered the Indian service. For <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years he was in the Bombay army corps, the first ten in active service, principally in the Sindh Survey, on Sir Charles Napier's staff. He also served in the Crimea as Chief of Staff to General Blatsom, and was chief organizer of the irregular cavalry. For nearly twenty-six years he was in the English consular service in Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe.

Then, too, the boy was shy. No, there was nothing in his past, of not yet quite <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years, to go by. He was not of those youths who are always thinking of conquests. The very idea of conquest seemed to him vulgar, mean, horrid. There must be many signs indeed before it would come into his head that a woman was in love with him, especially the one to whom he looked up, and thought so beautiful. For before all beauty he was humble, inclined to think himself a clod.

The only part on which there may be some difference between admirers is the final simile of the Tyrian trader. This finishes off the piece in <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> lines, of which the poet was--and justly--proud, which are quite admirable by themselves, but which cannot perhaps produce any very clear evidences of right to be where they are.

The principal object argued was the admission, or not, of a sentence of the Spiritual Court, in a suit for jactitation of marriage, in an indictment for polygamy. As the judges decided against the admission of such a sentence in bar to evidence, the fact of the two marriages was most clearly proved, and a conviction of course followed.

When Antoninus died, he was forty years old, but from the time of his earliest manhood he had assisted in administering public affairs. Then, after his uncle's death in 161, for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years he reigned as emperor. The barbarians were pressing on the Roman frontier, and a great part of Marcus Aurelius's nineteen years of reign was passed in campaigning. His absences from Rome were numerous and long.

This demand was refused, and Washington then ordered the execution of one officer of equal rank to be chosen by lot from among the prisoners in his hands. The lot fell upon Captain Asgill, of the Guards, who was only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age. The British authorities secured a respite under promise of trying Captain Lippincott by court-martial. After a full inquiry, Lippincott was honourably acquitted. In the meantime, Lady Asgill, Captain Asgill's mother, appealed to the Count de Vergennes, the French Minister, and, in response to her most pathetic appeal, the Count was instructed by the King and Queen of France, in their joint names, to ask of Washington the release of Captain Asgill \"as a tribute to...", "...months produced twenty-four Cantatas, at the rate of more than one a month.(350) Beginning at the New Year of 1725 he wrote eighteen Cantatas in nine months, some of which, however, may belong to the years 1726-7-8-9. But even so, his monthly average seems to have been maintained. For 1730 we have, perhaps, ten Cantatas. For 1731 about twenty survive, of which half a dozen may belong to 1732, a deduction which still preserves Bach's steady average. In 1735 he produced actually <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> Cantatas between the New Year and the following November, though not all of them are positively dated. Thereafter his activity is less certainly measured. But from 1736 till the end of 1744 he composed fifty-three Cantatas, at the rate, that is, of at least six every year, without making allowance for Cantatas written and lost. There are few phenomena in the record of art more extraordinary than this unflagging cataract of inspiration, in which masterpiece followed...", "...only bowed to Charles, enquiring from me whether he was likewise a clerk.

Revolutions in the government now succeed each other with rapidity and violence. Xerxes II. the only legitimate son and successor of Artaxerxes, is slain, after forty-five days' reign, by his bastard brother Sogdianus; the latter, in his turn, after a reign of six months, is deposed by another bastard brother, Ochus, who ascends the throne, and assumes the name of Darius II. 37.

In this period the decline of the state advances with hurried steps; partly by reason of the extinction of the legitimate royal line, partly by the increased practice of placing more than one province, together with the military command, in the hands of the same satrap.

This difference was so slight that they scarcely felt it. They also discarded the apergetic outfits that had been so useful on Jupiter, as unnecessary here.

Hark you now! Would any but these boiled brains of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and two-and-twenty hunt this weather?\" Now this passage has nothing to do with the play, nor with the shepherd's occupation; nor is it at all characteristic of a shepherd boy. Between ten and three-and-twenty a poor shepherd boy is likely to be kept hard at work; he is not idle and at a loose end like young Shakespeare, free to rob the ancientry, steal, fight, and get wenches with child. That, in my opinion, is Shakespeare's own confession. Of course, every one has...", "...at Lord Chiltern and was silent. \"Shall I go?\" said Lord Chiltern.

'Whom having not seen, ye love,' that is a very natural thought in the mind of one whose love to Jesus rested on the ever-remembered blessed experience of years of happy companionship, when addressing those who had no such memories.

There is nothing else in the world parallel to that strange, deep personal attachment which fills millions of hearts to this Man who died <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> centuries ago, and which is utterly unlike the feelings that any men have to any other of the great names of the past.

THERE was once a king, and he had a queen; and he was the manliest of his sex, and she was the loveliest of hers. The king was, in his private profession, under government. The queen's father had been a medical man out of town. They had <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> children, and were always having more. Seventeen of these children took care of the baby; and Alicia, the eldest, took care of them all. Their ages varied from seven years to seven months. Let us now resume our story. One day the king was going to the office, when he stopped at the fishmonger's to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail, which the queen (who was a careful housekeeper) had requested him to send home. Mr. Pickles, the fishmonger, said,...", "...of a peacock.\" \"Of which the corporal was the rump,\" interrupted the doctor.

If there is nothing very surprising in this from a Roman point of view, it is indeed to us both surprising and touching that she should have supported her request by a promise that she would be as much a mother to the expected children as their own mother, and would still be to Lucretius a sister, having nothing apart from him, nothing secret, and taking away with her no part of their inheritance. To us, reading this proposal in cold blood just <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred years after it was made, it may seem foolishly impracticable; to her, whose whole life was spent in unselfish devotion to her husband's interests, whose warm love for him was always mingled with discretion, it was simply an act of pietas--of wifely duty.

Since the days when I had known her at Pasean, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of misery, profligacy, and shame had made her the most debased, the vilest creature that can be imagined. She told us her story at great length; the pith of it might be expressed in six lines.

Here is the playbill which I held in my hand <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years ago, while the great writer was proving himself to be as pre-eminent an actor as he was an author.

Near this I sat, to dream my dreams and watch the colors of the lake, changing hourly, till the sun sank. These hours yielded impulses, wove webs, such as life will not again afford. Returning to the boarding-house, which was also a boarding-school, we were sure to be greeted by gay laughter. This school was conducted by two girls of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and seventeen years; their pupils were nearly as old as themselves. The relation seemed very pleasant between them; the only superiority--that of superior knowledge--was sufficient to maintain authority,--all the authority that was needed to keep daily life in good order.

The poor girl's heart was heavy. She had had so little experience of the world, and none at all of men. Already at an early age she had become motherless; all the care and the tenderness which she had ever known was from the father whose pride in her beauty was far greater than his love for his child. A rigid convent education had restrained the development of her ideals and of her aspirations; at <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age the dominating thought in her was service to her King and country, loyalty and obedience to her father and to the Church. In the crowded ballroom she saw young girls moving freely and gaily, talking and laughing without apparently a care or sorrow; yet they belonged to a subject and rebel race; the laws of a powerful alien government dominated their lives; fear of the Inquisition restrained the very freedom of their thoughts.

They are so delicate as to have little, if any, of the mortal in them. It is also significant that Noguchi in these later years (he is now only a little past thirty), does not reproduce this cosmic atmosphere in his writings to such an extent, due no doubt to the fact that his daily occupation...", "...so if that particular year began late.

For the Jewish calendar is a natural one and regulated both by the sun and the moon. It begins with the new moon, and it also begins as nearly as possible with the spring equinox. But as twelve natural months fall short of a solar year by eleven days, a thirteenth month has to be intercalated from time to time; in every <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years, seven are years having an extra month. Now the 21st day of the fourth month must have fallen on or about July 22 according to our present reckoning, in order that the moon might have sufficient northing, and that involves a year beginning after April 1; so that the year of the battle of Beth-horon must have been an ordinary year, one of twelve months, but must have followed a year of thirteen months.

The national gallery of pictures at Berlin (Kaiser Friedrich Museum), like the British National Gallery, is remarkable for its variety of schools and painters, and for the select type of pictures shown.

He took down a second version of the same ballad, but consisting of only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> stanzas, at Sumbo in 1847, which he published in the _Antiquarisk Tidsskrift_, 1849-50. This second version differs slightly from the one given in our text. In it Arngrim is said to have twelve sons of whom Angantyr was the youngest. Hjalmar is not expressly stated to have been a brother of Angantyr, as he is in our version and in the Danish ballad _Angelfyr and Helmer the Warrior_ (cf. p. 188 ff.). Moreover Angantyr is the first to learn of the franklin's daughter, and he...", "...and encamped on an island about eight miles' distant, having come, during the day, nine miles and a quarter.

In consequence of the accident yesterday evening, we were detained a considerable time this morning, until the boats were repaired, when we set out, and, after ascending a strong rapid, arrived at the portage by John Moore's Island.

He was then a young man of promise, a steady and thrifty mechanic, having worked nine years in the Cumberland Nail and Iron works.

She never returned; and thus his last earthly relative, so far as he knew, departed. Alone he battled his way up. Providence, however,...", "...long and weighs about three pounds.

It is well to inquire, whether the discovery, of which so much is made, is aught else than a misrepresentation. Byron thought Mary and Claire were, within a few months, of the same age. Writing of them in 1820, in the famous _Observations_, he put the case thus ungrammatically, 'Neither of them were, in 1816, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years old,'--_i.e._ in the months of 1816, which they passed chiefly in his society at Geneva. It may be observed that Byron, often an inaccurate, was sometimes an untruthful writer. But spite against Claire, with whom he was quarrelling bitterly in 1820, would have disposed him to exaggerate her age.

The contrast of results mentioned, between her voyage across and her occupancy of British waters, illustrates the comparative advantages of the two scenes of operations, regarded in their relation to British commerce.

He lost his reason in 1703 and died in 1708.

It is in the <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> French armored cruisers--France has no battle cruisers--that the French showed better efforts as builders of speedy ships, for they made 23 knots or more.

Besides studying under Sylvius, Vesalius had for his teacher at Paris the famous Winter, of Andernach, who was physician to Francis I. This learned man, in a work published three years after this period, speaks of Vesalius as a youth of great promise. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> Vesalius returned to Louvain; and here for the first time he openly demonstrated from the human subject. In this connection a somewhat ghastly story is told, which serves to show the intensity of the enthusiasm with which our anatomist was inspired.

A noted robber had been executed. His body...", "...persecution, who will pity him? I should think even bigots would let him alone out of contempt.

Subsequently to his birth, Marshall's parents removed to an estate called Oak Hill, in the western part of Fauquier County.

This protruding curve occurs more frequently on this and other buildings at Uxmal than any other decoration, and usually with the same or similar accompaniments, which may be fancied to represent the features of a monster, of which this forms the nose.

We have now to record the early voyages, fitted out from England, for trading to file East Indies, by THE GOVERNOR AND COMPANY OF MERCHANTS OF LONDON, TRADING INTO THE EAST INDIES.[75] By which stile, or legal denomination, George Earl of Cumberland, Sir John Hart, Sir John Spencer, and Sir Edward Mitchelburne, knights, with 212 others,...", "...that they were the reward of virtue, and after the statement of his being appointed to preside in the Court of King's Bench, adding, \"Where at this very time he is faithfully and boldly doing justice and affording protection to our subjects, according to law, in consequence of which virtues we have thought him fit to be raised to the peerage of this realm.\"[129] He took his seat in the House of Lords on the first day of the meeting of James's only Parliament, along with <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> others either raised in the peerage or newly created since the dissolution of the Oxford Parliament--the junior being John Lord Churchill, afterwards Duke of Marlborough. The journals show that Lord Jeffreys was very regular in his attendance during the session, and as the house sat daily and still met at the same early hour as the courts of law, he must generally have left the business of the King's Bench to be transacted by the other judges. He was now occupied day and night...", "...of the wind, hummed softly, and over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit-trees planted by her father five-and-twenty, years ago. Birds were almost silent, the cuckoos had ceased to sing, but wood-pigeons were cooing. The breath and drone and cooing of high summer were not for long a sedative to her excited nerves. Crouched over her knees she began to scheme. Her father must be made to back her up. Why should he mind so long as she was happy? She had not lived for nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years without knowing that her future was all he really cared about. She had, then, only to convince him that her future could not be happy without Jon. He thought it a mad fancy. How foolish the old were, thinking they could tell what the young felt! Had not he confessed that he--when young--had loved with a grand passion? He ought to understand! 'He piles up his money for me,' she thought; 'but what's the use, if I'm not going to be happy?' Money, and all it bought, did not...", "...not subject to sudden reflexes. \"Your satire is always a bit clumsy, dear,\" she said sweetly. \"The odalisque is not your role at all events.\" \"I don't go in for roles.\" And the four girls wrangled and dreamed and planned, while a city burnt beneath them; some three hundred million dollars flamed out, lives were ruined, exterminated, altered; and Labor sat on the hills and smiled cynically at the tremendous impetus the earth had handed them on that morning of April eighteenth, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred and six. They were too young to know or to care. When the imagination is trying its wings it is undismayed even by a world at war. CHAPTER V I That night Alexina knew that romance had surely come to her. She shared her room with three old ladies who slept fitfully between blasts of dynamite. But she sat at the window with no desire for oblivion. On the lawn paced a young man with a rifle in the crook of his arm. He was tall and young and very...", "...at him from the window, a revelation came to her of what the three years of life with Joel Mazarine had really been. From that moment until she heard the pioneer's wagon, escorted by her husband, bringing the unconscious Orlando Guise to her door, she had lived in a dream which seemed like a year of time to her. Since the early morning of that very day, when Joel had leaned over her bed and asked her in his slow, grinding voice how she was, she had lived more than in all the past <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of her life. The Young Doctor had come and gone, amazed at first, but presently with a look of apprehension in his eyes. There was not much trace of yesterday's illness in the alert, eager girl-wife, who twenty-four hours before had been really nearer to the end of all things than her aged husband. The Young Doctor knew all too well what the curious, throbbing light in her eyes meant. He knew that the gay and splendid Orlando Guise had made the sun for this prismatic...", "...1807, a volume, small octavo, named 'Hours of Idleness'--a title henceforth associated with Byron's early poems--was printed and published by S. and J. Ridge of Newark, and was sold by the following London booksellers: Crosby and Co.; Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme; F. and C. Rivington; and J, Mawman. The full title is, 'Hours of Idleness; a Series of Poems Original and Translated'. By George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor. It numbers 187 pages, and consists of thirty-nine poems. Of these, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> belonged to the original 'Fugitive Pieces', eight had first appeared in 'Poems on Various Occasions', and twelve were published for the first time. The \"Fragment of a Translation from the 9th Book of Virgil's AEneid\" ('sic'), numbering sixteen lines, reappears as \"The Episode of Nisus and Euryalus, A Paraphrase from the AEneid, Lib. 9,\" numbering 406 lines. The final collection, also in small octavo, bearing the title 'Poems Original and Translated', by George Gordon, Lord...", "...followed the names of each of the four horses--all had riders--and \"lord March's groom sat in the carriage. Two or three other carriages had been made before, but disapproved; and several horses killed in trials--to the expence of 6 or 700_l._\" Now such a carriage--there is a print of it by Bodger--was, of course, little more than a freak. It was a mere skeleton, fragile and entirely useless as a mode of conveyance over the ordinary roads. But the knowledge of those <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> miles covered easily within the hour must have set people thinking. Such a speed was almost incredible to those accustomed to five or six miles an hour. The carriage itself was the work of Mr. J. Wright, a coachmaker in Longacre, already becoming the home of his brother tradesmen, and it was doubtless exhibited in London. It showed what could be done, and must have opened out agreeable vistas. Twenty miles an hour was something to aim for, and with the war with France...", "...world, and which we know was ascended, is Etna. Concerning the progress of meteorology, from the time of the ancient Romans to the revival of knowledge in Europe, there is little to say except that during the middle ages meteorology, like other learning, was confined to the monasteries. Speculations were current as to the extent of the atmosphere until, in the middle of the eleventh century, Alhazen, a learned Arab, computed from the duration of twilight that the atmosphere extended <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> leagues above the earth. The same method was applied with more precision by Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and other astronomers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The earliest weather chronicles were probably noted by monks from time to time in almanacks or missals, although when this was done first we do not know. The oldest daily chronicles of the weather extant are those kept by William Merle in Oxford from 1337 to 1344. We owe it to the late Mr. Symons, the English...", "...leisurely about its surface. It has always been famous for its fishing. In Aubrey's time it was \"well known for its carps to the London fishmongers,\" and to-day it holds pike, perch and tench. I heard of no carp. Who would eat a carp? In the bar of the little inn that stands on the edge of Frensham Pond there is an interesting case holding two blackcocks and a grey-hen, whose unhappy lot it was to be shot--perhaps the last of their race seen in this part of Surrey. They were killed <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years ago, in 1889. Actually the last blackcock chronicled in Surrey were a pair seen near Hindhead, I believe in 1906. [Illustration: _The Devil's Jumps, from Frensham Common._] From Frensham Great Pond one may push on to Hindhead, three or four miles to the south-east, or may return to Farnham through Tilford by way of the Little Pond, another broad and shining stretch of water. The way to Farnham is the better, for it means leaving the high road for the natural paths...", "...system; insomuch that what till then used to be enjoined every year throughout all the Churches by the Bishop of Alexandria, might, from that time forward, be most easily known by all men, the occurrence of the fourteenth moon being regularly set forth in its course. This Paschal computation, Theophilus,(975) Bishop of Alexandria, made for the Emperor Theodosius, for a hundred years to come. Cyril(976) also, his successor, comprised a series of ninety-five years in five cycles of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years. After whom, Dionysius Exiguus(977) added as many more, in order, after the same manner, reaching down to our own time. The expiration of these is now drawing near, but there is at the present day so great a number of calculators, that even in our Churches throughout Britain, there are many who, having learned the ancient rules of the Egyptians, can with great ease carry on the Paschal cycles for any length of time, even to five hundred and thirty-two years,(978) if they...", "...favour.\" The same attitude was taken up by other Powers who were appealed to by the still optimistic Dutchmen. General Buller by this time had located himself on Spitz Kop, which stands some 7100 feet high and commands an enormous expanse of country. Here fifty-eight burghers surrendered, and he captured trophies--300,000 bales of supplies, and 300 boxes of ammunition. But the Boers were luckier elsewhere. An engineer convoy under Lieutenant Meyrick, Royal Engineers, with an escort of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> Hussars, in act of repairing telegraph line, was attacked near where the road crosses the Crocodile River. The young officer was wounded and the escort was missing. Generals Pole-Carew and Hamilton meanwhile pushed on, the Boers retreating as they saw themselves in danger. General French surprised the enemy and occupied Barberton on the 13th. He came on sufficient supplies to last three weeks, and made a splendid haul of prisoners, ammunition, and waggons, together with...", "...Serene as thine, which lent it life awhile. 3.

On a large table, which was as white as scrubbing could make it, the tea apparatus was duly arranged. The fire was burning its best, and sent out a ruddy glow, which made every bright thing it fell upon look brighter still. Muffins stood in a shining pile upon the fender, and a corpulent teapot on the top of the oven. Around the table sat two young men of about the ages of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and twenty, and three daughters who might range from eighteen to fifteen. Their mother was by the fire preparing the tea for her husband and children, who had all lately come in from their work. \"Why, Johnson, is that you?\" exclaimed Ned Brierley; \"come in, man, and sit ye down.--Reach him a chair, Esther,\" he said to his youngest daughter. \"Well, Ned,\" said Johnson, sitting down, and drawing back his chair as near the door as he could, \"I thought, maybe, you could give...", "...cutting into them, give an endless variety to the scene; while many a pretty peep may be obtained where the Chines open out to the land, or where the warmly-coloured cliffs glow in the sunlight between the deep blue of the sea and the sombre tints of the heather lands and the pine-clad moor beyond. The clays and sandy beds of these cliffs are remarkable for the richness of their fossil flora. From the white, grey, and brownish clays between Poole Harbour and Bournemouth, no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> species of ferns have been determined. The west side of Bournemouth is rich in Polypodiaceae, and the east side in Eucalypti and Araucaria. These, together with other and sub-tropical forms, demonstrate the existence of a once luxuriant forest that extended to the Isle of Wight, where, in the cliffs bounding Alum Bay, are contemporaneous beds. The Bournemouth clay beds belong to the Middle Eocene period. Westwards from the Pier the cliffs are imposing, on one of the highest...", "...multifarious chronicle which is nominally and mainly devoted to the record of the life and death of Hercules, but into which the serio-comic episode of Mars and Venus and Vulcan is thrust as crudely and abruptly as it is humorously and dramatically presented. The rivalry of Omphale and Deianeira for their hero's erratic affection affords a lively and happy mainspring--not suggested by Caxton--for the tragic action and passion of the closing scenes. At the opening of \"The Iron Age,\" <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years later in date of publication, we find ourselves at last arrived in a province of dramatic poetry where something of consecutive and coherent action is apparently the aim if not always the achievement of the writer. These ten acts do really constitute something like a play, and a play of serious, various, progressive, and sustained interest, beginning with the elopement and closing with the suicide of Helen. There is little in it to suggest the influence of either Homer...", "...which history tells. It was not a war of aggrandisement or of conquest: it was waged to deliver not merely Spain, but the whole of Europe, from that military despotism with which the genius and ambition of Napoleon threatened to overwhelm the civilised world. And on what a scale Great Britain, when aroused, can fight, let the Peninsular war tell. At its close the fleets of Great Britain rode triumphant on every sea; and in the Peninsula between 1808-14 her land forces fought and won <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> pitched battles, made or sustained ten fierce and bloody sieges, took four great fortresses, twice expelled the French from Portugal and once from Spain. Great Britain expended in these campaigns more than 100,000,000 pounds sterling on her own troops, besides subsidising the forces of Spain and Portugal. This \"nation of shopkeepers\" proved that when kindled to action it could wage war on a scale and in a fashion that might have moved the wonder of Alexander or of Caesar,...", "...be hanged, was George. He was placed in prison to await the day of execution, which would give him ten days to prepare for his doom. George was the son of a member of the American Congress, his mother being a servant in the principal hotel in Washington, where members of Congress usually put up. After the birth of George, his mother was sold to a negro trader, and he to a Virginian, who sent agents through the country to buy up young slaves to raise for the market. George was only about <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age, when he unfortunately became connected with the insurrection. Mr. Green, who owned George, was a comparatively good master, and prided himself on treating his slaves better than most men. This gentleman was also the owner of a girl who was perfectly white, with straight hair and prominent features. This girl was said to be the daughter of her own master. A feeling of attachment sprang up between Mary and George, which proved to be more than mere friendship, and...", "...number of good women.\" The most brutal and illegal of all forms of witch procedure had been revived, as if to celebrate the last appearance of the Devil. But the rest of the story is pleasanter. When the case came before the grand jury at the assizes, over which Justice Parker was presiding, \"the bill was not found.\" With this the story of English trials comes to an end. The statute of James I had been practically quashed, and, though it was not to be taken from the law books for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years, it now meant nothing. It was very hard for the great common people to realize what had happened. As the law was breaking down they had shown an increasing tendency to take justice into their own hands. In the case with which we have just been dealing we have seen the accusers infringing the personal rights of the individual, and calling in the constables to help them in their utterly unlawful performances. This was not new. As early as 1691, if Hutchinson may be...", "...proprietor of that collective work, without any such payment; The notice above referred to must be given not more than one year nor less than six months before the date at which the right would have so expired, and must be sent by registered post to the author, or, if he cannot with reasonable diligence be found, advertised in the London Gazette and in two London newspapers: (_b_) where any person has, before the twenty-sixth day of July <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred and ten, taken any action whereby he has incurred any expenditure or liability in connexion with the reproduction or performance of any work in a manner which at the time was lawful, or for the purpose of or with a view to the reproduction or performance of a work at a time when such reproduction or performance would, but for the passing of this Act, have been lawful, nothing in this section shall diminish or prejudice any rights or...", "...directed a heavy artillery fire to cover all the adjacent territory, including the passage leading to the trenches, thereby effecting a complete barrage of the salient front and rear. Soon after the enemy, exceeding two hundred in number, rushed the breaches and wire entanglements on each side of the salient, lifting the barrage in the forefield to permit their passage. It was an elaborate encircling bombardment to achieve a trifling object. An American platoon, numbering only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> men, were corraled by a heavy fire from 77's and 115's, which searched the whole line of trenches communicating with the salient where they were isolated. The French, who had only recently vacated the position to make way for the Americans, estimated that the German shells expended exceeded eight thousand. With the raising of the frontal barrage, the German raiders advanced. They were composed of storm troops, volunteers, machine gunners, artillerymen, pioneers to destroy...", "...While paddling towards us, and, indeed, before we could plainly perceive their canoes, they continued to vociferate loudly; but nothing like a song, nor even any articulate sound, which can be expressed by words, could be distinguished. Their canoes were taken on board by their own desire, plainly intimated by signs, and with their assistance, and they at once came up the side without hesitation. These people consisted of an old man, apparently much above sixty, and three younger, from <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> to thirty years of age. As soon as they came on deck, their vociferations seemed to increase with their astonishment, and, I may add, their pleasure; for the reception they met with seemed to create no less joy than surprise. Whenever they received a present or were shown anything which excited fresh admiration, they expressed their delight by loud and repeated ejaculations, which they sometimes continued till they were quite hoarse and out of breath with the exertion.

He gave up the voyage to Calcutta, sold the Spanish dollars and loaded with coffee and spices for Salem.

When, at length, he arrived in Salem harbor, after <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> months away, his enterprises had reaped a hundred per cent for Elias Hasket Derby and his own share was the snug little fortune of four thousand dollars. Part of this he, of course, invested at sea, and at twenty-two he was part owner of the Betsy, East Indiaman, and on the road to independence.

He professed to have converted Psalmanazar, baptized him, with the Brigadier for godfather, got his discharge from the regiment, and launched him upon London under the patronage of Bishop Compton. Here Psalmanazar, who on his arrival was between <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and twenty years old, became famous in the religious world. He supported his fraud by invention of a language and letters, and of a Formosan religion. To oblige the Bishop he translated the church catechism into 'Formosan,' and he published in 1704 'an historical and geographical Description of Formosa,' of which a second edition appeared in the following year. It contained numerous plates of imaginary scenes and persons.

A senatorial commission was sent to Spain in order to organize, in concert with Scipio, the newly-won provincial territory after the Roman method; and Scipio did what he could to obviate the effects of the infamous and stupid policy of his predecessors. The Caucani for instance, whose shameful maltreatment by Lucullus he had been obliged to witness <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years before when a military tribune, were invited by him to return to their town and to rebuild it. Spain began again to experience more tolerable times. The suppression of piracy, which found dangerous lurking-places in the Baleares, through the occupation of these islands by Quintus Caecilius Metellus in 631, was singularly conducive, to the prosperity of Spanish commerce; and in other respects also the fertile islands, inhabited by a dense population which was...", "...much too fine a gentleman to keep his seat while any lady stood.

He travelled, he read, he acquired facility in <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> languages and fluency in seven. Gradually he conceived the idea of a great work which should place history on an entirely new footing; it should concern itself not with the unimportant and the personal, but with the advance of civilisation, the intellectual progress of man. As the idea developed, he perceived that the task was greater than could be accomplished in the lifetime of one man. What he actually accomplished--the volumes which...", "...duties of the Royal Engineers are the construction and maintenance of barracks and military works generally, while for war purposes the corps is organized into mobile units known as field squadrons and companies for general field-work, and into more highly specialized units for mining, heavy bridging, and railway work.

This elasticity arises from the repulsive force of its particles, and is always equal to the compressive force which it balances.

Twenty cubic inches, introduced into a cannon whose sides are three inches thick, cannot be compressed into <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> inches without bursting it. This non-elastic property of water, with another, that of communicating, when under the action of any force, an equal pressure in all directions, led to the invention of the hydraulic press.

It was a slow heavy countenance, but not without comeliness. The skin was fresh as a child's, the eyes were large, blue, and mild, and the brown hair grew in waves that many a woman might have envied. Indeed had it not been for a short but strongly growing beard, it would have been easy to believe that the countenance was that of a boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> rather than of a man over thirty. Neither time nor care had drawn a single line upon it; it told of perfect and robust health and yet bore the bloom of childhood.

Clark, Wall, and the Lancet give descriptions of cases at the ninth month. Naegele has seen a case at the eighteenth month, and Schmidt and Colly in the second year. Another case is that of a child, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> months old, whose breasts and external genitals were fully developed, although the child had shown no sexual desire, and did not exceed other children of the same age in intellectual development. This prodigy was symmetrically formed and of pleasant appearance. Warner speaks of Sophie Gantz, of Jewish parentage, born in Cincinnati, July 27, 1865, whose menses began at the twenty-third month and had continued regularly up to the time of reporting. At the age of three years...", "...own living, and to do my duty in that state of life, unto which it shall please God to call me.

From cover to cover you find in the \"Mendip Annals\" no single word of social protest, not even of social suspicion.

Prosperous in a worldly way, Kimon was enabled to give this favorite daughter the best educational advantages; and he was justly proud when at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> Xanthippe was graduated from the Minerva Female College with all the highest honors of her class. There was but one thing that cast a shadow upon the old gentleman's happiness, and that was his pain at observing that among all Xanthippe's associates there was one upon whom she bestowed her sweetest smiles; namely, Gatippus, the son of Heliopharnes the plasterer. \"My daughter,\" said Kimon, \"you are now of an age when it becomes a maiden to contemplate marriage as a serious...", "...is also noticeable as the first married bishop who held the see.

There, as here, the games of children are but reproductions of the employments of their parents.

THE TOYS CHILDREN PLAY WITH One day while sitting at table, with our little girl, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> months old, on her mother's knee near by, we picked up her rubber doll and began to whip it violently. The child first looked frightened, then severe, then burst into tears and plead with her mother not to \"let papa whip dolly.\" Few people realize how much toys become a part of the life of the children who play with them. They are often looked upon as nothing more than \"playthings for children.\" This is a very narrow view of their uses and relationships. There is a...", "...Onontio at Montreal. They seemed willing enough to give up their French prisoners, but an unexpected difficulty arose from the prisoners themselves. They had been adopted into Iroquois families; and, having become attached to the Indian life, they would not leave it.

With these, they returned to Montreal, accompanied By a peace embassy of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> Iroquois. Peace, then, was made. \"I bury the hatchet,\" said Callieres, \"in a deep hole, and over the hole I place a great rock, and over the rock I turn a river, that the hatchet may never be dug up again.\" The famous Huron, Kondiaronk, or the Rat, was present, as were also a few Ottawas, Abenakis, and converts of the Saut and the Mountain.

Thus the trick was turned and the Massachusetts Convention ratified the Constitution a few days later by a slender majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> out of a vote of three hundred and fifty-five.[1089] But not without bitter protest. General Thompson remarked that \"he could not say amen to them [the amendments], but they might be voted for by some men--he did not say Judases.\"[1090] The deal by which the Constitutionalists won Hancock was suspected, it appears, for Dr. Charles Jarvis denied that \"these amendments have been artfully introduced to lead to a decision which would not otherwise be had.\"[1091] Madison in New...", "...difficulty of the circus rider's jumping feats.

His work and the parish had no real hold on him; so he had nothing to fall back on, and had become a confirmed invalid, seldom leaving the house and garden even to go to church, and thinking more of his dinner and his health than of all other things in earth or heaven. The only child who remained at home with him was a daughter, a girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> or thereabouts, whose acquaintance we shall make presently, and who was doing all that a good heart and sound head prompted in nursing an old hypochondriac, and filling his place in the parish. But though the old man was weak and selfish, he was kind in his way, and ready to give freely or do anything that his daughter suggested for the good of his people, provided the trouble were taken off his shoulders.

When this is over, each desk has nineteen bundles of checks on it and nineteen slips showing the different totals. Each clerk then adds up these <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> totals, and the grand total resulting shows what all the other banks have against his bank.

In all the nations of Europe, most of the articles produced in the United States were subjected to heavy duties, and some of them were prohibited.

This spot had been appropriated to the negroes' provision ground; and in one place, a portion of their well-cultivated gardens slipped from the brow of the hill, and, still clothed with its vegetable productions, half way filled up one of the chasms, (in breadth from three to four feet,) cleft in the solid ground. Upon the margin of the sea, another deep abyss presents itself.

He then refers to St. Cyril, and the cycle of Victoricius, clearly showing that he was familiar with the entire subject, and probably had in his hands some works which we no longer possess. After referring to the Synod of the Campus Lene, as explained above, and the appeal to Rome in accordance with the ancient statute (mandatum) of the Irish Church, he goes on to say that according to the synodical decree[200] all such \"causae...", "...the most brilliant, eloquent and amazing statesman of his day. Yet if his first efforts had been but moderately successful, he might have been content with mere mediocrity. It was his defeats that nerved him to strive for eminence and win it. But it took hard, persistent work in his case to secure it, just as it did in that of so many others. Byron was stung into a determination to go to the top by a scathing criticism of his first book, \"Hours of Idleness,\" published when he was but <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age. Macaulay said, \"There is scarce an instance in history of so sudden a rise to so dizzy an eminence as Byron reached.\" In a few years he stood by the side of such men as Scott, Southey and Campbell.

In those days there was little literature for children, and there was prejudice against that which was provided. There was especial prejudice in my own household. I think my teacher in school may have shared it. If he were an adult he would read, ostensibly to us, but for himself, something he could tolerate. Yes, it was he; an exception in those days, for in the public schools men seldom taught in \"the grades.\" He must have been a young man, not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> or twenty, waiting to mature in his profession.

I could not believe that there was folly enough, or hatred enough, or stupidity enough, in the world for so desperate a deed. But, alas, it was true. With my eyes closed, I fancied I saw the throngs marching through the streets--consisting of peasants, of merchants, of priests, of princes--to see a girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> burned in the fire, and in all that throng there was not one who had either a kind word or thought for her--her who had given them a country to live in. Abandoned, hated and spat upon, she was left to suffer the cruelest punishment that human _inhumanity_ could devise, or the most perverse imagination invent.

There they not only had the earthquake but a tumult of waves such as never was before seen. The sea went right over the town, and almost every soul there, and at other towns along the coast, perished. There were twenty-three ships in the harbour at Callao, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> of these were sunk and the other four carried half a mile inland.

The abdication of Napoleon had enabled England to turn her undivided attention to America, and one great force was sent against New Orleans, while another was concentrated in Canada, for the purpose of invading New York by way of Lake Champlain. On this latter enterprise, a force of twelve thousand regulars started from Montreal early in August, while the British naval force on the lake was augmented to <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> vessels. On September 11, this fleet got under way, and, certain of victory, sailed into Plattsburg Bay and attacked Macdonough. A terrific battle followed, in which the Saratoga had every gun on one side disabled and had to wear around under fire in order to use those on the other side. But three hours later, every British flag had been struck, and the land force, seeing their navy defeated, retreated hastily to Canada. So riddled were both squadrons that in neither of them...", "...some light on that question.

I shall speak with feeling, of course, for it is impossible not to be moved to the depths by the events which brought a girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> to the stake--but my passion is free from anger or prejudice. I can weep for this young woman without gnashing my teeth on her fanatical persecutors. I am sure I can tell the truth without lying about the Catholic Church.

In her character, as revealed in St. Luke's gospel, we read of her noble, trustful humility in accepting the message of the Annunciation; of her decision and prudence shown in her visit to Elizabeth; of her intellectual power as manifested in the song of the Magnificat; of the contemplative nature with which she watched the growth of Jesus; of her maternal devotion throughout her son's ministry,--and of...", "...woods, and root-inwove morass_.

In the year 1651 the EARL OF CROMARTIE being then <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age saw a plain in the parish of Lockburn covered over with a firm standing wood, which was so old that not only the trees had no green leaves upon them but the bark was totally thrown off, which he was there informed by the old countrymen was the universal manner in which fir-woods terminated, and that in twenty or thirty years the trees would cast themselves up by the roots. About fifteen years after he had occasion to travel the same way and observed that there was...", "...firmly persuaded that the Sergeant was wasting his breath to no purpose on Mrs. Yolland, I sat enjoying the talk between them, much as I have sat, in my time, enjoying a stage play.

Her sister was prettier, but I was beginning to feel afraid of a novice; I thought the work too great. This newly-married lady, who was between <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and twenty years of age, drew upon herself everybody's attention by her over-strained and unnatural manners.

Meanwhile the British general was issuing proclamations calling upon the people of New Jersey to return to their allegiance, and promising them pardon. Many gave up and asked protection. It seemed as if the war were coming to an end, and that all the struggle had been in vain.

His parents were American born, though of Scotch extraction, the ancient name of the family being, it is believed, Campbell. His opportunities for acquiring an education even of the common school order were extremely limited. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> he was apprenticed to his elder brother, Charles, to learn the potter's trade. He served some two years as an apprentice and then worked for his brother as a journeyman potter. While yet in the employ of his brother they together moved to Mendon, Monroe county, where the latter established a pottery. While living here Heber married Vilate Murray, of Victor, a town near Mendon, but in the adjoining county of Ontario. Soon after his marriage he joined the Baptist church.

Between July 16 and July 26 there were despatched 594 troop trains, conveying 186,620 men, 32,410 horses, 3,162 guns and road vehicles, and 995 wagon-loads of ammunition and supplies.

It also includes an account of his expenses during the whole period of his absence from Scotland. The second,[2] though a small volume, contains several distinct portions.

It does look, does it not? as if the sun was going round the earth quite quickly. But actually the earth is going round the sun.

Then the sailors began to murmur one to another, saying: \"This man is a traitor.\" Meanwhile the <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> monks were seated sanctimoniously in the midst, and they were shivering although the month was July and the sun was shining hot and clear, and a gentle breeze filled the sails of the ship as it glided, heavy and full-bellied, over the green waves.

The crime charged against him was that he had written a letter to the Americans at Vincennes apprising them of an Indian attack, and that as a consequence of that letter the attacking party had been captured. One of them was the son of a Wea who had burned an American prisoner at Ouiatenon the preceding summer, and the Weas now charged that this son would be burned by his American captors. Laselle was supposed to be in imminent...", "...distributing trade during the summer was strikingly dull, as the majority of buyers were holding off, in view of the prospective liberal new crops.

President Buchanan's last message had heretofore held the record for speedy passage, going over the route in seven days and <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hours.

Shelley was then <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and Southey thirty-seven; and Southey says, \"Shelley acts upon me as my own ghost might do; he has all my old dreams and enthusiasms: the only difference is the difference of age.\" Many bitter things were said of the handsome, gifted Shelley in his day; but, as Dr. Arnold in his quaint, Luther-like phraseology observes, \"Doubtless it is good for a man to have to do with Mr. Posterity,\" for that impartial judge has done Shelley justice.

Besides these there are thirty-six species not found in Europe, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> are natives of Madeira or the Canaries, three are American, and fourteen are altogether peculiar to the Azores. These latter are mostly allied to species found in Europe or in the other Atlantic islands, while one is allied to an American species, and two are so distinct as to constitute new genera. The following list of these peculiar species will be interesting:-- CARABIDAE. _Anchomenus aptinoides_ Allied to a species from the Canaries. _Bembidium...", "...was the son of a French father who had lived in Warsaw and was teacher in the gymnasium there; his mother was a Polish woman. Chopin's early talent for music was unmistakable, both his parents having been gifted in this direction. The child, therefore, was put at music very young and appeared as a wonder-child at an early age. His teachers were a Bohemian named Zwyny and Joseph Elsner. But the most of his work he must have accomplished by himself, since we find that before he was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> he had written his theme and variations upon \"La Ci Darem la Mano,\" and all his works up to and including the Concerto in E minor, opus 11. It is believed that the so-called second concerto in F minor was also completed before this period.

Nothing is known of his youth and little of his education; but it was a constant tradition of men of his own and the immediately succeeding generation that he had little school learning. Before he was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> he was married, at the end of November 1582, to Anne Hathaway, who was seven years his senior. Their first child, Susannah, was baptized six months later.

I will give another instance which occurred at the office at Queen Square.--A female, apparently no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age, named Jane Smith, and a child just turned of five years old, named Mary Ann Ranniford, were put to the bar, before Edward Markland, Esq., the magistrate, charged with circulating counterfeit coin in Westminster and the county of Surrey, to a vast extent.

One of them was a heavy, gross, dark-skinned man, with the careless bearing of one who had been nursed in a circus. The other was a small, fair-haired youth of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> or twenty years, with limbs as straight and as shapely as the Narcissus, and with joints like the wiry-limbed fauns. His head was round, and his face of a type which would never be called beautiful, although it was strong in feature and attractive in expression. His eyes were small and twinkling, his eyebrows heavy, and his mouth had a peculiar proud curl in it which was never disturbed by the tame smile of the practised performer. He was evidently a foreigner. He went through...", "...her.

Jessy courtseyed her acquiescence in the order just given her, and retired from the apartment to fulfil it. On the following day a travelling carriage, whose panels were adorned with a coronet, drove up to the door of Professor Lockerby. From this carriage descended a young man, apparently between <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and twenty years of age, of the most prepossessing appearance. His countenance was pale, but bore an expression of extreme mildness and benevolence. His figure was tall and slender, but handsomely formed; while his whole manner and bearing bespoke the man of high birth and breeding. On descending from his carriage, the young man was received by the professor with the most respectful deference--too respectful it seemed to be for the taste of him to whom it was addressed, for...", "...robbed my money drawer--have perpetrated a long series of high-handed villanies, and now to-night, because, forsooth, I'll not give you more money to spend on your dissolute companions, you break a chair over my aged head.

He spoke to Clarence Stanley, his adopted son and a beautiful youth of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> summers. In vain did Clarence plead his poverty, his tender age, his inexperience; in vain did he fasten those lustrous blue eyes of his appealingly and tearfully upon Mr. Blinker, and tell him he would make the pecuniary matter all right in the fall, and that he merely shattered a chair over his head by way of a joke. The stony-hearted man was remorseless, and that night Clarence Stanly became a wanderer in the wide, wide world. As he went forth he uttered these words: \"H....", "...extent America's good fortune. With comparatively short intermissions, France and England were engaged in a death struggle from 1793 to 1815, and although Britannia ruled the sea, the belligerents had to resort to neutral shipping.

The imports followed approximately the same curve for the corresponding dates, jumping from <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> millions to seventy-five millions in 1802 and reaching over one hundred thirty-eight millions in 1807.

Nevertheless, Marcus associated Commodus with himself in the empire when Commodus was fourteen and Commodus attained to absolute power when Marcus died.

The loss of the Rebels by the explosion was very great, as also by the heavy artillery fire. The causes of the failure, as decided by the Committee on the Conduct of the War, were: the injudicious formation of the troops assaulting; the halting of Ledlie; lack of proper engineers; and the want of a competent head at the scene of assault.

Over against this there has been an immigration in the years 1895-1905 of thirty persons;...", "...look at her.

Lawrence Washington secured one of these military districts for his brother George, who was then only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age.

He believed he could take a...", "...gentle craft, and for this reason we may not unfairly claim _Robert Morrison_ of Newcastle as a member of the illustrious brotherhood of the sons of St. Crispin. Dr. Morrison was the pioneer of modern missions to China, and did for the people and language of that country what another shoemaker did for the people of Bengal. The youthful Northumbrian had only a plain elementary education, and after he became an apprentice, spent all his spare time in reading religious books. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> he gave up his humble trade and began to study under a minister, who passed him on in two years to the academy at Hoxton, where he made such progress, that in a short time he was sent to London to study Chinese under Sam Tok, a native teacher, with a view to his becoming a missionary to China, in connection with the London Missionary Society. In 1807, he sailed for that country, and his rare gifts as a linguist were shown in the publication of a Chinese version of the Acts of...", "...position in which men have placed themselves, not only in relation to war, but also to all other calamities which they themselves inflict upon themselves. So that, however strange this may appear, the most effective and certain deliverance of men from all the calamities which they inflict upon themselves and from the most dreadful of all--war--is attainable, not by any external general measures, but merely by that simple appeal to the consciousness of each separate man which, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred years ago, was proposed by Jesus--that every man bethink himself, and ask himself, who is he, why he lives, and what he should and should not do.

Here a real absolute, or rather despotic power is pointed out; and we may infer from all these passages, either that the word absolute bore a different sense from what it does at present, or that men's ideas of the English, as well as Irish government, were then different. This latter inference seems juster. The word, being derived from the French, bore always the same sense as in that language. An absolute monarchy, in Charles I,'s answer to the <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> propositions is opposed to a limited; and the king of England is acknowledged not to be absolute: so much had matters changed even before the civil war. In Sir John Fortescue's treatise of absolute and limited monarchy, a book written in the reign of Edward IV., the word absolute is taken in the same sense as at present; and the government of England is also said not to be absolute. They were the princes of the house of Tudor chiefly who introduced that administration which...", "...desolate.

By working every hour she could make a fair wage, but, owing to the uncertain and spasmodic nature of the work, she was unable to depend upon earning enough to maintain even a fair standard of living.

It is well known that the feeling of fear is often very intense among children; and where it is due to ignorance it is not right to laugh it away. Doing so affords no explanation. The ridicule may cause the child to _hide_ his fear, but will not drive the feeling away. Since the feeling of fear is so closely connected with the strange and unknown, the...", "...This necessitated a departure from Timor; so the _Uranie_ weighed anchor and set sail on the 23rd October.

Campbell joined with Schmitz's attorneys, Drew and Barrett, while Frank J. Murphy and Charles H. Fairall appeared with Shortridge and Ach for Ruef. Ach, in moving to set aside or quash the indictments, stated that the motion was made for Schmitz and Ruef jointly, but that the defendants reserved the right to plead and to be tried separately. Ach's motion was based on <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> counts. The point most insisted upon was that Grand Juror Wallace Wise was disqualified because of his having been on a petty trial jury panel during the current year. Wise, being thus disqualified, Ach argued, the whole indictment failed as much as though the whole nineteen Grand Jurors were disqualified.[136] Judge Dunne, after a three days' hearing, swept aside the multitude of technical objections which the various attorneys for the defense had advanced.

A more elaborate investigation of the same kind, based by Professor Campbell in 1900[1536] upon the motions of 280 stars, determined with extreme precision, suffered in completeness through lack of available data from the southern hemisphere. The outcome, accordingly, was an apex most likely correctly placed as regards right ascension, but displaced southward by some fifteen degrees. The speed of twelve miles a second,...", "...the walls.

He adorned the city of Rome with splendid and substantial buildings, and delighted to draw men of merit from obscurity. His faults were, great fondness for war, and persecuting the Christians, which his strong attachment to the heathen ritual in which he had been educated made him consider as a duty, or a proof of sincerity. He died, during an absence from home, of apoplexy, at the age of sixty-three, having reigned <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years. Adrian, the fifteenth Roman Emperor, began his reign in 117. He had received an excellent education. He was an eloquent speaker, and wrote well, both in prose and poetry. One of his greatest virtues was, that he truly loved peace. He treated those who were in humble stations with kindness. He said that the chief ruler of a nation should be \"like the sun, giving warmth to the lowly vales as well as to the mountains.\" He travelled to France, to Germany, and to Holland;...", "...where they spent their entire lives. They had a family of eight children, four of whom are now living. Charles Plucker, whose name introduces this review, was reared and educated in Germany, spending the first seventeen years of his life in that country. He then determined to try his fortune in the new world and become a resident of America. In 1854, therefore, he made the voyage across the Atlantic and for two years remained a resident of New York. In 1856 he enlisted at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years in the army of his adopted land and was located on Governors island. In 1857 he went to Fort Simcoe as a soldier and was on active military duty there for five years.

At first the little one helped to divert her mind. But afterwards her wonted existence, like a grinding millstone, again seized hold of her, and she had to place the child in the charge of the French nuns, by whom she herself had been educated, at the convent of the Sacred Heart of La Trinita de' Monti. When Benedetta left the convent, grown up, <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age, she was able to speak and write French, knew a little arithmetic and her catechism, and possessed a few hazy notions of history. Then the life of the two women was resumed, the life of a _gynoeceum_, suggestive of the Orient; never an excursion with husband or father, but day after day spent in closed, secluded rooms, with nought to cheer one but the sole, everlasting, obligatory promenade, the daily drive to the Corso and the Pincio. At home, absolute...", "...to define. When Lord Palmerston visited Scotland in 1863, the commander of the naval guardship was very anxious to receive that distinguished statesman with all the ceremony befitting his exalted position. On the subject of salutes due to a Prime Minister the naval code-book unfortunately maintained an impenetrable silence, and gave the officer no information as to how he should act. He eventually solved the difficulty in a thoroughly tactful manner by giving Palmerston the salute of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> guns which were due to him as Lord Warden of the Cinq Ports.[131] Mr. Gladstone, who was ever most punctilious in matters of etiquette, always resolutely declined to leave a room in front of any person of higher social rank, and many a youthful peer vainly endeavoured to induce the aged Prime Minister to precede him.

She was pale and even sad-looking, but beautiful still; with a delicate and regular profile, soft blue eyes, and a sweet, rather tremulous mouth.

If the accounts of those Spanish officers were correct, the earthquakes, which certainly affect these islands, must have caused a considerable uprising of the base of the island; but, on referring to the plan in Anson's voyage, the soundings in 1741 do not appear to have been different from ours. The innermost ship, whose berth we occupied, is, in that plan, at anchor in {307} <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> fathoms, and the depth between the points of the bay is shown to be about fifty fathoms.

Viewed from the situation we now were in, it terminated in two high towers; and, within them, a hill shaped like a sugar-loaf. This wild rock, therefore, obtained the name of York Minster.

In Annabel's creed, masculine admiration was the supreme good. It was the ultimate test of a woman's success, as the ability to make money tested the success of men. Beauty was precious, because it was the most effective lure. Talent was not to be despised, since it too could boast its captives. But the woman who claimed that she prized her gift for its own sake was guilty of an affectation which could deceive no one, not at least, so shrewd an observer as Annabel. At <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> she had married a man more than twice her age. Since then her preference for youthfulness had been growing, a phenomenon not unusual in women of her type. At thirty-seven, she looked upon her husband as senile, patriarchal, as far removed from her generation as the Pilgrim fathers. Men of her own age bored her. They were interested in business, politics, their families, a thousand things besides herself.

Clitophon has been unwillingly betrothed at <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> to his half-sister, Calligone. Now his uncle, Sostratus, writes that he is sending his daughter Leucippe and her mother from their home in Byzantium to Tyre for safety during a war. Clitophon at once falls in love with Leucippe. He makes his cousin, Clinias, his confidant. Clinias is sympathetic because he had a tragic love affair with a youth who was killed by a fall from a horse which Clinias gave him.

The wife had been slain outright, also seven of the children; the other two might recover. The murder had been committed in the most brutal and ghastly fashion, after which Hopkins had scalped his wife, leaped on a horse, cut his own throat from ear to ear, and ridden four miles into Carson City, dropping dead at last in front of the Magnolia saloon, the red-haired scalp of his wife still clutched in his gory hand.

His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were frontiersmen, farmers, or planters. He had himself the discipline of the plantation, but he learned surveying and had also the sterner experiences of its frontier practice. Then came his appointment at <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> as an adjutant-general of colonial militia in Virginia and with that office the still sterner disciplines beyond the frontier, where France was tutor, without which tuition he would doubtless have become and remained a successful colonial Virginia planter and general of militia.

His father, Antonio Maria Martini, a violinist, taught him the elements of music and the violin; later he learned singing and harpsichord playing from Padre Pradieri, and counterpoint from Antonio Riccieri. Having received his education in classics from the fathers of the oratory of San Filippo Neri, he afterwards entered upon a noviciate at the Franciscan monastery at Lago, at the close of which he was received as a Minorite on the 11th of September 1722. In 1725, though only <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years old, he received the appointment of chapel-master in the Franciscan church at Bologna, where his compositions attracted attention. At the invitation of amateurs and professional friends he opened a school of composition at which several celebrated musicians were trained; as a teacher he consistently declared his preference for the traditions of the old Roman school of composition. Padre Martini was a zealous collector of musical literature, and possessed an extensive...", "...William Whitby himself. THOMAS C. PERRY.

Conference, that there is such a preacher in the Conference, and brother Perry further stated to me that he was well acquainted with him, and if this statement was published, and if it could be known where he was since the last Conference, he wished a paper to be sent him containing the whole affair. He also stated to me, verbally, that the young man he attempted to shoot was about <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> years of age, and had been shut up in a corn-house, and in the attempt of Mr. Whitby to chain him, he broke down the door and made his escape as above mentioned, and that Mr. W. was under the necessity of hiring him out for one year, with the risk of his employer's getting him. Brother Perry conversed with one of the slaves, who was so old that he thought it not profitable to remove so far, and had been sold; _he_ informed him of all the above circumstances, and said, with...", "...and Bourges, Tours, Angers, and Caen were noted for the purity of their French. Saumur and other towns in which the Protestants were powerful were also much frequented. John Malpet, afterwards Principal of Gloucester Hall, Oxford, spent two years in France with his pupil, Lord Falkland, visiting Orleans, Blois, and Saumur.[919] John Evelyn visited Paris, Blois, Orleans, and Lyons, and finally settled at Tours, where he engaged a French master and studied the language diligently for <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> weeks. While studying in one or other of these towns, English travellers usually lodged in hotels, _auberges_, or _pensions_,[920] and sometimes with French families. One of their chief difficulties appears to have been to avoid their fellow-countrymen in such places. Gabriel Du Gres suggests that when English students are thus thrown together they should come to an agreement that any one who spoke his native tongue should pay a fine.

The engine was on trial sixty-six hours, but <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hours were hindered by the shaft and ropes, &c., which made the consumption of coals about 3/4ths of a bushel per hour.

The plan of the expedition was briefly as follows: The ship was to be fully provided with rations for the ice-imperiled whalemen, which were to be conveyed to them as soon as the ice conditions in Bering Strait would permit the passage through. An overland expedition was to be landed from the _Bear_ as soon as practicable, at some point on the coast of Alaska, in Bering Sea, to be determined upon by Captain Tuttle.

The wood-panic had her in its grip--the age-old terror that still lies in wait where trees are gathered together, though the god that begot it be dead these <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred years. She began to run. It was impossible to pass quickly through the tangled undergrowth; but sheer fright gave her skill to avoid real obstacles, strength to crash over and through the mere wreckage of the wood.

After a desperate action, Lord Cochrane laid the little _Speedy_ on board his big antagonist. He had ordered his men to blacken their faces; and one party, led by his gallant Lieutenant Parker, boarded at the bow, and soon gained a footing on the enemy's deck. Their begrimed faces and the impetuosity of their onset struck dismay into the hearts of the Spaniards, and they incontinently gave way.

With a scant word of welcome Hancock referred Lafayette to Gouverneur Morris, who, he said, \"had such matters in charge.\" The Frenchmen went to see Morris, but to him also they appeared only a new addition to the many adventurers already hanging about, looking for high commands.

This last named fish is as pink in the flesh and as fine flavored as _Salmo salar_.

Such, as briefly as it can be clearly outlined, was the battle of Bunker Hill. Nearly one third of each army was left on the field. The British loss was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> officers killed and seventy wounded, itself a striking evidence of the prompt response to Prescott's orders before the action began. Of rank and file, two hundred and seven were killed and seven hundred and fifty-eight were wounded. Total, ten hundred and fifty-four.

All his reserves had been vigorously engaged, while at two o'clock in the afternoon General Chetwode had in reserve <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> battalions less one company still unused, and the care exercised in keeping this large body of troops fresh for following up the Turkish defeat undoubtedly contributed to the great success of the advances on the next three days.

Heney objected to Shortridge appearing as a representative of the District Attorney's office. Shortridge replied that he respected Judge Seawell's order, and had no intention of violating it. He asked if he would be permitted to act in the capacity of amicus curiae[111] in examining jurors. This privilege was accorded him. The examination of the Grand Jurors occupied more than a week. Several of the <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> were excused, it being found that their names were not on the assessment roll. The examination was concluded[112] on November 7th and the Grand Jurors sworn. B. P. Oliver was appointed foreman. From him the body received its name of Oliver Grand Jury. The Grand Jury organized by electing C. G. Burnett secretary. But one important question remained to be decided, namely--Was Ruef or Langdon to represent The People at the investigation into graft charges which the Grand Jury...", "...the marriage. What took place during this interval in the life of the Virgin is a mystery which it would be a vain attempt to investigate. If it be judged of from a purely rationalistic standpoint, there are no historical and no scientific data which will enable us to do otherwise than simply discredit the accounts of the Nativity, as they are given by Matthew and Luke. On the other hand, if the narrative of Christ's birth is accepted with that reverent faith which has endured through <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> centuries of Christendom, and has been and still is held by men of unrivalled intellect, there is nothing more to be said than the language of worship and wonder. We may well regret that John and Mark, or at least one of the epistolary writers, did not corroborate the testimony of the two first-named Evangelists; the scant importance Mary seems to have acquired in the Apostolic Church may appear inconsistent with the stupendous nature of her experiences; yet here is no subject...", "...was out! He scarcely dared to look at her. Lady Linden said nothing; she sat down. \"Hugh!\" She had found breath and words at last. \"Hugh Alston! Did I hear you aright?\" \"I believe you did!\" \"You mean to tell me that you--you are a married man?\" He nodded. He realised that he was not a good liar. \"I would like some particulars,\" she said coldly. \"Hugh Alston, I should be very interested to know where she is!\" \"I don't know!\" \"You are mad. When were you married?\" \"June <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> eighteen,\" he said glibly. \"Where?\" \"At Marlbury!\" \"Good gracious! That is where Marjorie used to go to school!\" \"Yes, it was when I went down to see her there, and--\" \"You met this woman you married? And her name?\" \"Joan,\" he said--\"Joan Meredyth!\" \"Joan--Meredyth!\" said Lady Linden. She closed her eyes; she leaned back in her chair. \"That girl!\" A chill feeling of alarm swept over him. She spoke, her ladyship spoke, as though such a girl existed, as though...", "...all day long. No more does Mr. Pike run the phonograph, nor does Margaret ever touch the piano. She complains of being bruised and sore. I have a wrenched shoulder from being hurled against the wall. And both Wada and the steward are limping. Really, the only comfort I can find is in my bunk, so wedged with boxes and pillows that the wildest rolls cannot throw me out. There, save for my meals and for an occasional run on deck for exercise and fresh air, I lie and read eighteen and <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hours out of the twenty-four. But the unending physical strain is very wearisome. How it must be with the poor devils for'ard is beyond conceiving. The forecastle has been washed out several times, and everything is soaking wet. Besides, they have grown weaker, and two watches are required to do what one ordinary watch could do. Thus, they must spend as many hours on the sea-swept deck and aloft on the freezing yards as I do in my warm, dry bunk. Wada tells me that they...", "...was at a loss before the comprehensiveness of this blanket question. \"What kind of a thing?\" she inquired. He professed himself more at a loss than she. \"If I had any idea what, I wouldn't need to ask you, would I?\" But he managed, all the same, at least to eliminate some of the things he didn't mean, \"Oh, not dresses or hats,\" and in a moment, after another sip at the liqueur, to give a little more definite idea of what he did, \"Something going on, social life; what girls of <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> are supposed to want.\" \"Oh, you needn't bother. I get enough of that,\" she answered, \"between Mrs. Marbury and Eugenia and Madame Vallery.\" She was surprised at her father's interest. They seldom talked together, except of what they were to eat, had eaten, or were eating, or of the interminable games of chess which occupied any leisure moments of his and hers which chanced to coincide. He seemed to have something on his mind now. And he always hated the effort of bringing...", "...Standard Oil Company. His rise from clerk in a grocery store to one of the greatest capitalists in the history of the world is an interesting one, as well as an important one in the commercial history of America. Born at Richford, New York, in 1839, his parents moved to Cleveland, Ohio, when he was a boy of fourteen, and such education as he had was secured in the Cleveland public schools. He soon left school for business, getting employment first as clerk in a commission house, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> being junior partner in the firm of Clark & Rockefeller, commission merchants. At that time the petroleum fields of Pennsylvania were just beginning to be developed, and young Rockefeller's attention was soon attracted to them. He seems to have been one of the first to realize the vast possibilities of the oil business, and in 1865, he and his brother William built at Cleveland a refinery which they called the Standard Oil Works. They had little money, but unlimited nerve,...", "...is oh, so much for a man to learn In nineteen hundred and now: The least and the most he should trouble to earn In nineteen hundred and now, The message burned bright on the heavenly scroll, The little he needs that his stomach be whole, The vastness of vision to sate his soul, In nineteen hundred and now. There is oh, so much for a man to get In nineteen hundred and now. He may drench the earth in vicarious sweat In <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred and now. And his wealth may be but a lifelong itch, While the lowliest digger within his ditch May have gained the little to make him rich In nineteen hundred and now. There is oh, so much for a man to try In nineteen hundred and now. The sea is so deep and the hill so high In nineteen hundred and now. But sometimes we look at our little ball Where the smallest is great and the greatest small And wonder the why...", "...was watched by the son of the murdered man. Half-past three--four--half-past four; and Richard Manx rose from his knees, and gave up his task for the night. Many times during his search had he drank from the bottle of spirits, but what he drank appeared to affect him only through his tongue, which became more loquacious and less guarded. Once more he counted his bank-notes, grudgingly, greedily, and muttered: \"She shall give me five hundred to-day--this very morning; that will make <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred and twenty--say eighteen hundred clear, to break the bank at Monaco. If she likes to come with me, she can. I am sick of this game; there's too much to lose. To-morrow night shall be my last night here. I have searched every inch of this cursed room, and I throw it up. It is a slave's work, not a gentleman's.\" He certainly looked as little like a gentleman as any human being could, and his words proclaimed the utter villainy of his nature. \"There's too much danger in...", "...balcony had brought me out of my bed. Was the opposite principle now about to expunge that other ill, to restore him, and to make him a whole and forward-living man again? He believed that there was a chance of it. Was it too utterly beyond belief after all? Did it prove to be true, then all was heavenly clear. His new life would be what we all sigh that our lives were not--no blind groping in the night of ignorance and doubt, but the angelic victory over the hosts of darkness. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> and unburdened of his sin, she seventeen and sinless. They would marry. One marriage such as theirs might at the last be enough to rehabilitate the despairing world. Instead of being in his own person a public peril he might be society's hope and stay. And--I found my excitement quickening--so far all was well. \"_Entrez!_\" the bright voice that might have been silent for ever had called, and I had entered to find him humming over a paint-box. Surely he knew about himself...", "...and bitterly complaining of those who refute it, that they would rob him of his faith and give him nothing in exchange. Suppose a man to believe that in the year nineteen hundred the earth will be exploded, and that all men, except himself and the little clique of his friends, will be strung for eternity on a red hot iron wire in empty space. Suppose that this horrid notion is clearly proved to him to be an error. Then, because he is not taught exactly what will happen in the year <span class=\"clocktext\">nineteen</span> hundred, he, the unhappy man, assails his enlightener for having robbed him of his faith and given him nothing in exchange! Is not the truth of ignorance better than the falsity of superstition? Modest faith in front of the shrouded unknown can well stand comparison with the arrogant and incompetent exultation of fanaticism. In regard to that belated relic of the belief in magic, the doctrine of the literal resurrection of the dead in their fleshy bodies, let us gratefully..."]
