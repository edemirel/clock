The British land forces in the two Canadian provinces were about seven thousand five hundred, while the number of Canadian militia did not exceed forty thousand with a frontier of seven hundred miles to guard.

If we should try to reason from the rate of past railway-growth as to what the future is to be, we should soon be lost in figures. Thus, in the United States,-- In 1829 there were 3 miles. In 1830 41 miles. In 1840 2167 miles. In 1850 7355 miles. In 1856 23,242 miles. Thus from 1830 to 1840, the rate is as 2167/41 or 53 nearly; from 1840 to 1850, 7355/2167, or 3 nearly; and...", "...between the camp and the city; but finding that not a man was removed from the customary guard of the town, and that nothing was hazarded upon rash hopes, he returned to Tifata without accomplishing any thing. At the same time that Cumae was relieved from siege, Tiberius Sempronius, surnamed Longus, fought successfully with the Carthaginian general, Hanno, at Grumentum in Lucania. He slew above two thousand of the enemy, losing two hundred and eighty of his own men. He took as many as <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> military standards. Hanno, driven out of the Lucanian territory, drew back among the Bruttii. Three towns belonging to the Hirpinians, which had revolted from the Romans, were regained by force by the praetor, Marcus Valerius, Vercellius and Sicilius, the authors of the revolt, were beheaded; above a thousand prisoners sold by auction; and the rest of the booty having been given up to the soldiery, the army was marched back to Luceria. 38.

Yet, not only does each of the sections relating to these personages re-appear in Marcion's Gospel, but it re-appears precisely at the same place. A marked peculiarity in St. Luke's Gospel is the 'great intercalation' of discourses, ix. 51 to xviii. 14, evidently inserted without regard to chronological order. Yet this peculiarity, too, is faithfully reproduced in the Gospel of Marcion with the same disregard of chronology--the only change being the omission of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> verses from a total of three hundred and eighty. When Luke has the other two Synoptics against him, as in the insertions Matt. xiv. 3-12, Mark vi. 17-29, and again Matt. xx. 20-28, Mark x. 35-45, and Matt. xxi. 20-22, Mark xi. 20-26, Marcion has them against him too.

It has been noticed as characteristic of St. Luke that, where he has recorded a similar...", "...English guard would lower French prestige in the eyes of the Russians. They quite agreed that there ought to be a guard, but it must be half English and half French, and to this we at once agreed. We therefore reduced our number to twenty-five.

The greatest number of orderlies they could spare was nine, so it was suggested that the guard should consist of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> English and nine French soldiers. This took the negotiators' breath away entirely; the first proposal was destructive of French prestige, the second was enough to destroy France altogether!

A dull, slow journey--a movement imperceptible to any eye--but it was proceeding, nevertheless, and without cessation. It was a journey which a rolling stone would make in a few seconds--the lofty point of departure was visible from the village below in the valley. The prediction cut curiously close to the truth; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years after the catastrophe, the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier. I find an interesting account of the matter in the _Histoire Du Mont Blanc_, by Stephen d'Arve. I will condense this account, as follows: On the 12th of August, 1861, at the hour of the close of mass, a guide arrived out of breath at the mairie of Chamonix, and bearing on his shoulders a very lugubrious burden. It was a sack filled with human remains which he had gathered from the orifice...", "...of the sack were spread upon a long table, and officially inventoried, as follows: Portions of three human skulls. Several tufts of black and blonde hair. A human jaw, furnished with fine white teeth. A forearm and hand, all the fingers of the latter intact. The flesh was white and fresh, and both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the articulations. The ring-finger had suffered a slight abrasion, and the stain of the blood was still visible and unchanged after <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years. A left foot, the flesh white and fresh. Along with these fragments were portions of waistcoats, hats, hobnailed shoes, and other clothing; a wing of a pigeon, with black feathers; a fragment of an alpenstock; a tin lantern; and lastly, a boiled leg of mutton, the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant odor. The guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from the glacier; an hour's exposure to the sun had already begun the work of...", "...I suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and then give it to a sick stranger? Indeed he wouldn't, so he wouldn't. I resolved, then, that I would do all I could to injure Mont Blanc. In the record-book was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened on the mountain. It began with the one in 1820 when the Russian Dr. Hamel's three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier, and it recorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the slow-moving glacier <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years later.

In Baltimore it seems that he fell in with some politicians who were conducting an election.

Here he was found by a printer, who notified his friends, and they sent him to the hospital, where he died on the 7th of October, 1849. He was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years old. Poe had a great and wonderful mind. In the latter part of his life he gave much of his time to a book called \"Eureka,\" which was intended to explain the meaning of the universe.

About the year 8 B.C., not long before Ovid wrote those poems in which married life was assumed to be hardly worth living, a husband in high life at Rome lost the wife who had for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years been his faithful companion in prosperity, his wise and courageous counsellor in adversity. He recorded her praises and the story of her devotion to him in a long inscription, placed, as we may suppose, on the wall of the tomb in which he laid her to rest, and a most fortunate chance has preserved for us a great part of the marble on which this inscription was engraved.

In the fortnight ending February 5, 1881, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> houses were attacked by small-pox in the special mile circle round the hospital, and in this limited outbreak it was found, as previously, that the severity of incidence bore an exact inverse proportion to the distance from the hospital. The greater part of these were attacked in the five days January 26-30, 1881, and in seeking for the source of infection of these cases, special attention was directed to the time about a fortnight previous viz., January 12-17, 1881.

The French captain fought well, but he was put at a disadvantage by losing his topmast at the opening of the engagement, so that Captain Truxtun was able to take a raking position. The American loss was only one killed and three wounded, while _L'Insurgente_ had twenty-nine killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> wounded. On February 1, 1800, the _Constellation_ fought the heavy French frigate _Vengeance_ from about eight o'clock in the evening until after midnight, when the _Vengeance_ lay completely silenced and apparently helpless. But the rigging and spars of the _Constellation_ had been so badly cut up that the mainmast fell, and before the wreck could be cleared away the _Vengeance_ was able to make her escape.

It is, indeed, unjustly and unreasonably depressed, and there is much room for amendment; but we must still hope and trust that things will not soon regain their...", "...public utility. Several years ago the city authorities honored me by giving my name to the attractive plot of ground at the junction of Fulton and Greene Avenues.

I have been permitted to spend <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> supremely happy years in this city which I heartily love, and for whose people I have joyfully labored; and while the permanent fruits of these labors remain, I trust I shall not pass out of all affectionate remembrance.

ISABEL THE REGENT PART I CHAPTER I DOG-BITE I \"And yet,\" Edward Henry Machin reflected as at six minutes to six he approached his own dwelling at the top of Bleakridge, \"and yet--I don't feel so jolly after all!\" The first two words of this disturbing meditation had reference to the fact that, by telephoning twice to his stockbrokers at Manchester, he had just made the sum of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pounds in a purely speculative transaction concerning Rubber Shares. (It was in the autumn of the great gambling year, 1910.) He had simply opened his lucky and wise mouth at the proper moment, and the money, like ripe, golden fruit, had fallen into it, a gift from benign heaven, surely a cause for happiness! And yet--he did not feel so jolly! He was surprised, he was even a little hurt, to discover by introspection that monetary gain was not necessarily accompanied by...", "...surprised, he was even a little hurt, to discover by introspection that monetary gain was not necessarily accompanied by felicity. Nevertheless, this very successful man of the world of the Five Towns, having been born on the 27th of May 1867, had reached the age of forty-three and a half years! \"I must be getting older,\" he reflected. He was right. He was still young, as every man of forty-three will agree, but he was getting older. A few years ago a windfall of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pounds would not have been followed by morbid self-analysis; it would have been followed by unreasoning, instinctive elation, which elation would have endured at least twelve hours. As he disappeared within the reddish garden wall which sheltered his abode from the publicity of Trafalgar Road, he half hoped to see Nellie waiting for him on the famous marble step of the porch, for the woman had long, long since invented a way of scouting for his advent from the small window...", "...As he carefully removed his hat and his beautiful new Melton overcoat (which had the colour and the soft smoothness of a damson), he animadverted upon the astounding negligence of women. There were Nellie (his wife), his mother, the nurse, the cook, the maid--five of them; and in his mind they had all plotted together--a conspiracy of carelessness--to leave the inexcusable tool in his lobby for him to stumble over. What was the use of accidentally procuring three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pounds? Still no sign of Nellie, though he purposely made a noisy rattle with his ebon walking-stick. Then the maid burst out of the kitchen with a tray and the principal utensils for high tea thereon. She had a guilty air. The household was evidently late. Two steps at a time he rushed upstairs to the bathroom, so as to be waiting in the dining-room at six precisely, in order, if possible, to shame the household and fill it with remorse and unpleasantness. Yet ordinarily...", "...\"Who's 'he?'\" demanded the master. \"Carlo, sir.\" Upon which triumph Maud retired. Edward Henry was dashed. Nevertheless, he quickly recovered his presence of mind and sought about for a justification of his previous verdict upon the negligence of five women. \"It would have been easy enough to put the brush where the dog couldn't get at it,\" he said. But he said this strictly to himself. He could not say it aloud. Nor could he say aloud the words \"neuralgia,\" \"three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pounds,\" any more than he could say \"late.\" That he was in a peculiar mental condition is proved by the fact that he did not remark the absence of his mother until he was putting her share of baked ham on to a plate. He thought: \"This is a bit thick, this is!\" meaning the extreme lateness of his mother for the meal. But his only audible remark was a somewhat impatient banging down of the hot plate in front of his mother's empty chair. In answer to this banging Nellie...", "...be placidly content, and he was not content. And more and more the domestic atmosphere and the atmosphere of the district fretted and even annoyed him.

He had taught Mr. Bryany a thing or two. To what brilliant use had he turned the purely accidental possession of a hundred-pound note! One of his finest inspirations--an inspiration worthy of the great days of his youth! Yes, he had had his hour that evening, and it had been a glorious one. Also, it had cost him a hundred pounds, and he did not care; he would retire to bed with a net gain of two hundred and forty-one pounds instead of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pounds--that was all! For he did not mean to take up the option. The ecstasy was cooled now and he saw clearly that London and theatrical enterprises therein would not be suited to his genius. In the Five Towns he was on his own ground; he was a figure; he was sure of himself. In London he would be a provincial, with the diffidence and the uncertainty of a provincial.

And there it hung.

As I had suspected I should, I found the Indians encamped at the Springs with the stock grazing around them. As quickly as possible I got back to the command with my news. The horses were quietly saddled and we proceeded, seldom speaking or making any noise. As we rode along I gave the lieutenant and first sergeant the description of the camp and suggested that it could be best approached just at daylight. We had but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> men. Ten of these, I said, should be detailed to take charge of the herd, while the lieutenant and I charged the camp. The Indians were encamped on a little knoll, around which was miry ground, making a cavalry charge difficult. The Indians numbered as many as we did. The safest plan was to dismount some of the men, leaving others to hold the horses, and proceed to the attack on foot. The rest of the men were to remain with their horses, and get through, the marshy ground...", "...of the Romans. _III.--Gothic Italy_ Dissensions in Italy excited the ambition of Justinian. Belisarius was sent with another army to Sicily in 535, and after subduing that island and suppressing a revolt in Africa, he invaded Italy in 536. Policy dictated the retreat of the Goths, and Belisarius entered Rome (December 536). In March, Vitiges, the Gothic ruler, returned with a force of one hundred and fifty thousand men. The valour of the Roman general supported a siege of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days and the intrigues of the Pope Silverius, who was exiled by his orders; and, finally, with the assistance of a seasonable reinforcement, Belisarius compelled the barbarians to retire in March of the following year. The conquests of Ravenna and the suppression of the invasion of the Franks completed the subjugation of the Gothic kingdom by December 539. The success of Belisarius and the intrigues of his secret enemies had excited the jealousy of Justinian. He was...", "...expenditures have reached an amount unprecedented in our history.

In 1869 it is estimated that it will reach 38,000,000, or an increase of 868 per cent in seventy-nine years.

The two old women accompanied him. When the trip was too hard for them, he went alone. One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was mounted on an ass.

From the first its invitation has been...", "...\"A suitable house and barn, standing in a suitable place; pasturing and sufficient warter meet for two Cows and one horse--the winter meet put in his barn; the improvement of two acres of land suitable to plant and to be kept well fenced; sixty pounds in lawful silver money, at six shillings and eight pence per ounce; twenty cords of wood at his Dore, and the Loose Contributions; and also the following artikles, or so much money as will purchase them, viz: Sixty Bushels Indian Corn, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> Bushels of Rye, Six hundred pounds wait of Pork and Eight Hundred and Eighty Eight pounds wait of Beefe.\" This would be considered a pretty liberal salary even now for a suburban people to pay.

As soon as I succeeded in doing this with comparative ease, I procured another hundred-pound dumb-bell, and in a few months succeeded in exercising with both of the instruments at the same time, raising each alternately above my head. I then commenced practice with a dumb-bell weighing one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pounds. It consisted of two shells connected by a handle, which, being removable, allowed me to introduce shot, from time to time, into the cavities of the shells. After a few months of practice, I could, with a jerk, raise the instrument from my shoulder to arm's-length above my head. My first public exhibition of this feat took place in Philadelphia, in April, 1860.

Indeed, it is surprising to find how correct this old French translation generally is. The translation of 'Plutarch's Lives from the Greek by several hands,' was published at London in 1683-86. It was dedicated by Dryden to James Butler, the first Duke of Ormond, in a fulsome panegyric. It is said that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> translators laboured at the work. Dryden did not translate any of the Lives; but he wrote the Life of Plutarch which is prefixed to this translation. The advertisement prefixed to the translation passes under the name and character of the bookseller (Jacob Tonson), but, as Malone observes, it may from internal evidence be safely attributed to Dryden. The bookseller says, \"You have here the first volume of Plutarch's Lives turned from the Greek into English; and give me leave...", "...eighty-five of his best soldiers, among whom was his beloved friend, Francesco Anzani.

So Garibaldi returned at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of age to the country where the sentence of death passed upon him had never been revoked. Before the law he was still 'a brigand of the first category.' Nor was he quite sure that he would not be arrested, and, as a precaution, when he cast anchor in the harbour of his native Nice, he ran up the Monte Videan colours. It was needless.

Of the others, Chares, the historian, tells us that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> died of an extreme cold that came upon them in their drunkenness. Alexander now celebrated the marriage of many of his companions at Susa.

How trying such a journey must have been to a lady in her condition is evidenced by the fact that, during the three days, she spent <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> hours on the road, reaching Paris on the 4th of July. Just six days later her ladyship, to quote a letter written by Mrs Hewit, \"produced two lovely boys,\" one of whom was so weak and puny that the doctor \"begged it might be sent to the country as soon as possible.\" So far the story seems clear and plausible, assuming that a lady, in such a delicate state of health, could bear the fatigues of so long and trying a journey as that from Rheims to Paris.

In Paris, which is in one sense the focus of French labor, its many opportunities drawing to it a large contingent from the provinces, it is popularly supposed that the ranks of the sewing-women give large proportion to houses of prostitution. This opinion is the prevailing one for all large cities, whether in Europe or America, yet is disproved on all sides. For Paris Parent-Duchalet states that in the statistics given by the prefecture of police, in a table including <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> categories, women with no occupation had first rank as prostitutes, domestic service giving the second, and sewing-women the smallest proportion. This is the more surprising when one considers that their wage is often below the point of subsistence, and that temptation of every order waits upon them. At the best the wage falls far below that of men, even when both engage in the same work. The present movement toward organization is the first step toward a general bettering of...", "...stores and shops as obligatory as that of factories. It was through the concerted effort of its members that the Factory Inspection Act became a law, though not without violent opposition.

There are eleven thousand factories in New York State, and only one inspector to investigate their condition; while in England, scarce larger in territory, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> inspectors are appointed by the Government. The Andrus bill, adding to the power of factory inspectors, raising the working age of children to fourteen years, and prohibiting night work for girls under twenty-one and boys under eighteen, was sent with the Factory Bill to the Central Labor Union, and the women were largely instrumental in obtaining the passage of the measure.

He escaped from a farmer, by the name of John Jones, who was classed, as to natural temperament, amongst \"moderate slave-holders.\" \"I wanted my liberty,\" said Arthur promptly and emphatically, and he declared that was the cause of his escape. He left his mother, two sisters, and three brothers in Slavery. Isaiah was about twenty-two, small of stature, but...", "...ABOUT JANUARY FIRST, 1855. VERENEA MERCER. The steamship Pennsylvania, on one of her regular trips from Richmond, brought one passenger, of whom the Captain had no knowledge; no permission had been asked of any officer of the boat. Nevertheless, Verenea Mercer managed, by the most extraordinary strategy, to secrete herself on the steamer, and thus succeeded in reaching Philadelphia. She was following her husband, who escaped about nine months before her. Verenea was about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of age, of a dark chestnut color, prepossessing in manners, intelligent and refined. She belonged to the slave population of Richmond, and was owned by Thomas W. Quales.

He found an agent of the Underground Rail Road, and after surmounting various difficulties, this point was settled. As good luck would have it, his wife, who was a free woman, although she heard the secret with great sorrow, had the good sense to regard his step for the best, and thus he was free to contend with all other dangers on the way. He encountered the usual suffering, and on his arrival experienced the wonted pleasure. He was a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of age, spare made, with straight hair, and Indian complexion, with the Indian's aversion to Slavery. Turner, who was a fellow-passenger with Henry, arrived also from Richmond. He was about twenty-one, a bright, smart, prepossessing young man. He fled from A.A.

I expect that abolitionists there are all opposed to buying slaves, and will not give anything.

In the year 1520, the houses, by count, which was ordered by the grand prince, amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand five hundred. The metropolitan bishop, the grand dignitaries of the court, the princes and lords occupied splendid mansions of wood reared by Grecian and Italian architects in the environs of the Kremlin.

In this attempt the tzar was successful, and on the 28th of July the garrison surrendered without obtaining any of the honors of war. Elated with success Peter increased the fortifications, dug a harbor capable of holding large ships, and prepared to fit out a strong fleet against the Turks; which fleet was to consist of nine sixty gun ships, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of from thirty to fifty guns. While the fleet was being built he returned to Moscow, and to impress his subjects with a sense of the great victory obtained, he marched the army into Moscow beneath triumphal arches, while the whole city was surrendered to all the demonstrations of joy.

With this object in mind the Directors wrote to Robert Moffat, proposing that he should go for a twelvemonth to the Matabele, taking two younger men with him, and plant a mission among this people.

The editorial course of the paper that year is perhaps best explained by the following paragraph, printed a few days after the election: \"One of our contemporaries says the Herald has alternately pleased and displeased both parties during this campaign.

And that was our only aim.\" The circulation during election week averaged <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand six hundred and ninety-three copies daily; throughout the year it was nearly thirty thousand--considerably larger than during the preceding year--and the boast that it was more than double that of any other paper in Boston undoubtedly was justified by the facts.

From this record it is learned that the Herald, from a circulation of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand one hundred and ninety-three in January, rose to fifty-three thousand and twenty-six in December. Twelve compositors were regularly employed this year, and the weekly composition bill was two hundred dollars.

But the curious fact is, that, for the three years, 1886, 1887 and 1888, the average contributions to the American Missionary Association from church collections are forty-seven per cent., from Sunday-schools seven per cent., from Woman's Missionary Societies five per cent., from individual donors <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> per cent. It thus appears that less than one-half the total sum comes from collections in the churches. Another curious fact is, that these receipts directly from the churches are uniform, not differing to the extent of three per cent. in the past three years.

It has been generally supposed that this prince was Chosroes' son, and succeeded him in the natural course; but the evidence of the Parthian coins is strong against these suppositions. According to them, Volagases had been a pretender to the Parthian throne as early as A.D. 78, and had struck coins both in that year and the following one, about the date of the accession of Pacorus. His attempt had, however, at that time failed, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years he kept his pretensions in abeyance; but about A.D. 119 or 120 he appears to have again come forward, and to have disputed the crown with Chosroes, or reigned contemporaneously with him over some portion of the Parthian kingdom, till about A.D. 130, when--probably on the death of Chosroes--he was acknowledged as sole king by the entire nation. Such is the evidence of the coins, which in this case are very peculiar, and bear the name of Volagases from first to last.

The greater number of my most valued friendships had been formed there; from almost everyone with whom I had been associated, whether European or Native, civilian or soldier, I had experienced unfailing kindness, sympathy, and support; and to the discipline, bravery, and devotion to duty of the Army in India, in peace and war, I felt that I owed whatever success it was my good fortune...", "...to the peerage; visits Burma; visits Nepal; review of the Maharaja's troops; a grand durbar; an evening reception at the palace; a short tour in the Punjab; proposed Mission to the Amir; the Mission abandoned; adieu to Simla; final tour in the Punjab; farewell entertainments at Lahore; at Lucknow; and at Calcutta; pig-sticking at Jaipur and Jodhpur; address from the municipality of Ahmedabad; parting dinner at the Byculla Club; the end of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years in India; letter to Yakub Khan; interview with Yakub Khan's agents; official report on interview with Yakub Khan; extract from Report on Commissariat; instructions to officers commanding Column in Burma; farewell address from Sikhs of the Punjab; from Hindus of the Punjab; from Mahomedans of the Punjab; from the European community of the Punjab; from the Talukdars of Oudh; from the citizens of Calcutta Robertson, Lieutenant...", "...Some remark which he told me had been made with respect to the frequent use of the demonstrative pronoun both by himself and by Sir W.

This is not mentioned in disparagement of that able writer and amiable man; but merely to show--that, if Milton's work were not more read, it was not because readers did not exist at the time.

Five hours was needed for the overland journey, and was considered amazing speed. By the year 1832 the overland trip between New York and Boston had been reduced to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> hours.

Returned to Wilna, as the only survivor of the corps after the death of Eble and in the beginning of the Restoration. Unable to read or write, deaf and decrepit, Gondrin forlornly left Paris which had treated him inhospitably, and returned to the village in Dauphine, where the mayor, Dr. Benassis, gave him work as a ditcher and continued to aid him in 1829.

After a violent debate of three days, it was carried, by a majority of one hundred and twenty-nine against eighty-three, in the house of commons, that the king's concessions were a foundation for the houses to proceed upon in the settlement of the kingdom. Next day, when the commons were to meet, Colonel Pride formerly a drayman, had environed the house with two regiments; and, directed by Lord Grey of Groby, he seized in the passage <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> members of the Presbyterian party, and sent them to a low room, which passed by the appellation of \"hell;\" whence they were afterwards carried to several inns.

In this emergency the Prussian general ordered his cavalry to make a circuit round a rising ground, and, if possible, charge the enemy in flank. This order was executed with equal vigour and success. They fell upon the imperial army with such impetuosity, as drove their battalions and horse upon each other in the utmost confusion. A considerable number of the enemy were slain, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> officers, with twelve hundred men, made prisoners. By this advantage, which was obtained at a very small expense, general Hulsen opened for himself a way to Torgau, whither he instantly retreated, perceiving that the whole army of the imperialists was advancing to cut off his communication with the Elbe.

The chancellor of the exchequer, however, preferred a reduction of the stamp duties to those on soap; and on a division the motion was negatived by a majority of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> against two hundred and eight. As the law stood, there was no distinction between newspapers in regard of duty on account of their size, all differences of this nature having been removed in 1828. By the new bill, however, this distinction was restored, an additional duty being imposed on every newspaper containing more than a certain number of square inches of surface.

From here to the distributing reservoirs in the Central Park, which have already been described, the distance is two and a quarter miles. The distributing reservoir for the principal part of the city is on Fifth Avenue, between Fortieth and Forty-second streets. It covers about four acres of ground, and is built of granite. It is forty feet above the street, is divided into two parts, and will hold 20,000,000 gallons of water. It is exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> miles from the Croton Lake. [Picture: THE FIFTH AVENUE RESERVOIR.] The daily flow of water through the aqueduct is 60,000,000 gallons, its full capacity. The reservoirs hold over 2,000,000,000 gallons, or about fifteen days, supply. Nearly four hundred miles of main pipes distribute the water through the city, and supply it to 67,000 dwelling houses and stores, 1624 manufactories, 290 hospitals, prisons, schools, and public buildings, 307 churches, and...", "...spent in the gold fields had accumulated considerable treasure. But choosing to dig for gold and to live among adventurers, thieves, and speculators, he had come to distrust human nature. He became so secretive that even at the approach of death, when the kindly French doctor had given him fair warning, he would confide in only one man. Verily, he had his reward. Incidentally, the three Californians whom he had named as his executors prospered. They may not all be included among the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thieves of this story, but it may not seem unreasonable to suppose that Henry Francis made it worth while for Hintzen and Haggerty to keep quiet. The point is that all three executors prospered--and then died penniless. Hintzen made so much money over at Forest City that he left for Arizona, where he invested in copper, and lost everything he had.

The third edition of this work was soon after its publication translated into English and issued officially to the British army as _The Duties of the General Staff_. Major Bronsart's new edition of 1904 was reissued in English by the General Staff, under the same title, in 1905. BRONTE, CHARLOTTE (1816-1855), EMILY (1818-1848), and ANNE (1820-1849), English novelists, were three of the six children of Patrick Bronte, a clergyman of the Church of England, who for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of his life was perpetual incumbent of the parish of Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Patrick Bronte was born at Emsdale, Co. Down, Ireland, on the 17th of March 1777. His parents were of the peasant class, their original name of Brunty apparently having been changed by their son on his entry at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1802. In the intervening years he had been successively a weaver and schoolmaster in his native country. From Cambridge [v.04 p.0638] he...", "...24 Paternoster Row, 1826.[63] The book contains an introduction in verse by Allan Cunningham, whose acquaintance Borrow seems to have made in London. It commences: Sing, sing, my friend, breathe life again Through Norway's song and Denmark's strain: On flowing Thames and Forth, in flood, Pour Haco's war-song, fierce and rude. Cunningham had not himself climbed very far up the literary ladder in 1825, although he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of age. At one time a stonemason in a Scots village, he had entered Chantrey's studio, and was 'superintendent of the works' to that eminent sculptor at the time when Borrow called upon him in London, and made an acquaintance which never seems to have extended beyond this courtesy to the younger man's _Danish Ballads_. The point of sympathy of course was that in the year 1825 Cunningham had published _The Songs of Scotland, Ancient and Modern_. But Allan Cunningham,...", "...Jeremiah;\" and another \"Thou art St. John the Baptist.\" But He asked, \"Whom do you say that I am?\"--turning to His disciples.

He was hungry to get some one to confess him. Let everyone take his stand on the side of the Lord. The Blind Beggar. Here is a whole chapter in John (ix) of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> verses, just to tell how the Lord blessed that blind beggar. It was put in this book, I think, just to bring out the confession of that man. \"The neighbors, therefore, and they which before had seen him which was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?

Admiral Durell, who had been left at Halifax over the winter, was too slow in getting the advance guard under way in time to cut off the twenty-three little vessels sent out from France to Montcalm in the spring. But this reinforcement was too small to make any real difference in the doom of Quebec when once British sea-power had sealed the St. Lawrence. Saunders took Wolfe's army and the main body of his own fleet up the great river in June: a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> vessels, all told, from the flagship _Neptune_ of ninety guns down to the smallest craft that carried supplies. It was a brave sight off the mouth of the Saguenay, where the deep-water estuary ends, to see the whole fleet, together at sunset, with its thousand white sails, in a crescent twenty miles long, a-gleam on the blue St. Lawrence. The French-Canadian pilots who had been taken prisoners swore that no fleet could ever get through the Traverse, a tricky bit of water...", "...of our British sea-power, that the Mercantile Marine is the other half, and that all kinds of British sea-power must work together or be lost. So we cannot separate one kind from another here; and we would not if we could. Nor should we forget that British sea-power was itself only one of the many kinds of war-power put forth by Britain in the cause of freedom. Britain raised by far the largest force of volunteers ever raised by any country in any age or for any war--five million and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand men for the Army alone. This takes no account of conscripts, or of naval, air force, or civilian Services; nor does it include one man belonging to any part of the British Empire overseas.

But there were many willing helpers, and at last the business was settled. Each child received a toy and a warm article of clothing. For a few minutes the uproar was deafening, with the blowing of whistles, shaking of tambourines, beating of drums, etc., as each child proceeded to try his own particular toy.

Constantinople, Tocat, and Aintab had each a training-school for native preachers and helpers, and there was also a girls' boarding-school at Constantinople; and thirty-eight free schools were scattered over the field. Nine years after the organization of the first evangelical church, the number of churches was twenty-three. The church at Aintab was the largest, containing one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> members. Kessab, a long day's journey south of Antioch, where no missionary had ever resided, had a church of forty-one members. The first edifice for Christian worship in the Ottoman Empire, erected on a new site, was the stone church at Aintab. Prior to this, Christians had only been allowed to repair their old churches, and to rebuild on the old sites. The obtaining of this new indulgence was probably owing, in a measure, to the influence of the Crimean war. The dedication...", "...forty pupils. A majority of the young men in the Seminary at Harpoot were married, and one main design of the female seminary at that station was the education of their wives. These kept house for their husbands, and attended school about seven hours a day, five days of the week. Their younger children were committed to the care of a woman employed for the purpose, while the older ones went to one of the city schools. Of the ninety-four connected with the seminary previous to 1867, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> were hopefully converted while in it. Their chief text-book was the Bible; and some of them, besides learning to read intelligently, and to write, keep accounts, and know something of geography and astronomy, became intelligent students and expounders of the Bible, and, with hearts warm with love to Christ, proved themselves wise and efficient in winning souls to Him.[1] This institution has had several valuable teachers from the United States, prominent among whom was Miss...", "...last I went out toward them on the new ice, which had now frozen solid enough to bear me. The gander rose in the air and circled overhead, squalling fearfully. On going nearer, I saw that all those geese were frozen in, and that they were dead; the entire flock, except that one powerful old gander, had perished there. They were frozen in the ice so firmly that I could not pull them out; in fact, I could scarcely bend the necks of those that had tucked them under their wings. I counted <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of them besides the gander. While I was looking them over, Tom and Addison appeared on the shore. They had waked and missed me, but, hearing the gander, had guessed that I had gone to the pond.

We politely invited him to take a hand, and he could not conceal his gratitude; though his breeding, and the etiquette of his profession, made him try. We explained the game to him, and said that there were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> balls, and that the player was privileged to extend his inning and keep on playing until he had used them all up--repeatedly--and that for every ten-strike he got a prize. We didn't name the prize--it wasn't necessary, as no prize would ever be needed or called for. He started a sarcastic smile, but quenched it, according to the etiquette of his profession.

Presently he removed his cravat; after a little he took off his vest; and still he went bravely on. Higgins was suffocating. My condition was the same, but it would not be courteous to laugh; it would be better to burst, and we came near it. That officer was good pluck. He stood to his work without uttering a word, and kept the balls going until he had expended the outfit four times, making four times <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> shots; then he had to give it up, and he did; for he was no longer able to stand without wobbling. He put on his clothes, bade us a courteous good-by, invited us to call at the Fort, and started away. Then he came back, and said, \"What is the prize for the ten-strike?\" We had to confess that we had not selected it yet. He said, gravely, that he thought there was no occasion for hurry about it.

The public schools of Massachusetts were taught in the years 1863-4 on an average just thirty-two weeks, just five days in a week, and, making proper allowance for recesses and opening exercises, just five and a quarter hours in a day. Granting now that all the boys and girls studied during these hours faithfully, you have an average for the three hundred and thirteen working days of the year of two hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> minutes a day,--an amount of study that never injured any healthy child. But, going back a little to youthful recollections, and considering the amazing proclivity of the young mind to idleness, whispering, and fun and frolic in general, it seems doubtful whether our children ever yet attained to so high an average of actual study as two hours a day.

To mention other monuments and writers here made use of, would be tedious and superfluous. The authorities produced throughout the work speak for themselves: the veracity of writers who cannot pretend to pass for inspired, ought to be supported by competent vouchers. The original authors are chiefly our guides. The stream runs clear and pure from the source, which in a long course often contracts a foreign mixture; but...", "...magistrate sent him to the \"Island,\" for thirty days and then Gottlieb would get him out on a writ of habeas corpus. Some of these writs attracted the attention of the bar and several appear in the reports. I am under the impression that we secured his release some twenty-nine separate times. At last he died in a fit of apoplexy caused by overeating; and when we administered his estate we found that he had already laid by, in a comparatively brief career, the very creditable sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand dollars. The \"Human Dog\" was but a clever variation of the \"Crust-Thrower\" --the beggar who tosses a dirty crust of bread into the gutter when no one is looking and then falls upon it with a cry of fierce joy.

For miles through the woods evidences of the terrible conflict meet one at every step. Trees peppered with bullet and buckshot, and now and then one cut down by cannon ball; unexploded shell, solid shot, dead horses, broken caissons, haversacks, old shoes, hats, fragments of muskets, and unused cartridges, are to be seen every-where. In an open space in the oak woods is a long strip of fresh earth, in which <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> sticks are standing, with intervals between them of perhaps a foot. Here forty-one poor fellows lie under the fresh earth, with nothing but the forty-one little sticks above to mark the spot. Just beyond this are twenty-five sticks, to indicate the last resting-place of twenty-five brave men; and so we found these graves in the woods, meadows, corn-fields, cotton-fields, every-where. We stumbled on one grave in a solitary spot in the thick cedars, where the sunshine never...", "...refugees and other good work. As we stopped at the entrance of Nancy, we saw an aeroplane flying over the town. This aeroplane was intended to convoy us to our destination. Next day we were driven to the village of Luneville. At this place, as in nearly all the towns of France, there is a public market house, with stalls usually presided over by women. Late in September the Germans dropped from aeroplanes a number of bombs on this market house. The entire building was destroyed and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> women killed, besides a number of children who were playing about. We saw the ruins of the market house. This sort of battle waging is called \"German terrorism\", otherwise, a \"stepping stone to kultur\".

The Major and Prof. reached the summit at an altitude of fifteen hundred feet. They had a wide view over the unknown country, and saw mountains to the west with snow on their summits. Snow in the canyons would not have surprised us now, for the nights were cold and we had warmth only in the middle of the day.

But poor Sidney lost his head in a very short time, and hitting out wildly at what he thought was a short ball, it rose right over the shoulder of his bat and carried off his bails in the neatest manner possible--two wickets for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> runs, as the captain had only managed to put on three runs since that fiend in human form had come on to bowl. Of course there was a wild shout of victory from the Inimitables when our best bat was disposed of, and corresponding woe in our camp, which was sympathisingly shared in by all the Little Peddlingtons around, and in the midst of the excitement I went to the wicket to fill the lamented vacancy. \"Mind, Jack,\" said Sidney, who did not allow the sense of defeat to...", "...wrung his old captain's hand and hurried down-stairs, leaving him with a ball in his throat and moisture very near his eyes. \"Thank goodness that is over!\" he murmured, as he left the Temple. \"Now for the barracks.\" Instead of offering himself to one of the outside recruiters, he went straight to the Orderly Room, and told a sergeant waiting outside that he wished to join. So he was brought before the Adjutant almost at once. He stood six feet in his stockings, and measured <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> inches round the chest, so there was no difficulty about his acceptance. They jumped at him like a trout at a May fly. He gave his real name, Reginald Kavanagh. \"If I were ashamed of what I am doing, I would not do it,\" he reasoned. And besides, he wished to be traced with the greatest possible ease should the missing will be found. Of course the life at first was extremely hard, and the companionship of some of his comrades very distasteful to him, but he took care...", "...get on at New Swishford, for it's a far jollier place than the Long Stork.\" Bowler's proposition was hailed with acclamation. His hearers were just in the humour to put their enthusiasm to the test, and the notion of a picnic on the Long Stork as a sort of full-dress rehearsal of the capture of New Swishford suited them exactly. They proceeded immediately to discuss ways and means, and found that by putting their pocket-moneys together they could raise the very respectable sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> shillings. Reserving the odd shilling for the possible contingency of having to \"square\" a coastguard for the use of the boat, they had two pounds to devote to the purchase of stores, weapons, and other necessaries; and, as Gayford pointed out, of course anything they got that wasn't eatable would come in for New Swishford. A sub-committee, consisting of Bowler, Braintree and Wester, was appointed to expend the funds of the adventurers to the best advantage, and meanwhile...", "...of the United Shoe Machinery Company, the largest and richest corporation of the kind in the world. (See, in _Munsey's Magazine_ of August, 1912, on page 722, biographical sketch of Mr. Sidney Winslow, millionaire head of the United Shoe Machinery Company.) Some idea may be had of the magnitude of this giant industry, which is thus shown to have grown directly out of the inventions of a young colored man, by recalling the fact that the corporation represents the consolidation of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> different smaller companies, that its factories cover twenty-one acres of ground, that it gives employment daily to 4,200 persons, that its working capital is quoted at $20,860,000, and that it controls more than 300 patents representing improvements in the machines it produces.

The boys became very much excited listening to their hunting stories; and after dinner nothing but Herbert's decided command prevented their loading the guns to be ready for any game they might see on the road. The landlord and the driver said that they never saw any deer driving along the road; but the boys thought it might be that they would, and after they started a strict watch was kept, which resulted in seeing <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> squirrels but nothing larger. They had not driven many miles up the mountain before it cleared off, and the sun came out. The forest road, lined with ferns and banks of moss, was very picturesque, and Leon and Sam enjoyed the ride as only happy schoolboys can, in the pleasantest spot that boys can be--a forest peopled with deer and squirrels. And when they reached the Summit House they were in as good spirits as jolly boys could be who expected a glorious chase the next...", "...up these the war-junks had to take refuge whenever the British ships approached. Commodore Elliot heard that a large number of war-junks were collected some five miles up one of them, called Escape Creek, and accordingly, early on the 25th of May, he went on board the _Hong-Kong_ gunboat, and got under weigh, followed by _Bustard, Staunch, Starling_, and _Forbes_, towing the boats manned from the _Inflexible, Hornet_, and _Tribune_. Steaming into the creek, they before long came upon <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> Mandarin junks, moored across the stream. Each junk had a long twenty-four or thirty-two pounder gun forward, and carried also four or six nine-pounders. The _Hong-Kong_ gallantly led. No sooner had she got within range, than the Chinese, with much spirit, opened fire, the first shot striking her, and others following rattling thick and fast on board. The other gunboats coming up, formed in as wide order as possible, and opened fire.

As regards Bligh, it is sufficient to say that he performed one of the most remarkable boat-voyages on record. In an overloaded and open boat, on the shortest allowance of provision compatible with existence, through calm and tempest, heat and cold, exposed to the attacks of cannibals and to the reproaches of worn-out and mutinous men, he traversed 3618 miles of ocean in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days, and brought himself and his followers to land, with the exception of one man who was killed by the natives. In this achievement he displayed those qualities of indomitable resolution and unflagging courage which ultimately raised him to high rank in the navy.

She was the _Forfarshire_, a steamer of three hundred tons, under command of Mr John Humble; and had started from Hull for Dundee with a valuable cargo, a crew of twenty-one men, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> passengers. It was a fearful night. The storm raged furiously, and would have tried the qualities of even a stout vessel; but this one was in very bad repair, and her boilers were in such a state that the engines soon became entirely useless, and at last they ceased to work. We cannot conceive the danger of a steamer left thus comparatively helpless in a furious storm and dark night off a dangerous coast. In a short time the vessel became quite unmanageable, and drifted...", "...Louis University, of St. Louis, Mo., has been made Provincial of the western province of the Jesuit Order, vice Rev.

The last-named group, made up of Democrats, numbered from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> to forty-four, and obviously needed the assistance of the \"mild reservationists,\" if they were to secure a two-thirds vote of the Senate. During October, all the amendments which the Foreign Relations Committee brought forward were defeated through the combination of the last two groups. Early in November, however, fourteen reservations were adopted, the \"mild reservationists\" voting with Senator Lodge, for lack of any basis of compromise with the Democrats.

About noon we saw and chased a large ship that appeared coming round Flamborough Head, from the northward, and at the same time I manned and armed one of the pilot boats to sail in pursuit of the brigantine, which now appeared to be the vessel that I had forced ashore. Soon after this a fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> sail appeared off Flamborough Head, bearing N. N.

Thus far the best record made by any other man was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> feet and five inches. Hickok must do his very best to beat that. The cheers died away as the Yale Goliath poised himself for the effort. He crouched, and then the heavy iron sailed through the air and fell with a thud to the ground. The tape was quickly drawn, and then the score went up. Forty-two feet and three inches! Once more Yale let herself loose, and it seemed that the roof must crack. Hickok quietly declined to take the two remaining trials open to him....", "...it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This fact confirmed my preconceived idea.

Of course, the 'forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'north-east and by north.' This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance.

On the wedding night she intends to kill her sons-in-law; but they, acting on the advice of him who had been the weakling of their party, but who has become a mighty hero, exchange clothes with their brides before \"lying down to sleep.\" Accordingly the Baba Yaga's \"trusty servants\" cut off the heads of her daughters instead of those of her sons-in-law. Those youths arise, stick the heads of their brides on iron spikes all round the house, and gallop...", "...Playhouse.\" In the words of the legal document, the Earl of Dorset \"in consideration that Richard Gunnell and William Blagrove should at their costs and charges erect a playhouse and other buildings at the lower end of Salisbury Court, in the parish of St. Bridges, in the ward of Farringdon Without, did demise to the said Gunnell and Blagrove a piece of ground at the same lower end of Salisbury Court, containing one hundred and forty foot in length and forty-two in breadth ... for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years and a half.\" The lease was signed on July 6, 1629. Nine days later, on July 15, the Earl of Dorset, \"in consideration of nine hundred and fifty pounds paid to the said late Earl by John Herne, of Lincoln's Inn, Esquire, did demise to hire the said piece of ground and [the] building [i.e., the playhouse] thereupon to be erected, and the rent reserved upon the said lease made to Gunnell and Blagrove.\" Herne's lease was for a term of sixty-one years.

There is a fondness for rapid transitions from one scene to another, as may be illustrated by the {53} fact that the Greek word for \"immediately\" occurs no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> times. In i. 27 the actual form of an original dialogue is shown in the abrupt and broken sentences employed. St. Mark uses different tenses of the Greek verb--present, perfect, imperfect, and aorist--with singular freedom, not because he did not know Greek well enough to write with more regularity, but because he is carried away by his interest in the facts which he relates.

Beginning with the capitals, he found that out of two hundred and seventy trials for each letter, W was recognized two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> times and E only sixty-three times, the former being much more distinct and the latter much less distinct than any other.

The Republican movement could not now go backward, and with a probation of four years to prepare for the next conflict, unembarrassed by the responsibilities of power, and free to profit by the blunders and misdeeds of its foe, it was pretty sure of a triumph in 1860. Fremont had received a popular vote of one million three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand two hundred and sixty-four, carrying eleven States and one hundred and fourteen electoral votes; while only four years before, John P.

The laws are made by the king in connection with a council of ministers. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> provinces of the kingdom are in charge of commissioners appointed by the king.

The government of the country had been provided for by the creation of a Council of State, consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> members selected from what was left of the Commons, and who were entrusted with full executive power at home and abroad. But if the Rump consented to profit by the work of the soldiers, it showed no will to signify its approval of it.

The Egyptians first employed this vague and uncertain method of calculating when they began to write the beginning of their history. These computed three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> generations from Menes to Sethon; and, having no fixed era, they supposed three generations to consist of a hundred years. In this manner they computed eleven thousand three hundred and forty years from Menes's reign to that of Sethon.

To these must be added foot soldiers of the Thracians, the Paeonians, the Macedonians, and others.

And of all this great host there was none fitter to be the ruler for beauty and great stature than King Xerxes himself.

The whole of our artillery was worked admirably. Captain Morrison's battery of the Third New York Artillery had three men wounded, and lost the same number of horses. Captain Morrison took at the battle of Kinston <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> prisoners, including two commissioned officers. At the battle of the railroad bridge he took seven more prisoners. When his battery was charged by the South Carolina regiments he kept up a steady fire until every round of his ammunition was gone, and then gave way to Captain Belger.

The assailants retreated, leaving Colonel Short, three officers, and fifty-two men dead in the ditch, and having <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of their number wounded.

The other company, composed of gentlemen and merchants in the west of England, had assigned to them the territory between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> and forty-five degrees. But only the first company succeeded. The territory, appropriated to the London or southern colony, preserved the name which had been bestowed upon it during the reign of Elizabeth,--Virginia.

Between the Union gunboats and the _Cotton_ the bayou had been obstructed so as to prevent any hostile vessel from ascending the stream beyond that point. A brisk fight followed. Under cover of the guns of the navy and of the raking and broadside fire of the batteries, the 8th Vermont and 75th New York first drove off the land supports and then moving swiftly on the _Cotton_ silenced her. In this advance the Vermonters captured one lieutenant and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> men. The _Cotton_ retreated out of range. That night her crew applied the match and let her swing across the bayou to serve as an additional obstruction. In a few moments she was completely destroyed.

On the 28th April, 1871, or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years ago, a meeting was held in Smith's Hall, which was situated in the building now occupied by Hall and Gospel on Government Street. The meeting was called to organize a society of the pioneers of British Columbia, and especially of Victoria. Among those present, and one who took a prominent part in its work, was William P. Sayward. By the death of this pioneer I am the sole remaining member of those who founded the society. By Mr. Sayward's death this city and province...", "...executive council were the Hon. Edward B. Chandler, the Hon. Robert L. Hazen and the Hon. Charles McPherson. When the House met in July, the Hon. Charles Simonds, of St. John, was elected speaker, and it was soon discovered, after the liquor bill had been disposed of, that the majority supporting the government was so small as to make it impossible for them to accomplish any useful legislation. When the legislature again met, in the early part of 1857, it was seen that in a House of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> members twenty were arrayed against the government, and the only way in which government business could be done was by the casting vote of the speaker. This condition of affairs speedily became intolerable, because it practically made legislation impossible, but it was brought to an end by Mr. McMonagle, one of the members for the county of Kings, withdrawing his support from the government. Two courses only were now open to them, to tender their resignations or advise the...", "...favour of confederation. The candidates were the Hon. S. L. Tilley and A. R. Wetmore on the confederate side, and J. V. Troop and S. R. Thompson opposed to confederation. Mr. Tilley's majority over Mr. Troop, who stood highest on the poll of the two defeated candidates, was seven hundred and twenty-six. The only counties which the anti-confederate party succeeded in carrying were Westmorland, Gloucester and Kent,--three counties in which the French vote was very large,--so that of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> members returned, only eight were opponents of confederation. The victory was as complete as that which had been recorded against confederation in the beginning of 1865. {THE BATTLE IS WON} The battle of confederation had been won, and the triumph was mainly due to the efforts of the Hon. Mr. Tilley. That gentleman, as soon as the defeat of confederation took place in March, 1865, had commenced a campaign for the purpose of educating the people on the subject. Being free...", "...the Middle Ages. What we now call the \"police\" did not exist then. In populous cities, especially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating power. Feudalism had constructed these great communities in a singular manner. A city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries, which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes. Hence, a thousand conflicting establishments of police; that is to say, no police at all. In Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> lords who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre-Dame des Champs, who had four.

The grappling irons of the latter were already flung on her foe, and the next instant the savage pirates sprang on deck, so overwhelming the crew by their furious onslaught that, unheeding their officers' commands, they flung down their weapons and leaped into the sea. The battle continued on the deck of the merchantman, whose firing had alarmed the other <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> vessels, which now also began to discharge their guns right and left, but without coming nearer, for they had no desire to mingle in the fray, and, in the very midst of the fleet, the pirates killed one half the Portuguese sailors, while losing only two of their own number.

The Russian forces in and about Sebastopol numbered 150,000; their losses sustained in its defence amounted, in killed, wounded and missing, to 90,142. The allied armies numbered 80,650 French, 43,000 English, and 20,000 Turks in January, 1855. The British troops suffered terribly from disease. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> English infantry battalions, which embarked originally, mustered 36,923, and were reinforced by 27,884. Their strength at the conclusion of hostilities was 653 less than it was at the beginning. The Sardinians suffered proportionately.

Not a single person under Tucker's command was killed, or died from sickness, during this expedition, and, singular to relate, after all the hardships and exposure endured the explorers were in much better health when they returned to their steamers than when they left them at the beginning of the expedition.

Its banks as well as the banks of the numerous streams that fall into it, are covered with pines of the finest growth, which appear to be almost inexhaustable, for although lumbering has been prosecuted on this river to a great extent for a number of years past, there is still abundance found by going a little back from the water.

The Council of State was only assembled to conciliate the nobility, whose loyalty was still further encouraged by the granting of honours, such as that of the Order of the Golden Fleece, and entrusting to them missions to foreign countries. The upper bourgeoisie, on the other hand, were largely permitted to enter the ranks of the nobility by receiving titles. From 1602 to 1638 no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> estates were raised to the rank of counties, marquisates and principalities, and a contemporary writer complains that \"as many nobles are made now in one year as formerly in a hundred.\" It was among these new nobles, or would-be nobles, who constituted a class very similar to that of the English gentry of the same period, that the State recruited the officers of its army and many officials, whose loyalty was, of course, ensured.

The old party of the Right was, however, also broken up; side by side with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> Clericals there were twenty-eight Christian Socialists led by Dr Lueger, a man of great oratorical power, who had won a predominant influence in Vienna, so long the centre of Liberalism, and had quite eclipsed the more modest efforts of Prince Liechtenstein.

Three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> were killed in action, or died of wounds or disease; five hundred and twenty-two were wounded; three hundred and eighty-two received decorations or honours, two of which were the Victoria Cross.

One of the first acts of the new Principal was the making of a general appeal, with the Governors, in the autumn of 1920, for public subscriptions to increase the endowment fund and revenues for the purpose of increasing professors' salaries and for the erection of new buildings or extensions. The response to this appeal was generous; a...", "...\"Of course, of course, Mr. Aston. I quite understand.

This railroad too is a standard gauge. To reach this altitude the train passes over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> bridges, one of which is two hundred and fifty feet high. It passes through sixty tunnels, the highest one of which is the Galeria tunnel, which is 15,665 feet above the sea.

The expedition was a complete failure, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> being killed or drowned, and one hundred and five wounded or missing. Among the wounded was Admiral Nelson himself, who lost his arm. The news of the mutinies taking place at Spithead and the Nore was a source of great anxiety to the officers, but the men were so attached to them that there was no real cause for uneasiness with regard to their own ship, and when the eleven ships of Duncan's fleet joined the mutineers at the Nore, the _Jason_ was one of the few that remained...", "...time of Shakespeare, and grown not \"for any other use than in regard of their beautiful flowers of several varieties, as they have been carefully sought out and preserved by divers to furnish a garden of dainty curiosity.\" Gerard had in his garden only six species; Parkinson had or described thirty-one different sorts, and after his time new kinds were not so much sought after till Dean Herbert collected and studied them.

In the Puyallup valley there were more neighbors--two families to the square mile.

The enemy suffered even more severely. The brigade lost <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> killed--eighteen in the Sixth; thirteen in the Fifth; five in the First and five in the Seventh. The losses of the Fifth in officers and men wounded but not fatally were larger than those in the Sixth, the total of killed and wounded aggregating something like fifty in the regiment. The First, though it did not meet with so sturdy a resistance in its immediate front, was able to work around the flank of the enemy, thus materially aiding in breaking their spirit and putting...", "...thou forgotten how we two went together in search of the golden hare?

Now when this old man was at the point of death, he divided all he had among his sons, and gave to each of the forty a horse; but when he came to the forty-first he found he had no more horses left, so the forty-first brother had to be content with a foal.

The eldest brother took the eldest sister, and the youngest the youngest, till they were all suited. And the youngest brother of all said, \"I'll take that little damsel who is sitting on the stove in the corner and has the nice kerchief in her hand.\" Then they all drank a bumper together to seal the bargain, and after that the forty-one bridegrooms and the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> brides laid them down to sleep side by side. But the youngest brother of all said to himself, \"I will bring my foal into the room.\" So he brought in the foal, and then went to his bedchamber and laid him down to sleep also. Now his bride lay down with her kerchief in her hand, and he took a great fancy to it, and he begged and prayed her for it again and again, until at last she gave it to him.

For some reason he removed across the river to Newbury. As a town official of Salisbury, he had occasion to lay out a highway towards Haverhill--a road still in use. He came upon a location that pleased his fancy, and in 1647, at the age of twenty-seven, he returned to the northern side of the river and built a log house on the left bank of Country Brook, about a mile from the location he selected in 1688 for his permanent residence. He lived <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years in this log house, and here raised a family of ten children, five of them stalwart boys, each over six feet in height.

This compact, signed by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> members, of whom eleven bore the title of \"Mister,\" was a plantation covenant, the political counterpart of the church covenant which bound together every Separatist community.

It is plain that Frontenac's career, so vigorously begun during the Thirty Years' War, had not developed in a like degree during the period (1648-61) from the outbreak of the Fronde to the death of Mazarin.

Though he had written, at the suggestion of Miltitius, a letter to the pope, not indeed of submission, but rather of exculpation, in language bold and energetic, he was in 1520 formally condemned by a bull from Rome, which, after enumerating <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of his heretical opinions, denounces against him the vengeance of the church, and excommunication, if within sixty days he did not make a due submission. This violent conduct Luther answered by \"The Captivity of Babylon,\" a book in which he inveighed bitterly against the abuses of Rome; and then, calling the students of Wittemberg together, he flung into the fire the offensive decree, which he called the _execrable bull of Antichrist_.

He was well on to forty when he took once more to shooting, he was forty-three when he killed his first salmon, but no boy could have more single-mindedly rejoiced in these pursuits.

Here they met and fought two deadly foes, the Indians and the Asiatic cholera. Theirs was a record of bravery and endurance; and their commander, Major...", "...alike except that one pair got alcohol and the other pair did not.

During the same time the temperance dogs had forty-five puppies and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of these lived.

There were several blind poets, of whom Milton is, of course, the most famous; he became totally blind in May, 1652, being then <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of age. A large number of his works, \"Paradise Lost\" among others, were written after his misfortune. He lived in darkness for twenty-two years, dying November 8, 1674. Homer was known as \"the blind bard of Chio's rocky isle,\" but he did not become blind until late in life--if indeed he was a real person at all. Another blind poet of note was Luigi Grotto, an Italian, known as \"Il Cieco d'Adria.\" He lived from 1541 to 1585. Giovanni Gonelli (1610-1664) was a...", "...ii, iii, iv, v and viii.

There is a growing effort to work in the thin wedge of \"a moderate tariff, not protective but defensive,\" but the opposition are fighting it with every weapon in their armory of protest.

Thirty per cent of the people are underfed and on the verge of hunger. Thirty per cent of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> millions comes to over twelve millions.

Immediately on his arrival at Berlin, he obtained an interview with Frederick William; and the replies of that king to the remonstrance of the British minister are abundantly curious.

All her life afterward she remembered that night as something akin to a witch's revel on the Brocken, a horrible wild reign of passion which she trembled to recall, and for which she did penance many times in tears. \"It shows the devil there is in us all,\" she said to herself, and she never passed the fire-irons for a long time afterward without an unpleasant consciousness.

The limited circle of island society suggested that Miss Lois had been hunting the loon with a hand-net--a Northern way of phrasing the wearing of the willow; but if the New England woman loved William Douglas, she was not conscious of it, but merged the feeling in her love for his child, and for the memory of Alida. True, she was seven years older than he was: women of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> can answer whether that makes any difference. On a brilliant, sparkling, clear June morning William Douglas went down to the little Roman Catholic church and married the French girl. As he had resigned his position in the army some time before, and as there was a new set of officers at the fort, his marriage made little impression there save on the mind of the chaplain, who had loved him well when he was surgeon of the post, and had played many a game of chess with him.

It is true that every party to the treaties endeavoured to evade the fulfilment of his pledges; but that was the custom of the times.

Unfortunately she did neither. She was now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years of age, and had ceased for nearly two years to cohabit with her husband. Her health was bad; she had grown stout, and her comeliness had departed; all hopes of her giving to the King the son and heir for whom he so ardently craved had quite vanished, and with them much of her personal hold upon her husband.

This is a large genus of birds, consisting of two hundred species, distinguished by the peculiar structure of the bill, which assists them in climbing. They are gregarious, have generally very brilliant plumage, and inhabit warm regions. _Anecdotes._--The gray parrot often lives to a great age. We are told by Le Vaillant of one which lived in the family of Mr. Huyser, in Amsterdam, for thirty-two years; had previously lived <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> with that gentleman's uncle; and there can be little doubt that it was two or three years old at the time of its arrival in Europe. In the day of its vigor, it used to speak with great distinctness, repeat many sentences, fetch its master's slippers, call the servants, &c. At the age of sixty, its memory began to fail. It moulted regularly twice a year, till the age of sixty-five, when the red feathers of the tail gave place to yellow ones, after which, no other change of...", "...years, there might be, in one family, three descents from father to son, in another two, in another only one. This is, perhaps, an extreme case; but it shows at least how far the disparity may be extended, without exceeding the bounds of possibility. The present Emperor of the French had reached the age of forty-eight, when the Prince Imperial was born: whereas her Majesty Queen Victoria became a grandmother at forty-one. Thus, in the royal family of England we find two descents in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years; in the imperial line of France only one descent in forty-eight years. It is, therefore, quite preposterous _to take for granted_ that, in _all the families of a whole nation_, the number of descents were exactly the same during a period of 215 years. But this assumption is especially inadmissible, when we consider the peculiar circumstances of the case before us. The first generation, according to Dr. Colenso, was composed of the fifty-one grandsons of Jacob. They...", "...and, besides a duel between France and England, involved Austria, with its allies, France, Russia and the German princes against the new kingdom of Prussia. This naturally led to an alliance between England and Prussia. Towards the end of the war, early in 1762, hostilities were declared against Spain. An English fleet and army, under Lord Albemarle, were sent to Cuba. The former consisted of more than two hundred vessels of all classes, and the latter of fourteen thousand and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> men. The opposing Spanish force numbered twenty-seven thousand six hundred and ten men. With the English, were a large number of Americans, some of whom figured later more or less prominently in the war of the Revolution.

The Tyrolese and Salzburghers collected more especially at small shooting meetings of their districts; so also the Franconians north of the Maine. A lasting union of middle-sized and smaller places existed there. This Franconian union comprehended in the sixteenth century, together with Wuerzburg and Schweinfurt, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> cities and forty-two villages with free peasants, particularly from the bishopric of Wuerzburg and the royal county of Henneberg. The chief prize was a neck chain--\"The Jewel of the Country\"--which the victor wore round his neck for a year, and which imposed upon the victorious place the duty of giving the next shooting meeting.

The next morning, when the package from the American Exchange Bank was delivered in Washington, the experienced Treasury clerk who received it perceived at once, from the condition of the package, that something was wrong. Employees of the Treasury Department seem to gain a new sense, and to be able to distinguish bank-notes from ordinary paper merely by the \"feel,\" even when done up in bundles. Looking at the label mark of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand dollars, the clerk shook his head, and called the United States Treasurer, James W. Hyatt, who also saw something suspicious in the package. Mr. Blanchard, the Washington agent of the Adams Express Company, was summoned, and in his presence the package was opened. It was found to contain nothing more valuable than slips of brown straw paper, the coarse variety used by butchers in wrapping up meat, neatly cut to the size of bank-notes. The forty-one thousand dollars...", "...Agency was notified; and urgent despatches were sent to Mr. John Hoey, president of the express company, and to Robert Pinkerton, who were both out of town, that their presence was required immediately in New York. Meanwhile every one who had had any connection with the stolen package--the paying-teller of the bank, other bank clerks, the messengers, detective McDougal, the receiving-clerks of the Adams Express Company, and the express messenger--was closely examined. Where and how the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand dollars had been stolen was important to learn not only in itself, but also to fix responsibility for the sum lost as between the bank and the express company.

Therefore the only complainant in the case now available would be the bank officials, who, for some reason, have seen fit to let the matter drop. Mr. Pinkerton's theory of the way in which this robbery was committed is that Crawford had an accomplice who had previously prepared the bogus package, and who, by previous...", "...the theft single-handed is the fact that when arrested in Honduras the bulk of the stolen money was found on his person, while it was known that, in addition to the thirty-two thousand dollars then recovered, he had previously spent considerable sums in various ways. His voyage, for instance, must have been expensive; and it was found that he had given at various times to members of his family sums ranging from twenty to fifty dollars. This would have left out of the original <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand dollars a very meager remuneration for a confederate. Perhaps the most reasonable explanation of the robbery lies in the assumption that Dominie Earle, honest, but simple-minded, did not go up-stairs at all with Crawford, but left him at the foot of the stairs, influenced by his eagerness to get home. Granting this supposition, what would have been easier than for Crawford, left alone at the foot of the stairs, to have turned back with the valise and gone into the...", "...a poet was chiefly centred in my love for his tender rhyme, 'Auf Wiedersehen', which I can not yet read without something of the young pathos it first stirred in me.

The following decade is remarkable for the wonderful increase in the number of inventions due to women, for there was a sudden jump from twenty-eight to four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> patents awarded them between the years 1861 and 1871.

In 1731 he republished it, with five others that had appeared in the interval, in the first Part of the _Clavieruebung_ (P. bks. 205, 206). 224 Forkel's rather casual critical axioms seem to be as follows: \"Publication postulates excellence\"; \"An amended MS. implies that the original text was not a finished work of art.\" 225 It was the first work engraved by Bach himself, though the parts of the Cantata _Gott ist mein Koenig_...", "...is not, indeed cannot be, doubted. Thus, Manouvrier determined the skull capacity of thirty-two distinguished men to average 1663 cc., or 103 cc. above the general mean of 1560 cc.--an excess of nearly 7 per cent. Again, the mean weight of brain of thirty-four such men reached 1533 grammes--an excess of 163 over the average (1370), or almost exactly 12 per cent. No amount of reasonable allowance can rob these results of their import. It is no answer to say that the cranial capacity of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> murderers averaged 1593 cc., or 33 cc. (about two per cent.) above the mean. We see no reason why a murderer might not have more than ordinary intelligence, though many be degenerates; it is not at all unlikely that his central nervous system or some part of it should be highly developed. Unless we err widely, not a few of the greatest characters of history have been great criminals.

More extensive observation shows that the Black average is about four ounces below the White. The absence of very large brains among the Blacks comes out most distinctly. There were no Black brains weighing over fifty-six ounces, only five weighing so much as fifty-five; whereas, eight White brains weighed over sixty ounces, and forty weighed over fifty-five. Likewise of the twenty-four Whites, only one fell under forty-five ounces, but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of the 141 Blacks; also, only forty-seven of the 278 Whites; it is plain, then, that large brains predominate among the Whites and small ones among the Blacks.

The man, it seemed, was of decent family, had done well at Oxford, both in scholarship and athletics. He was born--the Marquis counted his years. He was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years old--nineteen years younger! He closed the book and sat down in his chair, forgetting for once to mix for himself the whiskey and soda which lay ready to his hand. It seemed to him that there was a tragedy in that nineteen years. Borden was of the age now that he himself had been when Marcia had first listened to his very courtly and yet uncommonly definite love-making. He rose almost like a thief, crossed the hall, and, opening softly the door of the drawing-room,...", "...\"You complicate every situation in life by thinking of other people.

She can attain that position by becoming my wife.\" \"Really!\" his listener murmured, with a faint note of unruffled surprise in his tone. Borden set his teeth. The task which had seemed to him so easy was presenting now a very different appearance. Nevertheless, he kept an iron restraint upon himself. \"I do not wish to weary you,\" he went on, \"by making a long story of this.

And that he should have so felt was but natural, for she had been drawn to him, as she confided to him in one of her letters, by what he had written rather than and not by her knowledge of the man. There can be no doubt, however, that on Mrs. Gilchrist's part something more than the friendship of her new-found liberator was desired.

This was published by the Royal Society in England, in 1848, the expense being too great for one person.

The discovery of these fossils was due to Hugh Miller, whose interesting life and pathetic death will always be associated with the study of the Old Red Sandstone. In the spring of 1846, a great change took place in the life of the overworked naturalist. He had long hoped to visit the United States for scientific investigation, and now the time had come.

The groups are distinguished by various differences, of which the most important is that in the one case the workmen used four and in the other two pins to keep the paper in its place while being printed. An attractive explanation of all this would be that while Gutenberg set up the...", "...uncandid spirit of the leaders among their opponents in clinging to this charge, and reiterating it, after they had failed to substantiate it by any credible evidence.

Among the fifteen was Jackson, who, upon his way, a few days later, from Washington to his home in Tennessee, repeated and re-enlivened the charge of \"bargain and corruption.\" It is more than probable that Jackson believed in it himself. He was so convinced of his own honesty that he believed every one who differed with him to be dishonest.

At the moment the representation in the Senate was evenly balanced, but in the House it stood against the South, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> to ninety-nine. One more non-slaveholding Commonwealth, without an offset on the other side, would destroy the balance in the Senate and enable the North to undertake legislation hostile to slavery. The extension of slavery to new Commonwealths was thus manifestly a necessity to its permanent security, and even continuance, in the Commonwealths where it already existed. The policy of the slaveholders must be to allow no new non-slaveholding Commonwealth to be formed without...", "...of a Republican who could not be impeached was the only way to defeat this \"nefarious scheme.\" This explanation was of course ignored by Bullock's enemies when it was made; but in view of the lack of evidence that he was guilty of any fraud, and in view of the positive evidence to the contrary, there is now no reason to doubt it.

Although it was not improbable that doubts might have arisen as to the ability of the colony to repay so large an amount, a glance at its financial position would show that the required relief might be given without the risk of any loss to the mother country. The commissioners showed that the revenue of the island had increased from seventeen thousand pounds in 1839, to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand in 1859,--more than doubling itself in twenty years. It seemed apparent, therefore, that without disturbing the tariff or reducing the ordinary appropriations, in five years the natural increase of population, trade, and consumption would give six thousand pounds a year, or a sum sufficient to pay the interest on a hundred thousand pounds, at six per cent. As it was not improbable that five years would be required to purchase the estates, and expend the loan to...", "...of their mission, and immediately afterwards they attended a formal meeting of the privy council. A committee of the council, consisting of Sir John A.

In that memorandum the delegates proposed to accept, as the basis of union, the offer made in 1869 by the Dominion government, namely, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand dollars a year for revenue, provided the Dominion government would assume the cost of the railway, as well as that of the proposed branch to Port Hill.

On the first day of July, I boarded the train for Ashland, where I met Capt. Dutton, and we were joined immediately afterward by Capt. Geo. W.

Hans Holbein was another of the early artists who prepared their drawings for the express purpose of reproduction by means of wood engraving. That he fully appreciated the resources of his art there can be no doubt, for he imbued his work with an expressive individual force which was distinctly progressive and influential. His best known production consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> engravings representing \"Death--the King of Terrors,\" in association with nearly every phase of human life. Each one of these designs is a picture parable of remarkable power and suggestiveness. The characteristic drawing and quaint expressiveness of Holbein's illustrations merit unqualified admiration, and his graphic use of pure line for pictorial expression stands almost unrivalled. Hans Litzelburger engraved Holbein's designs.

I was satisfied that Ingersoll's teachings were, to a great extent, what I believed; but I did not like to hear a man get up and ridicule my mother's God; and my answer to those who wanted me to go was that I would not listen to any man who tried to ridicule the religion of my mother.

Among the three hundred and thirty must have been included some of the latter, though the Greek traveller did not know it.

On the one hand he was informed that in his time all Egypt was...", "...equal to the occasion, and on his asking them concerning Helen they at once gave him a long story about her arrival and adventures in Egypt. Proteus was at the time the king in Memphis, and not the sea-god of ships and prophetic insight, as Homer had imagined, and he very properly took Helen away from Paris and kept her safely till Menelaos arrived after the Trojan war to claim his wife. Accordingly Proteus, the Phoenician \"old man of the sea,\" has gone down among the three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> Pharaohs of Egypt whose names were recounted to Herodotos by the \"priests.\" There could not be a better illustration of the real character of his \"priestly\" informants, or of the worthlessness of the information which they gave him.

Allowing the 1016 the same rate of speed in the opposite direction, it would have passed Banta at eleven-twelve or thereabouts. Hence there would still be <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> minutes running time to be divided between the eastbound train and the westbound engine. In other words, the meeting-point, with the two running at the same speed, would fall about twenty minutes west of Banta. When we tried to figure this meeting-point out we were stuck. Banta lay in the lap of an irrigated valley in the hogback, a valley which the diverted waters of Banta Creek had turned into an orchardist's paradise. West of the town the railroad ran through a hill...", "...means that large enterprise was reduced through the perfection of system to a rather ordinary one. This could not have been if all its details and its possibilities had not been anticipated long in advance and planned against. The job was undertaken by the store itself; through its delivery department, in charge of Mr. James Price, with Mr. James Woods as his very active assistant. Both of these men are veteran employees of Macy's. The service record of the one of them reaches to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years and the other to forty-eight. They knew full well the size of the moving-day task that confronted them. To pick up a huge New York department-store and carry it twenty uptown blocks--almost an even mile--was a deal of a contract. Yet neither of them flinched at it. But both put on their thinking-caps and evolved a definite plan for it--a plan which in all its details worked without a hitch.

Mr. Gurney is of opinion that d'Orbigny's _Buteo unicolor_ is also referable to this form of _B. swainsoni_ (_cf._ Ibis, 1889, p. 134). A well-known writer on North-American birds (Capt. C. E. Bendire) gives the following account of the nesting of _Buteo swainsoni_ in Arizona:-- \"This species is by far the commonest Hawk in the vicinity of Fort Huachuca, and a resident throughout the year. Lieutenant Benson found not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of their nests containing eggs between May 14 and June 18, 1887. These were all placed in low mesquite trees and bushes, from 3 to 15 feet from the ground. Only six of these nests contained three eggs each, twenty-one nests contained two eggs, the remaining fourteen but a single egg. Many of the latter were undoubtedly laid by birds that had been robbed before, especially where the same nest was used again, which was frequently the case, and a few were uncompleted sets.

WHEN the Esquimo arrived with Bonsall and Petersen, Dr. Kane resolved at once to send them back with supplies for the remaining portion of Dr. Hayes's company, supposed to be, if living, at the miserable old hut. Petersen and Bonsall were utterly unable to accompany them. Of the scanty ship's store he caused to be cleaned and boiled a hundred pounds of pork; small packages of meat-biscuit, bread-dust, and tea were carefully sewed...", "...and of which even the tradition no longer lingers among the neighbouring Indians? In continuation Humboldt observes that \"that the inhabitants of Anahauc apparently designed giving the Pyramid of Cholula the same height, and double the base of the Pyramid of Teotihuacan, and that the Pyramid of Asychis, the largest known of the Egyptians, has a base of 800 feet, and is like that of Cholula built of brick. The cathedral of Strasburgh is eight feet, and the cross of St Peter's at Rome <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> feet lower than the top of the Pyramid of Cheops. Pyramids exist throughout Mexico; in the forests of Papantla at a short distance above the level of the sea; on the plains of Cholula and of Teotihuacan, at the elevations which exceed those of the passes of the Alps. In the most widely distant nations, in climates the most different, man seems to have adopted the same style of construction, the same ornaments, the same customs, and to have placed himself under the government...", "...deer raid. Macmillan lived in a very small cot at the back of his father's house, which his father had used as a barn. It was very poorly furnished even for that locality. There was a family of five small children, and there was only one bed in the house, with one blanket. Three of the children slept out with a neighbour. Macmillan cultivated the half of his father's croft, and had one cow. He was also a fisherman, having a share in a boat of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> feet keel; but, though he had attended the Barra fishing last summer, he had made nothing. His wife had got a boll of meal from the destitution fund, but besides that, she had only two barrels of potatoes. Previous to getting that meal, they had lived exclusively on potatoes. She stated that when her husband went out to the deer raid, there was but one barrel of potatoes; but since then, she explained, she had fallen back upon the seed.\"...", "...Hertwig from observation of the ova of starfishes. Mammalian ova, owing to an almost complete lack of yolk, are all small. The egg of a whale is about the size of a fern-seed, but the yolked eggs of birds are large--that of the great auk was 7.5 inches long. In man the ovum is from 0.18 to 0.2 mm. in diameter, scarcely visible to the {70} naked eye, and the spermatozoon is extremely minute. The human spermatozoon is only fifty-four thousandths of a millimetre in length, and from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> to fifty-three thousandths of a millimetre are taken up by its flagellum. The essential part is from four to six thousandths of a millimetre in length (Dr. L. N. Boston, _Journ, of Applied Microscopy_, vol. iv. p. 1360). A line of 18 human spermatozoa would reach only across the head of an ordinary pin. These spermatozoa have the power of locomotion in alkaline fluid.

As for him, he too appeared to us to forget all dates. I know that he was only now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years old, and having been the finest man in the world, he could not but preserve agreeable vestiges of a once striking beauty. But his young conquest had hardly entered on her eighteenth year, and this difference could not fail to be plain to the most inattentive, or most indulgent eyes. The King, with a sort of anticipatory resignation, had for six or seven years greatly simplified his appearance.

The house was planned by Wren, but the design was laid aside about the year 1690, when Henry, seventh Duke of Norfolk, who was a favourite of William Prince of Orange, obtained an act of parliament empowering him to lease the remainder of the garden-ground for a term of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years, and to appropriate to himself the fund which had accumulated. He accordingly let the ground to Mr. Stone of New Inn, an attorney, and buildings of a very different character to the palatial mansion that had been contemplated, ere long overspread the site of Arundel House.

We may first of all remark that, just as the French Revolution was in some sense the parent of the Romantic movement, the disintegration of the old Roman life was accompanied by the rise of antiquarianism. Cicero's was the last generation that learnt the Twelve Tables by heart at school _ut carmen necessarium_; and Varro, Cicero's contemporary, was the first and perhaps the greatest of all Roman antiquaries. So at least St Augustine held. Sixteen of his <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> books of Antiquities Varro gave to the gods, for \"he says he was afraid they would perish, not by any hostile invasion, but by the neglect of the Roman citizens, and from this he says they were rescued by himself, as from a fallen house, and safely stored and preserved in the memory of good men by books like his; and that his care for this was of more service than that which Metellus is said to have shown in rescuing the sacred emblems of Vesta from the fire or AEneas in...", "..._Four Masters_ in 1569. _Malachy O'Molony_ was next proclaimed in consistory on 10th January, 1571.

Francis._); and on 22nd of August, 1576, his translation to Kilmacduagh was solemnly promulgated in the Roman court.

This prelate played an important part in the last great struggle of the Desmond chieftains; and we have intentionally passed rapidly over the preceding bishops, that space might remain for dwelling on the unpublished documents connected with his history. At the time of his appointment to the see of Killaloe, James Fitzmaurice was actively engaged on the Continent in enlisting the aid of the Catholic...", "...when he died in 1810 most critics mourned for the unwritten lyrics and poetic dramas of which American literature had thus been robbed; they mentioned the author as a gifted youth, whom fate had removed at the beginning of a splendid career. To a certain extent this attitude was a tribute to the youthful spirit of William Vaughn Moody, to his vivacity, energy and cheerfulness. But it was chiefly a new illustration of the fact that nowadays poets flower late in the season. Moody was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years old when he died--and there was a time when the poet of forty was considered well past the meridian of his genius. Most of the great poets established their fame before they were thirty years old--Keats and Shelley died at twenty-five and twenty-nine respectively. But nowadays the poet of forty-five is still called young and the poet of thirty our kind critics consider a precocious infant. As a matter of stern fact, it is doubtful that American literature has really...", "...appear in the sketch, \"Crossing the Barren Grounds\"--followed by seven years of duty as governor of Tasmania. But these exacting duties had not tamed the adventurous spirit of this heroic Englishman.

When tendered the command the public awaited eagerly for his reply. He was in his sixtieth year, and through <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> degrees of longitude--from 107 deg. W. to 148 deg. W.--he had traced the coast of North America, thus outlining far the greater extent of the passage. But his arctic work had been done under such conditions of hardship and at such eminent peril of life as would have deterred most men from ever again accepting such hazardous duty save under imperative orders.

In one complete saros, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> solar eclipses will generally happen, but only about one-fourth of them will be total. The saros is a period at the end of which the centers of sun and moon return very nearly to their relative positions at the beginning of the cycle.

The international moral damage this war entails is the concern of all nations. The manner in which it was precipitated without first having recourse to the enlightened methods of peaceful adjustment, combined with the concerted refusal of European Powers to attempt mediation, will make peace treaties waste paper, and peace professions of civilized nations sham and hypocrisy.

This works out at the average of L2,616 per flowing bore, supplying 669,369 gallons a day. Calculating on the basis of 5 per cent., including interest and redemption payments, the annual charge for this money is equal to L131 per well, spread over a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years' term, the average cost to each well-owner being thus L1 for 1,865,000 gallons of water a year. Thus, although much money has been lost in sinking unsuccessful bores, the investment has on the whole been amazingly profitable, even allowing that a further annual charge for maintenance must be added. It need hardly be said, however, that in practice this enormous flow of artesian water could not be utilised solely either for human consumption or for irrigation.

Patrick Bronte (d. 1861) was incumbent here for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years, and a memorial near the west window of St Michael's church bears his name and the names of his gifted daughters upon it. The grave of Charlotte and Emily Bronte is also marked by a brass. In 1895 a museum was opened by the Bronte society. There is a large worsted industry.

They are aptly and ingeniously adapted to the truths they seek to inculcate; and they are remarkable for a terse simplicity of form and style, well suited to the objects and character of such productions. The maxims and criticisms they enforce must approve themselves to the mind, both of the professed scholar and the general reader. The author was born in Teneriffe, A.D. 1750, but was educated and resided at Madrid, where he died in 1791, at the early age, of course, of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years. His uncle, Don Juan De Yriarte, was the chief superintendent of the royal library; and the nephew was educated under his auspices. In his eighteenth year, he commenced his literary career by the writing of dramas, and the translation of plays from the French for the Spanish stage. He spent his life in the duties of sundry offices under the government; yet he very soon assumed and maintained a high consideration as a scholar and writer. His works, however, were of a...", "...might be named the historians Ephorus and Theopompus, the Attic archaelogist Androtion, and Isocrates of Apollonia, who succeeded his master in the school. Among the practical orators we have, in the forensic kind, Isaeus; in the political, Leodamas of Acharnae, Lycurgus and Hypereides. Hermippus of Smyrna (mentioned by Athenaeus) wrote a monograph on the \"Disciples of Isocrates.\" And scanty as are now the sources for such a catalogue, a modern scholar[5] has still been able to recover <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> names. At the time when the school of Isocrates was in the zenith of its fame it drew disciples, not only from the shores and islands of the Aegean, but from the cities of Sicily and the distant colonies of the Euxine. As became the image of its master's spirit, it was truly Panhellenic.

Towards the close of the year 1520, principally by Luther's advice, he had married a daughter of Mayor CRAPP, of Wittenberg. But of this we shall speak further hereafter. CHAPTER V. MELANCHTHON WITHOUT LUTHER. As early as the summer of 1520, the Pope, upon Eck's instigation, issued a severe bull against Luther, in which <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> propositions from his various writings were condemned, and he himself was threatened with excommunication if he should not recant. But the hero was of good courage, for he was suffering for the best cause. Eck triumphed, but the Wittenberger was not to be intimidated, and wrote the well-known severe work \"Against the Bull of Antichrist,\" and even took the bold step, on the 10th of December, 1520, to cast this bull, together with the canon law and other papal writings, into...", "...bad effects as far as offspring are concerned reveal themselves in the main under the category of \"false heredity,\" i. e., germinal or fetal poisonings rather than of heritable changes induced in the germ-cells. Most investigators feel that there are too many criminal, imbecile, insane and unhealthy persons among the offspring of drunkards to dismiss the matter as a coincidence. In an investigation of Imbault, for example, we find recorded of one hundred tuberculous children that while <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> were of tuberculous parentage, thirty-six per cent, were the offspring of inebriates. Furthermore Imbault cites the observations of Arrive on 1,506 cases of juvenile meningitis to the effect that this malady is twice as frequent in the children of alcoholic as in those of tuberculous parentage. It has been proved by Nicloux (_L'Obstetrique_, Vol. 99, 1900) that in dogs and guinea-pigs alcohol passes through the placenta and may be detected in fetal tissues; hence it is in...", "...287. They both insisted they had made no mistake, so we had to measure it all over again. There had come up a little flurry of snow in the meantime, which happens frequently at that altitude, and Eatumup Jake wanted them to divide the difference between 287 and 292, but as one had inches and the other feet, Eatumup Jake couldn't make the proper division in his head and we had nothing to figure with. So we measured again and counted and found they each had 287. As this would only equal <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> stock cars, and as there was forty-three cars of stock, five cars of California fruit, three cars merchandise, nine tonnage cars and the way-car, we knew our train couldn't possibly get in on this sidetrack. So Jake put on his pants and we started on again, perfectly satisfied now that we had solved what seemed at first a great mystery. After walking several miles it became daylight and we discovered a man and woman with a mule team and wagon, going the same way we were....", "...contrasted with one of the best establishments of the year 1814.

Ground was broken in the month of April, 1884, and the building completed and occupied in January, 1885. It has a frontage of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> feet six inches on German street, and extends back on Paca street one hundred and fifty feet to Cider Alley. Located upon one of the broadest thoroughfares, at a point which is the water-shed of this part of the city, being at the level of one hundred feet above tide-water, it rises prominently among other fine warehouses surrounding it, showing its array of architectural beauty to advantage, for it is one of the most imposing of the mercantile structures of the city.

This desperate condition needs as much aid every year as _all_ the Boards give _all_ <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> aided churches at present. Instead, this church has been allocated to one denomination, and is now getting less attention than before. This case constitutes an abuse of the principle of allocation.

Eighteen of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> pastors are graduates of colleges and theological seminaries; six others are college graduates, three are graduates of seminaries or Bible Schools, but have no college training.

If we turn from Rome to the neighbouring city of Naples, we shall find evidence of much more artistic work. In 1478 Sixtus Riessinger printed there for Francesco Tuppo an edition of Boccaccio's _Libro di florio e di bianzefiore_, or _Philocolo_, illustrated with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> woodcuts, of no great technical merit, but by no means without charm. Two years later a representation of the supposed origin of music by the figures of five blacksmiths working at an anvil occurs in an edition of the _Musices Theoria_ of Francesco Gafori, printed in 1480 by Francesco di Dino. Much more important than this is a handsome edition of _[AE]sop_ published in 1485 by Francesco Tuppo, and printed for him by an anonymous firm known to bibliographers as the 'Germain...", "...sets of proofs from the woodcuts are in existence, with lettering said to be in the types of Froben of Basel, who may have abandoned the idea of publishing them because of the vigour of their satire on the nobles and well-to-do. The Trechsels, the printers of the French edition, are known to have had dealings with a Basel woodcutter with initials H. L., who died before June 1526, and may have purchased the blocks directly from him, or at a later date from Froben. In 1538 they issued <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> woodcuts with a dedication by Jean de Vauzelles, and a French quatrain to each cut either by him or by Gilles Corrozet, giving to the book the title _Les Simulachres et historiees faces de la mort_. Its success was as great as it deserved, and ten more cuts were added in subsequent editions.

But what was the moral influence of this multiform, universal, all-embracing, and all-penetrating worship? Varro, whom Cicero calls the most acute and learned of writers, and whose great work in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> books he praises as containing the names, classes, offices, and causes of all divine and human things, divided theology into the fabulous, the natural, and the civil. In the first, he said, are many fictions unworthy of the nature and dignity of immortal beings: such as that one god sprang from the head, another from the thigh, another from drops of blood; such, again, as that gods were thieves or adulterers, or became slaves to men. In fact, this fabulous theology attributed...", "...It is from the pen of George Percy, a brother of the Earl of Northumberland, who was chosen to succeed Smith on his departure from the colony.

His ill health is made an excuse for his inefficiency, but Dale's letter of May 25, 1611, shows that even the horrible events of Percy's first government had not taught him to plant corn when again left in charge. Percy naturally resents Smith's boastfulness, and bluntly accuses him of laying claim to credit...", "...the same region. This Whale grows to a length of over 9 feet, but this length is exceptional. Its anatomy has been elaborately described by Dr. Anderson.[262] The next genus, _Inia_, is thus to be characterised:--Dorsal fin rudimentary; pectorals large and ovate. Teeth, as many as thirty-two on each side, often with an additional tubercle. Skull without large maxillary crests; palatines not hidden by pterygoids, but divided by vomer. The vertebrae of this genus are few in number, only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> in all, which are thus distributed: C 7, D 13, L 3, Ca 18. The peculiarities of the vertebral column are several. In the first place, as has been mentioned in the definition of the family, all the cervicals are separate and individually of some length. Secondly, the axis has a better trace of an odontoid process than in any other Whale except _Platanista_, where it is even more obvious. The lumbar region is remarkable on account of its restriction to three vertebrae. The...", "...while in America the proportion exceeds four-fifths.

One of the most extraordinary cases of an insane man attempting to restore his reason by voluntary starvation was discovered recently at the ---- County Insane Asylum. The case presents an interesting study for medical men generally. ----, aged forty years, a well-known resident of ----, who has been confined in the institution for the last two years, has abstained absolutely from all food except water, for the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days. From the forty-second day of his fast until the fifty-first day he drank one pint of milk daily, and from then began eating strawberries and milk. This diet was maintained for three weeks, and was then succeeded by oatmeal gruel and milk. The case is a matter of careful record at the institution and under circumstances that prevented deception. Therefore, there is not the slightest doubt as to the extraordinary performance having been genuine. Mr. ----, when he first...", "...he has had lucid intervals, and during these brief periods he frequently expressed the belief that there existed some method by which the insane might have their affliction alleviated if not entirely done away with. To Mrs. ----, the matron of the asylum, he took a great fancy, and, while averse to having anything to do with any other of the officials, he confided in her thoroughly and often expressed the wish that his mind might be restored to him and that he could be released. \"For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days,\" said Mrs. ----, \"nothing passed his lips but water, and tepid water at that. Of this fact I am thoroughly positive, knowing as I do the continuous efforts made every day to induce him to eat. When he began the fast he had been living on the same diet as the rest of the patients. He came to me and said, seemingly in a perfectly rational manner, that he was anxious to be cured, and that he thought abstinence from food for a time might benefit him. Mr. ---- said he did...", "...added strawberries.

He next inquired how far the sun must be removed from us, in order to appear no brighter than Sirius. He found the distance to be one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand times its present distance. But Sirius is more than two hundred thousand times as far off as the sun; hence he inferred that, upon the lowest computation, it must actually give out twice as much light as the sun; or that, in point of splendor, Sirius must be at least equal to two suns. Indeed, he has rendered it probable, that its light is equal to that of fourteen suns.

In 1820 Congress appropriated one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand dollars for completing the road from Washington, Pennsylvania to Wheeling. In the same year ten thousand dollars was appropriated for laying out the road between Wheeling, Virginia and a point on the left bank of the Mississippi River, between St. Louis and the mouth of the Illinois River.

The domestic policy of the state was yet to be molded, and such precedents established as would thereafter affect the destiny of Alabama. At this time Governor Pickens was just <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years old. There was a demand for extraordinary prudence in calling into conjunction with himself, by the governor, the sagest counsellors that the state then had. Executive leadership at this time must encounter a critical juncture. Fortunately for Alabama, Governor Pickens was amply qualified for the onerous task imposed. He sprang from one of the most eminent of the early families of the south. The name of Pickens lingers in Carolina history today with a flavor of...", "...walked as Doctor Reefy thought he had never seen anyone walk before. To her whole body there was a swing, a rhythm that intoxicated him. When she came and knelt on the floor beside his chair he took her into his arms and began to kiss her passionately. \"I cried all the way home,\" she said, as she tried to continue the story of her wild ride, but he did not listen. \"You dear! You lovely dear! Oh you lovely dear!\" he muttered and thought he held in his arms not the tired-out woman of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> but a lovely and innocent girl who had been able by some miracle to project herself out of the husk of the body of the tired-out woman. Doctor Reefy did not see the woman he had held in his arms again until after her death.

In this remarkable piece of work we have figures of more than six hundred persons, and seven hundred animals, besides thirty-seven buildings, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> ships or boats. There are of course also numerous shields of warriors, of which some are round, others kite-shaped, and on some of the latter are rude figures, of dragons or other imaginary animals, as well as crosses of different forms, and spots.

Another Pilgrimage Beginning at her stern and bearing to the starboard side, Ali set out to become more intimately acquainted with the ship. Almost every step brought to light a fresh marvel. As a camel driver who traveled with caravans, at one time or another he had been in every port that a caravan can visit, and he was not unfamiliar with ships. But never before had he seen anything to compare with the _Supply_. A hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> feet over all, the wooden three-master had a main and a quarterdeck. An official United States Navy ship, she was armed with a battery of four twenty-four pounders. One glance revealed that her crew of forty officers and men believed in and strictly adhered to the rules of first-class seamanship; the _Supply_ was as spotlessly clean as she was trim. Had she been a conventional ship, Ali would have considered her impressive enough. As it was, he found her overwhelming....", "...Wayne's prompt and vigorous action averted the massacre of these animals and insured establishment of the most colorful and most unique method of transportation ever attempted in the United States--the Camel Corps. * * * * * At the very rear of the caravan, where he had been posted by Major Wayne so that he might keep a watchful eye on all the other camels, a puzzled and apprehensive Ali sat lightly in Ben Akbar's saddle.

From Yusuf, the belled leader who swung along as placidly as though the seven hundred and fifty pounds he bore on his pack saddle had no weight at all, to Iba, the little female who walked just ahead of Ben Akbar and had been relieved of all pack-carrying because of anticipated motherhood, none had any rebellious ideas or any inclination to do anything except walk along until they came to their destination.

In the Books of Chronicles he is merely mentioned accidentally in a genealogy. The Second Book of Kings only devotes one verse to him (xiv. 25) beyond the stock formulae of connection so often repeated.

It began well; it fell by pride; it closed in misery. The annals of his son Jotham were not eventful, and he died at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> or earlier. He is said to have reigned sixteen years, but there are insuperable difficulties about the chronology of his reign, which can only be solved by hazardous conjectures.[352] He was a good king, \"howbeit the high places were not removed.\" The Chronicler speaks of him chiefly as a builder. He built or restored the northern gate of the Temple, and defended Judah with fortresses and towns. But the glory and strength of his father's reign faded away under his rule.

It appears that in 1820 Dr. Hamil and a party of climbers were struck by a snowslide on the slope of Mont Blanc.

A writer has founded on this incident an interesting story, in which the bodies are recovered in an excellent state of preservation, and an old woman with sunken cheeks and gray hair clasps the youthful body of her lover of long ago, the guide.

The more painful details of his Neapolitan residence may be found by those who care to seek for them in the deplorable publication of Ranieri's peevish old age (_Sette anni di sodalizio_). The decay of Leopardi's constitution continued; he became dropsical; and a sudden crisis of his malady, unanticipated by himself alone, put an end to his life-long sufferings on the 15th of June 1837. The poems which constitute Leopardi's principal title to immortality are only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> in number, and some of these are merely fragmentary. They may for the most part be described as odes, meditative soliloquies, or impassioned addresses, generally couched in a lyrical form, although a few are in magnificent blank verse. Some idea of the style and spirit of the former might be obtained by imagining the thoughts of the last book of Spenser's _Faerie Queene_ in the metre of his _Epithalamium_. They were first edited complete by Ranieri at Florence...", "...a poet was chiefly centred in my love for his tender rhyme, 'Auf Wiedersehen', which I can not yet read without something of the young pathos it first stirred in me. I knew and felt his greatness some how apart from the literary proofs of it; he ruled my fancy and held my allegiance as a character, as a man; and I am neither sorry nor ashamed that I was abashed when I first came into his presence; and that in spite of his words of welcome I sat inwardly quaking before him.

Of the total number forty-three are retained in Great Britain. When a bird becomes so rare that the individual remains can be counted, the same may be taken to be practically extinct as a species. The great auk has pursued a policy of extinction for the past two or three centuries, until now, like the mighty moa and the dodo, it has ceased to exist.

They had been only four days getting to a point below the San Juan, simply drifting; that is about two hundred miles, or some fifty miles a daylight day. Around three o'clock on the fourth day they heard the deep roar as of a waterfall in front of them. * Parry's first record of White's story is in Report of Surveys for a Railway across the Continent by Wm.

In the late afternoon of this same day, they came to the end of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> miles of Cataract Canyon, marked by a deep canyon-valley entering from the left at a sharp bend where millions of crags, pinnacles, and towers studded the summit of the right-hand wall, now again thirteen hundred feet high. It was called Millecrag Bend, either then, or on the second expedition. A new canyon immediately formed; a narrow, straight canyon, with walls terraced above and vertical below. The thirteen hundred feet of altitude speedily diminished and in nine miles...", "...scarcely knew where to make a landing. Finally we halted on the right, constantly watching the boats' lines lest the sand should melt away and take our little ships with it. Along the bases of the cliffs above the high waters were narrow strips of rocky soil, supporting a few stunted cottonwoods and hackberry trees, which, with some stramonium bushes in blossom, were the sum total of vegetation. In every way the Junction is a desolate place. It is the beginning of Cataract Canyon, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> miles must be put behind us before we would see its end--forty-one miles of bad river, too. From a point not far up the Green, which we easily reached with a boat, a number climbed out by means of a cleft about fifty feet wide, taking the photographic outfit along. The country above was a maze of crevices, pinnacles, and buttes, and it seemed an impossibility for any human being to travel more than a few hundred yards in any direction. The character of the place may best be...", "...ever got through Cataract Canyon alive. At some little rapid, after leaving the railway crossing, the first boat stove a hole in her side, but this was readily repaired and the party ran without further accident over the smooth stretches of river preceding the Junction, arriving at this latter point in four days.

Pitamakan's estimate of the loss of the enemy proved to be not far from correct.

Of that number one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> had been shot or drowned in the river, and not one of the survivors had reached the shore with his weapons.

The two trails were the same for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> miles, when, as the able historian of the fur trade remarks, a simple sign board was seen which carried the words, \"Road to Oregon.\"[41] The methods of these old men were very direct and simple.

About this time their number was so great that they were limited by law in each county to one at the court house and one at the ferry.

The same author has also shown that secondary attacks are most common in the young; so that advancing age not only renders a first attack of the disease improbable, but lessens the risk of a recurrence of it. The influence of age upon acute rheumatism is further shown in the fact that the disease is less severe, and less apt to invade the heart, in elderly than in young persons.

Events of such vast importance have rarely followed each other with such rapidity as have those of our late war with Spain.

Here we have an inspired scholar performing the mathematical solution of dividing <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> generations by three and obtaining fourteen generations for a quotient. \"The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and three score\" (Ezra ii, 64). This number, 42,360, is given as the whole number of persons belonging to the families that returned from Babylon. Adding together the numbers given in the census register, of which the above is declared to be the sum total, we find the whole number to be only 29,818--a difference and a...", "...front door of a certain country parsonage near North Yakima testifies to at least one pastoral vacation, by the presence of three large Flicker holes in its panels.

The district schoolhouse of a neighboring township is worst served of all, for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> Flicker holes punctuate its weather-beaten sides--reason enough, surely, for teaching the young idea of that district how to shoot. Indeed, the school directors became so incensed at the conduct of these naughty fowls that they offered a bounty of ten cents a head for their destruction. But it is to laugh to see the fierce energy with which these birds of the plains, long deprived of legitimate exercise, fall to and perforate such neglected outposts of learning. The bird...", "...9d. for \"A. B.,\" the excess being practically, as might be expected, in the amounts for \"mercer\" and \"taylor.\" Many, it is stated, fell short of \"A.

In that year he became a resident of Nebraska and there made his home until 1876, when he cast in his lot with the Pacific northwest. During the intervening <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years he has lived at Dayton and has become one of the foremost citizens of that town and, in fact, of Columbia county. In 1888 he was appointed deputy sheriff under W. R. Marcus, and two years later was elected justice of the peace. Subsequently he became police judge and for twenty-two years he filled both offices. In the discharge of his duties he manifested a fine sense of justice and an unusual ability to read human nature. For seven years he was also court commissioner...", "...He came to America in 1875, when a young man of twenty-five years, and for a brief period was a resident of the state of New York. The opportunities of the west attracted him and he made his way across the country to Walla Walla county, Washington, where he settled in 1876, becoming the first commercial gardener of the valley. He is today the owner of forty-six acres of very rich and productive land upon which he is now extensively engaged in gardening. He has followed this business for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years and he has ever held to the highest standards in his work. He produces vegetables of most excellent quality, size and flavor, and by reason of this he has been assured of a very liberal patronage. His business has grown year by year and today he has a splendidly improved farm, having secured all of the improvements that facilitate work of that character.

The researches of O.

In 1804 he married, and he built a house at Worthing, where he practised in the autumn for sixteen years. In 1807 he tried to become physician to the Middlesex Hospital. In this he failed, but he lectured there on Chemistry, Physiology, Nosology, Practice of Medicine, and Materia Medica. Many of the lectures formed afterwards part of his work on 'Medical Literature.' This year he published...", "...Captain Putnam took it upon himself to teach the lad how to shoot better.

When it came Andy's turn to shoot, the acrobatic lad made <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> out of a possible fifty. This was not so high, but as thirty-five was considered the passing mark there was no complaint. \"Well, I suppose it could be worse,\" was Andy's comment. He had been afraid that he would not pass, for he did very little shooting. Reff Ritter was the next student up, and by luck more than anything else he made forty-three points. \"I learned to shoot in Paris,\" he said, loudly. \"A French expert taught me.\" \"That was very good,\" said Captain...", "...evolution of the pear, yet his accounts of grafting and storing make plain the fact that this fruit was a standard product of the times.

Pliny, more or less discredited as a scientist because he was a compiler and, as the men of science for science sake never forget to point out, at all times of a utilitarian bent of mind, makes a most important contribution to the history of the pear as a domesticated fruit. Indefatigable compiler as he was, few cultivated pears of his or more ancient times could have escaped his notice, and the thread of the utilitarian running through...", "...Toward the middle of the sixteenth century Agostino Gallo, an Italian, wrote _The Twenty Days of Agriculture and the Charms of Country Life_. With the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, agriculture was reduced to the production of the necessities of life and pomology all but perished. It required a thousand years to recover from the domination of the barbarian conqueror of Rome. Hence, it is not surprising that Gallo names but twelve varieties of pears instead of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> of Pliny. Gallo says that he does not name all of the summer pears, but leaves the inference that his list is complete for autumn and winter sorts. There probably was a greater number under cultivation at this time in Italy, but Gallo's list shows that the number was small. Gallo is regarded as the restorer of agriculture in Italy after the dark ages, and as one of the most enlightened men of his time, so that we may accept him as an accurate historian.

The ring-finger had suffered a slight abrasion, and the stain of the blood was still visible and unchanged after <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years. A left foot, the flesh white and fresh. Along with these fragments were portions of waistcoats, hats, hobnailed shoes, and other clothing; a wing of a pigeon, with black feathers; a fragment of an alpenstock; a tin lantern; and lastly, a boiled leg of mutton, the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant odor. The guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from the glacier; an hour's exposure to the sun had already begun the work of...", "...I suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and then give it to a sick stranger? Indeed he wouldn't, so he wouldn't. I resolved, then, that I would do all I could to injure Mont Blanc. In the record-book was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened on the mountain.

He estimates the total by sea and land, thus augmented, at two millions six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> thousand six hundred and ten fighting men, and computes the number of the menial attendants, the motley multitude that followed the armament, at an equal number; so that the son of Darius conducted, hitherto without disaster, to Sepias and Thermopylae, a body of five millions two hundred and eighty-three thousand two hundred and twenty human beings [63]. And out of this wondrous concourse, none in majesty and grace of person, says Herodotus, surpassed the royal leader.

On the 16th of July, 1799, at break of day, we beheld a verdant coast, of picturesque aspect. The mountains of New Andalusia, half-veiled by mists, bounded the horizon to the south. The city of Cumana and its castle appeared between groups of cocoa-trees. We anchored in the port about nine in the morning, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days after our departure from Corunna; the sick dragged themselves on deck to enjoy the sight of a land which was to put an end to their sufferings. Our eyes were fixed on the groups of cocoa-trees which border the river: their trunks, more than sixty feet high, towered over every object in the landscape. The plain was covered with the tufts of Cassia, Caper, and those arborescent mimosas, which, like the pine of Italy, spread their branches in the form of an umbrella. The...", "...manager, they were aiding to fill his coffers. This was hinted at in some of the newspapers, and the consequence was, that many stayed away to punish him, if possible, under the silent system. But this did not last long. The love of mischief was as great an incentive to many of them as enmity to the new prices. Accidental circumstances also contributed to disturb the temporary calm. At the Westminster quarter-sessions, on the 27th of October, bills of indictment were preferred against <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> persons for creating a disturbance and interrupting the performances of the theatre. The grand jury ignored twenty-seven of the bills, left two undecided, and found true bills against twelve. The latter exercised their right of traverse till the ensuing sessions. The preferment of these bills had the effect of re-awakening the subsiding excitement. Another circumstance about the same time gave a still greater impetus to it, and furnished the rioters with a chief, round whom...", "...them. If 'applause' means success, the play thus maimed and maltreated was successful enough: it 'made way' for Macready's own Benefit, and the Theatre closed a fortnight after. Having kept silence for all these years, in spite of repeated explanations, in the style of your critic's, that the play 'failed in spite of the best endeavours' &c. I hardly wish to revive a very painful matter: on the other hand,--as I have said; my play subsists, and is as open to praise or blame as it was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years ago: is it necessary to search out what somebody or other,--not improbably a jealous adherent of Macready, 'the only organizer of theatrical victories', chose to say on the subject? If the characters are 'abhorrent' and 'inscrutable'--and the language conformable,--they were so when Dickens pronounced upon them, and will be so whenever the critic pleases to re-consider them--which, if he ever has an opportunity of doing, apart from the printed copy, I can assure you is...", "...Ethan French, now relieved of part of his duties by the employment of a second engineer, was never in better humor than when Fanny Jane, seated at this instrument, sang the songs she had sung to Wahena and himself on the lake island in Minnesota.

The season had been very profitable, and Lawry's account-book showed that the boat had been employed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days, besides nine evenings, the net profits of which were nearly fifteen hundred dollars, all of which was in the bank, or invested in government securities. While Captain Lawry was considering the practicability of running the _Woodville_ between certain places on the lake as a passenger-boat, he was startled by receiving a huge government envelope, containing a liberal offer for the use of his steamer as a despatch boat on southern rivers.

The first were the lords, which included seven earls and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> barons. Because of the increase of lesser barons due to a long national peace and prosperity, the lords attending were reduced in numbers and peerage became dependent not on land tenure, but on royal writ of summons. The great barons were chosen by the king and received a special summons in their own names to the council or Parliament. Others were called by a general summons.

The ten Earth years I had spent upon Barsoom had encompassed but five years and ninety-six days of Martian time, whose days are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> minutes longer than ours, and whose years number six hundred and eighty-seven days.

The words surged through my brain again and again, until at last I must have voiced them audibly, for Yersted shook his head. \"In time to save your Princess?\" he asked, and then without waiting for my reply, \"No, John Carter, Issus will not give up her own.

The lot of a last-wicket batsman, with a good eye and a sense of humour, is a very enviable one. The incredulous disgust of the fast bowler, who thinks that at last he may safely try that slow head-ball of his, and finds it lifted genially over the leg-boundary, is well worth seeing.

Nervousness at cricket is a curious thing. As the author of _Willow the King_, himself a county cricketer, has said, it is not the fear of getting out that causes funk.

The Supply was so wretchedly leaky that it was considered positively unsafe for her to risk the voyage. But her commander, Lieutenant William Kent, had a high sense of duty, and his courage was guided by the fine seamanship characteristic of the service. Having in view the importance to the colony of the stock he had on board, he determined to run her through. As a matter of fact, the Supply arrived in Sydney <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> days before the Reliance (May 16), though Hunter reported that she reached port \"in a most distressed and dangerous condition,\" and would never be fit for sea again.

After dinner, the general proposed to go on to Fort Harker, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> miles away, without any escort, leaving orders for Cody to return to Fort Larned the next day, with the soldiers. But Cody, ever impatient of delay when there was work to do, notified the sergeant in charge of the men that he was going back that very afternoon.

But, though its attribution of authority was great, its exercise of the powers lodged with it was hampered by differences among its members, and the disaffection of various interests and parties. The Council of State contained...", "...F\u00e9es_, which was published in Paris in 1785. Not much better are the attempts of Count Hamilton, who died in 1720; of M. de Moncrif, who died in 1770; of Mademoiselle de la Force, died 1724; of Mademoiselle l'Heritier died 1737; of Count Caylus, who wrote his _F\u00e9eries Nouvelles_ in the first half of the 18th century, for the popular element fails almost entirely in their works. Such as they are, they may also be read in the _Cabinet des F\u00e9es_, a collection which ran to no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> volumes, and with which no lover of popular tradition need trouble himself much. To the playwright and the story- teller it has been a great repository, which has supplied the lack of original invention. In Germany we need trouble ourselves with none of the collections before the time of the Grimms, except to say that they are nearly worthless.

He was not succeeded by his daughter, but by his brother. This precedent was soon transformed into the \"Salic law\" that only heirs in the male line could succeed to the throne. The rule was really the result of the \"genealogical accident\" that for three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> years, or since the election of Hugh Capet, every French king had been succeeded by his son. In several cases the son had been crowned in the lifetime of the father. Thus the principle of heredity, and of heredity in the male line, had taken root. Under _Philip V._ and his successor, _Charles IV._ (1322-1328), there was cruel persecution of the Jews, and many people suffered death on the charge of sorcery. EDWARD I.

After Mr. Archdale's arrival in England, he laid this address, together with a state of the country, and the regulations he had established in it, before the Proprietors, and showed them the necessity of abolishing many articles in the constitutions, and framing a new plan of government. Accordingly, they began to compile new constitutions; from his information and intelligence <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> different articles were drawn up and sent out by Robert Daniel, for the better government of the colony. But when the governor laid these new laws before the assembly for their assent and approbation, recommending the careful perusal and consideration of them, they treated them as they had done the former constitutions, and, instead of taking them under deliberation, modestly laid them aside.

Happy was it for the distressed North Carolineans Governor Craven lost no time in collecting and dispatching a force to their assistance and relief.

Hideous and dreadful, at this time, was that wilderness through which Colonel Barnwell had to march; and to get to North Carolina in time, for the relief of the people, the utmost expedition was requisite. In such a case it was not possible for his men to carry a sufficient quantity of provisions, together with arms and...", "...childhood!

An experienced manufacturer has said, \"You can protect a machine, you can guide the buzz-saw, but no law that you can enact can, in a large industry, protect the heart and soul of the child.\" A marked improvement has been made in the last five years in combating the evils of child labor.

In Pennsylvania, during the session of 1812, an act was passed authorizing twenty-five banks, with a capital of $9,000,000.

In the following session the proposition was renewed with more vigor, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-one</span> banks with a capital of $17,000,000 were authorized by a large majority; the representations of the Executive proved useless, and they immediately entered upon their duties with an insufficient capital.
