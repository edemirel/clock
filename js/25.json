The rock is crowned by the remains of a high wall or curtain, surrounding the building, the principal part of which, a strong square keep of three storeys, is still standing, surmounted by four square hanging turrets. This outward wall encloses a spacious yard, and is in some places terraced. In the angles were platforms for the convenience of the defending soldiery. The entrance was by a spacious gateway between two guard rooms, projected...", "...the Coast Artillery is an essential factor in the defence of Massachusetts. Coast artillery affords the most magnificent team-sport in the world. Three officers and sixty-seven men work together in firing the twelve-inch rifle, and each contributes something essential to the success of the shot. Twelve inches is the bore of the rifled gun; forty-two or more feet the length; $45,000 is the cost, and the carriage represents an investment of $40,000 more. It is loaded with three hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> pounds of powder, and a projectile weighing more than half a ton, costing upwards of $150, and sufficient in itself to destroy a hostile warship. The target, the moving target, at which the shot is fired, floats on the water at a distance of eight to sixteen miles; and without the use of powerful glasses is all but invisible. Range and direction (azimuth) are determined by a combination of most delicate scientific observing instruments. Now the great gun swings majestically...", "...he returned poverty-stricken to Ohio, where he founded in January, 1821, the Genius of Universal Emancipation. A few months later he transferred his paper to the more congenial atmosphere of Jonesborough, Tennessee, but in 1824 he went to Baltimore, Maryland. In the meantime, Lundy had become much occupied in traveling, lecturing, and organizing societies for the promotion of the cause of abolition. He states that during the ten years previous to 1830 he had traveled upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand miles, five thousand of which were on foot. He now became interested in plans for colonizing negroes in other countries as an aid to emancipation, though he himself had no confidence in the colonization society and its scheme of deportation to Africa. After leading a few negroes to Hayti in 1829, he visited Canada, Texas, and Mexico with a similar plan in view. During a trip through the Middle States and New England in 1828, Lundy met William Lloyd Garrison, and...", "...was fretting at its jaw.

Torn by doubts, he seemed willing to find excuses for postponing action, hoping to see clearer light on the future before committing himself to a decisive movement. An interesting item in the discussion between the Confederate generals was that Hood suggested Purdy as a better base than Tuscumbia, and proposed to abandon the work of rebuilding the railroad near that place. Purdy was some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles north of Corinth on the Mobile and Ohio Railway, and not far from the old battlefield of Shiloh. Its landing-place on the Tennessee River was nearly opposite Savannah, and it was there that Grant had stopped his steamboat for a conference with General Lew Wallace on his way to Pittsburg Landing the morning of the great battle. It is probable that Hood thought it advantageous to take a line by which he might avoid the risk of expeditions from Decatur, and could more...", "...the Duesseldorf school, who strove to make up in vigor and picturesqueness what he lacked in sentiment and feeling. A second illustrated edition was issued a few years later in New York. The illustrations were drawn on wood, many by Birket Foster, and the engraving and printing were done in England. This method of producing a fine edition of a favorite American writer would hardly suit a protectionist, but, then, Mr. Bryant was not a protectionist--as who is in literature? The last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of Mr. Bryant's life differed but little from those which preceded them. That is to say, they were spent in journalism, diversified, now and then, by the publication of a new volume of poems, and by several journeys on the Continent. The result of these journeys was given to the public in the shape of letters in the _Evening Post_, which letters have been collected in two or three volumes. Mr. Bryant's prose is admirable--a model of good English, simple, manly,...", "...cities under contribution. The alarm of the bluff secretary was natural, but there was no real ground for it. THE MONITOR. The Swedish inventor, John Ericsson, had completed his _Monitor_, which at that hour was steaming southward from New York.

The sides of the former were made of oak, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> inches thick, and covered with five-inch iron armor. The turret was protected by eight-inch plates of wrought iron, increasing in thickness to the port-holes, near which it was eleven inches through. It was nine feet high, with a diameter of twenty-one feet. She drew only ten feet of water, and was armored with two eleven-inch Dahlgren guns, smooth bore, firing solid shot weighing 180 pounds.

If it didn't charge at us, but attempted to escape, it was to be allowed to run across the strip of open ground in front of the camera before I was to shoot. Stephenson took his place on the other bank, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty yards from the edge of the reeds. Then the beaters were told to advance, and they moved forward, throwing rocks and sticks into the reeds ahead of them. The lion appeared on Stephenson's side. Like a flash it sprang out.

The envelope caught Anthony's eye, and held it; and that was scarcely to be wondered at, for, in his own unmistakable handwriting, it was addressed to Madame Torrebianca, at the New Manor, Craford, England, and its upper corner bore an uncancelled <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> centime Italian postage-stamp. On the page the envelope marked was printed the sonnet, \"Voicy le Bois.\" What happened at this moment in Anthony's head and heart?

Many things that had seemed trifling or meaningless must have assumed significance and importance.

Men say to me daily, when I ask them, in passing, \"Any thing in this morning's paper?\" \"O, no; nothing at all.\" And, as I never had any other answer, I am bound to suppose that there never _was_ any thing in a daily newspaper; and, therefore, that the horrible burden of misery and of change, which a century accumulates as its _facit_ or total result, has not been distributed at all amongst its thirty-six thousand five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> days: every day, it seems, was separately a blank day, yielding absolutely nothing--what children call a deaf nut, offering no kernel; and yet the total product has caused angels to weep and tremble.

Sissy coughed none at all. When we got to the wharf it was raining hard. I left her on board the boat, after putting the trunks in the ladies' cabin, and set off to buy an umbrella and look for a boarding-house. I met a man selling umbrellas, and bought one for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents. Then I went up Greenwich street and soon found a boarding-house.... It has brown-stone steps and a porch with brown pillars. \"Morrison\" is the name on the door. I made a bargain in a few minutes and then got a hack and went for Sis.

But in very truth it meant nothing whatever except that the wily Fabian, Joseph E. Johnston, in command of the Confederate forces in that quarter, was wisely determined to keep himself and his army within reinforcing distance of Beauregard at Manassas, where the first great battle of the war was obviously destined to occur. Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg were clearly of no value whatsoever to General Johnston. By abandoning them and retiring to Winchester he placed his army <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty miles nearer to Manassas than it had been and drew Patterson by so much farther from the fighting points. For in order to reach and reinforce McDowell for the impending Manassas fight Patterson must march north, recross the Potomac, move thence eastward to Washington and then move southwest again to McDowell's assistance. Johnston meanwhile secured to himself a short line of march which gave him a very great advantage.

The train was loaded, principally, with flour, bacon, sugar, coffee and tobacco. Flour was then worth <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars per hundred, bacon forty cents a pound, and other things in proportion.

He searched and found the bag, and there was in it thirty-six moidores, eighteen guineas, five crown pieces, two half-crowns, two broad pieces of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> shillings, four of twenty-three shillings, and one half-broad piece. He told me I must be cunning, and not to be seen to be flush of money. Says I, 'What would you advise me to do with it?' 'Why,' says he, 'you might have thrown it down the sink, or have burnt it, but give it to me, and I'll take care of it.' And so I gave it to him.

The capital of Utah, so well chosen for its special purpose, was an unbroken wilderness forty years ago, but can now boast a population of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand. Under the hands of its present occupants, the whole surrounding valley has been cultivated to a degree of fertility scarcely equaled by the same number of square miles on the continent.

Accordingly, in 1908, the American Bison Society formulated a plan by which the establishment of such a range and herd might be brought about. That plan was successfully carried into effect, in 1909 and '10. The Bison Society proposed to the national government to donate a herd of at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> bison, provided Congress would purchase a range, fence it and maintain the herd. The offer was immediately accepted, and with commendable promptness Congress appropriated $40,000 with which to purchase the range, and fence it. The Bison Society examined various sites, and finally recommended what was regarded as an ideal location situated near Ravalli, Montana, north of the Jocko River and Northern Pacific Railway, and east of the Flathead River.

Thinking we were the advanced guard of our column, they retired hastily to a village some two coss off. Meanwhile, Hodson and I, unconscious of their vicinity, rode on. They sent out scouts, and ascertained that only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> of our sowars were in the village, upon which they resumed their march, sending a party to cut up our men, and, I suppose, to wait for our return.

This range of size corresponds to a range in the rate of fall from about five feet a second for the smallest drops up to about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet a second for the largest. The maximum size of raindrops is limited by the fact that very large drops are broken up in their fall through the air.

The insects which were on a surface of a colour Similar to their own remained uneaten, while <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> green insects on brown parts of plants had all disappeared in eleven days. The experiments of Poulton and Sanders[45] were made with 600 pupae of _Vanessa urticae_, the \"tortoise-shell butterfly.\" The pupae were artificially attached to nettles, tree-trunks, fences, walls, and to the ground, some at Oxford, some at St. Helens in the Isle of Wight. In the course of a month 93% of the pupae at Oxford were killed, chiefly by small birds, while at St. Helens 68% perished....", "...out I daurna gae.

I was healthy, young, light-hearted; I had plenty of money and as yet no cares; I lived in the present and did precisely as I wished; in one word, life was in full flower with me.

Before the fire sat a stately young woman, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of age, who rose as the Lord of Burningford and his guest entered. As she approached Toppleton would have given all he possessed to be rid of the abominable costume he had on; and when the young heiress of Burningford's eye rested upon the fearfully green cotton umbrella, he felt as if nothing would so have pleased his soul as the casting of that adjunct to an alleged Americanism into the fire; for Lady Alice was, if he could judge from appearances, a woman for...", "...was the organization of the Eden church. The hearts of the people were drawn together, the religious interest was quickened throughout the whole territory, and the idea of the Larger Parish came to be more generally accepted. Eden is a country neighborhood three miles north of Benzonia.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty years a Sunday-school had been maintained in that community--one of the best country schools in the state. A young people's society and a weekly prayer-meeting had also been kept up for a long time.

There was a deep interest, and a number of positive conversions.

There was a calm and quiet dignity in the expression of the pure and noble brow, which may often have been seen in women of similar character, and of some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of age. But it is rare to find such at seventeen. Doubtless the having been left alone in the world at so tender an age, had done much towards producing the expression in question.

The latter fact is established beyond any doubt, namely, that the Admiral was the first who discovered Paria, and that he was there before any other Christian whatever was either there or on any other part of the mainland, nor had any tidings of it. The Admiral Don Diego, his son, had proof of this from sixty hearsay witnesses and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> eye-witnesses, as is seen by the records of the lawsuit, which I have not only seen but thoroughly examined. It was also proved that it was owing to the Admiral having first discovered these islands of the Indies, and afterwards Paria, which is the mainland, before anyone else whatever, that the others had the courage to follow his example and become discoverers.

The peat-bed alluded to is not confined, says Mr. Buist, to the present channel of the Tay, but extends far beyond it, and is covered by stratified clay from fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet in thickness, in the midst of which, in some places, is a bed full of sea-shells.[398] Recent discoveries having established the fact that upward and downward movements have affected our island since the general coast-line had nearly acquired its present shape, we must hesitate before we attribute any given change to a single cause, such as the local encroachment of the sea upon low land.

The piece-work method is adopted in paying, and though a smaller rate is paid per ton in mining than is usual in the Pennsylvania or Illinois mines, the earnings of the miners aggregate much larger than the average in the East.

She had really stopped because a pebble had got into her shoe, and as she took it out she looked at her bare heel and remarked ruefully:--\"Those <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cent stockings aren't worth buying!\" Economic problems, however, were powerless to worry her to-day, when the sun shone and the wind blew and the ferns, washed by the rill running through the culvert under the road, gave forth a delicious moist odour reminding her of the flower store where her sister Lise had once been employed.

APPLETON AND COMPANY, 1877. PREFACE. What we have attempted has been to gather and present, in a way to be easily understood, the most important facts respecting \"Pottery and Porcelain.\" The study of this interesting subject has for more than a century been constant in Europe, and notably so during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. A correct knowledge of it may now almost be called a liberal education. In the United States something has been done; and the public mind is now asking, \"What is it that makes 'pottery and porcelain' so attractive to scholars, statesmen, women, and wits?\" In some degree we have answered this question. My part of the work has been to gather where I could such historical and technical facts and such illustrations as seemed most valuable, not only to the student but...", "...smaller than a quarter, or any smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twenty-five cents' worth. We had always been used to half dimes and \"five cents' worth\" as the minimum of financial negotiations; but in Salt Lake if one wanted a cigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk pipe, it was a quarter; if he wanted a peach, or a candle, or a newspaper, or a shave, or a little Gentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him from having the toothache, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents was the price, every time. When we looked at the shot-bag of silver, now and then, we seemed to be wasting our substance in riotous living, but if we referred to the expense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the kind. But people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and fond and vain of both--it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one's toleration. After a...", "...of the scene to be presented. As the guests arrive, the host invites them to be seated on a row of stools, very large but so low as to give the impression of sitting on the ground. A number of attendants immediately take off the visitors' shoes, anoint their feet with various oils, after which the guests rest their legs on a low, iron railing fixed in the ground and worked into a rude pattern. In front of the audience is a post to which is fixed an enormous jar containing perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to thirty litres of spirits of rice. A Moi seated before the post recites our praises in a drawling voice. Our skill in the hunting-field, our physical strength, the efficacy of our medicines form a theme on which the bard lets his fancy play freely. When he has recounted our individual virtues, another warrior imprisons our right wrists in a thick copper bracelet, an act which signifies the conclusion of a compact and an oath of blood-brotherhood. The great jar is then...", "...of country where one or more may not be found, while in the large cities colonies have been formed, in which much of their primitive life has been re-established, and an opportunity presented for the observation and study of these interesting people at our very doors.

The owners should each clear from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to seventy dollars per month, while the hired laborers are paid from twenty-five to thirty dollars per month, with their board and lodging. They rise at daybreak and work until their task is finished, often until far into the night. Two meals a day are provided for them, one at about nine in the morning and another between four and five in the afternoon. These consist of rice, fish and pork, and certain vegetables, and are abundant and palatable.

Now to settle with this obstruction.\" A few powerful strokes with an axe shattered enough bars to enable Mr. McKay to squeeze through, and, followed by his eager companions, he entered the mysterious cavern. At first there was little to attract the attention of the explorers. The cave was of irregular form, being about fifty feet in length, thirty in breadth, and varying in height from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to six feet. On the floor were six wooden chests, ordinary in appearance and apparently of simple construction; they would have easily been mistaken for seamen's chests placed in a lumber-room. Striding up to the nearest one, Mr. McKay raised the lid. There was no creaking of rusty hinges, no glitter of gold and jewels to dazzle the eyes. The chest was empty! \"Well, this is a sorry trick to have played on one another after so much trouble,\" commented he with a...", "...some more noisome place, of which those Canadians, in their pure country seclusion, could not even dream. How I wished they were all in those sweet hayfields, breathing that pure, untainted air! Oh, it was a delicious picture; I could have looked at it forever; and at every turn in the road some lovely view enchanted us--some new blending of sea and sky, wood and valley, and each perfect of its kind; and so we came at last to the famous Falls of \"Montmorenci,\" where we were to have <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents' worth of a miniature Niagara, with root-beer and sponge-cake \"to suit,\" for an additional fee; and truly they might have been more extortionate as far as the Falls were concerned, were it not such a damper to sentiment to pay for one's ecstasy by the shilling.

The hills fell away even more abruptly here than they did in the north, cut so often into straight, stratified brown cliffs of crumbling dirt that Conniston wondered how and where the road could find a way out and down into the lower land. They swept away, both east and west, in a wide curve, roughly resembling a half moon. Toward the east, perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles from where Conniston sat upon his horse, the distant mountains sent out two far-reaching spurs of pine-clad ridges between which lay Rattlesnake Valley. Due south, as Lonesome Pete's outstretched finger indicated, lay the road which they were to follow and the headquarters of the Half Moon. There again a thickly timbered spur of the mountains ran down into the plain on each side of a deeply cleft canon from which Lonesome Pete told them that Indian Creek issued, and...", "...a population of artisans noted not only for their artistic skill but for a spirit of lawlessness, a turbulent fanaticism, that had led to many scenes of violence in the city's earlier history. The whole of Delhi, as well as the palace--which had its own separate fortifications--was surrounded by a wall seven miles long, twenty-four feet in height, well supplied with bastions, and containing ten huge gates, each a small fort in itself. The wall was protected by a dry fosse, or ditch, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet wide and about twenty feet deep; this, in turn, was guarded by a counterscarp and glacis. On the northwest side of Delhi, and about a mile distant from the river, an irregular, rock-strewn spine of land, called the Ridge, rose above the general level of the plain, and afforded a panoramic view of the city and palace. The rising ground began about half a mile from the Mori Gate--which was situated on what may be termed the landward side of the Kashmir Gate. It...", "...very much pleased to have good tenants in their absence. I am going to take you and your mother and Miss Kean, if she can come, to see the place to-morrow morning. The rent is reasonable, ridiculously cheap even, one hundred and twenty-five francs a month.\" Mrs. Brown's face fell at the rental named by her cousin. The marchioness saw it and gave a merry laugh. \"I know just what you are doing, Milly; you are thinking in dollars. I said a hundred and twenty-five _francs_; that is only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars.\" \"Oh, how silly I am! I did think you meant dollars. Of course, that is cheap and well within our means. We are so grateful to you, Sally, and I am sure it will suit,\" said Mrs. Brown, blushing at her mistake, which she need not have done as it is no easy matter to think in foreign money.

Molly and Judy told Philippe all about Wellington College, and he in turn had much to tell them of Nancy, where he had been studying forestry after...", "...A woman was put on trial in this city last year for incredible cruelty in her treatment of a step-child. The evidence aroused a strong suspicion that a pitifully small amount of insurance on the child's life was one of the motives for the woman's savagery. A little investigation brought out the fact that three companies that were in the business of insuring children's lives, for sums varying from $17 up, had issued not less than a million such policies! The premiums ranged from five to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents a week. What untold horrors this business may conceal was suggested by a formal agreement entered into by some of the companies, \"for the purpose of preventing speculation in the insurance of children's lives.\" By the terms of this compact, \"no higher premium than ten cents could be accepted on children under six years old.\" Barbarism forsooth!

Or, what is even more startling, an otherwise intelligent and meek man, only because a brass plate or a uniform is put on him and he is told that he is a watchman or a customs soldier, begins to shoot with bullets at men, and neither he nor those who surround him consider him blameworthy for it, and would even blame him if he did not shoot; I do not even speak of the judges and jurors, who sentence to...", "...taking away several of the latter's old customers.

Training schools both for languages and practical navigation were at the same time organized, and a training ship was procured and put under the command of a British naval officer. Some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty small vessels were built in the course of as many years, but gradually the whole organization was allowed to fall into decay. Except for petty repairs this establishment was in 1909 valueless to the Chinese government. There were also small dockyards at Kiang-nan (near Shanghai), Whampoa and Taku. There are well-equipped arsenals at Shanghai and at Tientsin, but as they are both placed up shallow rivers they are useless for naval repairs.

As diamond expert of the Henry Latham Company he handles millions of dollars' worth of precious stones each year, and has practically unlimited opportunities for theft, without murder, if he were seeking to steal.

Standing on about twenty-five miles farther, we came to a cape which is a little more elevated than the rest of the coast, and as its front had a red colour, we named it Cape _Roxo_, or _Rosso_.

This resemblance induced us to call the tree \"The little Gooseberry tree.\" At the table land, and along the upper South Alligator River, it was a tree from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to thirty feet high, with a fresh green shady foliage; but, at the Cobourg Peninsula, it dwindled into a low shrub. The fruit was much esteemed there by the natives; for, although the tree was of smaller size, the fruit was equally large and fine.

It is, the vast extent of the publications in which the history of Mr. Lincoln's life and times, his individual biography and real or written utterances, or his personal appearance, were in one way or another commemorated. A gentleman who has begun a collection of such materials had some time ago gathered two hundred different books on Mr. Lincoln, a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> portraits, besides badges, mourning cards, autographs and manuscripts, as he reports, \"almost without number.\" And in the list of publications about the rebellion compiled by Mr. Bartlett, are enumerated three hundred and eighty books, sermons, eulogies or addresses upon his life or death. There is an astonishing contrast between the perfect sweetness and kindness of Mr. Lincoln's sentiments and utterances, whether private or public, individual or official, in reference...", "...which the printer's case afforded. I cannot occupy space with any imitation of these typographical magnificences, but will simply copy the language of the bill.

That old Oak at Runnymede, under whose spreading branches the name of John was affixed to the Magna Charta, was for centuries held the most sacred spot in England. It is an impressive picture we get of John, \"the Lord's Anointed,\" when this scene was over, in a burst of rage rolling on the floor, biting straw, and gnawing a stick! \"They have placed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> kings over me,\" he shouted in a fury; meaning the twenty-five barons who were entrusted with the duty of seeing that the provisions of the Charter were fulfilled. Whether his death, one year later (1216), was the result of vexation of spirit or surfeit of peaches and cider, or poison, history does not positively say.

Certainly Diane did not look to be more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years old. Four years of solitude and repose had restored the freshness of her complexion. Besides, there are moments when the desire to please gives an increase of beauty to women. The will is not without influence on the variations of the face.

We looked over the barge accompanied by the owner, who rather elaborately pointed out defects, which he knew, and we knew, were unimportant, in a breezy and open manner, as one trying to impress us with his candour.

His gun and fishing-rod stood him in good stead; there were berries at times, and edible barks and watercress, and when these failed he had a little bag of meal and dried reindeer-tongues to fall back upon. The simplicity of his living is shown best in the fact that the expenses for the entire journey, occupying seven months, were only twenty-five pounds, or less than one hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars. The Academy had set aside sixty pounds, and their surprise at having most of the money returned to them, instead of a demand being made for more, won them, hand and heart. He had hit the sturdy old burghers in a sensitive spot--the pocketbook--and they passed resolutions declaring him the world's greatest naturalist, and voted him a medal, to be cast at his own expense.

It is made of wood, bone, or whalebone and has a lash of from twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet in length. The lash is made of walrus or ground seal hide, the lower end being broad and stiff, thus giving it greater weight and a slight springiness near the handle, which facilitates its use. A broad piece of skin clasps the handle, to which it is tied with seal thongs. Another way of making the lower part heavy is by plaiting ground seal lines for a length of a foot or a foot and a half.

The window tax, as it stands at present (January 1775), over and above the duty of three shillings upon every house in England, and of one shilling upon every house in Scotland, lays a duty upon every window, which in England augments gradually from twopence, the lowest rate upon houses with not more than seven windows, to two shillings, the highest rate upon houses with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> windows and upwards. The principal objection to all such taxes is their inequality; an inequality of the worst kind, as they must frequently fall much heavier upon the poor than upon the rich.

Much to the bewilderment of the Bell Company, it soon learned that the troubles of wealth are as numerous as those of poverty. It was beset by a throng of promoters and stock-jobbers, who fell upon it and upon the public like a swarm of seventeen-year locusts. In three years, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> competing companies were started, in open defiance of the Bell patents. The main object of these companies was not, like that of the Western Union, to do a legitimate telephone business, but to sell stock to the public. The face value of their stock was $225,000,000, although few of them ever sent a message. One company of unusual impertinence, without money or patents, had capitalized its audacity at $15,000,000.

Still, his poetic talent is manifest in numerous passages of the Koran, well known to those able to read it in the original, and in this respect the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> chapters of that book are, perhaps, the most remarkable. Although the power of the Arabs has long ago succumbed, their literature has survived, and their language is still more or less spoken in all Muhammadan countries. Europe at one time was lightened by the torch of Arabian learning, and the Middle Ages were stamped with the genius and character of Arab civilization.

Daniel Bic and Jean Cabdie, liberated in 1764, for attending religious meetings. Both were condemned for life, and had been at the galley-chain for ten years. Jean Pierre Espinas, an attorney, of St. Felix de Chateauneuf, in Viverais, who had been condemned for life for having given shelter to a pastor, was released in 1765, at the age of sixty-seven, after being chained at the galleys for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. Jean Raymond, of Fangeres, the father of six children, who had been a galley-slave for thirteen years, was liberated in 1767. Alexandre Chambon, a labourer, more than eighty years old, condemned for life in 1741, for attending a religious meeting, was released in 1769, on the entreaty of Voltaire, after being a galley-slave for twenty-eight years. His friends had forgotten him, and on his release he was utterly destitute and miserable.[81] [Footnote 81:...", "...of the Health Board that first year, gave us a daylight view of the slum: \"damp and rotten and dark, walls and banisters sticky with constant moisture.\" Think of living babies in such hell-holes; and make a note of it, you in the young cities who can still head off the slum where we have to wrestle with it for our sins.

The lack of facilities for moving large bodies of men and supplies, in event of war, was as apparent as was the lack of vessels of force on lake and river.

The time occupied was three days, and the rate for travellers <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents a league. This rough road--which entailed numerous ferries in summer at the Ottawa and at Lake St. Francis, except for a break of fifty miles--led by Cornwall and Prescott to Kingston, along which route United Empire Loyalists twenty years before had established themselves.

The rival refused, and thereupon the Gould combination dropped to twelve and a half, for the purpose of destroying the rival.

It is here that we find no less than twenty-five poems, _which he never edited_, reprinted (inexactly) from the old black-letter editions or from Chalmers.

It remains to be said that the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> poems which are here appended to the Canterbury Tales are well selected; and that the anonymous editor or superintendent was guided in his choice by Tyrwhitt's 'Account of the Works.' s. 8.

He was on a visit to Old Corbey, when the news arrived that a monk was much needed to accompany the Danish Harold to his native land, and that the abbot Wala had nominated him to the emperor as a fit person to be entrusted with the arduous mission. Summoned to the court, Anskar calmly but resolutely announced his willingness to go.

Moreover, the words, \"no man knoweth of his sepulchre\"--i.e., the sepulchre of Moses--\"unto this day,\" are another proof that the chapter was not added by Joshua, for they imply that a considerable space of time had elapsed, during which the sepulchre of Moses remained unknown. As Joshua died only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years after Moses, these words coming from his mouth would lose half their force, and would, probably, also convey an untruth; for we cannot believe that the great Hebrew legislator was buried clandestinely; or that Joshua, the next in command, and almost his equal, could be ignorant where his body was laid.' {92} The Book we have last examined professes in part to be a repetition by Moses, of various events mentioned in the previous Books; but as there are omissions of...", "...the American Anti-Slavery Society in New York.

The 1899 exports to China and Hong Kong combined will show a gain of nearly or quite <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> per cent over those of last year, while the total exports from the United States for the fiscal year 1899 will be little if any in excess of those of last year.

Very little of his music was performed during his lifetime--of the songs, first and last, many of them in private circles, and the last two or three years of his life, perhaps twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> in public. A few of his smaller orchestral numbers were played by amateur players, where he may have heard them himself, but his larger works he never heard.

The dam and containing walls of the Ashokan reservoir are all made of reinforced concrete, and the size of the lake and the strength of the walls can be appreciated when one thinks that the 130,000,000,000 gallons of water it holds in check would cover all Manhattan Island with twenty-eight feet of water.

The principle was thus established, and the doubts as to its practical application to a line of at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred miles were of such a character as to seem more serious to scientific men than to American capitalists of Mr. Cooper's type. In March, 1854, the New York, Newfoundland, & London Telegraph Company was organized, and Mr. Cooper became (and remained for twenty trying years) its president.

All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the eldest, Alexandra, who was just <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years old. The middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society.

In 1850, in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> States, the factory census reported 32,295 men and 62,661 women workers. In 1860 there were 46,859 men and 75,169 women. Hosiery machinery at this time was giving employment to three times as many women as men. But the emigrant, and not the American man, had been the means of turning out the native woman worker; it was the foreign-born woman who worked for \"unequal pay.\" In 1846, the sewing-machine had been invented.

The document explained that he gave the money and stocks to Noah, because he had supported and brought up the two children of his deceased brother Cyrus. To his brother Titus he gave twenty-five thousand dollars, including the mortgage note he held against him, half the balance in cash, and half in stocks and bonds. To his brother Noah, in trust for the two children of his brother Cyrus, deceased, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand dollars, to be paid over to them when they were of age. Colonel Cosgrove said the deceased had apportioned the stocks as they were to be given to the legatees, and the money was in the county bank.

'Well,' said Hussey, 'I want to be very reasonable with you. If you'll pay me one thousand dollars before you leave the house, or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred dollars before daybreak to-morrow, I'll sell you a licence.

In camp at night he told the others how, several years earlier, Gen. Samuel H. Parsons had come from Connecticut and attempted to establish a salt factory at the place. He undertook to purchase <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand acres of land, embracing the springs and the territory about them, and expected to reap a great fortune. He was greatly disappointed in the quantity of salt the water contained, but might have carried out his plan, anyway, had it not been that, in returning from the springs to the east, he was drowned by the upsetting of his canoe at the Beaver falls. The purchase of the great tract he had intended buying, was, therefore, never completed. \"But as a rule, lad,...", "...placards on which were printed answers to the \"anti\" advertisements. The public understood and treated the women with much courtesy. It is difficult to give even the barest outline of the work of the Press Bureau, at first under the management of Mrs. Haryot Holt Dey and later of Miss Rose Young, with a volunteer force of 214 press chairmen over the State.

To the weeklies a bulletin from the central bureau went regularly; 3,036 shipments were made of pages of plate matter. The American Press Association and the Western Newspaper Union for many weeks sent out columns of suffrage news with their regular service for the patent inside page used by country papers. The bureau furnished material for debates and answered attacks against suffrage. The support given by the newspapers was of great value.

The experience of the closely-following Revolutionary war proves how easily and readily, when their feelings were involved, the Americans could raise far greater supplies.

Of the 330,000 Indians in the United States, considerably more than half are now allotted, and 70,000 hold patents in fee. The latest report of the Indian Bureau gives the total number of Indian citizens at about 75,000. Those still living on communal land are being allotted at the rate of about 5,000 a year. The question of taxation of allotments has been a vexed one. Some Indians have hesitated to accept full citizenship because of...", "...and a good man.

George, who at this time might have been about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or twenty-six years old, was the second son of Lord Lochleven; but by a singular chance, that his mother's adventurous youth had caused Sir William to interpret amiss, this second son had none of the characteristic features of the Douglases' full cheeks, high colour, large ears, and red hair. The result was that poor George, who, on the contrary, had been given by nature pale cheeks, dark blue eyes, and black hair, had been since coming into the world an object of...", "...he could now go to the devil for all he cared.

A colloquial ephemeralism in a city may be undecipherable in the country districts <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles away. A large percentage of the athletic jargon of the sporting club and field is enigmatical to the uninitiated. And since a newspaper man writes for the world at large rather than for any specific class or group, he cannot afford to take chances on muddying his sentences by the use of slang. The best test of a good journalist is the instinct for writing for heterogeneous masses of people.

The greatest weight will be in the food, and each day will reduce this about two pounds.

IX TYPES OF MODERN VERSE CHAPTER IX TYPES OF MODERN VERSE _Vers de Societe_ Vers de societe, \"society verse,\" is a development of the last century; almost, one might say, of the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. In that time there has been composed a great volume of this sort of verse upon which a number of the minor poets have based their claims to remembrance. It is difficult to define _vers de societe_; in fact, the only way it can be described is through examples. Its characteristics are a gracefulness of thought and style, a fluency in expression, a vein of delicate humor or sentiment and a subject which falls within the limits of \"polite conversation.\" It sparkles or...", "...plant culture in pots; the best is that formed by rotted sods with a little well decomposed stable manure mixed with it. Rhubarb requires deep, rich soil. A good dressing of well-rotted manure, put on the ground this winter when it is not frozen, will start off the plants briskly in the spring. The same is true for asparagus. Mr. Russel Heath, Carpenteria, Cal., has an \"English walnut orchard\" of two hundred acres of rich, level land, near the sea-shore. The trees are from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years planted. His crop in 1882 was 630 sacks of 70 pounds each; this season he expects the harvest will aggregate about one-third more. Gardener's Monthly: The writer found among the gardeners in Canada, when in that country recently, that the English plan of preserving grapes in bottles of water was in not uncommon use. The bunches are cut with pieces of stems, and then so arranged that the ends are in bottles of water. By this plan the grapes can be preserved far into...", "...a great battle on the way thither, for the enemy could not fail to read the meaning of his movements. McClellan reasoned that this battle would take place between West Point and Richmond, and his intention was to advance without delay to the former position and use it as his chief depot for supplies. His plan was to make a combined naval and military attack on Yorktown, send a strong force up the York River, aided by the gunboats, and thus establish his new base of operations within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles of the Confederate capital. It was not long before he began calling for reinforcements, and the government, instead of aiding him, took away piecemeal many of the troops upon which the commander had counted to aid him in his campaign. He wanted 150,000 men and a large increase of cannon. The 10,000 men, composing Blenker's division, were detached, as the President informed him, to support Fremont, but Mr. Lincoln promised to withdraw no more from the main army....", "...fifteenth century literature assumed a somewhat wider range, and the language began to take precision and force. But with much general improvement and literary industry there was still nothing great or original, nothing to mark an epoch in the history of letters. The only poets worthy of notice were Charles, Duke of Orleans (1391-1465), and Villon, a low ruffian of Paris (1431-1500). Charles was taken prisoner at the battle of Agincourt, and carried to England, where he was detained for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, and where he wrote a volume of poems in which he imitated the allegorical style of the Romance of the Rose. The verses of Villon were inspired by the events of his not very creditable life. Again and again he suffered imprisonment for petty larcenies, and at the age of twenty-five was condemned to be hanged. His language is not that of the court, but of the people; and his poetry marks the first sensible progress after the Romance of the Rose. It has been well said...", "...toast: \"To Louis-Philippe!\" The great Flaubert lived on the Temple Boulevard at No. 42. There, on Sundays, he gathered his disciples at noisy lunches--Zola, Goncourt, Daudet, de Maupassant, Huysmans, Ceard, George Pouchet--a few yards away from a building of tragic fame. No. 50, in fact, was the wretched house whose third-story Venetian blinds concealed Fieschi and the twenty-five pistol barrels loaded with bullets which constituted his infernal machine. A train of powder passed over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> lights. The discharge of grapeshot to be vomited by this dreadful instrument of death was terrible. The grocer Morey, who had helped to prepare the monstrous crime, had even taken the useful precaution to damage four of the gun-barrels, whose explosion was to suppress Fieschi himself. Pepin, another accomplice, had been careful to walk his horse several times past the fatal window; and from behind the Venetian blinds, Fieschi, who was an excellent shot, had been able at...", "...of it....\" Which was true. \"Don't talk to me, miss!\" her ladyship said to the silent girl. \"I know what is best for you; and I know, too, what you don't think I know--ha, ha!\" Her ladyship laughed terribly. \"I know that you have been meeting that worthless young scamp, Tom Arundel!\" \"Oh, aunt, he is not worthless--\" \"Financially he isn't worth a sou--and that's what I mean, and don't interrupt.

In a word, the supplies amounted to nine millions four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand two hundred and fifty-four pounds; a sum almost incredible, if we consider how the kingdom had been already drained of its treasure. It was raised by the usual taxes, reinforced with new impositions on windows, carriages, and spirituous liquors; a lottery, and a loan from the sinking-fund. The new taxes were mortgaged for four millions by transferable annuities, at an interest of four, and a premium of ten per centum.

As we have remarked before, the site of the prison was covered with trees when its outlines were traced and surveyed by the rebel engineers. These trees, felled to the ground, were hewn, and matched so well on the inner line of the palisades as to give no glimpse of the outer world across the space of the dead line, which averaged nineteen feet in width, and which was defined by a frail wooden railing about three feet in height, from fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet distant from the palisades. [Illustration] This line of stockade rose from fifteen to eighteen feet above the surface of the ground, while the outer line of logs, which was erected about sixty paces distant from the inner line, was formed of the rough trunks of pines, and projected twelve feet above the earth. The original stockade measured but ten hundred and ten feet in length, and seven hundred and eighty-three feet in width; and within this space were jammed...", "...--those guesses being stated as facts--when every pope and priest and bishop knows that no one knows the slightest thing on the subject.

Each Christian nation is fortified to prevent other Christians from devastating their fields. There is already a debt of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand millions of dollars which has been incurred by Christian nations, because each one is afraid of every other, and yet all say: \"It is our duty to love our enemies.\" This world, in my judgment, is to be reformed through intelligence --through development of the mind--not by credulity, but by investigation; not by faith in the supernatural, but by faith in the natural.

Only a part of this land, however, was occupied by the nobles for their gardens, parks, and chases. The greater portion was let to farmers, either at a fixed rent, or on the _metayer_ system, by which the landlord was paid by a share of the crops. And beside his rent or his portion, the noble received other things from his tenants: payments and services according to ancient custom, days of labor, and...", "...new doors for Cuba's rich products. American trade and enterprise contributed a great deal which made for Cuban expansion and industrial development. In proof of this there is the fact that the island towns on the north side, which is nearest the United States, increased both in population and commercially, in striking contrast to the slow growth of the towns on the south side of the island. In 1850 these latter towns, with Santiago de Cuba as the chief city, did not maintain more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> per cent. of the trade of the island. In further proof of America's hand in the development of Cuba, we may cite the following tables, in every one of which it is easy to see that Cuba's trade was largely with the United States. Taking the records of Cuban trade in 1828 as typical of the commerce of the early part of the century, we get the following contrasts with the figures of the years immediately preceding 1850: Cuban imports in 1828, $19,534,922; exports,...", "...the difficulties against which we contended {262} yesterday, and regained the slues with tolerably dry garments.

Such a volume then may, if any, claim to belong to what De Quincey called the literature of power as distinct from that of mere information. Intellectual quality is not the only respect in which there has been lately witnessed a change among the officers of the army. The Crimean War was followed by many promotions to the grade of officers from the ranks. Since then the average number of commissions given in this way seems to have been about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> a year. Of this number 16 have gone to infantry, 4 to cavalry, and the remainder to other branches of the Service. These promotions, suitable as they are to the day of democracy, cannot of course affect sensibly the tone or the _personnel_ of the officers of the Queen's army, who will continue to be, as they have been, men born to the social advantages of gentle station.

There was a professor of the Harvard Law School, going about lecturing to boards of trade, urging in the name of economic science the repeal of laws against railroad monopolies--and being paid for his speeches out of railroad funds! There was a swarm of newspaper reporters, writing on railroad affairs for the leading papers of New England, and getting <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars weekly, or two or three hundred on special occasions. Sums had been paid directly to more than a thousand newspapers--$3,000 to the Boston \"Republic\", and when the question was asked \"Why?\" the answer was, \"That is Mayor Fitzgerald's paper.\" Even the ultra-respectable \"Evening Transcript\", organ of the Brahmins of culture, was down for $144 for typing, mimeographing and sending out \"dope\" to the country press.

In 1682 the Albemarle settlement contained about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred inhabitants. When an attempt was made in 1677 to collect the customs and to shut off the New England trade, about a hundred colonists led by John Culpeper rebelled and imprisoned Miller, who was the collector of customs and acting governor.

A second line of reform appeared in the \"model franchise\" for utility corporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the Chicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the company was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and the city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired to do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no franchises to utility companies could run more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. A third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of municipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely out of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal plants in the city itself.

This German idea was plainly expressed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years ago by the German historian Wilhelm Mueller, who wrote in a review of the year 1884: \"England was the opponent of all the maritime Powers of Europe. She had for decades assumed at sea the same dictatorial attitude as France had maintained upon land under Louis XIV. and Napoleon I.

The wicks, having been cut by machinery of the requisite length, instead of being cut one at a time, are arranged upon a rod. For the sort of candle called \"twelves,\" or twelve to a pound, twenty-four wicks are suspended on one of these rods. Thirty rods are connected together in a frame, which thus holds seven hundred and twenty wicks. Attached to the machine are thirty-six of these frames. The whole number of wicks is therefore <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand nine hundred and twenty.

Many pleasantries were circulated at the expense of the new medical architect; and PERRAULT replied to those sarcasms by producing the beautiful colonnade of the _Louvre_, the master-piece of French architecture, and the admiration of all Europe. The facade of this colonnade, which is of the Corinthian order; is five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet in length: it is divided into two peristyles and three avant-corps. The principal gate is in the centre avant-corps, which is decorated with eight double columns, crowned by a pediment, whose raking cornices are composed of two stones only, each fifty-four feet in length by eight in breadth, though no more than eighteen inches in thickness.

There was much hand-to-hand fighting before the British could struggle back to Ahwaz. As the Turks did not continue to attack it was to be supposed that they had lost heavily. The Anglo-Indian force had lost about 200. The colonel of the Seventh Rajputs was wounded, and four of their white officers were killed.

The British pretending to retire, maneuvered to lure them on to a position where they had concealed infantry with machine guns and artillery. The Turks, quite unsuspecting a ruse came on, were met by a withering fire from the guns that sent them shattered and broken flying back to Nakaila.

The lecturer was Professor Huxley; his subject, the Common Lobster. All the apparatus used was a good-sized specimen of the creature itself, a penknife, and a black-board and chalk.

To oppose this great armament, the Greek admiral Miaulis had only seventy sail, manned by five thousand sailors and carrying eight hundred guns.

On the land the Turks had more successes; but these were so indecisive that they did not attempt to renew the siege...", "...speculation, had lost much of their prestige, if Jonathan Edwards' immortal deductions may be considered an exception.

The number of white Republicans was far in excess of the number of colored Democrats. It was, therefore, well known that if a fair election should be made the State would go Republican by from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to forty thousand majority. The policy adopted this time was to select a few of the largest Republican parishes and by terrorism and violence not only obliterate their Republican majorities, but also intimidate the Negroes in the other parishes.

After the destruction of the stores had been completed, and Ellsworth had closed his business at the telegraph office, the command was again put in motion. It left the town about two P.M., on the Springfield road. Before leaving Knoxville, Colonel Morgan, appreciating the necessity of having an advance-guard which could be thoroughly relied on, and disinclined to trust to details, changed every day, for that duty, had organized a body of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> men, selected with great care from the entire force under his command, to constitute an advance-guard for the expedition. So well did this body perform the service assigned it, that the men composing it, with some additions to make up the tale as others were taken out, were permanently detailed for that duty, and it became an honor eagerly sought, and a reward for gallantry and good conduct second only to promotion, to be enrolled in \"the advance.\" The non-commissioned...", "...of the fortifications of the town, and in forts and batteries on the hills around it, were in situations which enabled them to fire upon ships. Altogether, the approaches by sea were defended by scarcely less than five hundred guns. The Admiralty were greatly surprised when Lord Exmouth proposed to attack these works with five sail of the line. Many naval officers who were consulted by the Board considered them unassailable. Nelson, in a conversation with Captain Brisbane, had named <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> line-of-battle ships as the force which would be required to attack them. The opinion was not founded upon his own observation, and he was evidently misled by the errors in the received plans; for that number of ships could not have been placed before the town; but it marks his sense of the great danger in attacking powerful batteries with ships, and of the tremendous strength of Algiers. Lord Exmouth was offered any force he required, but he adhered to his first demand;...", "...you the sheriff?\" \"Police.

The degree of pain varied very much according to the delicacy of skin, and no doubt some boys--one of our comrades had been flogged about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> times--did not feel much after many floggings, becoming literally case-hardened; whereas, we have known a boy compelled to stay in bed two or three days from the effects of a flogging which would have left little mark upon the \"twenty-fiver.\" When a victim issued from the flogging-room the questions from an eager throng were, \"How many cuts, old fellow?

This they did from their canoes. One man paddled and another stood in the bow of the canoe with a net like a landing net at the end of a long pole. As his quick eye detected a fish he dipped his net as a scoop or ladle is used, and each time brought up a fish three or four pounds weight.

This was the forerunner of the 'Montgolfieres', or hot-air balloons, which are a feature of fetes and Guy Fawkes' Day celebrations. It was followed by the sending up of a 'Montgolfiere' from Versailles on 18th Sept. of the same year, carrying a basket containing a sheep, a cock, and a duck. The first human beings to make an ascent were Pilatre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlande, who went away from Paris on 21st Nov., 1783. They passed right over Paris, and were in the air for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> minutes, during which time they replenished the fire suspended in a brazier below the neck of the balloon. The real genesis of the balloon, or air-ship as we know it to-day, was due to the discovery of hydrogen as the lightest gas, which discovery was made in 1766 by an English chemist, Henry Cavendish. Various people claim the credit of having been the first to call attention to the possibilities of this gas for aerial navigation.

This natural canal is of great depth, and from fifty to one hundred yards in width; so that, hemmed in by two green walls, eighty feet-high, we seemed to be sailing through a deep gorge; in some places it was so narrow it was nearly overarched by the foliage. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles from Gurupa is Breves, a busy little town on the southwest corner of the great island of Marajo. The inhabitants, mostly Portuguese, are engaged in the rubber trade; the Indians in the vicinity manufacture fancy earthen-ware and painted cuyas or calabashes. Soon after leaving Breves we entered the Para River, which suddenly begins with the enormous width of eight miles. It is, however, shallow, and contains numerous shoals and islands. It is properly an estuary,...", "...it appears that the population of the kingdom amounted to 1,500,000 _vecinos_ or householders; or, allowing four and a half to a family (a moderate estimate), to 6,750,000 souls. [142] This census, it will be observed, was limited to the provinces immediately composing the crown of Castile, to the exclusion of Granada, Navarre, and the Aragonese dominions. [143] It was taken, moreover, before the nation had time to recruit from the long and exhausting struggle of the Moorish war, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years before the close of the reign, when the population, under circumstances peculiarly favorable, must have swelled to a much larger amount. Thus circumscribed, however, it was probably considerably in advance of that of England at the same period. [144] How have the destinies of the two countries since been reversed?

To the other Italian powers a month was allowed to ratify the treaty. The pope and the Florentines, and with them the Siennese and other minor powers, acceded to it within the time. Besides this, the Florentines, the Venetians, and the duke concluded a treaty of peace for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. King Alfonso alone exhibited dissatisfaction at what had taken place, thinking he had not been sufficiently considered, that he stood, not on the footing of a principal, but only ranked as an auxiliary, and therefore kept aloof, and would not disclose his intentions. However, after receiving a legate from the pope, and many solemn embassies from other powers, he allowed himself to be persuaded, principally by means of the pontiff, and with his son joined the League...", "...character of one whom as a boy and man I have known for forty years.

He turned a trifle paler, and compressed his lips firmly, otherwise he gave no outward sign of his emotion. Knowing so much of the case as he did, he could not look on this woman in the light of a mother; she had indirectly contributed to his father's death; she had deserted him for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years; and now that she claimed his filial reverence, he was unwilling to yield it to her. Perhaps he was unjust and harsh to think this, but the natural tie between them was so weakened by time and ignorance that he could find no affection in his heart to bestow on her.

Sometimes a rorqual will come quite near the coast, and remain in a fishing-ground for weeks together, and as it swallows several boatloads of fish every day, it is scarcely necessary to say that the fishermen are not at all pleased to see it. There is another kind of whale, called the lesser rorqual, which only grows to the length of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty feet. It is common off the shores of Norway, and commoner still in North American waters, where it is known as the sharp-nosed finner.

The temptation was there; the provocation was there, incessant and prolonged for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, and yet, to my knowledge, Shakespeare has never used one word that malice could misconstrue. Yet he loved suggestive and lewd speech. Luckily, however, there is stronger proof of Shakespeare's innocence than even his condemnation of his false friend, proof so strong, that if all the arguments for his guilt were tenfold stronger than they are, this proof would outweigh them all and bring them to nought.

My young regiment behaved admirably, as did all hands. The loss of the party was of course very severe. Of Tombs's troop alone, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> men (out of fifty) and seventeen horses were hit. The brigadier and four officers composing his staff all had their horses killed, and two of the five were wounded.

No one in that hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years had ever raised a voice to plead on behalf of the prostitutes; it never seems to have occurred, even to the Parliament which had so much sympathy for the _pauvres veroles_, that the women likewise deserved pity and attention.

They walked into the lodgeroom where <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty men with similar \"jewels\" sat smoking and chatting. All seemed to know him, but (much to his relief) before he could be included in the conversation, the gavel fell; certain ones with more elaborate \"jewels\" and more ornate collars than the rest took higher-backed and more highly upholstered chairs at the four sides of the room, another stood at the door; and still another, in complete uniform, with sword and belt, began hustling the members to seats. \"The...", "...dark, we forgot to carry tapers, and did not discover our omission till we were wakened by our wants.

This island, like the projecting points of the main shore, is a mere deposit of earthly mud, covered with verdure, about twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet high. There was another island adjoining, which seemed to be a collection of boulder stones; from whence it was named.

Consequently on June 17th Macdonald found himself with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand men near Piacenza, in the presence of the enemy, with no support save two divisions of the Army of Italy, which had come in from Bologna, and whose commanders were jealous of his orders.

The other was that the ship was proceeding at reduced speed, eighteen knots an hour, only nineteen of her <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> boilers being used, the result of her effort to save in coal and labor. Sir Edward Carson, the Attorney General, in outlining the evidence in the hands of the Crown, adverted impressively to President Wilson's note to Germany on the sinking of the Lusitania in which the President informed the German Government that it was wrong in assuming that the Lusitania was equipped with masked guns and manned by trained gunners. \"We have ample evidence to disprove the German lie...", "...for the mesh wiring of the framework was also found to be extremely brittle. A section of the framework was, however, erected, and also one of wood, as a test for providing comparisons. In the tests, the wooden sections proved, beyond all comparison, the better, but the Admiralty persisted in their decision to adopt the metal. Towards the end of 1909 a new aluminium alloy was discovered, known as duralumin. Tests were made which proved that this new metal possessed a strength of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> tons per square inch, which was over twice as strong as the nominal strength of aluminium, and in practice was really five times stronger. The specific gravity of the new metal varied from 2.75 to 2.86, as opposed to the 2.56 of aluminium. As the weights were not much different it was possible to double the strength of the ship and save one ton in weight. Duralumin was therefore at once adopted.

We have said that it was a beautifully-finished weapon, with a silver plate let into the handle, and on this, standing out distinctly in the moonlight, were the initials \"H.S.\" And Claverton, narrowly watching his enemy's countenance, noted this effect and wondered not a little. These formalities over, the doctor proceeded to reload the weapons, which were both of the same calibre. Then he placed the combatants, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> paces apart, taking scrupulous care that each should enjoy an equal proportion of advantage from the moonlight. Truscott, to do him justice, was no coward. He had come there fully determined to slay his adversary if he could; and as for his own share of the risk, why, that must be left to the fortune of war.

Some kept their faith and showed their fidelity in other places and other work. Three or four went into the Roman Church, and found rest on its ancient bosom.

That position he has occupied for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, in a way honorable to himself and to good letters.

There were only fifteen mothers recorded under <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of age, while thirteen were over thirty-nine years; the most frequent age of the mothers was twenty-seven. On all these points we certainly need controlling evidence from other countries.

Amongst the many miracles recorded of him, three appear to me the most worthy of admiration: his origin and conception; his pre-election thirty years before his birth; and what exceeds all, the sudden rising of the ground, at Brevy, under his feet while preaching, to the great astonishment of all the beholders. Since the time of David, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> archbishops presided over the see of Menevia, whose names are here subjoined: David, Cenauc, Eliud, who was also called Teilaus, Ceneu, Morwal, Haerunen, Elwaed, Gurnuen, Lendivord, Gorwysc, Cogan, Cledauc, Anian, Euloed, Ethelmen, Elauc, Malscoed, Sadermen, Catellus, Sulhaithnai, Nonis, Etwal, Asser, Arthuael, Sampson.

There seems, curiously enough, to be a strange resemblance between the two emotions. If you'd only look at me plainly without any of your lovely glamour you'll see in a minute what nonsense it all is. Why, you are all the time in your heart of hearts in love with some little blonde thing with pink cheeks who is still at school.\" He turned away in a passion of wounded...", "...Hall, built of iron and glass in the Moorish style of the twelfth century, also a permanent structure, was erected by Philadelphia. Here, one walked amid the glories of tropical vegetation. Palm, orange, lemon, camphor, and india-rubber trees rose on every hand. The cactus of the desert, rare English flowering plants, strange growths from islands of the sea, here flourished each in its peculiar soil and climate. Outside the building were beds of hardy flowering plants covering <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> acres. Besides these five main structures, the United States Building, where the working of the various administrative departments of the Government was shown, attracted thousands of visitors daily. A Woman's Pavilion contained products of female industry and skill. A narrow-gauge railway ran in great loops from building to building. Twenty-six States erected buildings of their own. These served mainly as headquarters, but two or three contained large exhibits of state...", "...the debts of his father, who lived until 1601, and restoring the fortunes of his family in Stratford. The death of his only son, Hamnet, in 1596, must have been a severe blow to him, but he obtained from the Heralds' College the grant of a family coat of arms, which secured the position of the family as gentlefolks; in 1597 he purchased New Place, the largest house in Stratford; and later on he acquired other large property rights there. How often he may have visited Stratford in the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of his career in London we have no information; but however enjoyable London life and the society of the writers at the 'Mermaid' Tavern may have been to him, he probably always looked forward to ending his life as the chief country gentleman of his native village. Thither he retired about 1610 or 1612, and there he died prematurely in 1616, just as he was completing his fifty-second year. Shakspere's dramatic career falls naturally into four successive divisions...", "...dollars easy enough.\" \"Yes, and more if you had her up Boston way,\" answered the squire. \"You haven't had any idea of buying her, then?\" \"No,\" responded Mr. Carleton. \"Still, I might like to. But please don't say anything about it.\" \"Oh, no,\" replied the squire, chuckling to himself. Mr. Carleton, bidding him good night and taking his departure, was more than ever an object of interest to the squire. Here was a man that spoke in the most casual and nonchalant way of investing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred dollars in a piece of land that he liked, and of buying a fifteen-hundred-dollar boat. The squire's curiosity, always keen in other persons' affairs, was aroused. He wondered--in the usual trend of such personal curiosity--how the other man had made his money. This curiosity was not abated, to say the least, by a comparatively trifling incident that occurred a day or two following. The squire had, in the cupola of his house, which he used as a vantage-point for...", "...M. Violette, in pursuance of his paternal duty, condemned himself, three or four times a year, to the infliction of a visit at the \"Bon Marche des Paroisses.\" The hopes that M. Violette had formed as to his son's inheriting from M. Gaufre were very problematical; for the father, whom M. Gaufre had not been able to avoid receiving at his table occasionally, had been struck, even shocked, by the familiar and despotic tone of the old merchant's servant, a superb Normandy woman of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, answering to the royal name of Berenice. The impertinent ways of this robust woman betrayed her position in her master's house, as much as the diamonds that glittered in her ears. This creature would surely watch the will of her patron, a sexagenarian with an apoplectic neck, which became the color of dregs of wine after a glass of brandy. M. Gaufre, although very practical and a churchwarden at St. Sulpice, had always had a taste for liaisons. His wife, during her...", "...the river. It was in the spring, just as the snow was beginning to melt. We found about twenty-five squaws dancing around in a circle and making a fearful noise in their high squealing voices. They danced in the same way that the Indians did, and I had never seen any other form of dancing among them. They were wearing moccasins and were tramping around in the water. The Indians were sitting on logs watching them. One was pounding on a tom-tom. One day when we were eating dinner, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> Indians came to the house and looked in the window. They always did that and then would walk in without knocking. They squatted down on the floor until dinner was over and then motioned for the table to be pushed back to the wall. Then they began to dance the begging dance. In their dances they pushed their feet, held close together over the floor and came down very heavily on their heels. There were so many of them that the house fairly rocked. Each Indian keeps up a...", "...The fifth moved as he was shooting and he missed again. Then he got nervous and tried to please two at once. The sixth began to buzz and four more arrived. Berry lost his head and began to shoot wildly. One settled on Daphne's veil and she screamed. The hive began to hum again. With mistaken gallantry, Berry left the bees on his gauntlet and turned to the one on his wife's veil. The next moment she was reeling against the wall in a paroxysm of choking coughs. Some more of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand began to emerge from the skep, and a moment later I was stung in the lobe of the right ear. The pain, I may say, was acute, but it certainly broke the spell, and I turned and ran as I have never run before.

Now, one word more, Henri.\" \"Speak!\" \"Have you not another embarrassment to settle?\" \"I have indeed, and the sooner the better.

Here in her own grounds she had a private theatre built, a small square building, capable of holding about a hundred people, in addition to a diminutive orchestra, stage, and anteroom. In this hall she was wont to give concerts, to which were invited celebrities from every land, representatives of the various branches...", "...good deal of useful light. This is the question of the expenses of the electoral machine. In France, as in America, no limit is set by the law to the possible expenditure of a political candidate. I have already given the estimate made for me in Artois of the general cost of the legislative elections, and I have been told by more than one well-informed French politician in other parts of France, that the average cost of a candidacy for a seat in the Chamber may be roughly estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand francs, or a thousand pounds sterling. This would show, allowing two candidates only for each seat, an expenditure of thirty millions of francs, or twelve hundred thousand pounds, at each French parliamentary election, being very nearly the figure given me in Artois.

Any one who asked inconvenient questions would very probably have come here himself! The Great Hall, which is about one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet long by from fifty to sixty feet in width, is a chapter in the history of Flanders by itself. Here the Counts, and their successors, the Dukes of Burgundy, held many of their great banquets and state functions of various kinds.

When he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years old, he related that \"a glut of study and retirement had thrown him on the world,\" and that there was danger lest \"a glut of the world should throw him back upon study and retirement.\" To this Swift answered with great propriety, that Pope had not yet either acted or suffered enough in the world to have become weary of it. And, indeed, it must be some very powerful reason that can drive back to solitude him who has once enjoyed the pleasures of society.

With this glider they went in the summer of I 1900 to the little settlement of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, situated on the strip of land dividing Albemarle Sound from the Atlantic. Here they reckoned on obtaining steady wind, and here, on the day that they completed the machine, they took it out for trial as a kite with the wind blowing at between <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> and thirty miles an hour. They found that in order to support a man on it the glider required an angle nearer twenty degrees than three, and even with the wind at thirty miles an hour they could not get down to the planned angle of three degrees.

The climate is generally more severe than that of Spain and the portions of Italy, France, and Soviet Georgia that are in the same latitude.

Precipitation over the country averages about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> inches a year and, when it is distributed normally throughout the seasons, it is satisfactory for most agricultural crops. Dobrudzha, in the northeast, the Black Sea coastal area, and parts of the Thracian Plain usually receive less than twenty inches. The remainder of the Thracian Plain and the Danubian plateau get less than the country average. Higher elevations are the most generously watered, in some places receiving forty inches or more.

I would suggest that St. Clement is considering the whole order of the Aaronic priesthood and worship as a divine appointment. In this point of view, it is apart from time, that is, he mentions it ideally as a divine institution. Moreover, he clearly considers it as carried on in the Christian ministry, as having found in that ministry its complete fulfilment. In this aspect it was of no importance that the worship at Jerusalem, to which he referred, had...", "...sorrowing heart to take flight. During the lunch, Lewis, Castro and Spadoni kept up the conversation. They talked about gambling and the Casino, but no one dared ask the Englishman if he had been winning. He had a superstitious fear of this question, as if it brought misfortune. On the other hand, he talked about other people's good luck, and the great stakes that had been won in a night. He kept in his mind all that he had been told, and all that he had imagined he had seen during <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of life at Monte Carlo. An American had gone away with a million; an Englishman had won ten thousand pounds sterling with five _louis_ that he had borrowed. Thus he went on talking about the wonders that had happened in the Casino. And after that could there still be people to assert that all, absolutely all, of the gamblers, lose in the end?

No man with the slightest knowledge of frontiersmen or frontier life could commit such a mistake.

Not meeting with a harbour at Sapan, the Captain determined to make the best of his way to Tinian, where he might come to anchor and get his sick people on shore, having no less than fifteen men laid up with the scurvy, and the rest of his crew were so weak that they could scarcely work the ship: the wind, however, was so variable, that they did not reach the south-west side of that island till afternoon on the 4th, when they anchored in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> fathoms water, and soon afterwards the Charlotte came to anchor a small distance from the Scarborough. 5 August 1788-8 August 1788 Early the next morning, Captain Marshall sent his sick people on shore, with a tent, and a sufficient quantity of provisions to serve them five days.

If a tenant has to be evicted for a demand of L10, will he be able to live in comfort if he pay only L8? Shall one tenant live in comfort on a farm, the rent of which has been reduced him from L100 to L80, and another, the reduction having been from L20 to L16?

Whereupon the Pope, recognizing that he deserved something both on account of his age and for all his work, and hearing him much recommended, gave him an allowance of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> ducats a month, which lasted up to his death, on the condition that he should have charge of the Palace and of the house of the Farnese family.

By this arrangement the beauty of the entire structure was greatly enhanced, while a very appropriate entrance to Fenwick Hall was the result. At the rear of the grounds, on a line with the center of the mansion, were the roomy stables. They were built of rough Seneca sandstone. Like Swiss cottages, they were made more beautiful by a profusion of richly colored slates which covered the broad, steep roof and the wide eaves. Between the mansion and the stables, on the same line, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet distant from the former, was the pretty two story building, of the same material, devoted to the kitchen, the heating and the lighting plants. Both buildings were connected with each other and with the main building by a long colonnade of harmonious proportions; its heavy cornice, narrow, steep roof, and long double line of slender supporting pillars, were all of the same red stone.

By this time, his character, like his frame, was set; to the vehement ambition and ardor of youth had succeeded the cool, matured resolution of manhood--powerful to will, prompt to execute, and patient to endure; he was proof against idle hopes, no less than against groundless fears, and the common chagrins of life took no more hold of his soul than toil or privation of his body.

It is said that over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand children derive, either directly or indirectly, support from this establishment. About six thousand are taken in annually, of which perhaps one fourth die. Many of them are not far from dead when admitted; and it is only surprising, considering the deprivations they must endure in being so suddenly withdrawn from the mother's care, that so large a proportion should survive.

It was not until <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years later that I saw clearly the full implications of my present views on natural causation. As applied to this particular case these views show that to a theist, at all events (i.e. to any one who on independent grounds has accepted the theory of Theism), it ought not to make much difference to the evidential value of the Divine Plan of Revelation as exhibited in the Old and New Testaments, even if it be granted that the whole has been due to so-called natural causes...", "...she reached El-Muwaylah. After another stormy day, we again got up steam; and, fighting hard against adverse winds and waves, greatly to the distress of the unfortunate mules and gazelles, we reached Suez on April 20th. At Suez my wife had been awaiting me for long weeks, preferring the simplicity of the Desert to the complex life of Cairo. Some delay was again necessary in order to telegraph our arrival, to apply for a special train, and to sort and pack in the travelling-cases our <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> tons of specimens. As often happens, the return to civilization was in nowise cheery. Everything seemed to go wrong. For instance, the Dragoman despatched to town from the New Docks in order to lay in certain comforts, such as beef and beer, prudently laid out the coin in a brand-new travelling suit intended for his own service.

Paul Landry took <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand francs' worth; Constantin Unaieff, fifteen thousand; the others, less fortunate or more prudent, took smaller sums; and about midnight the game began. CHAPTER III THE GAME It began quietly enough, the two principal players waiting, before making any bold strokes, to see how the luck should run. The first victory was in favor of Henri, who, at the end of a hand dealt by Constantin Lenaieff, had won about three hundred Louis. Just at this moment the...", "...campaign, seven billions were subscribed. Quite as notable as the amount raised was the progressive increase in the number of subscribers, which ranged from four million individuals in the first loan to more than twenty-one millions in the fourth. Equally notable, as indicating the educative effect of the war and of the sale of these Liberty Bonds, was the successful effort to encourage thrift. War Savings societies were instituted and children saved their pennies and nickels to buy <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cent \"thrift stamps\" which might be accumulated to secure interest-bearing savings certificates. Down to November 1, 1918, the sale of such stamps totalled $834,253,000, with a maturity value of more than a billion dollars. The successful organizing of national resources to supply military demands obviously depended, in the last instance, upon the education of the people to a desire for service and sacrifice. The Liberty Loan campaigns, the appeals of Hoover, and the Fuel...", "...Backbone! But I never had any particular feeling for bones.

I went up the companion again, and as my eyes came up flush with the deck, a thundering great crab gave a kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling off sideways. Quite a start it gave me.

Jim said he did not think he had lost over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> minutes time in waiting for that meat. The train proceeded on now without any more stops towards the place where we were to camp that night at the sink of the Humboldt. We reached the camping ground quite a little while before sundown, and we certainly had selected an ideal place to camp.

In a few minutes we had the stock out to grass and the women...", "...him in a state of panic.

The result showed that they were headed straight for financial ruin.

Next we took two hours to go the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles between Richmond and Sherbrooke, though I will forgive them for that as we were really in a goods' train, to which they had attached a passenger car for our convenience. We eventually got in here about twelve last night. We did not go to the Magog House as Horton recommended, as it was a good long way from the station, and, we were told, might not be open. This place, the Sherbrooke Hotel, is just opposite the station, so being very tired and not wanting any bother we...", "...Madame Marie sat upright in the coach, holding the hand of her mistress, and Madelinette grew paler as the miles diminished between her and Quebec. Yet she was quiet and unmoving, now and then saying an encouraging word to Lapierre, who smacked his lips for miles afterwards, and took out of his horses their strength and paces by masterly degrees. So that when, at last, on the hill they saw far off the spires of Quebec, the team was swinging as steadily on as though they had not come <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles already. This was a moment of pride for Lapierre, but of apprehension for Madelinette. At the last two inns on the road she had got news of both Tardif and Havel. Tardif had had the final start of half-an-hour. A half-hour's start, and fifteen miles to go! But one thing was sure, Havel, the wiry Havel, was the better man, with sounder nerve and a fostered strength. Yet, as they descended the hill and plunged into the wild wooded valley, untenanted and...", "...creatures, peculiarly marked and evidently stunted by some artificial means. However, some of our party were captivated, and became purchasers of the delicate little tremulous creatures.

One of these was designed for a hotel, and would be an ornament to any city. Though Chihuahua is two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles south of the Rio Grande, still it shows many signs of its proximity to this country. Such buildings as we have just referred to would not be thought of in middle or southern Mexico.

In single seasons, Mr. Pike often buys, for resale, from seventy-five to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> tons of poultry, and between two and three hundred thousand pounds of wool. Besides the above, he has for many years purchased annually, for the Boston market, in the interest of the firm of Lamson, Dudley, & Pike, of which he is a member, great numbers of cattle and sheep. During the thirty years, Mr. Pike has found an outlet for that restless energy and enterprise which these pursuits and the occupation of farming and stock-growing cannot exhaust, in an extensive lumber...", "...fine eating, and expensive wines. No written contract binds them to remain where they are; they may leave when they please, if they can pay their debts; and the obligation they incur for the latter is one of honor only, and can not be enforced in the courts.

The good-will of a popular house has been sold for sixty thousand francs (twelve thousand dollars).

Some land being tithe free, some land tax free, some nearly rate free, those persons who do not trouble themselves to master the political economy may yet be satisfied that the \"burdens\" of the land affect neither the farmer, the labourer, nor the produce of the farm; the burdens fall _wholly_ on the landlord (a farmer with a lease being, as above shown, a part landlord). The efforts of some Conservative orators for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years to prove the contrary are erroneous in the reasoning; or I should say, much of the \"reasoning\" does not hang together at all.

The latter, a political and personal friend of Mr. Jefferson, and the very individual whom Colonel Burr had previously selected as his proxy to declare his sentiments, in case there was a tie between Mr. Jefferson and himself. A commission was accordingly taken out, and, on the 3d of April, 1806, Mr. Bayard and Mr. Smith were examined. No use, however, was made of these depositions until December, 1830, being a period of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. On the publication of Mr. Jefferson's writings, the sons of the late James A. Bayard felt that the memory of their father had been wrongfully and unjustly assailed in two paragraphs in the fourth volume of this work. The first of these paragraphs, on the 28th of January, 1830, was read in the United States Senate by the Hon. Mr. Clayton, of Delaware, General Samuel Smith and Edward Livingston both being members of the Senate and present. He read the following:...", "...death to burn a man alive; he therefore prayed and required the king to appease the fury and rigour of his justice and adopt a policy of mercy and pardon. This noble protest was effective, and some clemency was afterwards shown.

The cries of three thousand of his butchered subjects and the smoke from the ruins of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> towns and hamlets were the incense of his spirit's flight. One important innovation at court, fraught with evil, is due to Francis. \"In the matter of ladies,\" says Du Bellay, \"I must confess that before his time they frequented the court but rarely and in small numbers, but Francis on coming to his kingdom and considering that the whole decoration of a court consisted in the presence of ladies, willed to people it with them more than was the custom in ancient times.\"...", "...aus der Suedsee_ (Brunswick, 1899), p. 159; _id._, in _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, xxvii.

At the door, where she waited a few minutes for her taxicab, a young bride, with her eyes shining with joy, stood watching her husband while he talked with an acquaintance, and it seemed to Virginia that it was a vision of her own youth which had risen to torment her. \"That was the way I looked at Oliver <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years ago,\" she said to herself; \"twenty-five years ago, when I was young and he loved me.\" Then, even while the intolerable pain was still in her heart, she felt that something of the buoyant hopefulness of that other bride entered into her and restored her courage.

In spite of such precautions as these, and of all the pious diligence of the Holy Office, the reader will hardly believe that there is now a Spanish Protestant church in Valladolid; but such is the fact, though whether it derives from the times of the Inquisition, or is a modern missionary church I do not know. That _auto da fe_ was of the greatest possible distinction; the Infanta Juana presided, and the universal interest was so great that people paid a dollar and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents a seat; money then worth five or six times as much as now.

The inferiority and meagreness of such effects of hill, compared with the massive purple and blue of our own heaps of crags and morass, or the solemn grass-green and pine-purples of the Alps, have always struck me most painfully; and they have rendered it impossible for any poet or painter studying in the south, to enter with joy into hill scenery.

JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892) was born near the town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, not far from Hawthorne's birthplace. He had very little opportunity for education beyond what the district school afforded, for his parents were too poor to send him away to school. His two years' attendance at Haverhill Academy was paid for by his own work at making ladies' slippers for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents a pair. He began writing verses almost as soon as he learned to write at all, but his father discouraged this ambition as frivolous, saying it would never give him bread. His family were Quakers, sturdy of stature as of character. He is called \"The Quaker Poet.\" Whittier led the life of a New England farm boy, used to hard work and few pleasures. His library consisted of practically one book, the family Bible.

Here the dogs and cats were put through the proper movement from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to one hundred times, being left in the box after every five or ten trials and watched to see if they would not be able at least to realize that the act which they had just been made to do and which had resulted in liberation and food was the proper act to be done. For instance, a dog would be put in a box the door of which would fall open when a loop of string hanging outside the box was clawed down an inch or so. Animals were taken who had, when left to themselves, failed...", "...fifteen feet long by eighty wide, its nave being one hundred and four feet long and thirty-six wide. The form of the abbey is the usual long cross, and it has three entrances. Besides the nave, choir, and transepts, there are nine chapels dedicated to different saints, and an area of cloisters. The best external view of the building is obtained in front of the western entrance, where the visitor has full view of the two great square towers, which rise to the height of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet.

Out from an unusually bright day for London, we stepped in beneath the lofty arches, lighted by great windows of stained glass, glowing far above in colored sermons and religious stories; and from this point--the western entrance--a superb view may be had of the interior.

And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: 8:24.

And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year of their age, they shall cease to serve: 8:26.

They make several stops on the trip. The rich man, after the way of his kind, tarries in the fine hotels of two or three cities along the route. He pays five dollars a day for his rooms in these taverns, and from two to four dollars apiece for each of his meals. The poor man stops in those same cities. He pays from fifty cents to a dollar for his lodging each night and his meals will cost him nearer <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> than seventy-five cents each. Each of these men suits the necessities of his pocketbook and each finds suitable accommodations at the prices he wishes to pay. Yet the rich man and the poor man pay practically the same long-distance through fare--a trifle over two cents a mile--for the journey. Of course the rich man may have his drawing-room in a smart train that is formed almost exclusively of Pullman cars and the poor man may ride in day coaches and free reclining chair...", "...amazement of the minister's congregation.

The scene was a street in the West End of London, a little south of Eaton Square: the hour just <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> minutes short of midnight. A wind from the North Sea had been blowing all day across the Thames marshes, and collecting what it could carry; and the shop-keepers had scarcely drawn their iron shutters before a thin fog drifted up from lamp-post to lamp-post and filled the intervals with total darkness--all but one, where, half-way down the street on the left-hand side, an enterprising florist had set up an electric lamp at his private cost, to shine upon his window and...", "...inquiringly at Firmstone. \"Well?\" he finally ventured. \"What do you make of it?\" Firmstone asked.

Firmstone wrote the number on a slip of paper, then took the sheet from the foreman. \"You understand, then, that the ore taken from the mine and sent to the mill in May averaged <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars a ton?\" \"Yes, that's right.\" Luna was getting puzzled. \"Very good. You're doing well. Now look at this sheet.\" Firmstone handed him another paper. \"Now read the summary.\" Luna read aloud: \"Average loss in tailings, daily samples, May, two dollars and seventy-five cents a ton.\" \"You understand from this, do you not, that the gold recovered from the plates should then be twenty-two dollars and twenty-five cents a ton?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Luna's face was...", "...know what you are.\" \"I, an old soldier! twenty campaigns and ten times wounded!

The rice country.--The great staple of South Carolina was rice, which was grown upon the marshy lands. A limited amount was also produced in North Carolina and Georgia. The unhealthfulness of the rice fields, coupled with the large profits from the business, were factors which made negro slavery seem desirable. In 1733 the whites in South Carolina numbered about seven thousand, in 1748 about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand, and in 1765 about forty thousand, but this increase was due largely to the great migration to the back country.

From this beginning the indigo business rapidly developed.

I did not know that she was in Genoa, and the news gave me very great pleasure. I locked up my money, dressed in haste, and started out to see her.

In parts of France, Italy and Spain, the chestnut has become thoroughly naturalized and, as we may say, run wild, but as one of the early investigators says, in speaking of the abundance of old chestnut trees on the Apennines, they are generally scattered over the surface like trees on a well-arranged lawn, and not crowded and massed, as they would be in a state of nature or in a forest. On the south side of the Alps the trees grow up to an altitude of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred feet, and on the Pyrenees some two or three hundred feet higher.

I bought it a few weeks before I left the country. It is a round wooden pot with a lid to it. On the lid is the seated figure of a little old man with his shoulders hunched up, his chin resting in his two hands, his elbows on his knees. There is a mildly amused expression on the rudely carved face; whether this is there by accident or design I cannot say. On one side of the pot is a snake in relief; on...", "...hooting of tree-frogs, or the monotonous chirping of wood-crickets and grasshoppers.

The river ought to sink thirty or thirty-five feet below its highest point; this year it had declined only about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet, and the November rains threatened to be continuous. The drier the weather the stronger blows the east wind; it now failed us altogether, or blew gently for a few hours merely in the afternoons. I had hitherto seen the great river only in its sunniest aspect; I was now about to witness what it could furnish in the way of storms. On the night of the 22nd the moon appeared with a misty halo.

There is a strict division of property among the Gipsies; community of goods having no place among them. The heads of each family, although travelling in one band, manufacture and vend their own articles of merchandise, for the support of their own families. The following particulars are illustrative of this fact among the Gipsies:--A farmer in Fife, who would never allow them to kindle fires in his out-houses, had a band of them, of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> persons, quartered one night on his farm. Next morning, the chief female borrowed from the family a large copper caldron, used for the purposes of the dairy, with which she had requested permission to cook the breakfast of the horde upon the kitchen fire. This having been granted, each family produced a small linen bag, (not the beggar's wallet,) made of coarse materials, containing oatmeal; of which at least four were brought into the apartment. The female who prepared the...", "...the main island. About fifty-six species of land-birds are known to inhabit this island, and of these, a kingfisher (Tanysiptera Boris), a honey-sucker (Tropidorhynchus fuscicapillus), and a large crow-like starling (Lycocorax morotensis), are quite distinct from allied species found in Gilolo. The island is coralline and sandy, and we must therefore believe it to have been separated from Gilolo at a somewhat remote epoch; while we learn from its natural history that an arm of the sea <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles wide serves to limit the range even of birds of considerable powers of flight.

Miss Guyosa told charming folk-lore anecdotes, handed down in her family since the old Spanish days in Louisiana.

The unexpected movement of his enemies modified Napoleon's plan of attack. A delay in the arrival of the despatches sent to Major-General Berthier caused some difficulty in the first operations of the French army. When the emperor arrived at Donauwerth, on the morning of the 17th, his army was spread over an extent of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> leagues, and was in danger of being cut in two by the Archduke Charles. It was Napoleon's care and study on beginning the campaign to avoid this danger, which soon afterwards he subjected his adversary to. The Austrians, after passing the Isar at two places, and driving back the Bavarians who had been appointed to defend the passage, advanced towards the Danube. Already, before touching Donauwerth, Napoleon's orders had begun the concentration of his forces. Mass\u00e9na was...", "...in the matter, and meekly took his departure.

Although the weather was cool, yet when the sun was out the sitter left her nest from six to eight minutes at a time, and as often as once in twenty minutes. Of course in rain she had not so much...", "...to the wife's health this custom is entirely based on religious ideas and superstitions. Many savages consider that every woman is impure and bewitched during her monthly periods, during pregnancy and suckling. If we add to this the fact that, being usually treated as beasts, the women soon grow old, we can easily understand that the men are inclined to polygamy. It is remarkable with what rapidity the savage woman grows old. She is only fresh from thirteen to twenty years; after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> she is old and sterile, and a little later she has the aspect of an old sorceress. This premature senility is not so much due to early sexual intercourse as to the terribly hard work they undergo, and also to the prolonged period of suckling. Another cause of polygamy is man's natural desire for change. The negroes of Angola exchange wives. The instinct of procreation, love of glory and riches cooperate with the sterility of many women in propagating polygamy.

The hill-sides were thickly strewn with canvas tents and bush arbors; a store was erected, and several boarding shanties in operation. The day was intensely hot, yet about two hundred men were at work in the full glare of the sun, washing for gold--some with tin pans, some with close-woven Indian baskets, but the greater part had a rude machine, known as the cradle. This is on...", "...perched on a pedestal two feet high, suddenly fell down. At the same instant a crack opened between my feet and ran rapidly across the glacier in a straight line.\"* (* Extract from a letter of Louis Agassiz to M. Arago dated from the Hotel des Neuchatelois, Glacier of the Aar, August 7, 1842.) On this occasion Agassiz saw three crevasses formed in an hour and a half, and heard others opening at a greater distance from him. He counted eight new fissures in a space of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet. The phenomenon continued throughout the evening, and recurred, though with less frequency, during the night. The cracks were narrow, the largest an inch and a half in width, and their great depth was proved by the rapidity with which they drained any standing water in their immediate vicinity. \"A boring-hole,\" says Agassiz, \"one hundred and thirty feet deep and six inches in diameter, full of water, was completely emptied in a few minutes, showing that these narrow...", "...XL [Piteous Relics at Chamonix] I am not so ignorant about glacial movement, now, as I was when I took passage on the Gorner Glacier. I have \"read up\" since. I am aware that these vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed; while the Gorner Glacier makes less than an inch a day, the Unter-Aar Glacier makes as much as eight; and still other glaciers are said to go twelve, sixteen, and even twenty inches a day. One writer says that the slowest glacier travels <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet a year, and the fastest four hundred. What is a glacier? It is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which occupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains. But that gives no notion of its vastness. For it is sometimes six hundred feet thick, and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep; no, our rivers are six feet, twenty feet, and sometimes fifty feet deep; we are not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an ice-river six hundred feet...", "...the storm. \"I'm ever so sorry, Bob,\" said Betty earnestly, \"But--could you lend me twenty-five dollars?\" Bob whistled. \"I could,\" he admitted cautiously. \"What's it for, Betsey?\" \"That,\" said Betty, \"is a secret.\" Bob glanced at her sharply. His chin hardened. \"Come down here where we won't be interrupted,\" he said, leading the way to the wharf. \"You'll have to give me a good reason for wanting the money, Betty.\" CHAPTER XIX BOB'S SOLUTION \"If you wanted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars and I had it,\" said Betty persuasively, \"I'd give it to you without asking a solitary question.\" Rob's lips twitched. \"But, Betty--\" he began.

There was a mad scramble for the pigskin, Williams at last falling on it on his <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> yards. Norton punted poorly, the ball going diagonally across the gridiron, and it was Claflin's first down on Brimfield's twenty-eight yards. Atkinson came through centre for a yard, and then Burrage once more dropped back for a try at goal. The attempt looked rather desperate, for the kicker was standing almost on the forty-yard line, but Brimfield's supporters held their breaths until the Claflin half-back had swung his long leg. Then a vast shout of relief went up from...", "...Six thousand more would then hold all the rest of the territory necessary to hold until active operations can again be resumed west of the river. According to your last return, this would give you a force of over thirty thousand effective men with which to move against Mobile. To this I expect to add five thousand men from Missouri. If however, you think the force here stated too small to hold the territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of, I would say concentrate at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand men of your present command for operations against Mobile. With these and such additions as I can give you from elsewhere, lose no time in making a demonstration, to be followed by an attack upon Mobile.

[Sidenote: 1686. RENEWED WAR WITH FRANCE.] While the best strength of Germany was engaged in this Turkish war, Louis XIV. was busy in carrying out his plans of conquest. He claimed the Palatinate of the Rhine for his brother, the Duke of Orleans, and also attempted to make one of his agents Archbishop of Cologne. In 1686, an alliance was formed between Leopold I., several of the German States, Holland, Spain and Sweden, to defend themselves against the...", "...keep their own range.\" \"He's worth ten martens, they say?\" queried Rolf. \"Ugh! fifty.\" \"Can't we get him?\" \"Can try.

The last year of the eighteenth century was also the last of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years of partnership of Boulton & Watt, and, with it, the patents under which that firm had held the great monopoly of steam-engine building expired.

His long courtship was rewarded in October 1826. When the marriage took place the bride was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years old and the bridegroom thirty. Men of letters have not the reputation of making ideal husbands, and the qualities to which this is due were possessed by Carlyle in exaggerated measure.

Henry contented himself for a while with sending a few volunteers to aid in resistance; but when the death of the Duke left Britanny and its heiress, Anne, at the mercy of the French king the country called at once for war. Henry was driven to find allies in the states which equally dreaded the French advance, in the house of Austria and in the new power of Spain, to call on Parliament for supplies, and to cross the Channel in 1492 with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand men. But his allies failed him; a marriage of Charles with Anne gave the Duchy irretrievably to the French king; and troubles at home brought Henry to listen to terms of peace on payment of a heavy subsidy.

In like manner, Young's support of the canals and Wright's veto of the appropriation, strengthened the one and weakened the other in all the canal counties. Indeed, after the election it was easy to trace all these influences. Oneida, a strong canal county, which had given Wright eight hundred majority in 1844, now gave Young thirteen hundred. Similar results appeared in Lewis, Alleghany, Herkimer, and other canal counties. In Albany, an Anti-Rent county, the Whig majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> was increased to twenty-eight hundred, while Delaware, another Anti-Rent stronghold, changed Wright's majority of nine hundred in 1844, to eighteen hundred for Young. On the other hand, in New York City, where the conservative Whig papers had bitterly assailed their candidate, Wright's majority of thirty-three hundred in 1844 was increased to nearly fifty-two hundred.

It is a long time to look back on; but I well remember the bright, winning face, and cordial manners of the little lady, when she would come to the parsonage and enliven our tranquil hearts by her gay, spontaneous glee. She was full of life and buoyancy; there was even then a sort of sparkling rapture about her existence, a keen susceptibility of enjoyment, and an intense sympathy with those she loved, which bespoke her, from the first, no ordinary being.

That silk is produced in less quantity by the importation of that of China; and since our silk pays higher duties than the foreign--either because of its excellent quality, or because it is native, or for some other reason--that freedom from duties ought to be extended to it rather than to the Chinese silk, instead of burdening it with greater duties. These latter should be imposed upon the Chinese silk, so that,...", "...As a boy he may have had his likings among the girl companions with whom he was acquainted, but now it becomes a totally different question, and his intercourse with young women assumes the position of courtship. It is only natural and right that man should look where God intended him to look for a help-meet and companion, but all depends upon the way in which he does it. There is no need to be in a hurry. Better to wait and make quite sure. As a general rule I should say that <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> was quite young enough for a man to marry, but still that must entirely depend upon circumstances. Before I venture to suggest a few thoughts concerning courtship and the choice of a wife, I should like to make a few remarks upon the manner in which women ought to be treated by men.

Accordingly, braving the law which Elizabeth had had made in 1585, and which provided that, if any attempt on her person was meditated by, or for, a person who thought he had claims to the crown of England, a commission would be appointed composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> members, which, to the exclusion of every other tribunal, would be empowered to examine into the offence, and to condemn the guilty persons, whosoever they might be.

No more fascinating trip can be taken in summer, after Berlin and Potsdam have been visited, than to the wild and beautiful Spreewald,--a combination of forest and morass not yet wholly redeemed to the civilization of Europe, but holding in its remoter depths a genuine relic of the old barbarism.

On this occasion his usual good fortune attended him for it was the opinion of every one there, that he had got the best bargain disposed of during the day--a lot of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> wethers in prime condition. Gerald Cavanagh, who had also tasted the poteen, stuck as closely as possible to his skirts, moved thereto by a principle of adhesion, with which our readers are already acquainted; and Bryan, who saw and understood his motives, felt by no means comfortable at witnessing such strong symptoms of excessive attachment.

Once he thought he had found it in Mrs. Jane Stannard, mother of a schoolmate; but the new friend soon died, and for months the grief-stricken boy, it is said, haunted the lonely grave at night and brooded over his loss and the mystery of death--a not very wholesome experience for a lonely and melancholy lad of fifteen years. At the University he drank wine, though not intemperately, and played cards a great deal, the end of the term finding him with gambling debts of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred dollars. These habits were common at the time, and Edgar did not incur any censure from the faculty; but Mr. Allan declined to honor the gambling debt, removed Edgar, and placed him in his own counting room.

The ladies were walking home from a neighbor's house, where they had been on a visit, when they were suddenly surrounded by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> savages, who committed the fearful deed already indicated, and then carried them away into a captivity a thousand times worse than death.

There wasn't much on the street except ahead, by the curb, a wagon, and coming toward him a big motor truck. When he was fifty feet from the wagon a fellow stepped out from behind it to cross the street. It was right under the arc light, and Jord recognized Franz--'Little Hungary' you know--with his fiddle under his arm, crossing to go in at the stage door of the Victoria Theatre, where he plays.

The development of the Elizabethan drama for the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years is of exceptional interest to students of literary history, for in this brief period, in connection with the half-dozen theaters of a growing city and the demands of its varied population, we may trace the beginning, growth, florescence, and decay of many kinds of plays, and of many great careers. Actors, audiences, and dramatists all contributed to changes in taste and practice and to a development of unexampled rapidity and variety. In every detail of dramatic art...", "...with a note. In the evening a tall man with long hair just turning gray, and gray beard, came into the room. The old man immediately seated himself beside Maslova and began to jest. The hostess called him into an adjoining room, and Maslova overheard her say: \"As fresh as a rose; just from the country.\" Then the hostess called in Maslova and told her that the man was an author, very rich, _and will be very generous if he takes a liking to her_. He did take a liking to her, gave her <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> rubles, and promised to call on her often. The money was soon spent in settling for her board at her aunt's, for a new dress, hat and ribbons. A few days afterward the author sent for her a second time. She called.

While living in the apartments rented by the author, Maslova became infatuated with a jolly clerk living in the same house. She herself told...", "...the whole is done. Turn it out of the pot immediately, into a box--cover it tight, to keep in the steam. A coffee-roaster is better than a pot to roast coffee in, as it preserves the fine aromatic flavor of the coffee, which in a great measure escapes with the steam of the coffee, when roasted in an open pot. To make good common coffee, allow a table-spoonful of it, when ground, to each pint of water. Turn on the water boiling hot, and boil the coffee in a tin pot, from twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> minutes--if boiled longer, it will not taste fresh and lively.

But acumen develops in the investigator; the figure of twenty-five per cent is correct or may even be an underestimate.

There are sixty normal schools, fifty colleges and universities, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> theological seminaries. The colored people pay taxes on nearly $200,000,000 worth of property valuation. This is a wonderful showing for a race that has two hundred years of slavery and four thousand years of barbarism back of it; it needs no silent sympathy or patient waiting, when in twenty years it makes such a showing.

The States were then asked to pledge their own internal revenue for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years to meet the national indebtedness, but this could only be done by unanimous consent, and while twelve States concurred, Rhode Island refused and the measure was defeated.

The advantage of ducks over chicks is this: they do not bring quite so big a price per pound, but they grow so much faster during the first two months of their lives. Ducks should be marketed at eight to ten weeks old.

The cost of feeding the two will be about the same. Ducks have other advantages over chickens. They are not nearly so subject to vermin, though lice sometimes attack their heads. They seem to thrive in confinement and cost less to house than chickens. Their feathers will bring a good price, and eggs of pure breeds for hatching are in demand. They are excellent layers, even better than some hens, as experience will show.

If then good land existed in a quantity much more abundant than the production of food for an increasing population required, or if capital could be indefinitely employed without a diminished return on the old land, there could be no rise of rent; for rent invariably proceeds from the employment of an additional quantity of labour with a proportionally less return.

In 1873 he was decorated by the Austrian Emperor.

For twelve years their continual object had been national independence; henceforth it was \"to make the Eternal City, on which rested <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> centuries of glory, the splendid capital of the Italian kingdom.\" On March 25, 1861, Cavour seized a chance opportunity to repeat and emphasise his views. The question of Rome was, he said, the gravest ever placed before the parliament of a free people. It was not only of vital importance to Italy, but also to two hundred thousand Catholics in all parts of the globe; its solution ought to have not only a political influence, but also a moral and religious influence.

He says: \"To the south the calm surface of the bay opened outward into Cross Sound <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles away.

The greatest enterprise of this kind, however, still remains unaccomplished--that is, the laying of the Atlantic cable.

The chief difficulty which engaged the attention of Mr. Wildman Whitehouse and the other agents of the notable enterprise was the enormous size of the cable which, it was thought, would be necessary. The general belief at that time was, that the greater the distance to be traversed, the larger must be the wire along which the electric current was to pass, and...", "...hardness of the head.

The heads of the best varieties of Stone Mason range in weight from six to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> pounds, the difference turning mostly on soil, manure, and cultivation. The Stone Mason is an earlier cabbage than Premium Flat Dutch, has fewer waste leaves, and side by side, under high cultivation, grows to an equal or larger size, while it makes heads that are decidedly harder and sweeter. These cabbages are equally reliable for heading.

Every fall for years a few notes written to the leading girls, and a group of twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> working girls, would gather and start anew on this club life. This method of conducting a club made it seem useless to spend money in making the rooms attractive. They were usually on the second floor of a house occupied by two or more families; the halls dark and bare; the rooms rarely clean as to walls and ceiling, barren of ornament. The floors were bare, and not infrequently stood sadly in need of scrubbing. They were lighted by smoking kerosene lamps, which but added to...", "...not intend to tackle us except at that moment when it would be possible for her to take us at a disadvantage.

In accordance with this agreement, he accepted one lot of land situated within the Wilberforce settlement, which he agreed to sell to Mr. Lewis for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars. Mr. Lewis, knowing that I was anxious to purchase, accepted the offer, and then came and showed the contract, offering it to me on condition that I paid him the twenty-five dollars which he had just paid Mr. Ingersoll.

There are not wanting, however, indications that the protracted decline in rates of interest in the world's markets may have been checked, and even that a reverse movement has begun.

These facts are entirely consistent with the conclusions suggested by the history of the subject. No uniform or secular tendency to reduction in the average rate of interest, which is the index of the average productiveness of capital, not of its amount, can be found to have prevailed. Fluctuations in the average rate are found, quite independent of the local and temporary fluctuations, which are often extreme; and these long tidal waves...", "...comes of that other one's having left the front door on the latch.\" But I am not sure that any of us, including himself, believed she could be really dead.

The ground is then divided by a line into two equal parts. In a gymnasium balance beams may be set up for this purpose.

His cupidity was excited, and he felt sure of winning the dollar, as he had the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents. But James had no idea of playing off now, and he played a better game, as he was well able to do. The result was that Mark was beaten by three points.

It is needless to state that by far the greater part of the school travelled down by the four-eighteen--who for the sake of a fast train and a comfortable journey would surrender forty-eight minutes of his holidays?--and usually, of course, Roland accompanied the many. This term, however, the advantages of the fast train were considerable. He was particularly anxious to have the...", "...was the car that ran away with me, Mr. Plant,\" Frank broke in. \"Anyhow, I brought it back again.\" \"He is the first person I have ever known,\" Mr. Plant went on, \"to travel about the country in a private car, without a cent of money to buy anything to eat with.

Five long, weary days had the poor animals carried their loads, going sometimes <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to thirty miles a day, and all that time not one drop of water had they been able to get. Moreover, they scarcely looked like camels, for their nice, plump humps had almost entirely disappeared, and this was something that the Arabs noted with anxiety.

Senator Scrivener had bought it at a great price in Cairo. Some day the white enamel which Trent had painted over the imperishable glass would be carefully removed and it would gladden his eyes in Maine where visitors would be infrequent.

In many calculations the mathematician employs what is called a constant, a figure that never varies, and which is used to multiply or divide certain factors. In this case the constant is 5/1000, or, as usually written, .005. This is the same as one two hundredths of the squared figure. That would make the problem as follows: 45 X 45 = 2025 / 200 = 10.125; or, 45 X 45 - 2025 X .005 = 10.125.

This he fitted up with a collection of instruments of hitherto unapproached size and perfection, and here, for twenty years, he pursued his observations.

In Typhus, the sheet is changed every ten minutes, and as often as forty or fifty times in a day. As a general rule, Mr. Priessnitz told me, if unwell, without waiting to know the ailment--to take a packing-sheet, until warm, twice a day, followed by a tepid bath. Packing-sheets may be persevered in for years in obstinate cases. The usual time employed in their application is until the body is warm, which will be from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> to forty minutes. It is a great mistake to suppose the application of the sheet is to produce perspiration. If a genial heat pervades the body, it is all that is required, unless under peculiar circumstances, previous to immersion in either tepid or cold water.

Each company comprised swimmers, masons, bakers, tailors, shoemakers, armourers, and workmen of every class. They carried every thing they required with them; his army was like a colony; hand-mills followed.

The natives, becoming aware of the nature of the search, directed his attention to the hill of Corsabad, situated at a distance of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> kilometers from Mosul; the excavations were removed thither, and carried on with most gratifying results.

The next winter he stayed at Holmstater, with Ingolf. Next spring he fought with Thorgest and lost the battle. That summer, Eric began to settle the land which he had discovered [A.

However, I intimated that I thought they did. \"Of course they do\", my remark was answered in chorus. Since then I have noticed that a railway does invariably follow a valley, if it is a large one; and small rivers make excellent routes, but never crooked little streams like the Monca. When it comes to such creeks, and there is a table land above, as soon as the road can get out, it usually stays out. This was the situation of the C. & R.W.

There are fourteen bridges across in that many miles, which were and still are, always going out during high water.

The battle had lasted up to exhaustion without loss by the English! Without Montauban the battle would have been terminated by complete and mutual exhaustion and without further losses.

Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm--the fair round arm of a woman but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years old, and who yet spread death around her. It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room. The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to insensibility. She raised her head with an effort.

Meanwhile they were striking staggering blows in the South. On December 29, 1778, a British force landed two miles below Savannah, in Georgia, lying near the mouth of the important Savannah River, and by nightfall, after some sharp fighting, took the place with its stores and shipping. Augusta, the capital of Georgia, lay about a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles up the river. By the end of February, 1779, the British not only held Augusta but had established so strong a line of posts in the interior that Georgia seemed to be entirely under their control. Then followed a singular chain of events. Ever since hostilities had begun, in 1775, the revolutionary party had been dominant in the South. Yet now again in 1779 the British flag floated over the capital of Georgia. Some rejoiced and some mourned. Men do not change...", "...I know about, as I was one of the sufferers by these vermin.

The rabbits were the cause of the whole destruction. They had eaten up all the grass and edible bushes, and it was some consolation to know that they were themselves being starved out, and were dying by the hundreds daily.

In taxes and loans they paid to the Government about three thousand millions of dollars. Their indirect assistance was perhaps as great, though it is impossible today to estimate with any approach to accuracy the amount either in money or service. Among obvious items are the collections made by the Sanitary Commission for the benefit of the hospital service, amounting to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> million dollars, and about six millions raised by the Christian Commission. In a hundred other ways both individuals and localities strained their resources to supplement those of the Government. Immense subscription lists were circulated to raise funds for the families of soldiers. The city of Philadelphia alone spent in this way in a single year $600,000. There is also evidence of a vast amount of unrecorded relief of needy families by the neighbors, and in the farming...", "...to attain perfect golf when everything is in your favour. Mr. Barry's victory in the amateur event when he was nineteen, and those of Mr. Travis and Mr. Hutchings when these gentlemen were quite middle-aged (anyhow, Mr. Travis, the younger, was forty-three), have to be regarded simply as phenomena, and as the exceptions which prove the rule. The tale of the ages, as gathered from all experience, seems to be that the ideal golfer begins as a baby, is scratch at seventeen, a champion at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or twenty-six, and perhaps again at thirty-two, and that thenceforth he plays serenely on until at eighty-five or thereabouts he engages in a great foursome with other old warriors.

A NIGHT...", "...At first I thought a waist that tapered from the arm pits would be an added beauty, if only these ladies would be taught how to acquire it. But I lived long enough among them to look upon a tapering waist as a disgusting deformity. They considered a large waist a mark of beauty, as it gave a greater capacity of lung power; and they laid the greatest stress upon the size and health of the lungs. One little lady, not above five feet in height, I saw draw into her lungs two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cubic inches of air, and smile proudly when she accomplished it. I measured five feet and five inches in height, and with the greatest effort I could not make my lungs receive more than two hundred cubic inches of air. In my own country I had been called an unusually robust girl, and knew, by comparison, that I had a much larger and fuller chest than the average among women. I noticed with greater surprise than anything else had excited in me, the marked absence of men.

The sagacity of our border hero was fully proved upon another occasion. About 1790, the Indians visited Clarksburgh, in the night, and contrived to steal a few horses, with which they made a hasty retreat. About daylight the next morning, a party of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty men, among whom was Jesse Hughes, started in pursuit. They found a trail just outside of the settlement, and from the signs, supposed that the marauding party consisted of eight or ten Indians. A council was held to determine how the pursuit should be continued. Mr. Hughes was opposed to following the trail. He said he could pilot the party to the spot where the Indians would cross the Ohio, by a nearer way than the enemy could go, and thus render success certain....", "...diminished rapidly.

In the two last objects Carnegie was doomed to disappointment, but as a geographical contribution to our scanty knowledge of north-west Australia, the outcome of his repeated journey was distinctly valuable.

A native was induced to lead them to a singular spring situated in a cavern <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet underground. Though the water was not easy of access, having to be hauled up by bucket to the surface, there was an ample supply for the camels, and, as Carnegie considered the well to be permanent, he named it the Empress Spring. The discovery of this subterranean spring was indeed a godsend, as when they eventually reached Forrest's Alexander Spring they found it dry. A similar experience had befallen W.W.

Heysham, whose exact records of epidemics at Carlisle were made twenty or thirty years earlier, mentions casually in 1814 that scarlet fever had been \"more frequent of late,\" but that it did not spread as formerly[1340]. Other references to it in this interval are to show how seldom fatal it was under the cold water treatment or the lowering regimen[1341]. At the Newcastle Dispensary fully twice as many cases of scarlatina were attended in the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years 1803-27 (795 cases) as in the twenty-five years 1777-1802 (355 cases); but in the larger total, which an increasing population might account for, there were actually fewer fatalities (30) than in the smaller (33); the highest number in any one year was 71 in 1824, of which every one is entered as having recovered. This is the impression derived from various sources--that the scarlatina from about 1803 until about 1830 may have been frequent, but that it was mild, or...", "...confusion about the subsequent differentiation of these families, but it is sufficient to know that, together with the Mononobe family, they, were the hereditary repositories of military authority.

This latter process was often resorted to some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years ago, so that ballast in the form of lead sheeting might be padded on to the keel and garboards. More than one large yacht at that period had been so treated that she was supposed to have not much more than half-an-inch planking at her two lowest strakes.

In 1848 the Confederation endeavoured to obtain the release of the canton from Prussian rule, and this by the peaceful methods of diplomacy, but in vain. In 1856 a conspiracy was set on foot to undo the work of 1848--the granting of a more democratic constitution to Neuchatel. At the head of these royalist plotters were Count Poustates and De Meuron. However, their plans failed, and five hundred prisoners were taken. Out of these, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> were by order of the Federal Government kept back to be tried as insurgents. Frederick William IV., of Prussia, demanded their unconditional pardon and surrender, an order obedience to which would have been a renunciation of the canton, and a defiance of the Federal rule. The demand was refused, and the question of the release became the centre about which all the negotiation now turned. In this emergency Napoleon III., of France, offered his services as mediator, mindful...", "...rods, it may be safely calculated that about one-seventh part of the water can be raised and discharged at an elevation above the ram five times as high as the fall which is applied to the ram, or one-fourteenth part can be raised and discharged, say ten times as high as the fall applied; and so in that proportion, as the fall or rise is varied. Thus, if the ram be placed under a head or fall of five feet, of every seven gallons drawn from the spring, one may be raised <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet, or half a gallon fifty feet.

You and your children and your children's children would die while you are doing it. The best proof of that is the fact that we have had a constitution for one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, and the Lord knows it needs patching. It needs something worse: It needs abolishing worse than anything else. (Applause). If anybody does want to tinker with voting the first thing necessary is to get rid of the constitution.

In each prepared cocoon are about a thousand yards of filament ready to pay off, but this filament is nearly as fine as a cobweb and is tapering. The object is to form a thread by laying these filaments side by side in sufficient number to obtain the desired size. For the threads of raw silk used in commerce, the sizes vary, so that while some require but an average of three filaments, the coarsest sizes require <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty.

In this case, as in many others, the blood of a martyr was the seed of the faith. The mob that murdered Elijah P.

He argued, then, as he did <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years later, that the Constitution of the United States was sacred, and as long as it existed must be obeyed. It recognized the right to hold slaves in certain States, and therefore that right could not be denied until the Constitution was appropriately amended.

Deva Raya I. lived till at least 1412 A.D., and was succeeded by his son Vira-Vijaya, whom Nuniz calls \"Visaya,\" and who, he says, reigned six years. The last extant inscription of Deva Raya I. is dated in A.D. 1412 -- 13, the first of his successor Vijaya in 1413 -- 14. Vijaya's last known inscription is one of 1416 -- 17, and the first yet known of his successor, his eldest son, Deva Raya II., is dated Monday, June 26, 1424 -- 25. Nuniz gives Deva Raya II. a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years. I am inclined to think that Deva Raya II. began to reign in 1419, for the following reason.

If he'd gone another <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet he'd have gone into the pit where Superior had been. Knaubloch couldn't see the extent of the pit because it was too dark, but it looked big. Bigger than if a nitro truck had blown up, which was his first thought. He backed up two hundred feet, set out flares, then sped off to a telephone. The state police converged on the former site of Superior from several directions. Communicating by radiophone across the vast pit, they confirmed that the town undoubtedly was...", "...evinced no desire to take it, but Hilary pressed it on him. \"My resignation as counsel for your road.\" The president of the Northeastern, bewildered by this sudden transformation, stared at the envelope. \"What?

This expedition, fitted out partly by the Royal Geographical Society, South Australia, and partly by a Mr. Calvert, was under command of L. A.

The cabman charged him one rouble and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> copecks for driving him to Povarska Street, but he did not haggle and submissively took his seat in the sledge. He could still grasp the difference in numbers, but money had no value to him whatever. At home Klimov was met by his aunt and his sister Katy, a girl of eighteen. Katy had a copy-book and a pencil in her hands as she greeted him, and he remembered that she was preparing for a teacher's examination.

I told her she charged too high a price, as chickens were not worth more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents apiece; but she insisted that she wanted a dollar, because she had promised that amount to the padre for reading a mass for a man who had died in the time of Hidalgo at the beginning of the century. But most of the crowd flocked to my tent to consult me about their ailments. It was useless to tell them that I was not a medical man, or that I had not much medicine to spare, carrying only what I expected to use for my own party. If I had given them all they wanted,...", "...and learned that I was about to depart in the early morning, bound for Placentia Bay; he would like to ask me to do him a small favor. Could I take one package and land it on my way to Auvergne, where was one friend of his? A small matter, one five-gallon keg of rum, that rum which was of such trivial price in Saint Pierre, but on which the duty was so high in Newfoundland, and his friend was one poor man, one fisherman, who could not afford to pay the duty. Now this Auvergne was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles this side of any port of entry, and my first landing in Newfoundland, according to law, had to be at a port of entry. And so I told this chap that, and how I was liable to a heavy fine, and so on. Yes, he discerned much truth in what I said, but consider that poor fisherman who could have his good rum merely for the landing--no other cost, none whatever--he, a friend of Mr. Miller, was sending it as a gift for the holiday Christmas time. And that rum--consider the...", "...see in proverbs how by the power of simplicity an enormous amount of thought can be packed into a single line. Some of these have taken thousands of years to grow; and because so much time is required in the making of them, our facile modern writers never produce any. Their fleeting epigrams appear to be spurious coin the moment they are placed side by side with Franklin's epigrams, for instance. Franklin worked his proverbs into the vacant spaces in his almanac during a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, and then collected all those proverbs into a short paper entitled, \"The Way to Wealth.\" It may be added, also, that he did not even originate most of these sayings, but only gave a new stamp to what he found in Hindu and Arabic records. For all that, Poor Richard's Almanac is more likely to become immortal than even Franklin's own name and fame. The history of Bacon's essays is another fine example of what simplicity can effect in the way of greatness. These...", "...enough, they were clearly visible, more than two miles off, rising and falling on the swell, their oars flashing in the light from the conflagration. The crew had abandoned the hopeless fight and were saving themselves. \"Keep her straight for 'em, Perce!\" directed Jim. Whittington obeyed. Soon the _Barracouta_ was within hailing distance of the dories. In the now diminishing light from the distant fire the boys could see that both were crowded with dark figures. \"Must be at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> aboard the two,\" commented Stevens. \"Yes,\" returned Spurling. \"These fishermen carry big crews.

Dwyer tossed it to Red and he was away. It was strange, the feeling that came over Red Rodgers as he leaped forward. He was not on a football field dodging men, but on the water, heading into waves that threatened to swamp his frail craft. There was one to the right, a huge one. This way out. Here were two at the left. A quick turn here, a short twist there, and he was on again. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> yards, he raced forward. The field was clear now. The crowd was on its feet. They were shouting themselves hoarse. The miracle had happened. The Red Rover, their idol, was away at last. \"Touchdown! Touchdown!\" they screamed. And at last Berley Todd joined in the cry. \"Touchdown! Touchdown!\" Touchdown it was. Then the crowd waited, breathless, for the kick that promised a tie or defeat; the crowd waited and lost, for the ball went wild. The score stood Northern 7; Midway...", "...3,600 boxes, Charles S.

Nor must we forget to mention the milk business. Louis P. Hawkes has a herd of some forty cows and has a milk route at Lynn. J.W. Blodgett keeps <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cows, and takes his milk to market. Geo. N. Miller and T.O.W. Houghton also keep cows and have a route. Joshua Kingsbury, George H.

According to Gibbon, Rome's great standing army was not over 400,000 men. Napoleon's grand army did not exceed 700,000, and in the Battle of Waterloo less than 200,000 men were engaged. In the American Civil War less than 3,000,000, and in the Russo-Japanese War only 2,500,000 men were employed. Indeed, if we sum up the twenty greatest wars of the last one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, from the Napoleonic Wars to the present time, less than 20,000,000 men were engaged, while in this war nearly twice that number are now under arms. Britain alone has enrolled over 5,000,000 for the army, with 1,000,000 more from the overseas dominions, and about 500,000 for the navy. Germany has called some 12,000,000 and Russia more than 12,000,000 to the colors. By the end of 1917 nearly 6,000,000 men will have been killed. Less than 5,500,000 were killed in...", "...but the freshet had shut him off in that quarter; so he turned to the detachment of Jackson, on the east side, just cut off from support. Marching up the river bank, Jackson succeeded in so reinforcing his detachment as to defend it to an upper crossing till it found safe footing on the west bank. The high water cut off all operations by direct moves on the 24th. Meanwhile, General Pope had received the divisions of Kearny and Reynolds from McClellan's army, forty-five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred respectively. About this time a letter came to head-quarters of the right wing from General Toombs, expressing regret at his unfortunate mistake in relieving his troops from picket service, and asking to be released from arrest, that he might have the opportunity to show in the approaching conflicts his deep interest in the cause. The adjutant-general was instructed to say in reply that the chief of corps was pleased to know that the malefeasance was from want of...", "...went to France with his project and interested Napoleon Bonaparte, who became his patron and who was the means of securing sufficient funds for him to build a boat which was called the _Nautilus_. With this vessel Fulton made numerous descents, and it is reported that he covered fifty yards in a submerged run of seven minutes. In the spring of 1801 he took the _Nautilus_ to Brest, and experimented with her for some time. He and three companions descended in the harbor to a depth of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> feet and remained one hour, but he found the hull would not stand the pressure of a greater depth. They were in total darkness during the whole time, but afterward he fitted his craft with a glass window, one and a half inches in diameter, through which he could see to count the minutes on his watch. He also discovered during his trials that the mariner's compass pointed equally as true under water as above it. His experiments led him to believe that he could build a...", "...faggots with them and, in spite of the heavy volleys poured upon them managed, under cover of the darkness, to creep into the tunnel leading to the water, and to light a large fire underneath the tower. They were, however, driven out; and three water carriers went into the tunnel, and put out the fire. They were just in time, for the flames had taken a firm hold of the wooden beams. After this, twenty-five men were always stationed in the tower and, at night, another picket of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> men were placed in the covered way leading to the water. The entrance to this, at the water side, was exposed to the enemy's fire; but a barricade of stones, with interstices to allow the water to go through, was built into the river, and formed an efficient screen to the water bearers. On the night of the 14th, the enemy again made an attack on the water bearers, but were repulsed with loss. The water way was, indeed, a source of constant anxiety. Between it, and the...", "...and more of our consort. Undoubtedly the complement of this is true, and our consort knows more of us; but this thought, not always reassuring, comes only when we reflect concerning ourselves, which fortunately, perhaps, is not often. Married people, if we may judge from what they say, tend to reflect more concerning their mates. Alice, it is certain, knew less of herself. Much of the confidence of five years earlier she had parted with, some of it cruelly. Yet coming at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> into the Kimberly circle, and with the probability of remaining in it, of its being to her a new picture of life, Alice gradually renewed her youth. Some current flowing from this joy of living seemed to revive in her the illusions of girlhood. All that she now questioned was whether it really was for her. Her husband enjoyed her promise of success in their new surroundings without realizing in the least how clearly those about them discriminated between his wife and...", "...possess the two great capitals of Christendom in the same year? If, again, it were not accident, but due to some common cause, why is not that cause explained? Pope to his nearest friends never stated the amount of his loss. The biographers report that at one time his stock was worth from twenty to thirty thousand pounds. But that is quite impossible. It is true, that as the stock rose at one time a thousand per cent., this would not imply on Pope's part an original purchase beyond <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred pounds or thereabouts. But Pope has furnished an argument against _that, _ which we shall improve. He quotes, more than once, as applicable to his own case, the old proverbial riddle of Hesiod, _----- ----- ------, the half is more than the whole_. What did he mean by that? We understand it thus: That between the selling and buying, the variations had been such as to sink his shares to one half of the price they had once reached, but, even at that depreciation, to...", "...the officials was voluntarily directed to some other article, while the agent's porters turned the trunk upside down, chalked it, and replied to the query, that it had been examined, and was not even opened, which the officials well knew, and for the consideration of three dollars they betrayed trust.

The latter especially, being made at Tivoli, are prohibited, or admitted at the prohibitive duty of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> baiocchi the Roman pound,--sufficient to illustrate what might have been the result of this transaction in a mercantile point of view, not to speak of the opportunity afforded for introducing the _Bible_. The officials are all indifferently remunerated, and thus do business for themselves at the cost of the Government. They are also very incapable for the discharge of their duty. For example, the _Governor_ of the custom-house seriously asked me, preparatory to making a...", "...human judgments are limited and no doubt there was a mixture of truth and error in Chesterton's view of the years that followed. But in the universal reaction from the war-spirit to Pacifism the truths he was urging received scant attention, his really amazing prophecies fell on deaf ears. \"He will almost certainly,\" Monsignor Knox has said,* \"be remembered as a prophet, in an age of false prophets.\" And it is not insignificant that today it has become the fashion to say, as he said <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years ago and steadily reiterated, that the peace of 1918 was only an armistice.

Later on she was to become famous for her exploit in...", "...and true grandeur; the attitude of the peasants towards the seigniors is that of an affectionate son with his father; and the seigniors in talking with the peasants use their rude and coarse language, and speak only in a kind and genial way.

People live together harmoniously when living together from birth to death, familiarly, and with the same interests, occupations and pleasures; like soldiers with their officers, on campaigns and under tents, in subordination although in companionship, familiarity never endangering respect. \"The seignior often visits them on their small farms,[1305] talks with them...", "...Betty, something of what was in his mind about her. \"Gaspard is going to be taken away in an ambulance,\" the child said, \"to the hospital.\" \"Then who is going to cook my dinner?\" Collier Pratt asked. \"Good lord, I don't know,\" Nancy cried, roused to her responsibilities.

Dinner was served every night promptly at half past six, and there was absolutely no preparation made for it, not so much as a loaf of bread ordered. Instead of doing the usual marketing in the morning she had sent Michael out for the things that she needed in the preparation of luncheon, and planned to make up a list of things that she needed for dinner just as soon as her midday duties in the kitchen had set her free. She thought that she would be more...", "...flooded the plains of Germany, the plateaux of Spain, the cities of Italy, and the steppes of Russia, levelling the barriers of castes and creeds, and binding men in a new and solid unity. The reaction against that great centrifugal and international movement had now become centripetal and profoundly national. Thanks to Napoleon's statecraft, the peoples of Europe from the Volga to the Tagus were now embattled in a mighty phalanx, and were about to enter in triumph the city that only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years before had heralded the dawn of their nascent liberties. And what of Napoleon, in part the product and in part the cause, of this strange reaction? By a strange Nemesis, his military genius and his overweening contempt of Schwarzenberg drew him aside at the very time when the allies could strike with deadly effect at the heart of his centralized despotism.

Like a military dictator, Clark closed the land office,--\"Nor will it be opened again until after this expedition.\" Immediately a thousand men enlisted. Logan, Linn, Floyd, Harrod, all followed the banner of Clark. Boone and Kenton set on ahead as guides, into the land they knew so well. \"Is it not dangerous to invade the Shawnee country?\" inquired one. \"I was not born in the woods to be scared by an owl,\" was Clark's sententious reply.

In less than three minutes Don was back again at Powers's desk. He glanced through one of the circulars, which had to do with a certain electric company offering gold bonds at a price to net four and a half. He read it through once and then read it through again. It contained a great many figures--figures running into the millions, whose effect was to make <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars a week shrink into insignificance. On the whole, it was decidedly depressing reading--the more so because he did not understand it. He wondered what Miss Winthrop did when she was tired, where she lived and how she lived, if she played bridge, if she spent her summers abroad, who her parents were, whether she was eighteen or twenty-two or -three, and if she sang. All of which had nothing to do with the affairs of the company that wished to dispose of its gold...", "...Plato's philosophy: There is but one God, and we ought to love and serve him. The Word formed the world and rendered it visible. A knowledge of the Word will make us happy. The soul is immortal, and the dead will rise again. There will be a final judgment; the righteous will be rewarded, and the wicked punished. The design argument, the chief argument relied upon by Christians to prove the divine origin of the universe, is a Platonic argument. In a letter to the author <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years ago, James Parton wrote: \"Read carefully over the dialogue, Phaedo. You will see what you will see: the whole Christian system and the entire dream of the contemplative monk.\" Phaedo deals chiefly with the soul--its nature and destiny.

If people could only realise the amount of time lost by untidiness, I think they would regard the fault with positive horror. Why, Jack Sloven, at the very mildest computation, must have lost half an hour a day. Half an hour a day, at the end of the year, makes a clear working fortnight to the bad, so that in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, if he goes on as he has begun, he will have one year of which it will take him all his time to give an account. But not only does untidiness waste time, and render the person who falls into it a disreputable member of society, but it seriously endangers his success in life. Jack Sloven was naturally a clever fellow. When he could find his books, he made good use of them; none of us could come up to him in translations, and he had the knack of always...", "...since he perceived by it that his people were not all dead. He cast anchor, and threw himself immediately into a skiff with bread and wine, and proceeded to land on one of the islands. Nearly at the same time a boat came alongside with four armed men. Weybehays, who was one of the four, informed him of the massacre, and advised him to return as speedily as possible to his vessel, for that the conspirators designed to surprise him, having already murdered <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> persons, and to attack him with two shallops, adding that he himself had that morning been at close quarters with them. Pelsart perceived at the time the two shallops coming toward him, and had scarcely got on board his vessel before they came alongside. \"He was surprised to see the people covered with embroidery of gold and silver, and weapons in their hands, and demanded of them why they approached the vessel armed. They replied that they...", "...Mr. Reed: Paragon and native stock. A Member: Was that the old Furness Grove? Mr. Reed: Yes, sir.

With the Negro in this weak position, however, there developed in the South a movement to remove from the Republican party the stigma of its connection with the Negro by eliminating the members of that race from the circles of control in the South. This movement has been generally known as a \"Lily-Whiteism.\" For the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, therefore, there have come to the National Republican Conventions from the various Southern States contesting delegations, one white and the other black, each one claiming to be the properly accredited representative of the Republican party in the State concerned. In some States the \"Lily-Whites\" have actually held conventions from which the Negroes were excluded or which they were not permitted to attend. Because of the difficulty of making good their claim as...", "...inside the Stockade, the Raiders had slender picking.

As had been before stated, these boys brought in with them a large portion of their first instalment of veteran bounty--aggregating in amount, according to varying estimates, between <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand and one hundred thousand dollars. The Pilgrims were likewise well clothed, had an abundance of blankets and camp equipage, and a plentiful supply of personal trinkets, that could be readily traded off to the Rebels. An average one of them--even if his money were all gone--was a bonanza to any band which could succeed in plundering him. His watch and chain, shoes, knife, ring, handkerchief, combs and similar trifles, would net several hundred dollars in...", "...then, and then only, would crime really be arrested, when the lamp of knowledge burned in every mechanic's workshop, in every peasant's cottage. The idea was plausible, it was seducing, it was amiable; and held forth the prospect of general improvement of morals from the enlarged culture of mind. The present generation is generally, it may almost be said universally, imbued with these opinions; and the efforts accordingly made for the instruction of the working-classes during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years, have been unprecedented in any former period of our history. What have been the results? Has crime declined in proportion to the spread of education? Are the best instructed classes the least vicious? Has eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge diminished the power of the Tempter? So far from it, the consequences, hitherto at least, have been melancholy and foreboding in the extreme.

One of the most ingenious devices for extorting money that ever came to my attention was invented by a client of mine named Levine --a poor sort of character, to be sure, but cleverer than many a better man. In detail his method was as follows: He first bought at wholesale a large quantity of cheap watches covered with gold plate. To the inexperienced they looked as if they might possibly be worth forty or fifty dollars apiece. They cost Levine about two dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents each. His next step was to select some small shop belonging to a plumber, grocer, or electrician which was ordinarily left in the charge of a clerk while the owner was out attending to his work or securing orders. Levine would find some excuse for entering the shop, engage the clerk in conversation, and having secured his attention would produce one of his watches and extol its merits at length, explaining what a great bargain it was and how--only owing to an...", "...by Pete Hanun; after some inquiry, he came upon the undertaker who had buried Edstrom's wife, and who told him where the old Swede was staying, in the home of a labouring-man nearby. Edstrom greeted him with eager questions: Who had been killed? What was the situation? Hal told in brief sentences what had happened. When he mentioned his need of money, Edstrom answered that he had a little, and would lend it, but it was not enough for a ticket to Western City. Hal asked about the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> dollars which Mary Burke had sent by registered mail; the old man had heard nothing about it, he had not been to the post-office. \"Let's go now!\" said Hal, at once; but as they were starting downstairs, a fresh difficulty occurred to him. Pete Hanun was on the street outside, and it was likely that he had heard about this money from Jeff Cotton; he might hold Edstrom up and take it away. \"Let me suggest something,\" put in the old man. \"Come and see my friend Ed MacKellar....", "...on numbers would be bolder.

Besides trepang, they trade in sharks' fins and birds' nests, the latter being worth about 3000 dollars the picol. (*Footnote.

The total amount of fees paid by stockmen in the year 1907 amounted to $836,920. If the lands were under private control, the fees would be more than double what they now are. In New Mexico, for instance, the usual price for pasturing cattle upon the large land grants is from two dollars to three dollars a year, while on the government forests immediately adjoining the grant, and almost the same country, the fee is only seventy-five cents a year per head and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> cents per head for sheep. And these are the highest fees charged on any national forest for all-the-year-round grazing permits. In Colorado, California, Nevada, and Arizona, the charge for sheep or cattle grazing on the large areas of railroad and State lands is on an average fully twice as great as the same fees upon the national forest, and in the former the stockmen get no other return from the land owners.

The average yearly number of deaths from dementia paralytica according to the Government Statistician's returns between 1908 and 1921 was just under 40. If Fournier's estimate that 3 per cent. of syphilitics ultimately develop dementia paralytica be accepted, one would arrive at the annual infection by multiplying 40 by 33, which gives 1,320. Assuming the average duration of life, after infection, to be twenty-five years, this means that at any given time there are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> years' infections on hand. Dr. Hay computed from this the number of persons in New Zealand now who have, or have had, syphilis to be 1,320 x 25, equalling 33,000, or 1 to every 38 of the population. If the average duration of life after infection were assumed to be thirty years, the figures would be 1 to every 32 of the population. Taking the figure for syphilitic infections over a period of years at 1,320 per annum, this would mean for the population of New Zealand...", "...this much, however, it was but a moment's work to clamber out upon the roof in the pouring rain and replace the door. \"Py shimminy, dot vas a hard storm,\" he soliloquized. \"Der ocean grunts as uff she vas got der dispeppersy.

The great march had ended triumphantly on December 21. \"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift,\" wrote Sherman to Lincoln, \"the city of Savannah with a hundred and fifty-nine heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand bales of cotton.\" This news followed hard on the news of another victory. For on December 15th and 16th the Federals under General George H. Thomas had fought a great battle at Nashville, Tennessee, in which the Confederates had been defeated. By this battle their strength beyond the Alleghenies was practically crushed, so as the year 1864 closed, the hopes of the Federals rose high. Early in 1865 still another victory was recorded in the taking of Fort...", "...nigger Oh grandmammy Knock me down with the old fence rider, Ask that pretty gal let me court her Young gal, come blow the coal.' \"When I was twenty-one I was sold to the speculator and sent to Texas.

In 1901 the street still suggested the time when it had been lined by the dull, monotonous high stoops.

But property holders were awake to their opportunities. Inside lots twenty-five by one hundred feet on the Avenue were held at one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> thousand dollars, and corner lots correspondingly higher. Within two years these prices had doubled and trebled.

In 1700 the population numbered less than 20,000, from 12,000 to 15,000 being in Pennsylvania which included Delaware. The interior of West New Jersey was unoccupied, the population remaining close to the coast. From Barnegat to Cape May the settled area was about ten miles wide. Along the eastern shore of the bay and river the population belt widened to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty miles. In Pennsylvania and Delaware the settled area was continuous from the mouth of the Lehigh River to the southern boundary of Delaware. Back from the river the habitations extended for forty or fifty miles, but on the bay shore none of the settlers were more than ten or fifteen miles inland. The population of the Delaware region was composed of many nationalities. West New Jersey contained many English, but the descendants of the early Swedish and Dutch...", "...lady of a noble and free air and extremely beautiful coming towards me, my eyes were taken off from beholding any other object but her alone.

[Illustration: CORN] The United States is the chief producer of corn, and from an area of 80,000,000 acres--about that of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois combined--more than two billion bushels, or four-fifths of the world's crop, are produced. In the past few years the area planted with corn has not materially increased, and it is likely to be lessened rather than increased in the future. From the same acreage, however, the annual yield, now about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> or thirty bushels per acre, can be more than doubled by the use of more skilful methods of cultivation. Corn contains more fatty substance, or natural oil, than wheat, and therefore has a greater heating power. For this reason it is better than wheat for out-of-door workers, and it is almost the only cereal food-stuff consumed in Spanish America. It is also a staple food-stuff in Egypt. Corn has been used as a bread-stuff in the United States, Italy, and Rumania[30] for a...", "...Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c. 6 Dates (these were collected at Toser, and brought from Nefta and the surrounding districts) 500 ---- Total 529 It is impossible, with this statement before us, to make out any exact calculation of the amount of tribute.

A near-sighted man, shooting a pistol full arm stretch, without his glasses, sees his back sight a blur and his front probably not at all, and the target like a post impressionist picture. If he puts on glasses to see his hind sight properly, his front sight will not be distinct, and the target still more indistinct. I think for a near-sighted man it is best to have glasses made so that he can see his front sight very clearly. Then he would see the man target at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> meters quite well enough to be able to hit it. It is not necessary for him to see his back sight distinctly. A good pistol-shot does not focus his eyes on his back sight. That comes in line by itself when he gets into the mechanical lift of his arm.

The hall-door was quickly broken down, the wild band of assassins rushed in, and, after despatching their victims, there was a fierce chorus of gratified vengeance, each man boasting of his share in the bloody deed--d'Alfaro especially, who shouted \"_Va be, esta be_,\" and claimed that his mace had done its full duty in the murderous work....", "...cold winter, after going over all that his predecessors had done, after carrying the _Forward_ beyond the seas which were already known, in short, after completing half his task, he saw his grand plans completely overthrown.

He may spend it, if he will, and get all the gratification that a dollar and a quarter can bring.

Between sixty and seventy Eggs have been found in one nest; each is equal to twenty-four Eggs of the domestic hen, and holds five pints and a quarter of liquid. The shells are dirty white. The...", "...least in England, where Marlowe translated his _Amores_, and Shakespeare, during the early years of his literary activity, was greatly indebted to him (see, e.g., Sidney Lee, \"Ovid and Shakespeare's Sonnets,\" _Quarterly Review_, Ap., 1909). [381] This has already been discussed in Chapter II. [382] By the age of twenty-five, as G. Hirth remarks (_Wege zur Heimat_, p. 541), an energetic and sexually disposed man in a large city has, for the most part, already had relations with some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> women, perhaps even as many as fifty, while a well-bred and cultivated woman at that age is still only beginning to realize the slowly summating excitations of sex. [383] In his study of \"Conjugal Aversion\" (_Journal Nervous and Mental Disease_, Sept., 1892) Smith Baker points out the value of adequate sexual knowledge before marriage in lessening the risks of such aversion. [384] \"It may be said to the honor of men,\" Adler truly remarks (op. cit., p. 182), \"that it is...", "...sweep of boulevards and statelier buildings in the distance. She looked up and followed his eyes. \"Don't you like my view?\" she asked. \"One misses the roar of London. Do you notice how much shriller and less persistent all the noises are? Yet it has its own inspiration, hasn't it?\" \"Without a doubt,\" Julien answered. \"Of course, you can guess what I came for?\" \"If it were to ask me to lunch,\" she said, composedly threading her needle, \"I am sorry, but I can't come. I have to make <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> of these bows and I am rather slow at it.\" \"Luncheon might have followed as an after-thought,\" he replied. \"My real mission was to suggest that you should marry me.\" Lady Anne's fingers paused for a moment in the air. She sat quite still. Her eyes were half closed. There was a curious little quiver at her heart, a little throb in her ears. On the whole, however, she kept her self-control marvelously. \"Whatever put that into your head?\" she inquired, going on with...", "...him to give. Those arms he expected to receive, barring the dangers of the sea, and of the enemy, which obstacles alone prevented the \"positive assurance that they would be received at all.\" It was, as stated, with deep regret and bitter disappointment that I found, notwithstanding our diligent efforts to reenforce this army before and after the battle of Manassas, that its strength had but little increased, and that the arms of absentees and discharged men were represented by only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> hundred on hand. I can not suppose that General Johnston could have noticed the statement that his request for conference had set forth the object of it to be to discuss the question of reenforcement. He would have known that in Richmond, where all the returns were to be found, any consideration of reenforcement, by the withdrawal of troops from existing garrisons, could best be decided. Very little experience or a fair amount of modesty without any experience would serve...", "...through these, or step from boulder to boulder. Only very rarely did we get a little rubbly clear space to walk in, and then for only ten or twenty feet. We tried in spaced intervals to cover the whole hillside. It was very hard work. The boys, with the horses, kept pace with us on the sky-line atop, and two or three hundred yards away. We had proceeded in this fashion for about a mile, when suddenly, and most unexpectedly, the biggest lion I ever saw leapt straight up from a bush <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> yards in front of me, and with a tremendous roar vanished behind another bush. I had just time to throw up the.405 shotgun-fashion and let drive a snapshot. Clifford Hill, who was ten yards to my right, saw the fur fly, and we all heard the snarl as the bullet hit. Naturally we expected an instant charge, but, as things turned out, it was evident the lion had not seen us at all. He had leapt at the sight of our men and horses on the sky-line, and when the bullet hit he must...", "...That was his usual policy in war. He never left any chance for newspaper controversies about who won the battle. He made this valley, so quiet now, a reeking slaughter-pen. Somewhere in this part of the country--I do not know exactly where --Israel fought another bloody battle a hundred years later. Deborah, the prophetess, told Barak to take ten thousand men and sally forth against another King Jabin who had been doing something. Barak came down from Mount Tabor, twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-five</span> miles from here, and gave battle to Jabin's forces, who were in command of Sisera. Barak won the fight, and while he was making the victory complete by the usual method of exterminating the remnant of the defeated host, Sisera fled away on foot, and when he was nearly exhausted by fatigue and thirst, one Jael, a woman he seems to have been acquainted with, invited him to come into her tent and rest himself. The weary soldier acceded readily enough, and Jael put him to..."]
