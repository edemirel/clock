The Spaniards rushed out suddenly, and the Peruvians, astonished and defenceless, were cut down in hundreds. Pizarro himself seized the Inca, and in endeavouring to preserve him alive, received, accidentally, on his hand the only wound inflicted that day on a Spaniard.

These weights were added gradually, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> the specimen gave way. The accuracy of this mode of measuring the pressure was tested by direct loading of the ram with rails, which was repeated several times during the course of the experiments, so as to guard against any change in the amount of friction of the press.

He lived in a commercial age, an age that seemed to him blind to the beauty of the world; and the purpose of his whole life was, as he said, to help those who, having eyes, see not. His aim was high, his effort heroic; but for all his pains he was called a visionary, a man with a dream book. Yet he was always exact and specific.

But the case is different in the other life: there, no one is allowed to speak one way and think another. There, also, the variance is clearly perceived in each single expression, and when it is perceived, the spirit in whom there is such variance is expelled from society, and punished. He is afterwards by various methods brought to speak as he thinks, and to think as he wills, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> his mind is one, and not divided. If he is good, he is brought to will good, and to think and speak the truth from good; and if he is evil, he is brought to will evil, and to think and speak falsity from evil. Until this is effected, a good spirit is not raised into heaven, nor an evil one cast into hell: and the object of this is, that in hell there may be nothing but evil and the falsity of evil, and in heaven nothing but good and the truth of good.

He proposed to keep out of sight <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> night, and then make a visit to the store. It would go hard with him if he did not make a raise there either in the shape of money or articles of value. He came to a cabin standing by itself, at a considerable distance from the homes of the other miners. Sitting in front of it was a man with grizzled beard whose appearance indicated advanced age.

Then one morning she missed him altogether, having mistaken for him another youth, whom she followed and then found with bitter anguish to be not her boy.

Two years later he played a solo before the Prince Esterhazy, which his father had written specially for him with this object in view. At eight years of age he made a tour, accompanied by his father, and performed at concerts favourably in Vienna, Presburg, Dresden, and Berlin. On his return, the young Kraft sought to fill up the gaps in his general education, which, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> then, had been neglected, and this took up five years. During the time he only occupied himself with his instrument as a recreation. In 1796 he entered with his father into the Lobkowitz band. The prince, who took a great interest in the youth, and cherished the wish that he should cultivate still further his art, granted him the means of going through a course with Louis Duport at Berlin. This happened in the year 1801.

The writer of the _Blackwood_ papers signed himself Z.

This is a psychic inhibition independent of any disturbance due to the process of prevention. She knows other women who are similarly affected. Such an inhibition must be regarded as artificial and abnormal, since the final result of sexual intercourse, under natural and normal conditions, forms no essential constituent of the psychic process of intercourse. As a result of the fact that in women the sexual emotions tend not to develop great intensity <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> submitted to powerful stimulation, we find that the maximum climax of sexual emotion tends to fall somewhat later in a woman's life than in a man's. Among animals generally there appears to be frequently traceable a tendency for the sexual activities of the male to develop at a somewhat earlier age than those of the female. In the human, species we may certainly trace the same tendency.

The revival and extension of mining in...", "...if we but wait with patience.\" Rayel made no answer, and for some moments we both sat looking at the glowing embers in silence. \"I shall obey your wish,\" he said presently; \"I cannot do otherwise. I am like a child, and must look to you for instruction in all things.

We sat discussing our plans for the future <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> near midnight. When we went to bed at last, Rayel looked happier than I had seen him before since my recovery at the hospital. When I awoke it was near midday. I went to call Rayel and found that he was gone.

Alarmed at his continued absence I went at once to Hester's apartments, scarcely expecting, however, to find...", "...followed by Alexander the Great and Baber; but it has now been supplanted by the Khyber. LAGOON (Fr. _lagune_, Lat. _lacuna_, a pool), a term applied to (1) a sheet of salt or brackish water near the sea, (2) a sheet of fresh water of no great depth or extent, (3) the expanse of smooth water enclosed by an atoll. Sea lagoons are formed only where the shores are low and protected from wave action. Under these conditions a bar may be raised above sea-level or a spit may grow <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> its end touches the land. The enclosed shallow water is then isolated in a wide stretch, the seaward banks broaden, and the lagoon becomes a permanent area of still shallow water with peculiar faunal features. In the old lake plains of Australia there are occasional wide and shallow depressions where water collects permanently. Large numbers of aquatic birds, black swans, wild duck, teal, migrant spoon-bills or pelicans, resort to these fresh-water lagoons. LAGOS, the...", "...things seemed to develop pretty quickly. In the following two or three days a good deal happened. On the night of the day on which the Skipper had sent me away from the wheel, it was our watch on deck from eight o' clock to twelve, and my look-out from ten to twelve. As I paced slowly to and fro across the fo'cas'le head, I was thinking about the affair of the morning. At first, my thoughts were about the Old Man. I cursed him thoroughly to myself, for being a pig-headed old fool, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> it occurred to me that if I had been in his place, and come on deck to find the ship almost aback, and the fellow at the wheel staring out across the sea, instead of attending to his business, I should most certainly have kicked up a thundering row. And then, I had been an ass to tell him about the ship. I should never have done such a thing, if I had not been a bit adrift. Most likely the old chap thought I was cracked. I ceased to bother my head about him, and fell to...", "...you get away,\" came firmly from Andy. \"Let's tie his hands behind him and make him a prisoner,\" suggested his twin, and this the two boys proceeded to do, using some skate straps for that purpose. In the meanwhile, Slugger attempted to draw a pistol, but was promptly hurled back by Jack and Fred. Then Mr. Powell disarmed the youth, and he, too, was made a prisoner. \"You'll catch it for treating us this way!\" growled Slugger, when he realized that he could do no more. \"Just wait <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> my father hears of this!\" \"And just you wait, Slugger, until Mr. Stevenson gets here,\" retorted Jack, and this answer made the bully turn pale. Now that the two rascals had been captured, the Rover boys felt very much elated, the more so since they had recovered Uncle Barney's treasure box without the contents having been disturbed. \"Won't he be glad!\" murmured Fred, as he looked the box over. \"Let's go out and see if we can't signal to him in some way,\" returned...", "...life might be taken to save him from dying by an ignoble hand.

No strategy could now be of avail, and, in the effort of despair, Richard made the final charge upon his rival. Descrying Richmond, he put spurs to his horse, and with lance in rest rushed towards him, when, in the nick of time, Sir William Stanley, \"with three thousand tall men,\" closed in and Richard fell overpowered, with wounds enough to have let out...", "...well, I believed; but he still kept silent and made no move.

He struck ruthlessly, mercilessly, it may be said, in cold blood, innocent women and children; but the system of which he was the victim had less mercy in subjecting his race to the horrors of the \"middle passages\" and the endless crimes against justice, humanity and virtue, then perpetrated throughout America. The brutality of his onslaught was a reflex of slavery, the object lesson which he gave brought the question home to every fireside <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> public conscience, once callous, became quickened and slavery was doomed.

The chief difficulty in reconciling this belief with the actual occurrence was the odd behaviour of the animal. Why had it gone up the gorge, apparently _parenti passu_, to come tumbling down again in such a confused fashion? Why was it still kicking and stumbling about at the bottom of the ravine--for such did the sounds proclaim it to be doing? No answer could be given to either of these questions; and none was given, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> day dawned over the sand-hills. This was soon after; and along with the morning light had come the cessation of the simoom. Then saw the castaways that creature that had so abruptly awakened them from their slumbers, and, by so doing, perhaps, saved their lives. They saw it recumbent at the bottom of the gorge, where they had so uneasily passed the night. It proved to be, what, from the slight glimpse they got of it, they were inclined to believe, an animal, and a...", "...I got my own share of parting good-wishes, as we shook hands all round, not at all disturbed in the process by the sudden slamming of the drawing-room door and the violent ringing of a bell. Satisfactory as it all was from one point of view, I congratulated myself upon having contrived to spare Lilian this scene, as well as the final good-bye to the home that ought to have been her own. I turned from the main road and walked slowly down across the fields at the back of Fairview <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> I reached the stile at the end of the lane. Then seating myself upon the cross step, I yielded to a little sentiment, telling myself that there must be no such indulgence at the cottage for some time to come. We needed our full share of common-sense to keep the atmosphere healthy. It was all very well trying to assume philosophic airs about wealth; it did very well in my own case, for instance; but I really could not see that it was better for Lilian to lose her large...", "...something which she knew in an instant to be unique, tore across it.... * * * * * Then she saw, and understood.... CHAPTER V I Oliver had passed the days since Mabel's disappearance in an indescribable horror. He had done all that was possible: he had traced her to the station and to Victoria, where he lost her clue; he had communicated with the police, and the official answer, telling him nothing, had arrived to the effect that there was no news: and it was not <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> the Tuesday following her disappearance that Mr. Francis, hearing by chance of his trouble, informed him by telephone that he had spoken with her on the Friday night. But there was no satisfaction to be got from him--indeed, the news was bad rather than good, for Oliver could not but be dismayed at the report of the conversation, in spite of Mr. Francis's assurances that Mrs. Brand had shown no kind of inclination to defend the Christian cause. Two theories gradually emerged,...", "...wished to take them with him, but mother declined to give them up; she thought it would be disrespect to Marian's memory to give her private correspondence up to a stranger, and so she told him.

But mother always believed they held the key to the discovery of the guilty party; and afterward she left them to me, with the charge that I should never suffer them to pass from my possession <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> they had fulfilled their destiny of witnessing against the murderer--for whatever Mr. Willcoxen might think, mother felt convinced that the writer of those letters and the murderer of Marian was the same person.\" \"Tell me more about those letters.\" \"Dear Paul, I know nothing more about them; I told you that I was not sufficiently familiar with the French language to read them.\" \"But it is strange that you never made yourself acquainted with their contents by getting some...", "...as for the boys who had talked of the children's fur-clad saint for a month past. But by the next morning, Jean's inspiration had come. As soon as her work was done, she shut herself into her room and ransacked her few small stores. At least the boys should not be disappointed she thought, as she selected this treasure and that from the meagre number which she had hoarded with such care. A little planning and contriving changed them to fit the present need, and Jean had put them away <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> Christmas eve with the happy certainty that, at any rate, the toes of the stockings would bulge a little, even if the legs hung empty and lean. But now it was the morning of Christmas eve, and breakfast was waiting until Jean should get it ready, so she sprang up and hastily dressed herself. Then, with her cheeks glowing from the shock of the icy water, and her fingers aching with cold, she ran across the hall to rouse the boys. But they were sitting up in bed, calling back...", "...\"I remember Larry told me once,\" she said. \"That's the spot,\" said Nora. \"But don't look around now.

She was too inexperienced to know what that little stir that moved the stillness meant. The door of the jury-room was thrown open by the deputy-sheriff, and the jury filed into the court, and stood in a group near the bench. All hearts stood still. The face of the venerable judge turned a shade paler. The clerk of arraigns arose, and addressing the jury, inquired: \"Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?\" \"We...", "...from this irksome life, and set at liberty next Saturday.

Here the Soudanese were joined by the irregulars who had first crossed, and a terrible fire was maintained, from the sand hills, upon the crowded mass on the bare sand, cut off from all retreat by the deep river. Some tried to swim across, to join their friends on the west bank. A few succeeded in doing so, among them the Emir who had given battle to Colonel Parsons' force, near Gedareh.

One of the most remarkable cases on record of combined knavery, credulity, and superstition, is the belief which so extensively prevailed about fifty years ago in the mission and doctrines of Joanna Southcott, and of which, strange to say, some traces remain even to the present day. Is it not astonishing that so recently as the year 1814, August 3rd, the following...", "...Mazeau's,\" the king answered, turning to the person he named; \"and leave to-morrow about noon by St. Martin's gate.

Henry had risen and was bidding farewell to one and another; <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> no more than four or five beside Toussaint and La Noue remained with him. Then he prepared himself to go, and girt on his sword, talking earnestly the while. Still engaged in low converse with one of the strangers, he walked slowly, lighted by his host to the door; he had forgotten to take leave of the girl. In another minute he and they would have disappeared in the passage, when a hoarse sound escaped from Madeline's lips.

He insisted that he could walk in a few moments, but the others would not hear of it, for no sooner did he try to rise than he fell back again weak and dizzy. It was decided that he should lie upon a long sled and be drawn by the three men in turn, at least for an hour or two, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> he recovered more fully. In this manner, therefore, they started at once to retrace their steps, Mr. Bradford taking the first turn at drawing his disabled son.

He liked his old home. And he liked grasshoppers and cutworms, too. So he stayed <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> October. And the strange part of it was that he never once discovered that Farmer Green had planted tarred corn only in a border around the field. Inside that border the corn was of the good, old yellow kind that Mr. Crow liked. And so, for once, Farmer Green out-witted old Mr. Crow. By the end of the summer his corn had grown so tall and borne so many big ears that Farmer Green took some of it to the county fair.

But when a mistress came into the house, Raicharan found two masters instead of one. All his former influence passed to the new mistress. This was compensated by a fresh arrival. Anukul had a son born to him and Raicharan by his unsparing attentions soon got a complete hold over the child.

In some cases variants of the same law are found in different groups. Certain of these laws simply reiterate in slightly different form those already found in the primitive and Deuteronomic codes; but in general they supplement these earlier codes. The formulation, collection, and codification of these later laws apparently continued <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> toward the latter part of the Persian period when the Samaritan schism (Section CIII) fixed them in their present form. To these laws was prefixed, as an introduction, the priestly history that opens with the account of creation in the first chapter of Genesis and briefly traces Israel's history to the settlement in Canaan. The interest of these late priestly historians is, like that of the Chronicler, in the origin of institutions. Thus the object of the first chapter of...", "...After a long flight, he came in sight of Sledge Island. Owl thought he would go there. When far out at sea, he became very tired. He could hardly reach the shore. As he rested on a piece of driftwood on the sand, two men passed along the shore. Owl thought for a while. Then he said, \"I will be a Man.\" At once he became a fine-looking young man, but he had no clothing. Night came on and the air became cool. Man sat down with his back against the piece of driftwood and slept there <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> morning. When the sun arose he awakened. He felt lame and stiff from the cold night air. Looking about him, Man found some grass which he wove into a loose robe, which helped to keep out the cold. Suddenly he saw reindeer near him. He crept on hands and knees close to one, seized it by the horns and broke its neck with a single effort. He carried the reindeer on his back to his sleeping place. He felt all over the reindeer's body but its skin was too thick for his fingers to...", "...the papers in the War Series will be largely devoted to THE PENINSULAR CAMPAIGN BY GEN. G.B.

General McClellan will contribute two papers, the first of a general nature on the Peninsular Campaign, and the second (to appear later) on the battle of Antietam, thus covering the period of his command of the Army of the Potomac. General Joseph E. Johnston, who commanded the entire Confederate forces opposed to McClellan in the Peninsular engagements <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> the battle of Seven Pines, when in consequence of a wound he was succeeded by General Lee, will cover, in his papers, the period from Manassas to Seven Pines, dealing with both battles, and with his relations and differences with the President of the Confederacy.

As we followed it north we began to encounter the dreaded sea-fogs. Day after day the boats lowered and were swallowed up almost ere they touched the water, while we on board pumped the horn at regular intervals and every fifteen minutes fired the bomb gun. Boats were continually being lost and found, it being the custom for a boat to hunt, on lay, with whatever schooner picked it up, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> such time it was recovered by its own schooner. But Wolf Larsen, as was to be expected, being a boat short, took possession of the first stray one and compelled its men to hunt with the _Ghost_, not permitting them to return to their own schooner when we sighted it.

Where the engine and dynamo are on different levels, and the latter is a fixture, recourse must be had to a roller, bearing against the upper part of the belt and capable of screw adjustment. If link leather belting is used, it will be found necessary to take out several rows of links each day <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> it has finished stretching. A very handy thing to use for this purpose, and which can be made on board by an engineer, is a double clamp with a screw in between, just like the ones which are being sold for stretching trousers which have got baggy at the knees. Whatever belt is used, it is very important that there should be no joint or inequality which can cause a jump or slip when going over the pulley, as this will cause the lights to pulsate each time.

As I watched, the light flared up as though it were...", "...I cried at a time when I was unable to take myself thither and G. said he was too busy to take me. \"Not for one day?\" I implored. \"What's the use of wearing yourself out with those two long journeys, and spending five or six pounds, for one day?\" he asked.

But he did not love the less that he had to content himself, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> the kingdom should come nearer, with loving at a more conscious distance; by loving kindness and truth he continued doing all he could to bring the kingdom whose end is unity. Hence he had come to restrain his manner--nothing could have constrained his manners, which now from the conventional point of view were irreproachable; but if he did not so often execute a wild dance, or stand upon one leg, the glow in his eyes had deepened, and his response to any advance was as ready...", "...grape held locally in much esteem. At the vintage, which commences towards the end of October and lasts until the middle of the following month, all the rotten or unripe grapes are carefully set aside, and the sound ones only submitted to the action of a screw-press.

The produce of this double operation is poured into a vat termed a _sapine_, where it remains <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> bubbles are seen escaping through the _chapeau_ that forms on the surface of the liquid. The must is then drawn off--sometimes after being fined--into casks, which the majority of wine-growers previously impregnate with the fumes of sulphur.

When the pheasant is eaten only three days after its death, it has no peculiarity; it has not the flavor of a pullet, nor the perfume of a quail.

It is especially good when the pheasant begins to be decomposed-- an aroma and exciting oil is then produced, like coffee, only produced by torrefaction.

As early as 1639 people had begun to complain that too much power was rested in the discretion of the magistrate, and they clamoured for a code of laws; but as Winthrop says, the magistrates and ministers were \"not very forward in this matter,\" for they preferred to supplement the common law of England by decisions based on the Old Testament rather than by a body of statutes. It was not <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> 1649, after a persistent struggle, that the deputies won a decisive victory over the assistants and secured for Massachusetts a definite code of laws. In the New Haven colony similar theocratic notions led the settlers to dispense with trial by jury because they could find no precedent for it in the laws of Moses.

Now I will explain the methods used to separate copper from gold[24]. The salt which we call _sal-artificiosus_,[25] is made from a _libra_ each of vitriol, alum, saltpetre, and sulphur not exposed to the fire, and half a _libra_ of sal-ammoniac; these ingredients when crushed are heated with one part of lye made from the ashes used by wool dyers, one part of unslaked lime, and four parts of beech ashes. The ingredients are boiled in the lye <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> the whole has been dissolved. Then it is immediately dried and kept in a hot place, lest it turn into oil; and afterward when crushed, a _libra_ of lead-ash is mixed with it. With each _libra_ of this powdered compound one and a half _unciae_ of the copper is gradually sprinkled into a hot crucible, and it is stirred rapidly and frequently with an iron rod. When the crucible has cooled and been broken up, the button of gold is found.

Indeed, an ethical theory of the wages law is necessary only to achieve a further conclusion: (3) Since the 'laws of exchange value' determine the wage, an advance in labour productivity must bring about an ever declining share in the product for the workers. Here we have arrived at the Archimedean fulcrum of Rodbertus' system. This 'declining wage rate' is his most important 'original' discovery on which he harps from his first writings on social problems (probably in 1839) <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> his death, and which he 'claims' as his very own. This conception, for all that, was but a simple corollary of Ricardo's theory of value and is contained implicit in the wages fund theory which dominated bourgeois economics up to the publication of Marx's _Capital_. Rodbertus nevertheless believed that this 'discovery' made him a kind of Galileo in economics, and he refers to his 'declining wage rate' as explaining every evil and contradiction in capitalist economy. Above all, he...", "...took him to Powhatan.

My first eight weeks in Vienna were spent in learning, first, to control position and condition of hands and arms according to the law of balance; secondly, to direct each motion with the utmost accuracy and speed.

Gertrude took a niggardly pinch of dough, and began to roll it into a bannock; but as she rolled, it grew, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> she put it aside as too large to give away, and took a still smaller pinch. This also grew miraculously, and was put aside. The same thing happened a third time, till she said, 'I cannot roll you a small bannock.'

Explanation--In the note to II. xviii. we showed the reason, why the mind, from the contemplation of one thing, straightway falls to the contemplation of another thing, namely, because the images of the two things are so associated and arranged, that one follows the other. This state of association is impossible, if the image of the thing be new; the mind will then be at a stand in the contemplation thereof, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> it is determined by other causes to think of something else. Thus the conception of a new object, considered in itself, is of the same nature as other conceptions; hence, I do not include wonder among the emotions, nor do I see why I should so include it, inasmuch as this distraction of the mind arises from no positive cause drawing away the mind from other objects, but merely from the absence of a cause, which should determine the mind to pass from the contemplation of one...", "...subtlety of his intelligence.

Even then he hesitated for he knew the shock it would cause the gentle one, who was devotedly attached to her father.

When God caused a famine to descend upon the whole world, Joseph sent for his father, and he brought him down into Egypt his father, his brethren, and all his father's household, and he supplied them with food without pay or reward, while he acquired Egypt, and made slaves of all its inhabitants. \"Now, therefore, my lord king,...", "...She insisted, and I insisted; but at last we compromised.

Day after day he begged about the streets, and his inside rumbled for want of food; he had no clothes to his back.

That night we sat up <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> a late hour, and talked of all the strange actions of those in power, and made surmises as to what the next move should be; but even our most pessimistic predictions fell far short of the reality.

When one thinks of it, a whole socialistic system lies in that suggestion.'

The way has been broken, and all good men acknowledge that the heroism of the missionary woman is grand and sublime. The decision made by Harriet Atwood was different from that made by others in after years, inasmuch as she had no example, no pattern.

Ralph had grown a trifle uneasy. If the lawyer did not put in an appearance, it was difficult to foresee how affairs would turn out. He did not rely much on Bartlett's Winchester or the brawny fists of the tramp.

In all her work <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> her sixteenth year Vere had consulted her mother. Nothing of her child till then was ever hidden from Hermione, except those things which the human being cannot reveal, and sometimes scarcely knows of.

It was a wild place; the rocks rose to a sheer height of two or three hundred feet above our heads, broken into a variety of fantastic forms. In one place there was a cleft in the rock, out of which the water flowed into the main stream. The lieutenant, who was fond of fishing, was soon absorbed...", "...paramount.

It was not <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> she read it again together with Smaltz's confession, that it came to her clearly.

It was commonly understood in the town of Rockland that Dudley Venner had had a great deal of trouble with that daughter of his, so handsome, yet so peculiar, about whom there were so many strange stories. There was no end to the tales which were told of her extraordinary doings. Yet her name was never coupled with that of any youth or man, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> this cousin had provoked remark by his visit; and even then it was oftener in the shape of wondering conjectures whether he would dare to make love to her, than in any pretended knowledge of their relations to each other, that the public tongue exercised its village-prerogative of tattle. The more common version of the trouble at the mansion-house was this: Elsie was not exactly in her right mind. Her temper was singular, her tastes were anomalous, her habits were lawless, her...", "...known as the Arkansas, or Western, Cherokee. The emigrants soon became involved in difficulties with the native tribes, the Osage claiming all the lands north of Arkansas river, while the Quapaw claimed those on the south. Upon complaining to the government the emigrant Cherokee were told that they had originally been permitted to remove only on condition of a cession of a portion of their eastern territory, and that nothing could be done to protect them in their new western home <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> such cession had been carried out. The body of the Cherokee Nation, however, was strongly opposed to any such sale and proposed that the emigrants should be compelled to return. After protracted negotiation a treaty was concluded at the Cherokee agency (now Calhoun, Tennessee) on July 8, 1817, by which the Cherokee Nation ceded two considerable tracts--the first in Georgia, lying east of the Chattahoochee, and the other in Tennessee, between Waldens ridge and the Little...", "...Moliere, in which shepherds and shepherdesses are introduced in court dress, you will have a very accurate conception of the general spirit of the age.[37] It was in such a state of society that the landscape of Claude, Gaspar Poussin, and Salvator Rosa attained its reputation.

The reputation thus gained survived unimpaired almost into the present century, <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> Wordsworth in poetry and Turner in painting led the return to nature, and the modern school of landscape arose. It is, however, the art of Constable to which direct influence must be attributed in the foundation of the modern school of landscape--_paysage intime_--in France (see Vol. II., pp. 93-4). Of this school, wholly unrepresented until lately in our National Gallery, a few examples--characteristic, if not very important--may now be seen in Room XVII.

Turning angrily round, with his revolver half raised, Kenyon saw the spy standing on the very edge of the parapet of rock, with his hands at liberty, and in the act of drawing the gag from his mouth. On seeing Kenyon turn, the Zanzibari doubtless thought he was himself about to be shot, and impelled by rage and fear, he sprang...", "...her feet and wiping the cream from her eyes, and nose, and ears.

He had driven over from Montrose with the partnership papers for Strout, Hiram, and Quincy to sign and also the will of the late Mrs. Hepsibeth Putnam. As he came into the kitchen he espied Mandy, and a broad smile spread over his face as he said, \"Good morning, Miss Skinner, was that paper all right?\" Mandy flushed...", "...rose once more.

The President replied that he had no instructions, that the decisions could wait <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> he returned, though the hearings could proceed and reports could be made during his absence. Astonished as I was at this wish to delay these matters, I suggested to him the subjects which I thought ought to go into the Treaty.

ALFRED DE VIGNY The reputation of Alfred de Vigny has endured extraordinary vicissitudes in France.

The supremacy of Victor Hugo has been, if not questioned, at least mitigated; other poets have recovered from their obscurity.

Pretending or professing to repent without turning away from our sins and abandoning them is, as some one has said, like trying to pump the water out of a boat without stopping the leaks.

It is true that we knew the plan of campaign set forth by Gen.

Hence it is that the three Evangelists, without giving any of the details which were afterwards supplied by St. John, sum up the closing months of the forerunner's ministry in the one fact which suggests all, that John was silenced, and shut up in prison.

His only daughter married Mr Farrance, and was lost in the Indian seas on board the ship from which you saved Mary and Tom.

In 1867 Judge Cyrus Olney, who had succeeded to the claim of John McClure, formulated a plan to dispose of a part of this property at a uniform price per lot.

In order to ascertain how far it might be possible for a bar of the size causing the injury to traverse the skull in the track assigned to it, Bigelow procured a common skull in which the zygomatic arches were barely visible from above, and having entered a drill near the left angle of the inferior maxilla, he passed it obliquely upward to the median line of the cranium just in front of the junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures.

Then, as suddenly as Dr. Crane had inserted his bill in the throat, he withdrew it. But Dr. Crane had accomplished his purpose. The tickling in the throat had started Bumper to vomiting, and all his dinner, including the poisonous plant, came up with a rush. It made him weak and faint, but the pain in his stomach was relieved, and when he was through he looked up and said faintly: \"Thank you, Dr. Crane, I feel much...", "...come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a betrayal was imminent.

Bailey and Harrison (1948:125-130) found that young channel catfish in the Des Moines River, Iowa, fed almost exclusively on aquatic insect larvae. My observations indicate that this is true in the Neosho and Marais des Cygnes rivers also. Young produced in 1958 in the Neosho River attained an average total length of three inches by 26 August, and young produced in 1959 attained an average size of 3.5 inches by 11 September. Both groups probably continued growth <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> October, and may have averaged four inches total length at that time. The 1958 and 1959 year-classes were much less abundant than were the 1957 young. Therefore, it seems likely that the growth of the 1957 young in the Neosho River was depressed because of crowding. The 1959 year-class was larger than the small 1958 year-class, thus conforming to a general expectation that strong year-classes will be followed by weak year-classes.

Henceforth we are friends in life <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> death.' I answered, that I owed him as much. The duke has done everything that was right. He might have said nothing at all, or contented himself with saying that I had not the cough; but to affirm that I never could have one was a very delicate proceeding on his part.\" \"This is what I call courage well employed.

The reason the males do this is perhaps evident enough, for at a certain date the flowers upon whose sweets the birds largely subsist begin to grow scant, and so if they remained there would not be enough for all.

At break of day, in spite of the cold, they will gather in large flocks at some spring to drink and bathe. Doctor Merriam says about them at such times: \"They were like swarms of bees, buzzing about one's head and darting to and fro in every direction. The air was full of them. They would drop down to the water, dip their feet and bellies, and rise and shoot away as if...", "...between brown foothills, a stretch of rolling prairie land, black and green and gold, and in the distance the hazy, snow-covered summits of far away mountains.

Every power-loom weaver detected absenting himself at another time, while the machinery is in motion, forfeits for each hour and each loom, 3d. Every person who leaves the room during working-hours, without obtaining permission from the overlooker, forfeits 3d. 3. Weavers who fail to supply themselves with scissors forfeit, per day, 1d. 4.

The wind blows violently, and soon the poor little boy sleeps quietly. A frightful noise awakens him. Jack starts up and sees something monstrous--a howling, snorting beast, with two fiery eyes that send forth a shower of sparks. The creature dashed past, leaving behind him a train like a comet's tail. A grove of trees, quite unsuspected by Jack, suddenly flashed out clearly; each leaf could have been counted. Not <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> this apparition was far away, and nothing of it was visible save a small green light, did Jack know that it was the express train. What time was it? How long had he slept? He knew not, but he felt ill and stiff in every limb. He had dreamed of Madou,--dreamed that they lay side by side in the cemetery; he saw Madou's face, and shivered at the thought of the little icy fingers touching his own. To get away from this idea Jack resumed his weary journey. The damp earth had...", "...\"Just this, Douglas--I do not intend to leave my sister unprotected as I was.

But this traverse is not common. Any persons are eligible for asking presentments; but it is usually done only by resident gentlemen, agents, clergy, or respectable tenantry.

She was thinking of what Jim Colter would say when he learned of their adoption of Olive. She knew that Jim was troubled about something; had the ranch girls any right to offer a home to any one when their own future was so uncertain? But Jack's lips closed firmly. \"Never mind, Olive,\" she answered. \"We won't worry over things <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> they happen, when they do we will face them the best we can.\" Rainbow Lodge had never looked more dear and homelike than it did when the four ranch girls arrived before its open front door. Jim had sent one of the cowboys to drive them home and Jack wondered why he had not come himself.

He studied and graduated at Harvard College, and was married to Susanna Porter, a daughter of Rev. Aaron Porter, of Medford, Mass., the same year, when but twenty years of age. Four years later, 1739, he was called to the pastorate of a congregation at Haddam, Connecticut, where he continued <span class=\"clocktext\">until</span> dismissed for alleged heterodoxy. A year later Mr. Cleveland was installed over a congregation at Malden. His views being there deemed too liberal, he was obliged to resign that charge also. This circumstance occurred in 1750, the same year in which he went to Halifax. Falling into disrepute once more, because of his too rapid advance in theological tenets, he was forced to give up the Nova Scotia pastorate. The same year, 1755, he removed to England. He subsequently...", "...that the defenders should entirely disregard the fire of the matchlock men, and should direct their aim upon the storming parties.

The farmers vied with the men-at-arms in the steadiness of the defence, being furious at the sight of columns of smoke which rose in many directions, showing that the cavalry of the besiegers were occupied in destroying their homesteads. Sometimes, when four or five ladders were planted together, the assailants managed to climb up to the level of the parapet; but only to be thrust...", "...wait so long, as the season for favorable navigation to approach Peking may elapse; and announces his determination to proceed at once in the Brandywine, without waiting for any permission; and declares that a refusal to receive him would be a national insult, and a just cause of war.

The Mackenzies gave him what money they could spare, and Miss Valentine, on hearing where he was, sent more. But in Baltimore Poe found himself coldly received by his relatives.

With the subtlety and soft cowardice of Mussulman women, young or old, Ourieda said no word to her father of her loathing for Tahar.
