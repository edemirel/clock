The annual consumption of bread in Spain was four hundred pounds for each person, while in Cuba, it was only fifty-three pounds, nine ounces. In fact, all the necessaries of life were burdened with most iniquitous taxation. Then again there was the interest on the national debt. While the Spaniards paid three dollars and twenty-three cents per capita, six dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> cents, nearly double, was exacted from the Cubans. All these were the chief causes of the revolution which began in 1868, and many of them still existed a few years ago and led to the last revolution.

Its theory is a perverted Marxism and its practice is an envenomed Hindenburgism.

The leader Lenine said of the Bolsheviks in a moment of frankness: \"For every genuine Bolshevik of my party there are sixty idiots and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> rascals,\" and no one can doubt his fitness to judge. We should not forget that the Russian public that looks on Lenine as its idol is honeycombed with deserters, ruffians, and at least three hundred thousand common criminals who were liberated from the prisons and from exile in Siberia by the revolution. The Bolsheviks are neither a party nor are they the expression of democratic and revolutionary Russia, as a great many persist in believing.

On leaving the Barrier we could show a pack of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> dogs, many of which had grown up during our year's stay there; about half had survived the whole trip from Norway, and eleven had been at the South Pole. It had been our intention only to keep a suitable number as the progenitors of a new pack for the approaching voyage in the Arctic Ocean, but Dr. Mawson's request caused us to take all the thirty-nine on board.

According to the Black Code of Louisiana when slaves were charged with crimes punishable with death or hard labor for life, the jury might at its discretion commute the death penalty and inflict a lesser punishment. In Florida a slave guilty of crime punishable with death might at the discretion of the court suffer instead a whipping not exceeding <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> lashes, have his ears nailed to a post and stand one hour, and be burned in the hand. In the light of the documents quoted and the statutes cited the statement so frequently made that benefit of clergy disappeared in America at the time of the Revolution, and the dictum of an Indiana judge that \"it is unknown to our laws\" (I Blackford 63), can not be taken at their face value.

It was obvious to Mr. Laing that the forty families of two or three Norwegian highland glens, 'each possessing and living on its own little spot of ground and farming well or ill, as the case might be, were in a better and happier state, and formed a more rationally constituted society, than if the whole belonged to one of these families (and it would be no great estate), while the other <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> families were tenants and farmers.' Mr. Laing found the happy agricultural population of Norway 'much better lodged than our labouring and middling classes, even in the south of Scotland;' and that no nation was at that period either better housed, or so well provided with fuel. The standard of living appeared to be higher in Norway than in most of our Scotch highland districts, although the materials were the same, namely, oatmeal, barley meal, potatoes, fish--fresh and...", "...Sommervogel has already drawn up a list of 120,000 Jesuit authors and he has restricted himself to those who have ceased from their labors on earth and are now only busy in reading the book of life. Nor do these 120,000 authors merely connote 120,000 books; for some of these writers were most prolific in their publications. The illustrious Gretser, for instance, \"the Hammer of Heretics,\" as he was called, is credited with two hundred and twenty-nine titles of printed works and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> MSS. which range over the whole field of erudition open to his times: archaeology, numismatics, theology, philology, polemics, liturgy, and so on. Kircher, who died in 1680, wrote about everything. During the time he sojourned in Rome, he issued forty-four folio volumes on subjects that are bewildering in their diversity and originality: hieroglyphics, astronomy, astrology, medico-physics, linguistics, ethnology, horoscopy, and what not else besides. We owe to him the...", "...prolonged fatigue. Nothing in the world would induce Herschel to abandon his work; for, according to him, it would be to spoil it.\" The advantages that Herschel found in 1783, 1784, and 1785, in employing telescopes of twenty feet and with large apertures, made him wish to construct much larger still. The expense would be considerable; King George III. provided for it. The work, begun about the close of 1785, was finished in August, 1789. This instrument had an iron cylindrical tube, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> feet four inches English in length, and four feet ten inches in diameter. Such dimensions are enormous compared with those of telescopes made till then. They will appear but small, however, to persons who have heard the report of a pretended ball given in the Slough telescope.

The year 1631 is of interest as the date of publication, not only of Oughtred's Clavis, but also of Thomas Harriot's Artis analyticae praxis.

Harriot died ten years before the appearance of his magnum opus, or ten years before the publication of Oughtred's Clavis. Strangely, Oughtred, who survived Harriot <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years, never mentions him. There is no doubt that, of the two, Harriot was the more original mind, more capable of penetrating into new fields of research. But he had the misfortune of having a strong competitor in Rene Descartes in the development of algebra, so that no single algebraic achievement stands out strongly and conspicuously as Harriot's own contribution to algebraic science.

December 21, Bering received from Spangberg a message, relating that he had started for Yudomskaya Krest with ninety-six sledges, and that he had left the boats in charge of a mate and six guards. Bering immediately dispatched ten sledges with provisions for his relief, and on the succeeding day, thirty-seven sledges with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> men. January 6, 1727, Spangberg reached Okhotsk, and a few days later his whole command had arrived, eighteen of whom were now sick. Twice during the course of the winter, Spangberg and Chaplin were obliged to repeat this journey to rescue the materials at the Yudoma. Not until midsummer, 1727, did the rear under the command of Chirikoff arrive from Yakutsk. And yet Bering was far from the place where his work of discovery could begin.

Egypt, the Parthian kingdom on the Tigris, and Armenia in the mountains, alone remained free. While all this was going on in the East, there was a very dangerous plot contrived at Rome by a man named Lucius Sergius Catilina, and seven other good-for-nothing nobles, for arming the mob, even the slaves and gladiators, overthrowing the government, seizing all the offices of state, and murdering all their opponents, after the example first set by Marius and...", "...accomplished the unification of Germany, his later policy was, by common consent, a policy of peace. War had done its part, and the new Germany required all its energies to build up its internal prosperity and strength. In 1875, it is true, Bismarck was credited with the intention to fall once more upon France. The fact does not seem to be clearly established. At any rate, if such was his intention, it was frustrated by the intervention of Russia and of Great Britain. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years that followed Germany kept the peace. While France, England, and Russia waged wars on a great scale, and while the former Powers acquired enormous extensions of territory, the only military operations undertaken by Germany were against African natives in her dependencies and against China in 1900.

Rossini went to live with his father in Bologna, it is true; but he did not go there until 1836, so that this could have had little influence in making him determine to send back his librettos six years before.

He was destined to write <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> operas, of which he wrote thirty-four during the first thirteen years of his career. Ferdinand Hiller was no doubt right in saying that a man cannot go on perpetually writing operas with impunity for twenty years--and such operas as Rossini's, and at such a rate of production! Even when he had become comparatively inactive, Rossini produced four operas at the Academie in four successive years. Meyerbeer, his immediate successor at the Academie, brought out no more than...", "...without which there is no intellectual equality--no defence against the errors of the state or the pulpit. It is of no use that the Protestant concedes the right to think unless he concedes the right to differ. We may as well be Catholic unless we are free to dissent.

But this animal, gigantic as it was, is not the largest specimen that has been discovered. A portion of an Urus skull was discovered in the Avon, at Melksham, near Bath, the horn-cores of which, as described by Mr. H. Woods, were seventeen inches and a half in circumference, thirty-six inches and a half in length, and the distance from tip to tip was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> inches. Taking the same proportions as those of the ordinary ox, the author shows that the skull in question belonged to an animal very much larger than that which was described by Cuvier. In another specimen the distance between the tips of the horn-cores was forty-two inches, but their length only thirty-six. Of course, the size of the horn-cores gives little indication of the dimensions of the horns themselves, and the principal point to be noticed is the shape of the...", "...the =John=, the =Tenth Whelp=, the =Signet=, and the =Constant Warwick=.

In April of 1650 <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> vessels were required in the Downs, or on the coasts of Ireland and Scotland, in addition to the twenty which were then cruising to the southward under the command of Popham and Blake.

The subjective act which lays hold of Christ is faith, which in our text has its usual meaning of saving trust, and is entirely misconceived if it is taken, as it sometimes is, to mean the whole body of beliefs which make up the Christian creed. That which unites us to Jesus Christ is an infinitely deeper thing than the acceptance of any creed. A man may believe <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> or thirty-nine hundred articles without having any real or vital connection with the one Lord. The faith which saves is the outgoing of the whole self towards Christ. In it the understanding, the emotions, and the will are all in action.

Each zenod had its own post-office, court house, police, city prison, and all the machinery necessary in the operation of a complete city. The zenods were governed by a lieutenant-mayor and a council of fifteen members; the city, as a whole, was governed by a mayor and a supreme council of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> members. Cobb ascertained from Hugh that it had been found utterly impossible to properly provide for the welfare and advancement of such a great population unless the work was divided, and to that end the four zenods, with their respective municipal corporations, with a supreme head and upper house, had been created.

This must be conceded in praising a great artist for a line which he never drew, after you have taken the immortal Zero's advice and divested yourself of the scruples. 'I would rather be an Academician than an artist,' said Aubrey Beardsley to me one day. 'It takes <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> men to make an Academician, and only one to make an artist.' In that sneer lay all his weakness and his strength.

The sum of the whole is, that of our <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> fathers who framed the original Constitution, twenty-one--a clear majority of the whole--certainly understood that no proper division of local from Federal authority, nor any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal Government to control slavery in the Federal Territories; whilst all the rest probably had the same understanding.

The cannonade attracted a flotilla of cruisers, which came up too late to save the _Ramsay_, but which did succeed in cutting off the _Meteor_. Four officers and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> members of the crew were picked up by the Germans when their antagonist went down and these, together with the crew of the _Meteor_, took to the German's boats when her commander saw that escape was impossible.

In vain did the Adams men attempt to reframe the bill: when it came to a vote, sixteen of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> New England members felt compelled to accept it, with all its enormities, and it thus passed the House.

Between 1870 and 1890 the numbers of people increased from nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> millions to nearly sixty-three millions, the rate each decade being not far from twenty-five per cent. Six states added more than a million each to their population--New York and Pennsylvania in the Northeast; Ohio, Illinois and Kansas in the Middle West; and Texas in the South. No fewer than seventeen others expanded by half a million or more--ten of the seventeen being in the valley drained by the Mississippi River system.

They answered that they had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> acres of land, which paid tribute, and that they worked for their livelihood. He then asked them when Jesus Christ's kingdom was to come, and they told him \"At the end of the world.\" After which Domitian permitted them to depart in peace; which goes far to prove that he was not a persecutor.

They, however, contented themselves with flogging Paul when he fell into their hands, but they left his life unharmed; five times, as he himself relates, he was chastised with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> strokes.

Fifty of the enemy were killed, and one hundred and ten wounded; while, of the Americans, only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> appeared on the lists of killed and wounded. It was said at the time, that Capt. Pitot reported having struck his flag three times; hoisting it again, on finding that in the darkness the \"Constellation\" took no notice of the surrender.

On a whisper from the first rabbi, probably Saul Morteira, he went to a corner of the synagogue, stripped as far as the girdle, and received <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> stripes with a scourge. Then he was obliged to sit on the ground, after which the ban was removed. Not yet having satisfied the authorities, he had to stretch himself out on the threshold of the synagogue, that those present might step over him.

On her brow were several large brilliants, each one alone weighing one hundred and forty-nine grains. The girdle, finally, was a golden ribbon ornamented With <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> rose-colored stones. The scepter of his Majesty the Emperor had been made by M.

Napoleon found it expedient not to pursue. His own losses aggregated over 30,000, among them an unusual number of generals, of whom ten were killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> wounded. Three days proved a brief time to attend to the burial of the dead and the needs of the wounded.

Elizabeth was thirty-nine years of age, and therefore the poor women who were seated before her for the ceremony were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> in number. The queen's ladies brought silver basins filled with warm water delicately perfumed with flowers and sweet-smelling herbs. Cushions were placed, and on these the queen kneeled as she washed one foot of each of the poor women, marked it with a cross and kissed it. It takes a little from the humility of the act to read that just before the queen's performance of this duty the feet of the thirty-nine poor women were most carefully scrubbed and perfumed by three...", "...of its metal plate.

He succeeded in obtaining one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> fertile young queens from one Italian queen. Ligurian bees begin work earlier in the morning and leave off later than the common bees.

There he was circumcised, but was persecuted by the Jews themselves, and eventually whipped in the synagogue for attempting reformation of the Jewish usages, in which, he said, tradition had departed from the law of Moses. He took his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> lashes, recanted, and lay across the threshold of the synagogue for all his brethren to walk over him. Afterwards he endeavoured to shoot his principal enemy, but his pistol missed fire. He had another about him, and with that he shot himself.

Rawlinson, from Klerksdorp, with columns of Scott, Briggs, and Dawkins, was to march south of Hartebeestefontein straight through the enemy's lines--a thing the enemy would be at a loss till too late to understand--and arrive at dawn at a point <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> miles to west. General W. Kitchener (with Keir, Lowe, and Cookson's columns) was to continue the line and march south of Rawlinson to a point some forty miles distant. Lord Basing, from south of the Vaal, was to fill in the more southerly place, and Colonel Rochfort was to form up to the south of him with his right resting on the Vaal.

On our side, one man only was killed, and a few were wounded. The principal loss of the Chinese was inflicted by the fire of the howitzers upon their dense masses, in the narrow street, and the sustained fire of our column as it advanced upon them. Not a few, however, were killed inside the walls of the city.

Pugno was one day looking over his piano Concerto which had recently appeared. 'Why don't you play the work for the composer when he comes?' asked a friend. 'I am no pianist,' objected Pugno. 'Why not?' said his friend; 'you know enough about the piano, and there are still four weeks in which to learn the Concerto.' Pugno took the advice, practised up the work, played it in the concert given by Grieg, and scored a success. He was then <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years of age. This appearance was the beginning; other engagements and successes followed, and thus he developed into one of the great pianists of France. \"Pugno was a born pianist; he had a natural gift for technic, and therefore never troubled himself much about teaching technical exercises nor practising them.

While the negotiation was in progress there was a constant murmur among the Whigs about Mr. Webster's remaining in the cabinet, and as soon as the treaty was actually signed a loud clamor began--both among the politicians and in the newspapers--for his resignation. In the midst of this outcry the Senate met and ratified the treaty by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> to nine,--a great triumph for its author. But the debate disclosed a vigorous opposition, Benton and Buchanan both assailing Mr. Webster for neglecting and sacrificing American, and particularly Southern, interests.

The total of the surplus amounted to about 12-1/2 millions sterling; the deficits exceeded 75-1/2 millions of pounds.

Sixty-five of the king's soldiers had been killed, one hundred and eighty wounded, and twenty-eight taken prisoners; while of our people fifty-nine were killed, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> wounded, and five failed to answer to the roll call, having, most like, crawled away, as do the lower animals, to die alone.

On this matter I have pondered long; for, teaching <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years in Harvard College, I have each year found out a little more fully my own incompetence.

During the last twenty-four years of his life he kept an accurate account of the sums he thus distributed, but with no idea that the statement, which he intended for his own eye only, would ever be made public. During this period he gave away six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> thousand dollars. The greater part of this was given away in ten years, and during a period when his average income was sixty thousand dollars a year. He was a liberal patron of education, giving large sums to its extension; and it was his delight to assist poor clergymen, without regard to denominations. He gave away clothing, food, books, etc., in large quantities, as well as ready money. \"Two rooms in his house,\" says his son and biographer, \"and sometimes three, were...", "...of Clogher, and through the recommendation of Swift obtained also a good living. Parnell was fond of society, and was accustomed as often as possible to join the wits in London. He was a member of the Scriblerus Club, wrote for the _Spectator_, preached eloquent sermons, and had the ambition of a poet. But the loss of his wife preyed upon his mind, and he is said, though I believe chiefly on Pope's authority, to have given way to intemperance. He died suddenly at Chester at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> in 1718. Parnell was one of the poets whose fortunes Swift did his best to promote. Writing in 1712, he says, 'I gave Lord Bolingbroke a poem of Parnell's. I made Parnell insert some compliments in it to his lordship. He is extremely pleased with it, and read some parts of it to-day to Lord Treasurer, who liked it as much. And indeed he outdoes all our poets here a bar's length.'

The next step was the appointment of a committee of conference between the two Houses, but the members for the House showed an unusual determination to resist the will of the Senate, and on the 19th of July, the conferees reported that they had failed to reach an agreement.

He wore with military severity the full-dress uniform of the field-marshal, white coat, with epaulettes of gold; scarlet casimir breeches over which reached the shining black of his high riding-boots, a little dusty, as he had assisted in the review appointed in his honour. The great cordon red, the collar of the fleece of gold, and five or six medallions of different orders ornamented his breast; his hair was pale blond,...", "...and said: 'The shark with the shortest tail is my friend and will protect me.'

And the Water Baby came up and climbed out with another fat lobster for the king. \"And the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> sharks measured tails, devoting the one with the shortest tail, so that there were only thirty-eight sharks. And the Water Baby continued to do what I have said, and the sharks to do what I have told you, while for each shark that was eaten by his brothers there was another fat lobster laid on the rock for the king. Of course, there was much quarrelling and argument among the sharks when it came to measuring tails; but in the end it worked out in rightness and justice,...", "...and adopted child, Charles of Durazzo, who had forsaken her to follow the fortunes of the King of Hungary, and who had invaded Naples and put forth a claim to the throne, basing it upon some scheming papal grant which was without legality.

So came to an end this brilliant queen, the most accomplished woman of her generation, and with her downfall the lamp of learning was dimmed for a time in southern Italy, where the din of arms and the discord of civic strife gave no tranquillity to those who loved the arts of peace.

St. John's reputation for sanctity brought crowds to confess to him, as they came to be baptized by him with the baptism of justice; but we are not informed that St. John gave his penitents <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> stripes. Confession was not then a sacrament; for this there are several reasons. The first is, that the word \"sacrament\" was at that time unknown, which reason is of itself sufficient. The Christians took their confession from the Jewish rites, and not from the mysteries of Isis and Ceres. The Jews confessed to their associates, and the Christians did also. It afterwards appeared more convenient that this should be the privilege of the priests. No rite, no ceremony, can be...", "...from all the States to revise the National Constitution.

The movement seemed all the more ominous after the fall elections, which resulted in the choice of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Federalist Congressmen from New England and of only two Republicans. In the preceding Congress there had been thirty Federalists and eleven Republicans.

If it was not forbidden, but if Congress may exercise powers not expressly bestowed upon it, and if by a bank some of the things which the federal government had to do could be best done, it would be not only right but wise to establish such an agency. This was the burden of the argument of the Federalists, and Madison and his friends had no sufficient answer. The bill was at length passed by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> to twenty. But it had still to pass the ordeal of the cabinet. The President was not disposed to rely upon his own judgment either one way or the other. He asked, therefore, for the written opinions of the secretaries of the treasury and of state, Hamilton and Jefferson, and the attorney-general, Randolph. The same request was made to Madison, probably more because Washington held his ability and knowledge of constitutional law in high esteem than because of the prominent...", "...the obligation would be in such a case assumed, though it was not in this case real.

The independent dealer should meet chain-store competition in coffee on a price basis, making a special on a superior grade and figuring to get not more than three cents profit per pound, like his competitor.

Leil reigned twenty-five years, but towards the latter end of his life grew more remiss in his government, so that his neglect of affairs speedily occasioned a civil dissension in the kingdom. After him reigned his son, Hudibras, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years, and composed the civil dissension among his people. He built Kaerlem or Canterbury, Kaerguen or Winchester, and the town of Mount Paladur, now Shaftesbury.

He was a native of Wu-ch'ang, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years younger than Confucius, according to the 'Historical Records,' but forty-nine, according to the 'Narratives of the School.' He was excessively ugly, and Confucius thought meanly of his talents in consequence, on his first application to him. After completing his studies, he travelled to the south as far as the Yang-tsze. Traces of his presence in that part of the country are still pointed out in the department of Su-chau.

It is scarcely necessary to remark that the age of the mothers is probably quite as influential as that of the fathers. Concerning the mothers, however, we always have less precise information. My records, so far as they go, agree with Vaerting's for German genius, in indicating that an elderly mother is more likely to produce a child of genius than a very youthful mother. There were only fifteen mothers recorded under twenty-five years of age, while thirteen were over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years; the most frequent age of the mothers was twenty-seven. On all these points we certainly need controlling evidence from other countries. Thus, before we insist with Vaerting that an elderly mother is a factor in the production of genius, we may recall that even in Germany the mothers of Goethe and Nietzsche were both eighteen at their distinguished sons' birth. A rule which permits of such tremendous exceptions scarcely seems to bear the strain of emphasis. It must...", "...well aware of the shadowy character of these claims; but, when armed with a signed deed of cession, they had something tangible upon which thenceforth to base their own claims of proprietorship.

Colonel Richard Henderson was one of the principal judges in North Carolina, a scholarly, talented man, eminent in the legal profession; although but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years of age, he wielded much influence. Knowing and respecting Daniel Boone, Henderson was much impressed by the former's enthusiastic reports concerning the soil, climate, and scenery of Kentucky; and, acting solely upon this information, resolved to establish a colony in that attractive country.

The punishment for the second and third offence, of this kind, is the same in the case of a free person, as of a slave; namely, by the pillory and loss of ears, for the second offence; the third is declared felony, to which clergy is, however, allowed.

Some ruins of a very peculiar kind are situated under the Palazzo Doria and the church of S. Maria in Via Lata. They consist of ancient piers of travertine stone, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> inches square, standing in rows at distances of five or six yards, and evidently belonging to the remains of a portico. There are three rows of these, each containing eight piers under the Palazzo Doria, and five rows under the church of S. Maria in Via Lata, containing each five piers. It is plain that these were originally faced with marble, as the exterior surface of the travertine is rough hewn. The situation of these pillars agrees well with the locality in which the...", "...slavery.

His prose works lack artistic measure and objective plausibility; his lyrics lack clarity and virility; his creations in general lack the story-telling property that holds attention and the human-interest touches that move the soul. His <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years were too empty of real experience;[27] his works are not filled with the matter that endures. And it is for this reason that they ceased to live after their author had died. His connection with this earth was always just at the snapping-point.

No writer of his time contributed more towards the formation of an improved prose style than Mosbeim (1694-1755); although his \"Ecclesiastical History\" is now superseded by works of deeper research. His contemporary, Reimarus, wrote in favor of natural theology, and may be considered the founder of the Rationalistic School. Neander (d. 1850) wrote a history of the church, in ten volumes, distinguished for its liberal views.

During the night while the white men were smoking round their fires, the sound of the plaintive evening hymn rising in the still air from the pah suggested how strong was the hold that the new faith now had on the Maori mind.

In 1822 Sargon had 116 Jewish children under his charge at Cochin, but in 1824 he was transferred to Bombay, where he opened, under the auspices of the L.J.S., a school exclusively for Jews. In Cochin Sargon baptized a Jew and two Jewesses in 1828.

It takes a little from the humility of the act to read that just before the queen's performance of this duty the feet of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> poor women were most carefully scrubbed and perfumed by three separate officials. There must have been some competition to be among the chosen thirty-nine, if any one guessed what would happen, for before the queen bade them farewell, she presented each one with a pair of shoes, cloth for a gown, the towel and apron used in the ceremony, a purse of white leather containing thirty-nine pence, and a red purse containing twenty shillings.

After \"The Defense of Guinevere\" was published, it was thirteen years before Morris issued another volume. His days had been given to art and the work of management.

Taking up the active work of literature when <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years of age, he followed it with the zest of youth for over twenty years--until death claimed him. William Morris thought literature should be the product of the ripened mind--the mind that knows the world of men and which has grappled with earth's problems. He also considered that letters should not be a profession in itself--to make a business of an art is to degrade it. Literature should be the spontaneous output of the mind that has known and felt.

To me this risk against the chance of escape matters nothing. Why, when I was cabin-boy I got daily more than thirty-nine lashes--kicks, cuffs, and rope's-endings. Nay, I remember, when we sat over the Latin syntax together my daily ration must have been thirty-nine, more or less, and Dad's arm was stronger than you would judge, to look at him.

'A Kit-kat is a supper for a lord,' says a comedy of 1700, and certes it afforded at this club evening nourishment for many a celebrated noble profligate of the day. The supposed sign of the Cat and Fiddle (Kitt), gave another solution, but after all, Pope's may be satisfactorily received. The Kit-kat was, _par excellence_, the Whig Club of Queen Anne's time: it was established at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and was then composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> members, among whom were the Dukes of Marlborough, Devonshire, Grafton, Richmond, and Somerset.

It was from America that Edwards's \"Narrative of Surprising Conversions\" had come to Wesley, which, being read by him on the walk from London to Oxford, opened to his mind unknown possibilities of the swift advancement of the kingdom of God. The beginning of the Wesleyan societies in England followed in close connection upon the first Awakening in America. It went on with growing momentum in England and Ireland for quarter of a century, until, in 1765, it numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> circuits served by ninety-two itinerant preachers; and its work was mainly among the classes from which the emigration to the colonies was drawn. It is not easy to explain how it came to pass that through all these twenty-five years Wesleyan Methodism gave no sound or sign of life on that continent on which it was destined (if one may speak of predestination in this connection) to grow to its most magnificent proportions. At last, in 1766, in a little group of Methodist...", "...my love for you; Come! come! I leave to you my glory! Come near!

Many poems were accordingly sent in to the Society; and, after some consideration, it was thought that the prize should be awarded to M. Jude Patissie. But amongst the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> poems which had been presented for examination, it was found that two had been written in the Gascon dialect. The committee were at first of opinion that they could not award the prize to the author of any poem written in the vulgar tongue.

A force of anything between twenty-four and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> thousand men, combatant and non-combatant, with its wagons and sumpter horses, the considerable booty of its raid, its tents, its reserve of armour and of weapons, we cannot reckon, even upon a front of twelve deep, at less than a couple of miles in length, even under the best and strictest conditions of marshalling.

Hence it has been customary among writers on Parthian history to assign to Volagases I. the entire period between A.D. 51 and A.D. 90--a space of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years. Recently, however, the study of the Parthian coins has shown absolutely that Pacorus began to reign at least as early as A.D. 78, while it has raised a suspicion that the space between A.D. 51 and A.D. 78 was shared between two kings, one of whom reigned from A.D. 51 to about A.D. 62, and the other from about A.D. 62 to A.D. 78.

Allowing for exaggeration, it is not too much to say that Thorfinn and his cousin Macbeth must, after the death of their cousin Duncan in 1040, between them have held all that is now Scotland save the Lothians, until about 1057, when Macbeth was slain. To us it is interesting to note[14] that Duncan died, not in old age, (as Shakespeare, following Boece and the English chronicler Holinshed would have us believe) but a young man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years, either in, or after, Thorfinn's battle, and that he fell a victim not of Groa, Macbeth's wife's cup of poison, but possibly of her husband's dagger at Bothgowanan or Pitgavenny, a smithy about two miles from Elgin. We should also note that Thorfinn's cruelty made it difficult for him ever to hope to obtain and keep the throne of Scotland, which thus fell to Macbeth.

Who can say from memory the titles of even six of his <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> operas, from whence may be culled many of his choicest flowers of melody? M. Rolland rightly emphasises the importance of the operas of Handel in the long chain of musical evolution, and it seems impossible for anyone to lay down his book without having a more all-round impression than heretofore of this giant among composers.

Examination of the pedigree brings out the facts (1) that all affected individuals have an affected parent; (2) that none of the unaffected individuals, though sprung from the affected, ever have descendants who are affected, and (3) that in families where both affected and unaffected {173} occur, the numbers of the two classes are, on the average, equal. (The sum of such families in the complete pedigree is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> affected and thirty-six normals.) It is obvious that these are the conditions which are fulfilled in a simple Mendelian case, and there is nothing in this pedigree to contradict the assertion that brachydactyly, whatever it may be due to, behaves as a simple dominant to the normal form, _i.e._ that it depends upon a factor which the normal does not contain. The recessive normals cannot transmit the affected condition whatever their ancestry.

Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> signers, nineteen were from the North and twenty from the South. The three who refused to sign were Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts and Edmund Randolph and George Mason of Virginia.

In 1356 Orchan's son, Suleiman, inspired like his grandfather by a dream or a vision which he took as a supernatural summons, crossed to Europe with but <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> companions, and took the fort of Tzympe near Gallipoli. In three days there were three thousand Turks settled in Europe. It was the beginning of an Empire which lasts to this day.

While a large part of the route offers no more difficulty than the conquest of limitless levels, there are portions that have taxed to the utmost the skill and patience of the engineer. The deep trough of Lake Baikal has now (June 1905) been circumvented by the construction of a railway (here laid with double tracks) which follows the rocky southern shore. This part of the line, 244 versts (162 miles) long, has involved enormous expense. In fifty-six miles there are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> tunnels, and thirteen galleries for protection against rock-slides. This short section is said to have cost L1,170,000.

For the account of this curious procession we are indebted to Callixenes of Rhodes, who was then travelling in Egypt, and who wrote a history of Alexandria.

Using his pulse as a timekeeper he learned that where the chains were of the same length the lamp swayed to and fro in equal length of time, whether they traveled through a short space or a long space. This observation set the philosopher to experimenting with pendulums of different lengths. Among the many things he learned one of the most important was this: a pendulum <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> inches in length will make one vibration in just one second of time. Now, if the pendulum could only be kept swinging and its vibrations counted it would serve as a clock. Galileo, of course, saw this, and he caused to be made a machine for keeping the pendulum in motion (Fig. 11), but he did not make a clock; he did not connect his pendulum with the works of a clock.

However, the result of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> borings in two parallel lines across the river, to the depth of from 23 to 37-1/2 feet, seemed to prove that there was below the gravel a stratum of strong blue clay of sufficient depth to ensure the safety of the Tunnel.[8] A report to this effect was made to the shareholders at their first general meeting in July, and it was also stated that the works would be completed in three years. The first operation connected with the works, was the constriction of a shaft; and...", "...cause physical incapacity from service, and by emigration, the total army of first line must fall short of the total of seven times 275,000.

Behind the Landwehr comes the supplementary reserve, and behind that again the Landsturm, comprising the men who have been trained and are between the ages of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> and forty-five, the young men under twenty, and all those who, from physical weakness, have been entirely exempted from training. During their two or three years with the colours the men receive an allowance or pay of twopence halfpenny a day. Their service is not a contract but a public duty, and while performing it they are clothed, lodged, and fed by the State. When passed into the reserve they resume their normal civil occupation, except that for a year or two they...", "...are several of their men void of a spirit of enthusiasm, ... for many of them concealed themselves in houses, and advanced within ten yards to fire at me and other officers, though they were morally certain of being put to death....

Of her sons forty-nine were killed, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> were wounded, and five were taken prisoners. Berniere's figures of the British losses are 73 killed, 174 wounded, and 26 missing. The totals, for a day more important, as says Bancroft, than Agincourt or Blenheim, are very small.

The expedition, however, succeeded in reaching Rabba, on the Niger, five hundred miles from the sea, ascended the Benue, eighty miles above the confluence, and charts were made and soundings taken for the distance explored. In 1842 the British government made a new effort to explore the Niger, and built for that purpose three iron steamers, the Wilberforce, Albert, and Soudan, vessels of one hundred to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> feet in length. The error committed in the first expedition, of too great draught, was avoided; but the steamers had so little power and keel that their voyage to the Niger was both tedious and hazardous, and their speed was found insufficient to make more than three knots per hour against the current of the river. Arriving on the coast late in the season, they were unable to ascend above the points already explored, and the officers and men, suffering from the tedious...", "...in the race at the 4th Olympiad(610) (764 B.C.); and it agrees well with this date that Eumelus, who was contemporary with Archias the founder of Syracuse (in the 5th Olympiad), composed a poem for _free_ Messenia.

Its effect was very quick. Within a few hours after taking it the fever had subsided two degrees; in the morning the thermometer indicated only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> and a few decimals; her restlessness and delirium had entirely disappeared.

Seventy of those who now teach in the schools, were once ragged scholars themselves, thus imparting to others the benefits which they had received when poor ignorant children.

The incongruous buildings and external additions of the Restoration were removed. The entrance gateway to the upper ward, with its two towers of Lancaster and York, was made. The height of the Round Tower was increased by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> feet and a flag turret added. The old houses under the Curfew, Garter, and Salisbury towers were cleaned away.

The new church still accepted the theory of the devil causing storms, but opposed ringing the holy church bells to attempt to drive him away. The sins of people were also thought to cause storms, and also plagues. In 1562, the Church of England wrote down its Christian Protestant beliefs in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Articles of Religion, which specifically excluded certain Catholic beliefs. They were incorporated into statute in 1571 establishing them as the tenets of the official religion of England.

Among the first writers whose works he edited were the Puritan divines, Richard Sibbes, Thomas Brooks and Herbert Palmer.

In 1868 he brought out a bibliography of the writings of Richard Baxter, and from that year until 1876 he was occupied in reproducing for private subscribers the \"Fuller Worthies Library,\" a series of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> volumes which included the works of Thomas Fuller, Sir John Davies, Fulke Greville, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, John Donne and Sir Philip Sidney.

This was an entire change of style from his earlier works, possibly, however, foreshadowed by his \"Comte Ory,\" a revision of a previous score, and produced, as was his \"Tell,\" at the Grand Opera. \"Guillaume Tell\" not only is written to a French libretto; it is in the French style of grand opera, in which the vocal melody is less ornate and the instrumental portion of the score more carefully considered than in the Italian. During the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years of his life not another opera did Rossini compose. He appears deliberately to have formed this resolution in 1836, after hearing \"Les Huguenots\" by Meyerbeer, as if he considered it useless for him to attempt to rival that composer.

He presents the strange spectacle of a successful composer of opera, who lived to be seventy-six, abruptly closing his dramatic career at...", "...The whole earth was ruled by the mitre and sceptre, by the altar and throne, by fear and force, by ignorance and faith, by ghouls and ghosts.

He is represented lying down, the head inclined and supported by an angel; another angel is at his feet. The whole is striking, and the details are exquisite. The face of Chabot has every beauty, as if to answer to its reputation, but the beauty is that of one dying.

Seeing that his country was doomed to destruction, Aristodemus slew himself on his daughter's tomb. Shortly afterwards, in the twentieth year of the war, the Messenians abandoned Ithome, which the Lacedaemonians razed to the ground, and the whole country became subject to Sparta. Many of the inhabitants fled into other countries; but those who remained were reduced to the condition of Helots, and were compelled to pay to their masters half of the produce of their lands.

Lemaitre drew the wig from his pocket and threw it at the _souffleur's_ head: a frightful tumult followed. The pit climbed over the footlights, determined to make the insolent actor offer apologies: he refused. The play was stopped, and the commissaire of the theatre sent the offending actor to prison, where he remained <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> days. When he got out again Lemaitre hastened to make his peace with the public. It was easy enough. He had only to act in the superb manner of which he was master, and everything was forgiven. The great genius of the actor finally triumphed over the erratic dispositions of the man so far as to secure for him a call to that theatrical holy of holies, the stage of the Comedie Francaise. He made his debut at the theatre in the Rue Richelieu in _Fredegonde et Brunehaut_....", "...I had a curious dream or vision. I seemed to be standing outside the door of No. 4, looking up the corridor to No. 2, when suddenly I saw a figure with his back to the door of No. 2, and quite close to the door which leads to No. 3. His face was quite distinct, and what struck me most was the curious way in which his hair grew on his temples. His eyes were very dark, keen, and deep-set; his face was pale, and with a drawn, haggard expression. He looked about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years of age. His hair was dark and thick, and waved back from his forehead, where it was slightly grey. It was a most interesting and clever face, and one that would always, I should think, attract attention. He was dressed in a long black gown like a cassock, only with a short cape, barely reaching to the elbows.\" A further reference to this vision, which at the time seemed irrelevant, will be found on page 225. _February 18th,...", "...government purchasing agents.[412] Occasionally there went along these routes of trade men of real learning, and such would surely have carried the knowledge of many customs back and forth.

He spent <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years in travel, having been hospitably received in Babylon, and upon his return he was welcomed with great honor at Salerno.[413] A very interesting illustration of this intercourse also appears in the tenth century, when the son of Otto I {105} (936-973) married a princess from Constantinople.

The Bishop of Nova Scotia and the Bishop of London desired to confine it entirely to students belonging to the Church of England, and to make subscription to the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> articles a condition precedent to the granting of degrees in arts. On the other hand, Attorney-General Peters in 1845, when the amendments to the charter were discussed in the legislative council, stated that the charter as originally drafted and sent to England was much more liberal in its provisions than when finally passed, but that in 1828, to the surprise of Sir Howard Douglas, the then existing charter came out copied from one obtained by Dr. Strachan for Upper...", "...Man may discriminate, but nature and the laws that control the affairs of men will not and cannot.

The union was not so strong even as that in our own country under the Articles of Confederation. But there were two states in the German Confederation which were far stronger than any of the others; these were Austria and Prussia. Austria had been a great power in German and European affairs for centuries; but her rulers were now incompetent and corrupt.

Later, as a compromise, he proposes skipping <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> centuries and limiting his researches to the study of the political and social conditions of Egypt during the last ten years. And when he begins jauntily on this he finds that all that has gone before, from Rameses II. to Mehemet Ali, is as simple as the line of Popes in comparison with the anomalies and intricacies of government that have arisen within the last decade.

For my own part I think the scrutiny of one age is quite enough to bear without calling in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> others to its assistance.

There are ancient volcanoes on the moon forty or fifty miles in diameter; indeed, there is one well-formed ring, with a mountain rising in the centre, the diameter of which is no less than seventy-eight miles (Petavius). It seems difficult to conceive how a blowing cone at the centre could convey the materials to such a distance as the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> miles between the centre of Petavius and the rampart. The explanation is, however, facilitated when it is borne in mind that the force of gravitation is much less on the moon than on the earth. [Illustration: PLATE VIII.

But in the second Leipzig period, after his collaboration with Marianne von Ziegler, he arrived at and remained constant to a uniform design. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Choral Cantatas of the whole period only two exhibit the earlier form. Of all the others the libretto consists partly of unaltered hymn-stanzas--invariably used for the first and last movements, and occasionally elsewhere--but chiefly of paraphrased stanzas of the hymn, whose accustomed melody, wherever else it may be introduced, is associated invariably with the hymn when the text is used in its unaltered form.

A council was called at Camp Moultrie in 1823, where a treaty was made between the United States government and the Seminole Indians. By the terms of this treaty the Indians were to give up all their land north of the Withlacoochee River, except a few tracts reserved for chiefs. They were bound to stay within the limits of the lands assigned them, and if found in the northern part of the territory without passports were to suffer <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> stripes on the bare back, and give up their firearms. They were also pledged to assist in recapturing fugitive slaves, who in the future should seek refuge among them. In return for what they had given up the Seminoles were to receive from the United States at once, provisions for one year and six thousand dollars worth of cattle and hogs; and for twenty years thereafter, an annuity of five thousand dollars was to be paid to them.

On the last day of September, Pompey celebrated the most splendid triumph that the city had ever seen, and with it the glorious part of his life ended. Over three hundred captive princes walked before his chariot, and brazen tablets declared that he had captured a thousand fortresses, many small towns, and eight hundred ships; that he had founded <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> cities, and vastly raised the public revenue. The year following the departure of Pompey for the East was rendered noteworthy by the breaking out of a conspiracy that will never be forgotten so long as the writings of Cicero and Sallust remain. These were times of treasons, stratagems, and greed for spoils. Vice and immorality were rampant, and among the vicious and debased none had fallen lower than Lucius Sergius Catiline, a ferocious man of powerful body and strong...", "...the wife is an active business partner. This is notably true in France, among the Jews in Russia, and many immigrant races in the United States. The wife may even take the leadership if her superiority clearly shows up.

It was settled that there should be equal representation in the Senate, and proportional representation in the House of Representatives. This is one of a series of compromises that had to be made between the two parties in the convention. In fact, the Constitution is a series of compromises from beginning to end. Only thirty-nine of the fifty-five delegates in the convention signed the Constitution, and it is probable that no one even of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> was wholly pleased with it.

For many years past Signor Fogazzaro has dwelt in his native Vicenza, the most honoured of her citizens, round whom has grown up a band of eager disciples, who look to him for guidance not merely in matters intellectual or aesthetic, but in the conduct of life. He has conceived of the career of man of letters as a great opportunity, not as a mere trade. Nothing could show better his high seriousness than his waiting until the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> before publishing his first novel, unless it be the restraint which led him, after having embarked on the career of novelist to devote four or five years on the average to his studies in fiction. So his books are ripe, the fruits of a deliberate and rich nature, and not the windfalls of a mere literary trick. And now the publication of _The Saint_ confirms all his previous work, and entitles him, at a little more than threescore years, to rank among the few literary masters...", "...but the sneer only shows that the woman who uttered it was neither in love with him nor grateful to him. In this paper we are not discussing Lassalle as a public agitator or as a Socialist, but simply in his relations with the two women who most seriously affected his life.

Then came that profound and thrilling passion which ended the career of a man who at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> had only just begun to be famous. Lassalle had joined his intellectual forces with those of Heine and Marx. He had obtained so great an influence over the masses of the people as to alarm many a monarch, and at the same time to attract many a statesman. Prince Bismarck, for example, cared nothing for Lassalle's championship of popular rights, but sought his aid on finding that he was an earnest advocate of German unity. Furthermore, he was very far from resembling what...", "...be relieved by a militia one. How many sergeants' parties have you?

At the outbreak of hostilities the American force in the department did not amount to five hundred men.

General Clinch, who commanded at Fort Brooke, having been reinforced with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> men from Key West, no time was lost in preparing two companies for the above service.

Some of these, though in a very dilapidated state, presented points of great interest. When he started he knew of but few of those ruins.

Mr. THOMAS CARTWRIGHT, who died April 13th, 1744, aged 57; having by a diligent, faithful, and humble discharge of the various duties of the Christian and ministerial life, obtained a good report of all men, and of the truth itself; being most highly esteemed of those by whom he was most intimately known. Mr. Cartwright left a widow, who survived him <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years. The next pastor of this Church was a Mr. Walker, but of his life or ministry we find no records preserved. Mr. Richard Denny became pastor of this Church in 1763, and continued his labours for nearly forty years.

There is always a plentiful supply of curates in England.

These thirteen quiet years of Grant's life are not of account in his public career, but they are a phase of experience that left its deep traces in the character of the man.

Nor in the pride and power of his after success did he completely conquer the besetting weakness of his flesh. The years from twenty-six to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> in the lives of most men who ever amount to anything are years of steady development and acquisition, of high endeavor, of zealous, well-ordered upward progress, of growth in self-mastery and outward influence, of firm consolidation of character.

A. seven years later. His mature life was that of a courtier to whom the king's favor brought high appointments, with such vicissitudes of fortune, including occasional imprisonments, as formed at that time a common part of the courtier's lot. Wyatt, however, was not a merely worldly person, but a Protestant seemingly of high and somewhat severe moral character. He died in 1542 at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> of a fever caught as he was hastening, at the king's command, to meet and welcome the Spanish ambassador. On one of his missions to the Continent, Wyatt, like Chaucer, had visited Italy. Impressed with the beauty of Italian verse and the contrasting rudeness of that of contemporary England, he determined to remodel the latter in the style of the former. Here a brief historical retrospect is necessary. The Italian poetry of the sixteenth century had itself been originally...", "...important gains countrywide. Also, by 1970 electricity had been extended to over two-thirds of all villages. Consistently high levels of population growth placed severe strains on available supplies of food, consumers' goods, housing, and services. POPULATION The total population in January 1970 was an increase of approximately 500,000 over the 1960 official census total of 1,626,315. The distribution by age groups in 1970 was: under fifteen years of age, 42 percent; fifteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years, 37 percent; forty to sixty-four years, 16 percent; and sixty-five years and over, 5 percent. With almost 60 percent of its inhabitants under forty years of age and a median age of approximately nineteen years, the population was extremely youthful, and indications were that it would remain so into the 1970s. The proportion of persons in the dependent age groups, under fifteen and over sixty-four years, to the working age group, fifteen to sixty-four years, was 887 to...", "...Merriweather and his staff had circulated among them. Few of them had been trusted by Beckett with the secret that, with that platform and with Simpson as the nominee, their party would have the interests behind it, would almost certainly win. They only saw ahead a dull campaign, and no real issue between the parties, and their candidate, if he was Simpson, much the less attractive personality of the two. The following morning the voting began; and after seven ballots Simpson had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> votes less than on the first ballot. \"It was like a funeral,\" was the verdict of my disappointed guests that evening. A night of debate and gloom among the politicians and other delegates, and on the opening ballot Merriweather sprung his trap. The first big doubtful state in the alphabetical list of states is Illinois. When the secretary of the convention called for Illinois' vote, it was cast solidly for Scarborough. There was straightway pandemonium. It was half an...", "...among the poets of his country. GEORGE CHAPMAN George Chapman, translator of Homer, dramatist, and gnomic poet, was born in 1559, and died in 1634. At fifteen, according to Anthony Wood, \"he, being well grounded in school learning, was sent to the university\" of Oxford; at thirty-five he published his first poem: \"The Shadow of Night.\" Between these dates, though no fact has been unearthed concerning his career, it is not improbable that he may have travelled in Germany. At <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> he was reckoned \"among the best of our tragic writers for the stage\"; but his only play published at that age was a crude and formless attempt at romantic comedy, which had been acted three years before it passed from the stage to the press; and his first tragedy now extant in print, without name of author, did not solicit the suffrage of a reader till the poet was forty-eight. At thirty-nine he had also published the first instalment of his celebrated translation of the...", "...desired to be a civil engineer that Mr. ----, not being able to pay the large premium required for his apprenticeship, had been made very glad by the consent of Mr. Penn, of Millwall, to receive him without a premium after the boy should have spent some time at King's College in the study of mechanics. The rest is a sad story. About a fortnight ago Mr. ---- was taken ill, and died last week, the doctors say, of sheer physical exhaustion, not <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years old, leaving eight young children, and his poor widow expecting her confinement, and so weak and ill as to be incapable of effort. This youth is the eldest, and the other children range downwards to a babe of eighteen months. There is not one who knew him, I believe, that will not give cheerfully, to their ability, for his widow and children; but such aid will go but a little way in this painful case; and it would be a real boon to...", "...Fremont was subjected to a shower of fierce criticism, which this time he sought to disarm by ostentatious announcements of immediate activity. \"I am taking the field myself,\" he telegraphed, \"and hope to destroy the enemy either before or after the junction of forces under McCulloch.\" Four days after the surrender, the St. Louis newspapers printed his order organizing an army of five divisions. The document made a respectable show of force on paper, claiming an aggregate of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> thousand. In reality, however, being scattered and totally unprepared for the field, it possessed no such effective strength. For a month longer extravagant newspaper reports stimulated the public with the hope of substantial results from Fremont's intended campaign. Before the end of that time, however, President Lincoln, under growing apprehension, sent Secretary of War Cameron and the adjutant-general of the army to Missouri to make a personal investigation. Reaching...", "...Germany had certain others, individual in type, such as the _Von der Tann, Moltke, Goeben, Seydlitz, Derfflinger, Fuerst Bismarck, Prinz Heinrich, Prinz Adalbert, Roon_ and _Yorck, Scharnhorst_ and _Gneisenau, Bluecher, Magdeburg, Strassburg, Breslau, Stralsund, Rostock_, and _Karlsruhe_. These may be reckoned as scout cruisers, for they showed much speed, the fastest making 30 knots and the slowest 19 knots. The oldest dates from 1900, and the newest from 1914. Germany had, also, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> more fast protected cruisers which were designed for scout duty. In destroyers she was well equipped, having 143 ready for service when war was declared. Her twenty-seven submarines were of the most improved type, and much about their construction and armament she was able to keep secret from the rest of the world. It is probable that even their number was greater than the intelligence departments of foreign navies suspected. The best type had a speed on the surface of...", "...all articles on which they could safely lay their hands. In all this she was no doubt greatly aided by her fashionable appearance and winning ways. Not only did shopmen bow down before her, but she imposed upon the shrewd pressmen who interviewed her, and towards the end of her career, when funds were low, she persuaded a firm of West End bankers, hard-headed, experienced men of business, to give her a cheque-book and allow her to open an account. She soon had drawn no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> cheques on their bank, not one of which was honoured. When at last fate overtook her, and the police were set on her track by the duped and defrauded tradesmen, she brazened it out in court, declaring that her engagements were no more than debts, and that she was no worse than dozens of fashionable ladies who did not pay their bills. The prompt disposal of the goods she had obtained was, however, held to be felonious. Nor would the judge allow her plea that she always meant...", "...had done what we wanted, the gale was over, and we lost no time in making a fresh start. We soon got into the south-east trades, and, as they happened to be blowing strong, we made the best of them, and did not attempt to stop at Saint Helena. We were fortunate again in crossing the line, getting a little slant of wind, which carried us handsomely across the usually calm belt which so tries the patience of the homeward-bound seaman at that spot; and after a remarkably fine passage of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> days from Table Bay, we found ourselves at anchor in Funchal Roads. One of the canoes (both of which the schooner carried on deck) was got out, and my father and I went ashore to the post-office, where we found, as we expected, letters from my sister in answer to ours from Melbourne. My poor father was completely unmanned by the warmth of affection breathed forth in my sister's letter to him, and I was scarcely less so at the delight she manifested at our safety and...", "...taking place. There is, again, another serious item to be considered in connection with this statement. Why should this overplus, of more than seven millions of pounds of meal, be sent to this prison, when the army of Virginia was calling loudly for grain? The statement and the figures indicate simply a foolish desire to cover up deficiencies, and that too in a very hasty manner. XX. The same commissary states that he sent, during the same period of time, three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> thousand pounds of bacon, or five million four hundred and twenty-four thousand ounces. This will give thirty-six hundred and eighty-four pounds of bacon each day of the ninety-two days; and, after allowing six ounces per man to the rebel garrison, we shall have remaining but two thousand pounds to be divided among the twenty-nine thousand prisoners, or about one and one seventh ounces of bacon to each man. Thus the account of the commissary, if true, proves that the...", "...least of his worries compared with the titanic task of accumulating the money necessary to pay for the land when the filings should be approved. Yesterday everything had revolved around the necessity for thirty-nine thousand dollars, until the contemplation of this monetary axis had threatened to set his reason tottering on its throne. But that worry no longer existed. Homer Dunstan had indicated very clearly to Bob that he considered him insane, but Homer Dunstan had pledged him the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> thousand dollars when he could come to him with the notification from the Registrar of the State Land Office that the lands had been passed to patent, and Bob knew that Dunstan would keep his word, provided his death did not occur prior to the granting of the patents. The rough draft of the contract having been drawn up to his satisfaction, Bob sallied forth in search of a public stenographer. He knew that he had evolved rather a clever scheme, and he was averse to...", "...one hundred further trials failed to improve. The results have a real interest for vocational psychology. The experiment consisted in putting each of thirteen individuals through 205 repetitions of seven different mental tests. The trials were controlled as thoroughly as possible with respect to such factors as _interim_ occupation, exercise, food, rotation of tests, temperature, illumination, and incentive and interest. The subjects, four women and nine men, ranging from eighteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years in age, were mature, zealous, and faithful. Competition was stimulated by the award of desirable prizes, and each worker received a daily wage. Records were announced to the subjects only after each thirty-five trials. So far as previous practice in these particular tests is concerned, all the subjects were naive. Five trials were made daily, these trials being distributed through the day at about two-hour intervals. The tests themselves occupied about forty minutes...", "...best be explained by an account of its working in that country. In Germany every man becomes liable to military service on his seventeenth birthday, and remains liable until he is turned forty-five. The German army, therefore, theoretically includes all German citizens between the ages of seventeen and forty-five, but the liability is not enforced before the age of twenty nor after the age of thirty-nine, except in case of some supreme emergency. Young men under twenty, and men between <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> and forty-five, belong to the Landsturm. They are subjected to no training, and would not be called upon to fight except in the last extremity. Every year all the young men who have reached their twentieth birthday are mustered and classified. Those who are not found strong enough for military service are divided into three grades, of which one is dismissed as unfit; a second is excused from training and enrolled in the Landsturm; while a third, whose physical defects are...", "...light, thus adding greatly to the light, ventilation, and comfort of the steerage passengers, and necessitating the advantage of a smaller number of persons in each room.

There are seven boilers and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> furnaces. Practically the Servia is a five decker, as she is built with four decks--of steel, covered with yellow pine--and a promenade reserved for passengers.

The Post Office authorities find that these tubes are quicker than carts, but their speed is not so great as is usually supposed.

The longest tube in London is two miles three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> yards in length. Originally there were only seventeen pneumatic tubes in operation, the longest being that which went to Fenchurch Street, namely, nine hundred and eighty yards. The second in length was that to Leadenhall Street--six hundred and fifty-nine yards. The diameter of the tubes varies from one and a half inches to two and a quarter inches. The telegrams are placed in little leather cases, called \"carriers.\" The time taken in transmission to Fenchurch Street is,...", "...and so it dies in a kind of inane helplessness. Especially is this true in the country, where people have not obtained the mastery of their clothes that those who live in the city have.

Mr. Thayer doubts this story, because he could not find anything in Beethoven's sketch-books corroborating it; but even if it should be a myth, there are many well authenticated facts which show that Beethoven, like other composers, owed many of his best ideas to the magic influence of love in stimulating his mental powers. He dedicated <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> compositions to thirty-six different women, and it is well known that he was constantly falling in love, had made up his mind several times to marry, and was twice refused.

Her council and her house of assembly are each elected and on the same franchise. In these two colonies we have, therefore, types of colonial autonomy--that is to say, an...", "...auspices.

From an address issued at the time, we make the following compilations and extracts: After reciting that Virginia was a community of farmers--eight-tenths of her industry being expended upon the soil, the address proceeds to point out that out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> millions of acres she tills only a little over ten millions; that New York, on the other hand, with twenty-nine and a half millions, has subdued to the plough twelve and a quarter; while Massachusetts has reclaimed from the forests, quarry and marsh, two and one-tenth out of her little territory of five millions of acres; that the live stock of Virginia was worth only $3.31 for every arable acre; the live stock of New York, $6.07; and the live stock of...", "...Senator Lodge. On that I cannot hesitate, for, in my opinion, the resolution in that form does not provide for ratification but rather for nullification of the treaty. I sincerely hope that the friends and supporters of the treaty will vote against the Lodge resolution of ratification.\" The \"mild reservationists\" led by McCumber voted with the Lodge group for the resolution; but the \"bitter-enders,\" combining with the supporters of the original treaty, outnumbered them. The vote stood <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> in favor of the resolution and fifty-five against. When a motion for unconditional ratification was offered by Senator Underwood, it was defeated by a vote of fifty-three to thirty-eight.

They had killed the treaty, but in such an indirect fashion as to confuse the public and to fix upon the President the blame for delaying the peace.

His majesty was not aware, it should seem, that people do sometimes reconsider their opinions; and that nothing more disposes a man to reconsider his opinions, than a suspicion, that, if he adheres to them, he is very likely to be a beggar or a martyr. Yet it seems strange that these truths should have escaped the royal mind. Those Churchmen who had signed the Oxford Declaration in favour of passive obedience had also signed the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Articles. And yet the very man who confidently expected that, by a little coaxing and bullying, he should induce them to renounce the Articles, was thunderstruck when he found that they were disposed to soften down the doctrines of the Declaration. Nor did it necessarily follow that, even if the theory of the Tories had undergone no modification, their practice would coincide with their theory. It might, one should think, have crossed the mind of a man of fifty, who had...", "...\"and in the beginning of the seventeenth we find the proud edifice of the Catholic Church completely reared in South America. There were five arch-bishoprics, twenty-seven bishoprics, four hundred monasteries and innumerable parish churches.\" Of course, with due regard to Ranke, all that was not the work of Jesuits, but men of his kind see \"Jesuit\" in everything. It may be said, however, that they contributed in no small degree to bring about this result. In 1570 Azevedo conducted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Jesuits from Madeira to Brazil. Simultaneously, thirty more in two other ships set sail from Lisbon for the same destination. But the day after Azevedo's party had left Madeira, the famous Huguenot pirate, Jaques Soria, swooped down upon them, hacked them to pieces on the deck, and then threw the mangled remains to the sharks. The amazing Southey narrates this event as follows: \"He did by the Jesuits as they would have done by him and all their sect:--put them to death.\"...", "...that the two things which that Congress deliberately framed, and carried to maturity at the same time, are absolutely inconsistent with each other? And does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation, from the same mouth, that those who did the two things, alleged to be inconsistent, understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we--better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent? It is surely safe to assume that the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> framers of the original Constitution, and the seventy-six members of the Congress which framed the amendments thereto, taken together, do certainly include those who may be fairly called \"our fathers who framed the government under which we live.\" And so assuming, I defy any man to show that any one of them ever, in his whole life, declared that, in his understanding, any proper division of local from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbade the Federal...", "...Supreme Court until I graduated from Philander Smith College.

Here then is a result which is attained by the same process which applies to the year 1824, and to every other year, and which is right in itself; and which must put to flight and to shame all the attempts to excite the country with this bugbear story of extravagance. In the first place the aggregate expenditures have not increased threefold in fifteen years; they have not risen from thirteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> millions, as incontinently asserted by the opposition; but from thirty-two millions to thirty-seven or thirty-nine. And how have they risen? By paying last year eleven millions for Treasury notes, and more than twelve millions for Indian lands, and wars, removals of Indians, and increase of the army and navy, and other items as enumerated. The result is a residuum of thirteen and a half millions for the real expenses of the government; a sum one and a half millions short...", "...many painful marks of violence and injury. His perils endured by land and sea, his imprisonments, his \"labour and travail, hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness,\" his three shipwrecks, the \"night and day spent in the deep,\" were sufficient to break down the strength of the stoutest frame; they had given him the look of a worn and haggard man.

The allusion of 1 Pet. ii. 24--\"by whose _stripes_ (literally, _bruise_ or _weal_) ye were healed\"--shows how vividly this circumstance was remembered, and how strongly it affected Christian minds.

These brethren spread so luxuriantly, however, that in the reign of Henry VIII. there were thirty-six greater, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> lesser monasteries, and twenty-six nunneries, of their rule. The founder of the church was Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk; and it would appear that the choir was finished and consecrated before the rest of the building was complete, a circumstance not unusual at that time. The consecration took place in 1268; and in the body of the church the architecture is of a style long subsequent. The remains of the church are now the only interesting parts of the ruin, at least as a...", "...Stephen returned to London to hold his Easter court.

At this assembly Stephen's queen, Matilda, was crowned, and so brilliant was the display and so lavish the expenditure that England was struck with the contrast to the last reign, whose economies had in part at least accumulated the treasure which Stephen might now scatter with a free hand to secure his position.

It is true that the rate of increase is falling off both absolutely and in proportion to the white race. In the South Central group of states, which includes most of the Lower South, the population increased about forty-eight per cent from 1860 to 1880 and only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> per cent in the next double decade; while the white population has in both periods increased at about sixty per cent, with a rising ratio.

He repented of having trusted himself from the vessel, but it was now too late to recede.

During the first hundred years of its educational life, it counted among its alumni, eight bishops and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Jesuits, of whom four became provincials. There were also on the benches eleven future Augustinians, eighteen Franciscans, three Dominicans, and thirty-nine of the secular clergy. The University of St. Ignatius, which opened its first classes in 1587, was confirmed as a pontifical university in 1621 and as a royal university in 1653. Besides these institutions, the Society had a residence at Mecato and a college at Cavite, and also the famous sanctuary of Antipole. They...", "...and I will give him my daughter.'

'Well, in forty days the man who has sent you must make that hill vanish, and plant a beautiful garden in its place. That is the first thing. Now go, and tell him what I say.' So the old woman returned and told the head the sultan's first condition. 'It is well,' he replied; and said no more about it. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> days the head remained in its favourite corner. The old woman thought that the task set before him was beyond his powers, and that no more would be heard about the sultan's daughter.

Before the year 1761 there were only between sixty and seventy sugar refineries on the island. By the end of the century there were four hundred and eighty. Before the year 1796 there were only eight or ten coffee plantations, so that the island barely produced enough coffee for its own consumption. By the end of the century there were three hundred and twenty-six \"cafeyeres.\" At the same time the island had two thousand four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> vegas, or tobacco fields, and one thousand two hundred and twenty-three _colmenares_ or apiaries. The revenues of the island from 1793, when they amounted to over one million pesos, rose steadily until at the beginning of the century they were about three million pesos annually. The sugar plantations yielded great profits, but they also required big investments of money and labor. One of the most prominent sugar planters on the island, D.

In the recently published second part of his \"Synoptical Flora of North America\" he has described <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> species, six of which are annual. The synonyms and cross-naming adopted by previous authors have led to much confusion, which probably will not now be altogether cleared up, for Dr. Gray warns us that the characters of some of the species are variable, especially in cultivation. It may be added that some at least of the species readily form hybrids. There is always more or less difficulty with a variable genus in making garden plants fit wild specific types, but in the...", "...to bind, us all together in our joint efforts.

His master ordered that he should be sent to the workhouse and receive <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> paddles before leaving, and on the morning he was to be shipped, his distressed wife, hearing the sad news, came to the jail; but notwithstanding the entreaties of several debtors, the jailer could not allow her to come in, but granted, as a favor, that she should speak with him through the grated door.

Ten are dolichocephalic, 71 to 74.6; twenty-nine are mesaticephalic, 75.2 to 79.7; twelve are brachycephalic, 80.4 to 84.8, and two are hyperbrachycephalic, 85 and 96.3. Thus the vast majority of heads are mesaticephalic with more tendency toward brachycephaly than to dolichocephaly. The nose represents on the other hand surprising uniformity.

How desperate some of them have become in the face of this cruel dilemma is illustrated by the tale which is told of Dr. Jowett, of Balliol College, Oxford: that when he was required to recite the \"Apostle's Creed\" in public, he would save himself by inserting the words \"used\" between the words \"I believe\", saying...", "...for hire.

Sibley, St. Paul, Minn._: \"Ordered, that of the Indians and half-breeds sentenced to be hanged by the military commission, composed of Colonel Crooks, Lieutenant Colonel Marshall, Captain Grant, Captain Bailey and Lieutenant Olin, and lately sitting in Minnesota, you cause to be executed on Friday, the nineteenth day of December, instant, the following named, to-wit: (Here follow the names of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> Indians, and their numbers on the record of conviction.) \"The other condemned prisoners you will hold, subject to further orders, taking care that they neither escape nor are subjected to any unlawful violence. \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN, \"_President of the United States._\" Colonel Sibley had been appointed, by President Lincoln, a brigadier general, on the 29th of September, 1862, on account of his success at the battle of Wood Lake,...", "...Presidential Election, at which Mr. Wilson's claim is based on having kept America out of the War. [Illustration: COMRADES IN VICTORY Combles, September 26th POILU: \"Bravo, mon vieux!\" TOMMY: \"Same to you, mate.\"] Members have returned to St. Stephen's refreshed by seven weeks' holiday, and the Nationalists have been recruiting their energies, but unfortunately nothing else, in Ireland. By way of signalising his restoration, after an apology, Mr. Ginnell handed in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> questions--the fruits of his enforced leisure. The woes of the interned Sinn Feiners who have been condemned to sleep in a disused distillery at Frongoch have been duly brought forward and the House invited to declare that \"the system of government at present maintained in Ireland is inconsistent with the principles for which the Allies are fighting in Europe.\" The system of administration in Ireland is, and always has been, inconsistent with any settled principles...", "...how they shall behave and bear themselves in their office ... and for what causes they may be removed; and touching the manner and form of choosing and nominating of the chief master and undermaster, and touching the ordering, government and direction of the chief master and undermaster and of the scholars of the said School, which said Statutes were to be inviolately observed from time to time for ever. No record remains of Statutes made in accordance with this royal permission until <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years later. Custom no doubt played a great part in the government of the School and it continued steadily on the lines first laid down by James Carr. But towards the close of the century the country was awakening from the materialism which had girt it round. The danger of invasion had passed away. The seeds of religious fervour were bearing fruit. A militant, assertive Puritanism was vigorously putting forward its feelers throughout the length and breadth of England, nor...", "...Q. Yes, we will admit that, but is the Bible inspired? A. \"But still I know of no way to convince any one of spirit and inspiration and God only as His reason may take hold of these things.\" Q. Do you think the Old Testament true? A. \"The story of Eden may be an allegory; the history of the children of Israel may have mistakes.\" Q. Must inspiration claim infallibility? A. \"It is a mistake to say that if you believe one part of the Bible you must believe all. Some of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> books may be inspired, others not; or there may be degrees of inspiration.\" Q. Do you believe that God commanded the soldiers to kill the children and the married women and save for themselves the maidens, as recorded in Numbers 31:2? Do you believe that God upheld slavery? Do you believe that God upheld polygamy? A. \"The Bible may be wrong in some statements. God and right can not be wrong. We must not exalt the Bible above God. It may be that we have claimed too...", "...Bolshevism. It seemed to him that the dollar standard was the paramount means both magnate and socialist used to value inanimate and animate objects. He longed for a new unit of measure. He was keen on business trips. At least he could have the freedom of his hotel and could roam about without being pointed out as the Gorgeous Girl's husband, the lucky young dog and so on. Neither would he be dragged from this house to that to sit on impossible futurist chairs while young things of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> clad in belladonna plasters and jet sequins gathered about to tell him what perfectly wonderful times their class in cosmic consciousness was having. Mary Faithful was keen to have him go. She dreaded any furthering of the personal understanding between them. When one has become master of a heartache and thoroughly demonstrated that mastery it is not sensible to let it verge toward a heart throb, even if one is positive of the ability to change it back at will into the...", "...officers came on board to examine the vessel, and inquire into her cargo and destination. These men, to their great surprise, finding it commanded by a lady of exquisite beauty, reported her charms to the sultan, who resolved to possess them, and sent her an offer of marriage; to which she seemingly consented, and the sultan commanded the most splendid preparations to be made for the nuptials. When all was ready, he sent onboard the vessel the daughter of his vizier, with other ladies, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> in number, magnificently attired, to wait upon his bride, and attend her on shore. They were graciously received by the politic lady, and invited to refresh themselves in the grand cabin, which she had elegantly adorned with costly hangings, and prepared in it a superb collation, to which they sat down. She then dismissed the boats in which they came, sending a message to the sultan that she should entertain the ladies on board till the next morning, when she would repair...", "...has been the worst on me, though the corporal says I never can hope to be a soldier till I'm able to lay down in three or four inches of water and get as much rest as I would at home in bed. I tell him I don't hope to be one any more, for I've had about enough of it, though of course I shall stick by the company till we've taken the fort, and it's pretty certain we shall do that, because now there are two hundred and seventy men in the ranks. \"Colonel Easton enlisted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> of his militia before we got to Bennington, and there we were joined by the Green Mountain Boys under the command of Colonel Ethan Allen. \"It surprised me to find that a good many of the people don't believe we are doing right in trying to take away the fort from the king's troops, and the corporal says that unless this thing is a success we are all like to be hanged for traitors, because his majesty will make an example of them who are foremost in the...", "...fruit of slavery, abandoned to brutality and lust. The laws of South Carolina and Georgia make it an offence punishable with death, \"if any slave shall presume to strike a white person.\" By the laws of Maryland and Kentucky, it is enacted \"if any negro, mulatto, or Indian, bond or free, shall, at any time, lift his or her hand in opposition to any person, not being a negro or Indian, he or she shall, in the first-mentioned State, suffer the penalty of cropped ears; and, in the other, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> lashes on his or her bare back, well laid on, by order of the justice.\" In Louisiana there is a law--for the enactment of which, slavery is, of course, responsible--in these words: \"Free people of color ought never to insult or strike white people, nor presume to conceive themselves equal to the whites: but, on the contrary, they ought _to yield to them on every occasion_, and never speak or answer them but with respect, under the penalty of imprisonment, according to the...", "...hand. Seizing the rifle by the barrel, I blindly and recklessly attacked them; I had a grim sort of feeling that if I was to die, I would die fighting. I remember, too, that I comforted myself with the thought that no one depended on me, and that I had no near relatives to bemoan my death. It may be that my position gave me an advantage, otherwise they, being three, must have mastered me easily, although one of them was badly wounded; still, one desperate man can do much. I was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> years of age, and although not bred a soldier, I was an athlete. I was an old rowing blue, too, and that means good muscles and a strong heart. I weighed only a little over twelve stone, but I had not an ounce of spare flesh, and I was desperate. I had a little advantage in reach, too; I am over six feet in height, and long in limb. But it was an unequal battle, and I knew they were bearing me down. One of my arms was numb, too; I expect it was from a blow, although I...", "...has been split up into many colours by passing through the glass, as it is in the rain-drops of the rainbow and the bubbles of the scum of the pond. Week 5 Till now we have talked of the sunbeam as if it were made of only one set of waves of different sizes, all travelling along together from the sun. These various waves have been measured, and we know that the waves which make up red light are larger and more lazy than those which make violet light, so that there are only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> thousand red waves in an inch, while there are fifty-seven thousand violet waves in the same space. How is it then, that if all these different waves making different colours, hit on our eye, they do not always make us see coloured light? Because, unless they are interfered with, they all travel along together, and you know that all colours, mixed together in proper proportion, make white. I have here a round piece of cardboard, painted with the seven colours in...", "...it is much better to leave a man unmolested until the testimony and pleadings are all in. Otherwise he is dumb--he is at the sarsaparilla stage. Before I get to the higgledy-piggledy point, as Mr. Howells suggested I do, I want to thank you, gentlemen, for this very high honor you are doing me, and I am quite competent to estimate it at its value. I see around me captains of all the illustrious industries, most distinguished men; there are more than fifty here, and I believe I know <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-nine</span> of them well. I could probably borrow money from--from the others, anyway. It is a proud thing to me, indeed, to see such a distinguished company gather here on such an occasion as this, when there is no foreign prince to be feted--when you have come here not to do honor to hereditary privilege and ancient lineage, but to do reverence to mere moral excellence and elemental veracity-and, dear me, how old it seems to make me! I look around me and I see three or four persons..."]
