Towards 1705, although Lady Josiana was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> and Lord David forty-four, the wedding had not yet taken place, and that for the best reasons in the world. Did they hate each other? Far from it; but what cannot escape from you inspires you with no haste to obtain it. Josiana wanted to remain free, David to remain young.

The dates of much of the classical German literature precluded the possibility of its being translated until two thirds of the period had passed.

It was in this way that she cultivated an intimacy with the celebrated Richardson; and that, in 1750, when she was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, she ventured to controvert his opinions on 'Filial Obedience.'[1] Richardson delighted to stimulate female talents to honourable and persevering exertions.

For it was will and not mere passion that mastered his course. \"In his faults,\" says a sympathetic historian, \"the love of pleasure had no part.\" At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> he had left Rouen, and securing a seigniory, where we have just seen him, in the \"most dangerous place in Canada,\" he made clearing for the settlement which he named the Seigniory of St. Sulpice (having received it from the seminary of St. Sulpice), but which his enemies named, as they named the rapids, \"La Chine.\" There tutored in the Indian languages and inflamed of imagination as he looked day after day off to the west, his thoughts \"made alliance with the sun,\" as...", "...butter upon Bacon, we refrain from any eulogy upon that illustrious character. * Rapin, vol. iii., p. 88. ** The last of the Non-Parliamentary barons is the well- known Baron Nathan of Kennington.

[Illustration: 177] EDWARD the Second was, in common phraseology, a very nice young man when he came to the throne, being <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, and tolerably good-looking, though he turned out eventually, according to one of the chroniclers of the times, \"a very ugly customer.\" His first step on coming to the throne was to send for a scamp named Piers Gaveston, a Gascon youth who was full of gasconade, and had been sent out of England by the late king as an improper character. Young Edward, who had been much attached to this early specimen of the gent., recalled Piers Gaveston, and made him a...", "...PLAY, AND MANUAL ACTIVITIES To another German, Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852), we are indebted, directly or indirectly, for three other additions to elementary education --the kindergarten, the play idea, and handwork activities. ORIGIN OF THE KINDERGARTEN. Of German parentage, the son of a rural clergyman, early estranged from his parents, retiring and introspective by nature, having led a most unhappy childhood, and apprenticed to a forester without his wishes being consulted, at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> Froebel decided to become a schoolteacher and visited Pestalozzi in Switzerland. Two years later he became the tutor of three boys, and then spent the years 1808-10 as a student and teacher in Pestalozzi's Institute at Yverdon. During his years there Froebel was deeply impressed with the great value of music and play in the education of children, and of all that he carried away from Pestalozzi's institution these ideas were most persistent. After serving in a variety of...", "...for a little enjoyment has invariably the effect of awaking the sense of enjoyment, irritating it, and setting it on edge. I, therefore, recollecting my own case, have allowed for _no_ wine-parties. Let our friend, the abstraction we are speaking of, give breakfast-parties, if he chooses to give any; and certainly to give none at all, unless he were dedicated to study, would seem very churlish.

But, however this be settled, let no mistake be made; nor let that be charged against the system which is due to the habits of individuals. Early in the last century, Dr. Newton, the head of a college in Oxford, wrote a large book against the Oxford system, as ruinously expensive. But then, as now, the real expense was due to no cause over which the colleges could exercise any effectual control. It is due exclusively to the habits of social...", "...Chiefs; J.

I was a little bashful in approaching him with the offer, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years ago Lord Stanmore, the High Commissioner, had offered him a similar post, and the letter of appointment was still to come. But finding that, despite his seventy years, he was still ready to accept the unpaid office, and that he was a _persona grata_ to Europeans and natives alike, my hesitation vanished. I was particularly anxious to see him for another reason.

And, although the peace which Ulfeldt concluded with Sweden and Holland at Broemsebro, in 1645, might have been still more disastrous than it was, if the negotiation had been entrusted to less skilful hands, yet there was but too much truth in the reproachful words of the King, when,...", "...their average height is 77.41 inches, whereas that of the self-fertilised is 52.83 inches, or as 100 to 68.

Thus the average number of seeds in the crossed capsules was to that in the self-fertilised capsules as 100 to 94.

His army steadily increased, and he soon marched with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand troops and fourteen pieces of artillery to lay siege to Paris. His army had unbounded confidence in his military skill. With enthusiastic acclamations they pursued the retreating insurgents.

The Parliament, under the leading of Hazlerigg and Vane, still resisted his claims, and attempted to defy him. Their resistance was easily overcome. Lambert met Lenthall, the Speaker, on his way to the House, compelled him to return home, and by main force closed the Parliament. In its place was established a Committee of Safety of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> members, to which the administration was entrusted. Besides officers of the army and some London citizens, certain representatives of the Parliament were granted seats upon it. Lambert seemed, for the moment, to be completely master of the situation, and the Royalists conceived hopes that they might secure for their own cause the assistance of the leaders of the army. Fleetwood, however, lost his head, and would not act without the permission of Lambert. In December he...", "...the siege of Mexico brought to a conclusion by the capture of Guatimotzin and his chiefs, on the thirteenth of August, at the hour of vespers, being the day of St. Hyppolitus, in the year of our Lord one thousand five hundred and twenty-one.

Guatimotzin was of a noble appearance both in person and countenance; his features were rather large and cheerful, with lively eyes. His age was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> or four years, and his complexion very fair for an Indian. His queen, the niece of Montezuma, was young and very handsome. THE MORTALITY AT THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO What I am going to mention is truth, and I swear and say amen to it.

As the stringency increased, the attack on the clergy gained in ferocity. Edward I. not only taxed the priesthood, but seized the revenues of the alien priories; of these there might have been one hundred and fifty within the realm, and what he took from them he spent on his army. Edward II. and Edward III. followed the precedent, and during the last reign, when the penny dropped four grains, these revenues were sequestered no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years. Under Henry IV. the penny lost three grains, and what remained of the income of these houses was permanently applied to defraying the expenses of the court. Henry V. dissolved them, and vested their estates in the crown. In the reign of Henry IV., when the penny was on the point of losing three grains of its silver, the tone of Parliament was similar to that of the parliaments of the Reformation. On one occasion the king asked for a subsidy, and the Speaker...", "...he received his earlier education in the Abbey School there; and such a rapid advance did he make in learning, that whilst still very young, the direction of the school at Dunstable, a dependency of the Abbey of St. Alban's, was entrusted to him.

He did not long adhere to the scholastic learning of the University, but in 1186 returned to England, and resumed his old post at Dunstable.

At the taking of the first census of the United States, in 1790, the country contained a population of about four millions in its territory of less than one million of square miles. Sixty years later, at the census of 1850, it contained a population of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> millions in its territory of about three millions of square miles. The vast expansion of territory to more than threefold the great original domain of the United States had been made by honorable purchase or less honorable conquest. It had not added largely to the population of the nation; the new acquisitions were mainly of unoccupied land. The increase of the population, down to about 1845, was chiefly the natural increase of a hardy and prolific stock under conditions...", "...149:1] are these; Matthew and Mark agree together against Luke in 1684 particulars, Luke and Mark against Matthew in 944, but Matthew and Luke against Mark in only 334.

Thus (to take a case at random) in the parallel narratives Matt. xii. 1-8, Mark ii. 23-28, Luke vi. 1-5 (the plucking of the ears on the Sabbath day), there are fifty-one points (words or parts of words) common to all three Evangelists, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> are common only to Mark and Luke, ten to Mark and Matthew, and eight to Matthew and Luke. In the next section, the healing of the withered hand, twenty points are found alike in all three Gospels, twenty-seven in Mark and Luke, twenty-one in Mark and Matthew, and five in Matthew and Luke.

The United States navy, to which is committed the naval defense of the United States, has followed the same lines as the British; and its task, while in some ways easier, is in other ways more difficult. Perhaps the chief reason why the naval defense of Great Britain is so difficult is the extreme closeness of her borders to the borders of her possible foes--for the English Channel is only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles across from Dover to Calais. And yet the very narrowness of the Channel there lends a certain element of assistance to the defender of either coast against an enemy like Germany, because it enables the defender, by simply protecting that narrow area, to prevent an enemy from passing to the sea or from it, except by going around the British Isles.

Guillotin, the physician, who invented or rather improved this machine, which is called after his name with a feminine termination, is said to have been a man of humanity; and, on that principle alone, he recommended the use of it, from the idea of saving from painful sensations criminals condemned to die. Seeing the abuse made of it, from the facility which it afforded of dispatching several persons in a few...", "...navy, in a dry-rot period of a hundred years before, had induced a like head-wagging and exchange of views when one of its greatest admirals, Hawke, was first given charge of a squadron; being then already a man of mark, and four years older than Nelson at the Nile. But he was younger than the rule, and so distrusted. The vacancies made by the wholesale action of 1854 remedied this for a while. The lieutenants who owed their rank to it became such after seven or eight years, or at, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> or four; and this meant really passing out of pupilage into manhood. The change being effected immediately, anticipated the reaction in public opinion and in Congress, which rejected the findings of the board and compelled a review of the whole procedure. Many restorations were made; and, as these swelled the lists beyond the number then authorized by law, there was established a reduced pay for those whose recent promotion made them in excess. For them was adopted, in...", "...golden hair, which streamed freely over her shoulders and fell around her. She walked slowly, but quite calmly.

He, too, like Aurelius, had learnt that what was good for the bee was good for the hive. He strove to live as the civil administrator, of an unaggressive and united republic; he disliked war, did not value the military title of Imperator, and never deigned to accept a triumph. With this wise and eminent prince, who was as amiable in his private relations as he was admirable in the discharge of his public duties, Marcus Aurelius spent the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of his life. So close and intimate was their union, so completely did they regard each other as father and son, that during all that period Aurelius never slept more than twice away from the house of Antoninus. There was not a shade of jealousy between them; each was the friend and adviser of the other, and, so far from regarding his destined heir with suspicion, the Emperor gave him the designation \"Caesar,\" and heaped upon him all the honours of the Roman...", "...here. In the autumn of 1835, a handsome compliment was paid to Mr. Charles Holmes, the driver and part proprietor of the Blenheim coach (from Woodstock to London) to celebrate the completion of his twentieth year on that well-appointed coach, a period that had elapsed without a single accident to his coach, his passengers, or himself; and during which time, with the exception of a very short absence from indisposition, he had driven his sixty-five miles every day, making somewhere about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand miles a year. The numerous patrons of the coach entered into a subscription to present him with a piece of plate; and accordingly a cup, bearing the shape of an antique vase, the cover surmounted by a beautifully modelled horse, with a coach and four horses on one side, and a suitable inscription on the other, was presented to Mr. Holmes by that staunch patron of the road, Sir Henry Peyton, Bart., in August, at a dinner at the Thatched House Tavern, St....", "...was passed on to the future still unsettled. In the spring of 1125 also occurred an event which again changed the direction of Henry's plans. On May 23, the emperor Henry V died, without children by his marriage to Matilda. The widowed Empress, as she was henceforth called by the English though she had never received the imperial crown, obeyed her father's summons to return to him in Normandy with great reluctance. She had been in Germany since her early childhood, and she was now <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age. She could have few recollections of any other home. She loved the German people, and was beloved by them. We are told even that some of them desired her to reign in her husband's stead, and came to ask her return of Henry. But the death of her husband had rendered her succession to the English throne a matter of less difficulty, and Henry had no mind to sacrifice his own plans for the benefit of a foreign people. In September, 1126, he returned with Matilda...", "...of Ipswich conveys to Anthony Needham of Salem \"a certain tract of land being the third part of twenty three acres of land (formerly the land of John Herod) lying and being in ye towne of Salem aforesaid, the said twenty three acres of land being bounded on ye northerly side with ye land of ye said Needham, on ye south with ye highway, on ye west with ye land of ye said Anthony Needham, and on ye east with ye land now in ye occupation of John Procter.\" Supposing this third part of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> acres to have been the eight acre lot referred to above, being the only locality that would agree with the description, the land in the \"occupation of John Procter\" on the east side of the whole \"twenty three acres\" would be the \"Flint Pasture,\" part of the Downing Farm, which was then, in 1681, in the occupation of John Procter, as tenant. It is therefore quite probable that the \"fifteen acre\" lot which John Procter owned was the other two thirds part of the \"twenty three...", "...evening we had to wade through that slough, trying to follow his thought. And this reminds me of a saying of one of the most astute politicians and most capable public men of recent development: \"The surest sign that a man is not great is that he strives to look great.\" I think that the best speech I ever heard for obedience to the rules of art was an address of about ten minutes by a young Salvation Army officer on the streets of Chicago. I listened with amazement. He was perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, with delicate, clear-cut features, sensitive mouth, and marvelously intelligent eyes. I was just passing the group as he stepped into the circle that always surrounds these noisy but sincere enthusiasts.

About the middle of the year 1696, he returned home, and settled at Stepney, in the neighbourhood where he was born: the success, he met with in his practice here, established his reputation, and was a happy presage of his future fortunes. If it be remembered, that our author was, when he began to practise, no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, that only three years, including the time taken up in his travels, were appropriated to his medical attainments, it may be, not unreasonably, admitted, that nothing but very uncommon talents, join'd to an extraordinary assiduity, could have enabled him to distinguish himself, at this early a period of life, in so extensive, and so important a science. In 1702, Dr. Mead exhibited to the public, a manifest evidence of his capacity for, as well as application to...", "...effect upon me, owing to the peculiar character of one of our new relay of horses. He was a great raw-boned brute about sixteen hands high, who reared upright at starting, and showed a strong disposition to bolt the first few miles--a disposition only checked by the extreme stolidity of his companion, who stumbled over his nose every few steps. \"N'ayez pas peur, mademoiselle,\" said the grave voice at my side, consolingly; \"I know him well; he will do no harm. That fellow who rears is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old; but he is much the best of the two.

In the command were to be found roughly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> battalions of Militia and forty-eight of Volunteers; but, owing to the supineness and neglect of the Government, the former regiments now found themselves, at the moment when wanted, greatly denuded of officers, and, owing to any lack of encouragement to enlist, largely depleted in men. As regards the Volunteers, matters were even worse, only about fifteen thousand having responded to the call to arms. And upon these heroic men, utterly insufficient in point of numbers,...", "...I could now give _you_ some instruction, but all I have to say to you on these subjects shall be said verbally.\" Each year of his life at this period Faraday found himself becoming busier than the previous one. Another five chemical lectures (on the metals, well known and little known) were given before the City Philosophical Society during 1818, completing a course, extending over three years, of seventeen lectures on the chemical science, no mean accomplishment for a young man from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> to twenty-six years of age. So much was his time now becoming occupied that we find a great falling-off in his letters this year, a falling-off not only in number, but also in length. The correspondence with Abbott, commenced six years earlier, practically comes to an end in 1818; there was not, it is necessary to mention, the slightest abatement in the warmth of affection of the two friends; it was that, to a great extent, perhaps, the correspondence had done its work,...", "...ahead; that no forage was available; that the medical department had neither sugar, tea, chocolate, wine nor spirits.

Soldiers can get along without pay but they must have food. Mutiny broke out among the recruits. In the midst of this trouble, Lafayette, the handsome French Marquis, then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, arrived on his white horse, after a winter in Paris, bringing word that a fleet and army from France were heading across the sea. This news revived the drooping spirit of the army. Soon boats began to arrive from down the river with food from the east. The crisis passed. In the north a quiet summer followed. The French fleet with six thousand men under Rochambeau arrived at Newport, July tenth, and were immediately blockaded by the British as was a like...", "...for bare necessities.

So I laid my need before my Father, confident that he knew it was a real need, and that according to his promise he could and would supply it.

A few days later I received a letter from a band of ladies in Mount Forest, Ontario, enclosing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> dollars and some odd cents, and saying: \"Please accept the enclosed to buy something you have lost as our substitute in China.\" Only a day or two later another letter came, from quite another part of Ontario, enclosing twelve dollars and some cents.

The sixteen hundred millions of greenbacks added to the amount already issued would give us some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> hundred millions of paper money, and I suppose the theory of the new doctrine would leave this mass permanently in circulation, for it would hardly be consistent to advocate the redemption of the greenbacks in gold after having repudiated and foresworn our obligation on the bonds. \"But if it be intended to redeem the legal tenders in gold, what will have been the net gain to the Government in the whole transaction?

About sixteen feet is the measurement of a large elm, like that on Boston Common, which all middle-aged people remember. From twenty-two to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> feet is the ordinary maximum of the very largest trees.

When a friend commented on the circumstance that no less than nine strange horses were feeding in the stables at Montpelier, Madison remarked somewhat grimly that he was delighted with the society of the owners but could not confess to the same enthusiasm at the presence of their horses.

When the messenger was taking his leave the Prince said to him: 'Do not forget, my dear Becafigue, that my life depends on my marrying Princess Desiree, whom you are going to see. Do your best for me and tell the Princess that I love her.' Then he handed Becafigue his photograph to give the Princess. The young Prince Becafigue's cortege was so grand, and consisted of so many carriages, that it took them <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> hours to pass; and the whole world turned out to see him enter the gates of the palace where the King and Queen and Princess Desiree lived. The King and Queen saw him coming and were very pleased with all his grandeur, and commanded that he should be received in a manner befitting so great a personage. Becafigue was taken before the King and Queen, and, after paying his respects to them, told them his message and asked to be introduced to the Princess Desiree.

But his personal bravery at Jena, his brilliant pursuit of the enemy, the audacity with which he bluffed fourteen thousand Prussians to surrender at Erfurt, and his capture of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand prisoners and eight hundred cannon at the great fortress of Magdeburg made ample amends for his errors.

In all there were thirteen brass and twenty-six iron cannon; eight brass and six iron mortars. Also there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> hundred pounds of lead for bullets, and a barrel of flints.

One of the epigrams attributed to him on the authority of Planudes is an eulogy on the celebrated Hypatia, daughter of Theon of Alexandria, whose tragic death took place A.D. 415 in the reign of Theodosius the Second.

JEAN DE LA FONTAINE was born in 1621 at Chateau-Thierry, in Champagne, son of the \"maitre des eaux et forets.\" His education was less of a scholastic kind than an education derived from books read for his own pleasure, and especially from observation or reverie among the woods and fields, with their population of bird, beast, and insect, so dear to his heart and his imagination. Slipping away from theology and law, he passed ten years, from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> to thirty-three, in seeming indolence, a \"bon garcon,\" irreclaimably wayward as regards worldly affairs, but already drawing in to himself all that fed his genius, all sights and sounds of nature, all the lore of old poets, story-tellers, translators, and already practising his art of verse. Nothing that was not natural to him, and wholly to his liking, would he or could he do; but happily he was born to write perfect verses, and the labour of the artist was with him an...", "...thin flag, which makes the mast look like a whip with a lash on the end of it. Here is the story of it. In the old days, 250 years ago, Britain and Holland were both powerful nations at sea and rivals in commerce, but as we had command of the British Channel we made all foreign ships salute our men-of-war when passing them. One day, May 19th, 1652, a Dutch fleet of forty-five ships; under their great admiral Van Tromp, came sailing up the Channel, and passed a British Fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> ships under Admiral Blake. Seeing how strong he was, the Dutch admiral declined to salute us. So our flagship fired a shot across his bows, as a signal to remind him of his duty; but Van Tromp promptly replied with a broadside into the stern of Admiral Blake's ship. \"That's very rude of him to break my windows,\" remarked Blake, and promptly ordered his small Fleet to attack the Dutch, although it was twice as strong. The battle began at four o'clock in the afternoon,...", "...the whole of the century, but at no other period and in no other country did the love-sonnet dominate literature to a greater extent than in England between 1591 and 1597. Of sonnets to patrons between 1591 and 1597, of which detached specimens may be found in nearly every published book of the period, the chief collections were: II. Sonnets to patrons, 1591-7.

We then tried to beguile the time by climbing amongst the hills at the back of the house--by pushing our way through the tangled briers--by walking to a little lake, where there were ducks and waterfowl, and close to the margin a number of fruit trees. We returned to the baths--the mules had not been heard of--there was no resource but patience. Our Morelian friends left us to return home before it should grow dusk; and shortly after, an escort of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> lancers, with a captain, arrived by orders of the governor, Don Panfilo Galiudo, to accompany us during the remainder of our journey. They looked very picturesque, with their lances, and little scarlet flags, and gave a very formidable aspect to the little portico in front of the baths, where they deposited all their military accoutrements--their saddles, guns, sarapes, etc. The captain had with him his wife and daughter, and a baby of about two years old, which, during...", "...should fall. Why do bodies fall?\" \"Goodness knows,\" said the small voice of Miss Miette in the midst of the silence that followed. \"Miette,\" said Madame Dalize, \"be serious, and don't answer for others.\" \"But, mamma, I am sure that Paul would have answered the same as I did:--would you not, Paul?\" Paul bent his head slightly as a sign that Miette was not mistaken. \"Well,\" continued Monsieur Roger, \"another one before you did ask himself this question.

They are really implied contracts which the law will sustain for his benefit and protection. What are necessaries is a question of fact, not always easily answered. Much depends on a minor's place in society and condition. The question is for a jury to decide, also whether the prices for them are reasonable or not. One of the well-known cases occurred many years ago. The bill against the minor was for more than a thousand dollars for twelve coats, seventeen vests, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> pairs of trousers, five canes, fur caps, chip hats and other things, in less than six months. The jury rendered a verdict for almost the entire amount, but the reviewing court remarked that the bill made the members shudder, that the seller must have known that all these things were not needed for the minor's comfort within that short period, and the verdict was therefore set aside. The question is constantly arising, what are necessaries? A thing might be to one and not...", "...himself. It was marvellous what he had accomplished with his opportunities. Ten hours a day in the mines had earned for him his living, and the night had given him his leisure. An attic, lighted by a tallow candle, with a shelf of books that left him hardly enough for bread, had been his Alma Mater. History was his chief study. There was hardly an authority Joan could think of with which he was not familiar. _Julius Caesar_ was his favourite play. He seemed to know it by heart. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> he had been elected a delegate, and had entered Parliament at twenty-eight. It had been a life of hardship, of privation, of constant strain; but she found herself unable to pity him. It was a tale of strength, of struggle, of victory, that he told her. Strength! The shaded lamplight fell upon his fearless kindly face with its flashing eyes and its humorous mouth. He ought to have been drinking out of a horn, not a wine glass that his well-shaped hand could have...", "...speed of the trains was also increased. The first locomotives used in hauling coal-trains ran at from four to six miles an hour. On the Stockton and Darlington line the speed was increased to about ten miles an hour; and on the Liverpool and Manchester line the first passenger-trains were run at the average speed of seventeen miles an hour, which at that time was considered very fast. But this was not enough. When the London and Birmingham line was opened, the mail-trains were run at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles an hour; and gradually the speed went up, until now the fast trains are run at from fifty to sixty miles an hour--the pistons in the cylinders, at sixty miles, traveling at the inconceivable rapidity of 800 feet per minute! To bear the load of heavy engines run at high speeds, a much stronger and heavier road was found necessary; and shortly after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester line, it was entirely relaid with stronger materials. Now that express...", "...of labor is carried very far. The best is made at the village of Kiangsee, which contains a million of inhabitants. Seventy hands are sometimes employed on a single cup.

By the end of the century there were four hundred and eighty. Before the year 1796 there were only eight or ten coffee plantations, so that the island barely produced enough coffee for its own consumption.

The revenues of the island from 1793, when they amounted to over one million pesos, rose steadily until at the beginning of the century they were about three million pesos annually.

Jose Ignacio Echegoyen, calculated that to produce ten thousand arrobas of sugar, an expenditure of twelve...", "...hearts, Whose message hope and joy imparts, They sang their deathless strain.\" The fate of Timrod was the saddest of them all. Gifted with uncommon genius, he never saw its full fruitage; and over and over again, when some precious hope seemed about to be realized, it was cruelly dashed to the ground. There is, perhaps, no sadder story in the annals of literature. Henry Timrod was born in Charleston, South Carolina, December 28, 1829. He was older than his friend Hayne by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days. The law of heredity seems to find exemplification in his genius. The Timrods, a family of German descent, were long identified with the history of South Carolina. The poet's grandfather belonged to the German Fusiliers of Charleston, a volunteer company organized in 1775, after the battle of Lexington, for the defense of the American colonies. In the Seminole War, the poet's father, Captain William Henry Timrod, commanded the German Fusiliers in Florida. He was a...", "...on the beacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building.

In Farrar's report of Mason's speech, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> pages are devoted to the first point, eight to the second, and six to the third. In other words, the third point, involving the great constitutional doctrine on which the case was finally decided at Washington, the doctrine that the Legislature, by its acts, had impaired the obligation of a contract, was passed over lightly. In so doing Mr. Mason was not alone.

Thus, of the 8 cases which Taruffi has collected, in 7 the twins were female; and if to these we add the sisters Rosalie and Josepha Blazek and the Maids, we have 10 cases, of which 9 were girls.

There is, therefore, nothing inherently improbable in the statement that the Biddenden Maids lived for thirty-four years. With regard also to the truth of the record that the one Maid survived her sister for six hours, there is confirmatory evidence from scientifically observed instances, for Joly and Peyrat (Bull. de l'Acad.

In thirteen years, the toil was all but accomplished. In the coming summer the Canal du Midi would be opened--when Riquet died--the great cup of his life's ambition brimming untasted at his lips. Six months thereafter, a gay company of king's commissioners, gracefully headed by Riquet's two sons, rode through the channel of the water-courses from Beziers to Toulouse, and returned the next week by water, leading a jubilant procession of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> great barges, proceeding from the west with cargoes for the annual fair held on the Rhone, at Beaucaire. Since Riquet's days, all his plans have been, one by one, carried out. His canal now runs to Agen, where it joins the Garonne; while at the other end, it is led through the chain of marshes and lagoons which extend along the Mediterranean, from Perpignan to the delta of the Rhone, joining the \"swift and arrowy\" river at Beaucaire.

A census of the colleges and seminaries in and about Chicago showed that the country is furnishing eighty per cent of our college students.

If they could not do this, then it follows that all the colored persons in Virginia, up to 1753, (only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years before the revolution,) and all their descendants to the present time, were and are free; and they cannot now be distinguished from the descendants of those subsequently imported.

On the return of the Dutch to Sumatra and Java, they met the great Portuguese fleet consisting of eighteen galleons, four galleys, one caravel, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> fustas, with over three thousand men--the largest fleet ever seen in the Indias--and in the combat captured and destroyed four galleons, although with some considerable loss to themselves. The Portuguese prisoners taken formed lengthy material for debates between the Portuguese and Dutch.

Reaching those islands after anchoring at...", "...requisite number is drawn out the box; and the men whose names are drawn, are summoned to attend as jurors. Sec.6. It is the business of a _grand jury_ to inquire concerning crimes and misdemeanors committed in the county; and if there appear just grounds of accusation against any person, they make to the court a presentment or formal charge against him, upon which he is to be put upon trial. The number of grand jurors is not always the same. In some states there may not be more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> nor less than twelve. It is not required that they shall all agree in order to put a person upon trial. Sec.7. On the opening of the court, the grand jurors are sworn to make a true presentment of all things given them in charge.

He earnestly suggested amendments on all these points, as well as with regard to the soldiers' pay; which was less than that of the regular troops, or the troops of most of the other provinces. All these suggestions, showing at this youthful age that forethought and circumspection which distinguished him throughout life, were repeatedly and eloquently urged upon Governor Dinwiddie, with very little effect. The plan of a frontier line of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> forts was persisted in. Fort Cumberland was pertinaciously kept up at a great and useless expense of men and money, and the militia laws remained lax and inefficient. It was decreed, however, that the great central fort at Winchester, recommended by Washington, should be erected. In the height of the alarm a company of one hundred gentlemen, mounted and equipped, volunteered their services to repair to the frontier. They were headed by Peyton Randolph. No doubt they...", "...soon as they turned their backs, and fled precipitately oh every side, the legionary cavalry was sent in pursuit of them. On that day, fourteen thousand of the Boians were slain; one thousand and ninety-two taken--as were seven hundred and twenty-one horsemen, and three of their commanders, with two hundred and twelve military standards, and sixty-three chariots. Nor did the Romans gain the victory without loss of blood: of themselves, or their allies, were lost above five thousand men, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> centurions, four prefects of the allies, and two military tribunes of the second legion, Marcus Genucius and Marcus Marcius. 6. Letters from both the consuls arrived at Rome nearly at the same time.

This trend of thought led me unconsciously to the dividing frontiers of different sciences and shaped the course of my work in its constant alternations between the theoretical and the practical, from the investigation of the inorganic world to that of organised life and its multifarious activities of growth, of movement, and even of sensation. On looking over a hundred and fifty different lines of investigations carried on during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years, I now discover in them a natural sequence. The study of Electric Waves led to the devising of methods for the production of the shortest electric waves known and these bridged over the gulf between visible and invisible light; from this followed accurate investigation on the optical properties of invisible waves, the determination of the refractive powers of various opaque substances, the discovery of effect of air film on total reflection and the polarising...", "...syllable which he was pronouncing at the moment of interruption. The general consternation discovered to him what had happened, and he declared, with an awful solemnity, that they ought to think themselves happy in having escaped with the fright alone.

Some even suppose him to be one of the departed who is allowed to pass <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> hours of the day among the living, and that in the twenty-fourth his soul is obliged to return to the infernal regions to suffer its punishment.

Coming to this country as a mere lad, he engaged in mercantile pursuits in Georgetown, D.C., and when about sixteen years of age became a lay Jesuit and in 1817 entered the priesthood. After ministering to Trinity church in Georgetown for several years, he was transferred, at the request of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, to Frederick, where he built St. John's church, a college, an academy, an orphan asylum, and the first free school in the city. After remaining there for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years and establishing a reputation for devotion to his church and rare executive ability that made him one of the most useful Jesuits in the country, he was sent back to his old church in Georgetown and the following year went to the Mexican War as Chaplain in the regiment commanded by Caleb Cushing.

She read well and could write, too. It is stated that Nancy Hanks taught Thomas Lincoln to write his own name. Thomas was twenty-eight and Nancy <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> when their wedding day came. Christopher Columbus Graham, when almost one hundred years old, gave the following description of the marriage feast of the Lincoln bride and groom: \"I am one of the two living men who can prove that Abraham Lincoln, or Linkhorn, as the family was miscalled, was born in lawful wedlock, for I saw Thomas Lincoln marry Nancy Hanks on the 12th day of June, 1806.

For the first time the officer who recited the formula: _Quest'e il vostro doge si vi piacera_, turned aside without staying to receive the approbation of the people. The long reign of Gradenigo (1289-1311) is one of the most important in the annals of Venice. By the fall of Acre in 1291 the doom of the Christian power in the Holy Land was sealed, and Venice, whose interest in the Crusades and in the Latin dominion over Syria was...", "...71.

POSITION OF WOMAN.--Women in Japan are treated with far more respect and consideration than elsewhere in the East. According to Japanese history the women of the early centuries were possessed of more intellectual and physical vigor, filling the offices of state and religion, and reaching a high plane of social dignity and honor. Of the one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> Japanese sovereigns, nine have been women. The great heroine of Japanese history and tradition was the Empress Jingu, renowned for her beauty, piety, intelligence, and martial valor, who, about 200 A.D., invaded and conquered Corea.

The young man was, perhaps, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> or twenty-four years of age, though at first his dignified bearing might lead one to imagine him to be even older than that. He was clad in a very common suit, which betrayed his poverty, while at his feet, in a basket, lay a plane and saw, which indicated that he belonged to the carpenters' guild.

Cowperwood wished he could make some such strike; but he was too practical to worry over anything save the facts and conditions that were before him. His chance came about six months later, when it was found that the State would have to have much more money. Its quota of troops would have to be equipped and paid. There were measures of defense to be taken, the treasury to be replenished. A call for a loan of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> million dollars was finally authorized by the legislature and issued. There was great talk in the street as to who was to handle it--Drexel & Co. and Jay Cooke & Co., of course. Cowperwood pondered over this. If he could handle a fraction of this great loan now--he could not possibly handle the whole of it, for he had not the necessary connections--he could add considerably to his reputation as a broker while making a tidy sum. How much could he handle? That was the...", "...since, such trees were in great numbers along the northern parts of Connecticut River.\" In another letter, he speaks of the white pine as \"frequently six feet in diameter, and two hundred and fifty feet in height,\" and states that a pine had been cut in Lancaster, New Hampshire, which measured two hundred and sixty-four feet. Emerson wrote in 1846: \"Fifty years ago, several trees growing on rather dry land in Blandford, Massachusetts, measured, after they were felled, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> feet. All these trees are surpassed by a pine felled at Hanover, New Hampshire, about a hundred years ago, and described as measuring two hundred and seventy-four feet.[249] These descriptions, it will be noticed, apply to trees cut from sixty to one hundred years since.

In the teeth of these positive orders he remained at Menindie no less than eighty-two days, from Nov. 5th, 1860, to Jan. 26th, 1861, doing literally nothing at all. There was, as far as we can see, nothing to prevent him from reaching Cooper's Creek with a portion of the stores before the end of 1860. The distance from Menindie to the Creek is about 400 miles, and Mr. Burke had traversed it without difficulty in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days. When Burke left Cooper's Creek on December 16th, he was in daily expectation of Wright's arrival. Had this reasonable expectation been fulfilled, there would then have been no reason why Brahe should not have remained at the depot for six months, or even a longer time. Wright appears to have spent a considerable portion of the time which he wasted at Menindie in making trips to see his wife and family, who were at a station about twenty-one miles off, being troubled...", "...Fourth of July Oration at Quincy, 1831 Nullification is the provocation to that brutal and foul contest of force, which has hitherto baffled all the efforts of the European and Southern American nations, to introduce among them constitutional governments of liberty and order.

Sebastian Cabot sailed in the summer of 1498: he soon reached Newfoundland, and thence proceeded north as far as the fifty-eighth degree.

The number to be included in the established list is continually increasing at such a rate that it is impossible to state it with any approximation to exactness.

By the time a girl is twenty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> she is counted _passee_, and, if unmarried, must retire into the background in favor of her younger sisters. The young girls are exceedingly attractive. They are slender, and their heads sit beautifully above long swan-like necks. They dress their hair in a rather tightly drawn pompadour, and ornament it with filigree combs set with seed pearls, or, if they are able, with jewelled butterflies and tiaras. Jewellery is not only a fashion here, but an investment. Outside...", "...all of a check for rent made out to Judge Hugo Marshall!_ But there was a stub that interested him.

They saw no signs of any people having been there lately, but found a human skull on the ground. This was supposed to have belonged to one of two Indian chiefs, who were left there by Captain Swan, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years before, as Dampier told us: for victuals being scarce with these buccaneers, they would not carry the poor Indians any farther, after they had served their turns, but left them to starve on this desolate island.

That night he saw an eclipse of the moon, which he said varied five hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> minutes from its time at Cadiz[20], to the place where he then was. The bad weather, probably owing to the eclipse, lasted so long, that he was forced to remain at that anchorage till the 20th of the month, all the time under great anxiety for the other ships which were not able to get into the same place of security, but it pleased GOD to save them.

HANDEL.--In the sphere of sacred music, perhaps Handel stands without a peer.

In <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days he produced \"The Messiah,\" a work which, for vastness of conception and exquisite finish, is the grandest and most perfect choral work the world has ever known. He belonged to no school, has no imitators, for he is too far removed for imitation to be attempted. Well has it been said that the power of such souls baffles criticism. That they tower so far above the common level, and possess such exceptional mental and moral powers, leads to the supposition that they...", "...denomination can be held to have such vested interest in the revenue derived from the proceeds of the said clergy reserves as should prevent further legislation with reference to the disposal of them, but this House is nevertheless of opinion that the claims of existing incumbents should be treated in the most liberal manner.\" Baldwin and other Reformers supported this clause, which passed by a majority of two.

Confirmation of the Deluge story was found in the fossil shells on high mountain tops; while as for the giants of antediluvian times, there were the huge bones in proof.

Lewis took his father's name after Emancipation, and worked for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years in a cotton gin at La Grange. He came to Fort Worth in 1896 and worked for Armour & Co. until 1931. Lewis lives at 3304 Loving Ave., Fort Worth, Texas. \"My birth am in de year 1851 on de plantation of Massa Fred Tate, what am on de Colorado River. Yes, suh, dat am in de state of Texas.

The addition of these little ribs does not affect the fourteenth cervical alone, for properly the ribs of the first true dorsal vertebra are destitute of processes; but in some of the skeletons in which the fourteenth cervical bore little ribs, the first pair of true ribs had well-developed processes. When we know that the sparrow has only nine, and the swan <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> cervical vertebrae,[432] we need feel no surprise at the number of the cervical vertebrae in the fowl being, as it appears, variable. There are seven dorsal vertebrae bearing ribs; the first dorsal is never {267} anchylosed with the succeeding four, which are generally anchylosed together. In one Sultan fowl, however, the two first dorsal vertebrae were free. In two skeletons, the fifth dorsal was free; generally the sixth is free (as in _G....", "...entirely disregarding military usages and discipline, always rash in speech, act, and orders, refusing to inferior officers and their reports that consideration which is due an officer of the U.S. Army.

No effort was made by him to keep communication open behind us. It seemed he desired none. We had but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days' rations on hand. As soon as he reached a position on Grand River 14 miles from Fort Gibson his movements suddenly ceased. We could then have crossed the Arkansas River, but it seemed there was no object to be attained in his judgment by such a move. There we lay entirely idle from the 9th to the 19th. We had at last reached the point when we had but three days' rations on hand. Something must be done.

The afternoon was spent in the garden, the little girls betaking themselves to a pretty moss-covered arbour, where there was a grand doll's feast. Ida had no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> dolls, ranging from the magnificent Rosalind, who had real hair that could be brushed, and was as large as little Sally at home, down to poor little china Mildred, whose proper dwelling-place was a bath, and who had with great difficulty been put into petticoats enough to make her fit to be seen out of it. Now nobody at home could have saved the life of a doll for a single day, and Susan and Elizabeth were both thought far above them; but these beautifully arrayed young...", "...have come from Portsmouth in a boat.

There was much buzzing among the natives regarding our prospects for the day. I shall always think from their tone and manner, and the frequent repetition of the names of the three worst gulches, that the older men tried to dissuade us from going; but Deborah, who was very anxious to be at home by Sunday, said that the verdict was that if we started at once for our ride of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles we might reach Onomea before the freshet came on.

Why not tell the world that we will have failed in the one thing for which we set out if we evacuate Belgium?

In the year 1878 was announced one of the most fortunate discoveries known in the whole history of geological science--a discovery unique of its kind, and one which throws considerable light on the nature of the monster first discovered by Dr. Mantell. In that year came the good news that no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> Iguanodons had been found in the colliery of Bernissart, in Belgium, between Mons and Tournai, near the French frontier. The coal-bearing rocks (coal-measures) of this colliery, overlain by chalk and other deposits of later age, are fissured in many places by deep valleys or chasms more than 218 yards deep. Though now filled up, they must at one time have been open gorges on an old land surface.

This shows much less variety in the mental stock of ideas than I had expected, and makes us feel that the roadways of our minds are worn into very deep ruts. I conclude from the proved number of faint and...", "...being Christian, is at the very lowest calculation twenty. How is it possible that 'lives should be only thirty years, and reigns from twenty-two to twenty-five, if princes had not more common life than other men?' Mark again, the influence of religion in the duration of sovereignties. All the Christian reigns are longer than all the non-Christian reigns, ancient and modern, and Catholic reigns have been longer than Protestant reigns. The reigns in England, which averaged more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years before the Reformation, have only been seventeen years since that, and those of Sweden, which were twenty-two, have fallen to the same figure of seventeen. Denmark, however, for some unknown cause does not appear to have undergone this law of abbreviation; so, says De Maistre with rather unwonted restraint, let us abstain from generalising. As a matter of fact, however, the generalisation was complete in his own mind, and there was nothing inconsistent with his view...", "...in proper proportion is best fitted to withstand disease. Leading physicians believe that the greatest harm that comes from the use of alcohol lies in the fact that nothing else so weakens the resistance of the white corpuscles, and that therefore the person who is an habitual user of alcohol lacks the power to repel all classes of disease. English and American life insurance companies give us almost exactly the same figures, which show that of insured persons, the death rate is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> per cent. higher among those who use alcohol than among total abstainers. It is probable that the proportion of persons carrying life insurance is much less among the drinking classes and that if we had complete statistics the difference would be far greater than appears in the life insurance tables.

One of these had but one delegate and his vote was cast out by the rule requiring a State to be represented by at least two delegates to participate in a vote. Of the ten States remaining, seven must have at least two delegates of an affirmative mind from each to retain the clause. Six of these States voted solidly to keep the restriction, but the seventh State could not be secured, as Jefferson stated. Considered by our present method of voting, sixteen of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> delegates present voted affirmatively and seven negatively; yet the motion was lost and the clause struck out. Rarely has the power of a minority been so great. The individual may be allowed to hide the mass by being held too close to the vision.

The principle was most likely acknowledged at an earlier time. Simon de Montfort summoned only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> temporal peers to his famous parliament. In the year 1255 the barons complained that many of their number had not received their writs according to the tenor of the charter, and refused to grant an aid to the king till they were issued.[15] But it would have been easy to disappoint this mode of packing a parliament, if an unsummoned baron could have sat by mere right of his tenure.

It more than doubled again during the fifteen years preceding the last census; and the four years since that census have witnessed an increase of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> per cent. This final estimate is of course liable to correction by next year's census, but its error will be found on the side of under-statement, rather than of exaggeration.

In the afternoon the _Medusa_ ascended the river ten miles higher; but Captain Tarleton felt himself bound by his orders to return.

So she preserved his Bible, and kept his memory intact in her heart, for her own sake. To her dying day, for thirty-five years, she did not speak of him.

The specimen figured in Pl. 1, fig. 18, magnified about ten diameters, shews the appearance presented by an embryo of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> hours. The medullary groove (_mc_) has become much wider and deeper than it was in the earlier stage; the medullary folds (_A_) are also broader and more conspicuous. The medullary groove widens very much posteriorly, and also the medullary folds separate far apart to enclose the anterior end of the primitive groove (_pr_).

Seven of these have since vanished.

Yet it is not at all surprising that a process, offering the artistic qualities of reproduction which mezzotint possesses, should prove successful in the interpretation of such light and shade as, for example, Turner painted into his pictures. Turner was engaged upon the series of pictures for his _Liber Studiorum_ when he suddenly realised the value of mezzotint engraving. He consulted with Charles Turner, an eminent engraver, who afterwards executed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> of the _Liber Studiorum_ plates, and eventually decided to adopt a combination of etching with mezzotint for the reproduction of that famous series of pictures. The leading or essential lines of each picture were etched, probably by Turner himself, and the mezzotint added by other engravers. It is perhaps to some extent true that prints from mezzo plates lack somewhat in dignity of effect and fidelity of representation. They are suggestive rather than representative;...", "...and there, sure enough, was Gus Thomas, with one of his boys in tow.

Now it is evident, that it cannot apply to Jesus Christ; for if from going forth of the commandment in the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus, until the coming of the Messiah, there were to be seven weeks or forty-nine years, how does this agree with what follows? \"After threescore and two weeks (or three hundred and seventy-four years) shall Messiah be cut off.\" And again, \"He shall confirm the covenant with many for a week.\" Did then Jesus Christ live four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years, or are there two Messiahs predicted?

Railways received their great stimulus during the government of Sir Francis Hincks, who largely increased the debt of Canada by guaranteeing in 1852 the bonds of the Grand Trunk Railway--a noble, national work, now extending from Quebec to Lake Michigan, with branches in every direction, but whose early history was marred by jobbery and mismanagement, which not only ruined or crippled many of the original shareholders, but cost Canada eventually <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> million dollars. In 1864 there were two thousand miles of railway working in British North America, of which the Grand Trunk Railway owned at least one-half.

The clue to what follows is in the way he had developed during that long discouraging apprenticeship to greatness. Mentally, he had always been in isolation. Socially, he had lived in a near horizon.

It took four years in building, and was indeed of remarkable workmanship, with substantial masonry and the most exquisite elaborations of woodwork.

These savings were made out of a daily pay of one and threepence and a penny for beer-money, or equal to about nine and sixpence a week, subject to sundry deductions for extra clothing.

Since from fifteen _centumpondia_ of re-melted copper there was a total of four and a third _librae_ and a _semi-uncia_ of silver, there remain only two and a third _librae_.

These two substances have the convenient property of balancing each other's disadvantages. For instance, zinc oxide has a tendency to crack and to peal, which is overcome by the tougher coating formed by the white lead. Again, when white lead is exposed to light and weathering, it becomes chalky, which fault is remedied by the property possessed by zinc oxide, of remaining hard.

By boiling the oil with lead oxide or manganese oxide it can take more oxygen from the air, and thereby its drying powers are increased.

From this scene of festivity she returned home to meet a fresh sorrow in the sudden death, almost at the hour of her arrival, of Ann Eliza, daughter of her eldest sister Guelma and Aaron McLean, the best beloved of all her nieces. She was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, beautiful and talented, a good musician and an artist of fine promise. In her Miss Anthony had centered many hopes and ambitions, and the letters show that she was always planning and working for her future as she would have done for that of a cherished daughter.

Marion's troopers rushed in with a wild shout, and the attack went all one way. A large number were killed, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> were taken prisoners, and the supplies of the Tory camp were enjoyed by Marion's men for a long time. Not one of his force was lost. Soon after Gates's defeat, Marion learned by his scouts that the British were not far off with a large body of American prisoners. He sent at midnight a squad to hold the road to their camp, and before dawn he approached it silently with his own force. Just at daylight he made a sudden attack upon them.

(M159) On a great plain, four hundred miles in length and one hundred miles in width, forming the valley of the Euphrates, bounded on the north by Mesopotamia, on the east by the Tigris, on the south by the Persian Gulf, and on the west by the Syrian Desert, was established, at a very early period, the Babylonian monarchy. This plain, or valley, contains about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand square miles, equal to the Grecian territories. It was destitute of all striking natural features--furnishing an unbroken horizon. The only interruptions to the view on this level plain were sand-hills and the embankments of the river. The river, like the Nile, is subject to inundations, though less regular than the Nile, and this, of course, deposits a rich alluvial soil. The climate in summer is intensely hot, and in winter mild and genial. Wheat here is...", "...the human, the gallant, the inimitable Marbot!

And what a latent power there must be in this French nation which could go on pouring out the blood of its sons for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years with hardly a pause! It took all that time to work off the hot ferment which the Revolution had left in men's veins. And they were not exhausted, for the very last fight which the French fought was the finest of all.

Nothing was wanting to give dignity to the spectacle. Truce was made; the ramparts of this fortress-city in the mountains (which we cannot find on the map) were \"all beset with faire Dames and men in Armes\"; the Christians were drawn up in battle array; and upon the theatre thus prepared the Turkish Bashaw, armed and mounted, entered with a flourish of hautboys; on his shoulders were fixed a pair of great wings, compacted of eagles'...", "...man call at the office this afternoon?\" \"Oh, sir, yes, sir,--I--I--thought he was drunk and wouldn't let 'im in, sir; he's bin a standin' stampin' at the door for more than--\" The end of the sentence was cut short by Mr Denham suddenly ejecting the boy from the room and shouting, \"Let him in!\" In a few seconds a heavy tread was heard in the outer office, and the boy ushered in a tall young man, of unusually large proportions, with extremely broad shoulders, and apparently about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, whose rough pilot-coat, wide pantaloons, and glazed hat bespoke him a sailor.

The result is that there is as great a lack of agreement in regard to the time of Christ's death as there is in regard to the time of his birth.

We at once set to work, and with such material as we had at hand formed a slight barricade around us; this was formed of sacks of mealies (Indian corn), boxes of sea biscuits, &c., of which we had a good supply.

Having <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> sick men in the rooms, our officer, Lieutenant Bromhead, ordered six men into the hospital, myself being one of the number, to defend and rescue the sick from it. We had scarcely taken our post in the hospital when two out of our number were killed in the front or verandah, leaving four of us to hold the place and get out the sick. This was done by two (viz., Privates Hook and Williams) carrying the sick and passing them into the barricade through a small window, while...", "...and industrial state of the Yorubas formerly spread and wielded great influence. We find Yoruba reaching out and subduing states like Nupe toward the northward. But the industrial democracy and city autonomy of Yoruba lent itself indifferently to conquest, and the state fell eventually a victim to the fanatical Fula Mohammedans and was made a part of the modern sultanate of Gando. West of Yoruba on the lower courses of the Niger is Benin, an ancient state which in 1897 traced its <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> kings back one thousand years; some legends even named a line of sixty kings. It seems probable that Benin developed the imperial idea and once extended its rule into the Congo valley. Later and also to the west of the Yoruba come two states showing a fiercer and ruder culture, Dahomey and Ashanti. The state of Dahomey was founded by Tacondomi early in the seventeenth century, and developed into a fierce and bloody tyranny with wholesale murder. The king had a body of two...", "...it to Sindhia in exchange for Jhansi. In June 1857 the Gwalior soldiery mutinied and massacred the Europeans, but the Maharaja remained throughout loyal to the English Government.

In the changed circumstances of the country, and with regard to the modern developments of the art of war, the Gwalior fortress is now of slight military value. 27. The territory of the Dholpur chief is about fifty-four miles long by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> broad. The town of Dholpur is nearly midway between Agra and Gwalior.

No one, however, who had only known Richard prior to this period could realize how rapidly the new environment was to form and ripen his character. He was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age and a master of his trade. He had written two operas and saw little likelihood of either being played--for his advantage, at least. He had composed some instrumental things, but he knew that the theatre and not the concert-room was his vocation.

BURDETTE When Rollo was five years young, his father said to him one evening: \"Rollo, put away your roller skates and bicycle, carry that rowing machine out into the hall, and come to me. It is time for you to learn to read.\" Then Rollo's father opened the book which he had sent home on a truck and talked to the little boy about it. It was Bancroft's History of the United States, half complete in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> volumes. Rollo's father explained to Rollo and Mary his system of education, with special reference to Rollo's learning to read. His plan was that Mary should teach Rollo fifteen hours a day for ten years, and by that time Rollo would be half through the beginning of the first volume, and would like it very much indeed. Rollo was delighted at the prospect. He cried aloud: \"Oh, papa! thank you very much.

Burnes barricaded his house, but was soon environed by an angry mob of Afghans. He sent an urgent message to the British cantonment for a battalion of infantry, and two field-pieces, which at that early hour could have penetrated the city and effected his deliverance. But the danger was underrated, and no force was sent lest it should offend Shah Shuja. That same afternoon the gateway of the house was burnt down by the mob, and Burnes and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> others were brutally murdered. [Sidenote: Afghan revolt.] By this time the outbreak had culminated in an insurrection. The population of the villages round about had joined the rioters, and thousands of Afghans were hurrying into the city of Cabul in the hope of plunder.

He reigned in Jerusalem; and his mother was Hamutal, of the city Libhah.

He fell at the foot of Pompey's statue, pierced with no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> wounds. His body was burnt on a pyre in the Forum, and his friend, Antony, pronounced the funeral eulogy. CONSEQUENCES OF CAESAR'S DEATH In the light of all the possibilities of beneficent government which Caesar was revealing, his cowardly murder becomes one of the most stupendous follies recorded in history.

The appointment of George Neville, who had been nominated when only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> to the see of Exeter, was a purely political one, the bestowing of a high and lucrative office on a member of a noble family that was enjoying the full sunshine of popularity and power.

Criminals have been flogged, mutilated and maimed, tortured in a thousand ways, and the only effect was to demoralize, harden and degrade society and increase the number of crimes. In the army and navy, soldiers and sailors were flogged to death, and everywhere by church and state the torture of the helpless was practiced and upheld. Only a few years ago there were two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> offences punished with death in England. Those who wished to reform this savage code were denounced as the enemies of morality and law. They were regarded as weak and sentimental.

But during the night the fires became extinguished, and, a dense fog having arisen, our blankets were saturated with water when...", "...shut the windows of the sky, Through which Aurora shows her brightening face; You cannot bar my constant feet to trace The woods and lawns, by living streams at eve: Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace, And I their toys to the great children leave: Of fancy, reason, virtue, naught can me bereave.\"_ THOMSON.

She sat to John Lucas for the picture in her serene old age, and the likeness is faultless. She had proposed to herself to leave the portrait, as it was her own property, to me in her will; but as I happened to be in England during the latter part of her life, she altered her determination, and gave it to me from her own hands.

What is the quantity of paper demanded by the present British periodical press, I am unable to state. In this month of January, 1852, it is calculated that there are about three thousand different newspapers and other periodicals printed in this country, the entire issues of which approach the yearly aggregate of four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> millions of numbers. When Franklin was a printer it was a hard task to work off over a thousand sheets on both sides in a day, by the hand press. Since his time we have had the Clymer, the Napier, the Ramage, the Adams, and now Hoe's Lightning press. By this last-named achievement in the arts, so honorable to a son of New-York, and so stupendous in its results to the world at large, twenty thousand papers may be printed in one hour.

He won for himself much gratitude, not only by his zealous work in war time, but by the skill and patience with which he sought to reduce the plague which raged in Greece in 1827 and 1828. Two proofs of the popularity which he fairly won are as follows. The first, dated the 17th of June, 1828, was signed by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> leading inhabitants of Poros. \"Nous citoyens de Poros, reconnaissant dans la personne de M. le Docteur Louis Andre Gosse, un homme anime du philhellenisme le plus sincere et doue de vertus eminentes, considerant son zele ardent et infatigable pourtant en ce qui concerne le bien de la patrie et pour la cause sacree de la Grece et en particulier temoins des soins philanthropiques qu'il a prodigues aux indigens, persuades d'autre part que ses qualites rares...", "...sensation of unreality.

But, luckily, there exists in the Cabinet at Berlin a set of coarse enlarged drawings in Indian ink, on brownish paper, of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> of the series. These are in circular form; and were apparently intended as sketches for glass painting. That they are copied from the woodcuts is demonstrable, first, because they are not reversed as they would have been if they were the originals; and, secondly, because one of them, No. 36 (\"The Duchess\"), repeats the conjoined \"H.L.\" on the bed, which initials are held to be the monogram of the woodcutter, and not to be part of the original design.

The lowest value it can attain is about 30,000,000 miles; the highest value is about 43,000,000 miles. In accordance with Kepler's second law, the velocity of the planet must exhibit corresponding changes. It must sweep rapidly around that part of his path near the sun, and more slowly round the remote parts of his path. The greatest velocity is about thirty-five miles a second, and the least is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles a second. For an adequate conception of the movements of Mercury we ought not to dissociate the velocity from the true dimensions of the body by which it is performed. No doubt a speed of twenty-nine miles a second is enormous when compared with the velocities with which daily life makes us familiar. The speed of the planet is not less than a hundred times as great as the velocity of the rifle bullet.

And the thing which was bound to happen did happen, in the most simple and loving manner, permitted by the mother herself, who, full of contempt for a social system which allowed those of good hearts to die of hunger, refused to admit the necessity of any social tie. Thus there was no question of a regular marriage. One day Guillaume, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, found himself mated to Marguerite, who was twenty; both of them handsome, healthy, and strong, adoring one another, loving work, and full of hope in the future. From that moment a new life began. Since his father's death, Guillaume, who had broken off all intercourse with his mother, had been receiving an allowance of two hundred francs a month. This just represented daily bread; however, he was already doubling the amount by his work as a chemist,--his...", "...Senate and House representation; nor yet to the State Legislatures, because of the unequal sizes of the States; but to a set of electors to be chosen by the States, a kind of substitute for these various plans.

In very truth it may be said that the entire document is made up of a series of compromises.

She completed her conquest at the dinner-table by the display of a wit which I greatly admired. It is rare in Italy, and seems to belong generally to the daughters of France. I did not think it would be very difficult to win her love, and I resolved on trying.

It seemed to me that the captain himself would not raise any great objection, for he seemed one of those men who, treating love as a matter of pure fancy, accept all circumstances easily, and give way good-naturedly to all the freaks of fortune.

No part of the machine has been found strong enough to withstand the friction upon it for any considerable portion of time. The union nut has proved its weakest point, and the breaking of this generally destroys that part of the piston to which it is attached. Another point of weakness is the feed ratchet-band, the springs of which are almost continually breaking. The machine consists of eighty pieces; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> of which are screws, fifteen pins, and seven pieces of cast iron. It weighs 240 pounds, runs about 200 strokes per minute, and costs about $400. Its longest run without breaking has been five days. The run of one of them two days without breaking during the time, is considered fortunate. The average breaking is more than one a day.

An attempt was then made to prove that Lambert had murdered Poindexter; but it entirely failed, there being no evidence that the two men had ever so much as met, and there being no conceivable motive for the murder. Lambert, therefore, was permitted to enter undisturbed upon his inheritance; for he had no difficulty in establishing the fact of the elder Lambert's marriage to an Italian woman <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years before. The marriage had been a secret one, and soon after a violent quarrel had taken place between the wife and husband, and they had separated. The following month Giovanni was born prematurely. He had seen his father but once. The quarrel was never made up, but Lambert sent his wife, from time to time, money enough for her support. She had died about ten years ago, and had given her son the papers to establish his identity, telling him that the day would come to...", "...the food is made soft in the crop, and then fed to the young ones, as I told you. Birds have no teeth, yet they eat hard seeds, like acorns and grains of corn. To break these up, and get them ready for the stomach, they have a gizzard, which is a sort of grinding-mill. And to help in the work of grinding they swallow small stones. One of the wonderful things about birds is the height at which they can live, and not only live, but fly. A man cannot go higher than twenty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand feet, while moving about or exercising, because the air is so rare he cannot breathe. The highest a man was ever known to go and live, it is said, was less than thirty thousand feet, and that was in a balloon, where he did not move. But birds go a good deal higher than this, and can fly--which is violent exercise--at that height. It is thought by some that the thinness of the air may be the cause of the great speed with which birds fly in that region. But there...", "...A greater dramatist than these showed how Spanish romance could coalesce with French tragedy in a drama which marks an epoch--the _Cid_; and the _Cid_, calling forth the judgment of the Academy, served to establish the supremacy of the so-called rules of Aristotle. PIERRE CORNEILLE, son of a legal official, was born at Rouen in 1606. His high promise as a pupil of the Jesuits was not confirmed when he attempted to practise at the bar; he was retiring, and spoke with difficulty. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> his first dramatic piece, _Melite_, a comedy, suggested, it is told, by an adventure of his youth, was given with applause in Paris; it glitters with points, and is of a complicated intrigue, but to contemporaries the plot appeared less entangled and the style more natural than they seem to modern readers. The tragi-comedy, _Clitandre_, which followed (1632), was a romantic drama, crowded with extravagant incidents, after the manner of Hardy. In _La Veuve_ he returned to...", "...to the Privy Council against the Charter.

As long as the canal remained blocked, German submarines detailed for operating against Allied commerce in the English Channel and other waters outside the North Sea were, for the most part, compelled to do so from the Heligoland Bight.

Furthermore that about one pound of phosphorus per acre is lost annually in drainage water in humid regions. By dividing 1200 by 24 it is easy to see that fifty corn crops such as we ought to try to raise would require as much phosphorus as the present supply in our soil to a depth of about seven inches.

In the next class of games were the shows of gladiators; they were first exhibited at Rome by two brothers called Bruti, at the funeral of their father, and for some time they were only exhibited on such occasions; but afterwards, also by the magistrates, to entertain the people, chiefly at the _saturnalia_ and feasts of Minerva. Incredible numbers of men were destroyed in this manner; after the triumph of Trajan over the Dacians, spectacles were exhibited for one hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days, in which eleven thousand animals, of different kinds, were killed, and ten thousand gladiators fought, whence we may judge of other instances. The emperor Claudius, although naturally of a gentle disposition, is said to have been rendered cruel by often attending these spectacles. Gladiators were at first composed of slaves and captives, or of condemned malefactors, but afterwards also of free born citizens, induced by hire or inclination.

It should be added that the numbers are those of the Public Acts alone, and they would be much higher, particularly in the later years, if the Local and Private Acts were included in the enumeration.

Whatever things contributed to the growing evil repute of smallpox among epidemic maladies, there is so much concurrent testimony to the fact itself that we can hardly take it to have been wholly illusion. In some parts the mildness of smallpox was still asserted as if due to local advantages.

In 1831 he was a county auditor. In 1834 he was elected to the State Legislature, and re-elected four times, consecutively. He was speaker of the House in 1838, 1839 and 1840. In 1842 he was secretary of the land office of Pennsylvania. During his first term as speaker, the public commotion occurred, known as the \"Buckshot War.\" Troops surrounded...", "...with creeping things, damp and reeking with vapors, and dripping with moisture.

The focus of the ecclesiastico-political projects of Gregory VII. is to be found in his relationship with Germany. Since the death of Henry III. the strength of the monarchy in that country had been seriously impaired, and his son Henry IV. had to contend with great internal difficulties. This state of affairs was of material assistance to the pope. His advantage was still further accentuated by the fact that in 1073 Henry was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age and by temperament inclined to precipitate action. Many sharp lessons were needful before he learned to bridle his impetuosity, and he lacked the support and advice of a disinterested and experienced statesman.

He had won his reputation by that explosion of gaiety and imagination, _Les Contes d'Espagne el d'Italle_. He had written some fine poetry, dreamy, disturbing and daring. He had also given _Les Caprices de Marianne_, in which he figures twice over himself, for he was both Octave the sceptic, the disillusioned man, and Coelio, the affectionate, candid Coelio.

Encouraged by his easy success as a highwayman on the great maritime roads, he thought that if he could acquire some honour and glory while engaged in making his fortune, so much the better would it be for him. With this idea he bought three ships, the _Desire_, of twenty tons, the _Content_, of sixty tons, and the _Hugh Gallant_, of forty tons, upon which he embarked one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> soldiers and sailors. Setting sail on the 22nd July, 1586, he passed by the Canaries, and landed at Sierra Leone, which town he attacked and plundered; then, sailing again, he crossed the Atlantic, sighted Cape Sebastian in Brazil, sailed along the coast of Patagonia, and arrived on the 27th November at Port Desire.

The same year that Cinna died, Sulla landed at Brundisium, with 40,000 troops and a large following of nobles who had fled from Rome. Every preparation was made by the Marian party for his reception; but no sooner did he land in Italy than the soldiers were induced to desert to him in immense numbers, and he soon found himself in possession of all Lower Italy. Among those who hastened to his standard was young POMPEY, then but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, and it was to his efforts that Sulla's success was largely due. The next year, 83, the Marian party was joined by the Samnites, and the war raged more fiercely than ever. At length, however, Sulla was victorious under the walls of Rome. The city lay at his mercy.

Napoleon excelled all modern generals in the celerity of his movements. Others have made for a single day as extraordinary marches as the French, but for general activity during a campaign they have no rivals in modern history.

ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR, 44 B.C. Caesar did not live to complete his task. Like that other colossal figure, Alexander the Great, he perished before his work as a statesman had hardly more than begun. On the Ides of March, 44 B.C., he was struck down in the Senate-house by the daggers of a group of envious and irreconcilable nobles, headed by Cassius and Brutus. He fell at the foot of Pompey's statue, pierced with no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> wounds. His body was burnt on a pyre in the Forum, and his friend, Antony, pronounced the funeral eulogy. CONSEQUENCES OF CAESAR'S DEATH In the light of all the possibilities of beneficent government which Caesar was revealing, his cowardly murder becomes one of the most stupendous follies recorded in history. Caesar's death could not restore the republic. It served only to prolong disorder and strife within the Roman state.

An untangling at once commenced, and he said, \"consarned if he ever saw so many snakes before.\" Upon going to the place where he had shot, he found 150 snakes dead, and as many more wounded. He carried some of the largest of the dead out, procured a ten-foot rod, and on measuring found one that measured <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> feet.

Although the Dismal Swamp is so uninviting, it is one of the healthiest places in the United States. Death from disease has never been known in that place, and it is impossible to tell what age one would attain if they would take up their abode in it. I have been told...", "...to the various states the measures of taxation which were deemed necessary for the support of the army. It had no authority to raise taxes in any state, nor had it any power to constrain the government of a state to raise taxes. The states were accordingly all delinquent, and there was no resource left for Congress but to issue its promissory notes. Congress already owed more than forty million dollars, and during the first half of the year 1778 the issues of paper money amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> millions. The depreciation had already become alarming, and the most zealous law-making was of course powerless to stop it.

At the time of the Declaration of Independence a committee had been appointed by Congress to prepare articles of confederation, to be submitted to the states for their approval. These articles were...", "...and that indigestion, headaches, with a looming hopeless breakdown of body and mind made his life a burden and a curse.

His life was a continuous alternation of small doses of work and large doses of rest. So he was enabled to publish <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> volumes of original writing and fifty-one scientific papers. Living a sort of quasi-sanitarium life, with the rules and regulations of one undergoing a rest cure for thirty-six years, he thus accomplished infinitely more than the millions who have led the strenuous life.

The fleet, which sailed in August, numbered thirty-four ships, carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> hundred men and a considerable equipment. Sir William Phips, the leader of the expedition, was not an Englishman by birth, but a New Englander of very humble origin who owed his advancement to a robust physique and unlimited assurance.

But if so it evidently created no impression on his mind. In the debate on the Army Estimates he followed Captain TRYON, who had delivered an urgent appeal to the Government from the text, \"A strong Army and a shorter War.\" Mr. PRINGLE'S ideal is just the reverse. In his view the Army is too big already, and is taking too great a toll from our industrial and commercial population. The great men who won the Napoleonic War--after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years--had not a big army; and the consequence was that, while it was going on, British trade expanded by leaps and bounds. To-day, owing to our disastrous military policy the demands upon our tonnage were so heavy that people had to go short of sugar and tobacco.

The services which Aguinaldo and his adherents rendered in preparing the way for attack on Manila are certainly entitled to consideration, but, after all, they were small in comparison with what was done by our fleet and army. There is no reason to believe that Aguinaldo's Government has any elements of stability. In the first place, Aguinaldo is a young man of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years. Prior to the insurrection of 1896 he had been a schoolmaster, and afterward Gobernadorcillo and Municipal Captain in one of the pueblos in the Province of Cavite.

He remained alone to the end of his term, faithfully complying with every condition of his indenture. In 1800 Mr. Davis, then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, hired a shop on Union Street, and started in business for himself as a brass founder.

This development has been reached by the time the young man is twenty-one to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, when, in the average case, he would be able, so far as concerns his physique and temperament, to establish and maintain a home. The fact that his adolescent development is complete by the age of twenty-five, and that he has, by the time he arrives at that age, grown into the full stature of all his physical and mental powers, may certainly be interpreted as nature's indication that his home-building should be begun not later than the twenty-fifth year.

Then there was the distance from the window to the dressing table, at least eight feet more, to be added, making necessary a rod over thirty feet long. And he saw at a glance that even could a rod of this length be secured and handled, the angle made by a line from the dormer window through Ruth's window was such that the end of the rod or pole would strike the floor only a few feet beyond the windowsill, and in no possible way could its further end...", "...after St. Paul had preached the Gospel to them, were seduced by some false teachers, who had been Jews and who were for obliging all Christians, even those who had been Gentiles, to observe circumcision and the other ceremonies of the Mosaical law.

He too died in a short time before my arrival in this country; and the son of his sister, Mrs. Kerr, is at present the hereditary chief of the Six Nations. They consist at present of two thousand five hundred, out of the seven or eight thousand who first settled here. Here, as everywhere else, the decrease of the Indian population settled on the reserved lands is uniform. The white population throughout America is supposed to double itself on an average in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years; in about the same proportion do the Indians perish before them. The interests and property of these Indians are at present managed by the Government. The revenue arising from the sale of their lands is in the hands of commissioners, and much is done for their conversion and civilisation. It will, however, be the affair of two, or three, or more generations; and by that time not many, I am afraid, will be left. Consumption makes dreadful havoc among them. At...", "...on this march and as we approached a road that led to Raccoon Ford a little way off to the right, General Reno rode up to the head of the column and showed some anxiety. The Confederates had something of a force at Raccoon Ford and he, I imagine, knew we were running pretty close to them. They did not attempt to disturb us, however; they very likely did not know we were passing so near them, and we sped along, reaching Kelley's Ford about noon the 19th, having marched a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles. The last mile before we reached the ford the road ran along near the river bank. It was hot and dusty, and the sight of that cool fresh water was too great a temptation for three of us boys, so down we went, stripped off and took a duck. We had no more than got into the water when we heard firing just behind us. The Johnnies' cavalry had overtaken us and had opened fire on the boys up in the road. We caught up our clothing and trappings and ran along beside the...", "...to recall it, you will remember that the winter of 1904-05 was very cold; even colder, about Whitby, than the previous cold winter had been. Toward the end of January, not only was Whitby Harbor frozen, but there was fairly solid ice for miles out into the bay. Whitby, not being, in general, prepared for such winters, was not provided with boats especially designed for breaking the ice. The two tugs had kept a channel open as long as they could; but one night the temperature fell to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> below zero and the morning found them fast bound in their docks. So they decided to give it up--making a virtue of necessity--and to wait; which was a decision reached after several hours of silent conference between the tugboat captains, during which conference they smoked several pipes apiece and looked out, from the snug pilothouse of the Arethusa, over the glittering surface. At a quarter to twelve Captain Hannibal let his chair down upon its four feet and thoughtfully...", "...of his personal influence he organized levies of the Sikhs who had just been defeated, led them now against a chief in the upper hills and now to storm the fort of a raja in the lower, till he so welded the people into a loyal mass that he was ready to repeat the service of 1846 when, three years after, the second Sikh War ended in the conversion of the Punjab up to Peshawar into a British province. Lord Dalhousie had to devise a government for a warlike population now numbering <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> millions, and covering an area little less than that of the United Kingdom. The first results were not hopeful; and it was not till John Lawrence became chief commissioner, and stood alone face to face with the chiefs and people and ring fence of still untamed border tribes, that there became possible the most successful experiment in the art of civilizing turbulent millions which history presents. The province was mapped out into districts, now numbering thirty-two, in...", "...God for the privilege of cherishing _such_ a memory. Small wonder to us then, when tragedies such as this were brought home to us, that in the camps the thin tents, torn to ribbons by the storm, afforded no protection to the scantily-clothed, half-famished inmates! That the death-rate was not higher during the winter months we owe entirely to the overcrowding of the tents, there being in Hansie's ward at Irene many bell-tents, destined to accommodate six, holding from sixteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> persons for many months. But what was an advantage during the winter months became a source of great danger when the heat of summer came. To return to our story. It was Hansie's privilege--yes, privilege--to act as one of the volunteer nurses from Pretoria during that very winter of 1901, and though it is not my intention to record in this book the experience connected with that period, I do not think it will be out of place here to mention an important result of that...", "...come home drunk, and if any body made him angry out from home, he would come home and take his spite out of his people.\" He owned three grown men, two women and six children.

Eliza Jane was a tall, dark, young woman, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age, and had been held to service by a widow woman, named Sally Spiser, who was \"anything but a good woman.\" The place of her habitation was in Delaware, between Concord and Georgetown. Eliza Jane's excuse for leaving was this: She charged her mistress with trying to work her to death, and with unkind treatment generally. When times became so hard that she could not stand her old mistress \"Sally\" any longer, she \"took out.\" Harriet did not come in company...", "...Bruce of St. Regis. The following day, the 8th, Lord Avonmore requested of me seven men and a foreman, to go with him up to the Dal cataract to be stationed there, owing probably, as I thought to myself, that Col. Alleyne considered the Dal the most difficult. I pointed out Peter Canoe as the most experienced boatman I had, and as he does not speak English, James Deer went as their interpreter. I received orders for myself to go down with the rest of my men to Gemai. At Gemai I found <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> light boats manned by Dongolese. Placing a captain in each boat we started, but were disappointed to find that these men had never seen a boat nor used an oar. With the help of the usual north wind we managed to ascend in good time to Sarras. On the way up we had to teach one man to steer and then go round to each man and teach him to row. Neither understanding one word of the other's language, this was a terrible task. I had however, been long enough in contact with...", "...Saxony, Sweden, and Silesia. Charles, while all powerful in those parts, had obliged the emperor Joseph to take a hundred and five churches from the catholics in favour of the Silesians of the confession of Augsburg. The catholics then no sooner received news of the defeat of Charles, than they repossessed themselves of all the Lutheran temples. The Saxons now thought of nothing but being revenged for the extortions of a conqueror, who had robbed them, according to their own account, of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> millions of crowns. The king of Poland, their elector, immediately protested against the abdication that had been extorted from him, and being now reconciled to the czar (Aug. 3.), he left no stone unturned to reascend the Polish throne. Sweden, overwhelmed with consternation, thought her king for a long time dead, and in this uncertainty the senate knew not what to resolve. Peter in the mean time determined to make the best use of his victory, and therefore...", "...his expedition to the road of Puna and Guayaquil, where he had burnt two ships and captured a third. He had also taken Guayaquil after considerable loss, and finding it untenable, and not having boats to carry away the booty, he had set it on fire, burning a great quantity of rich goods in the warehouses, after which he reimbarked his men. The Dutch fleet sailed from the island of Lima on the 14th of August, and anchored that same evening in a bay behind the Piscadores islands, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles north, where they watered. Continuing their course on the 16th, they came in sight of the island of Santa Clara, or Amortajado, on the 24th, intending once more to visit Guayaquil. The fleet anchored on the 25th in the road of the island of Puna, whence all the people had fled, both Spanish and Indians, so that no intelligence could be procured of the strength and dispositions of the enemy. On the 27th, the guns, ballast, and stores of all kinds were removed from...", "...four Indians, who had also been fortunate enough to save themselves by flight, confidently asserted, as we were so long in returning, that we must have been killed. Luis Marin, who likewise gave us up for lost, had already, as was customary at that time, divided our Indian commendaries among the other Conquistadores, and had written to Cortes for fresh indentures to convey the property; besides that, he had sold off all our moveable goods by public auction. However, after the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days, we again, to the surprise of all, made our reappearance in Guacasualco, where our friends were indeed delighted to see us, but those who had obtained our possessions drew very long faces. Luis Marin was at length fully convinced that he should never be able to put down the rebellion in the provinces, unless he was allowed a stronger body of troops, for now he was sacrificing the lives of the few men he had to no purpose. He resolved therefore to repair in person...", "...that the _plein-air_ artist, the luminarist, the impressionist, owe no small share of their knowledge to his inspiration. The name of Tiepolo brings before us a whole string of illustrious personages--doges and senators, magnificent procurators and great captains--but we have nothing to prove that the artist belonged to a decayed branch of the famous patrician house. Born in Castello, the people's quarter of Venice, he studied in early youth with that good draughtsman, Lazzarini. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> he married the sister of Francesco Guardi; Guardi, who comes between Longhi and Canale and who is a better painter than either. Tiepolo appeared at a fortunate moment. The demand for a facile, joyous genius was at its height. The life of the aristocracy on the lagoons was every year growing more gay, more abandoned to capricious inclination, to light loves and absurd amusements. And the art which reflected this life was called upon to give gaiety rather than thought,...", "...1842 till May 1843; and in the summer of '43, Phalanxes by the dozen were on the march for the new world of wealth and harmony. On the fifth of October 1843, Brisbane entered upon his third advance-movement by establishing in New York City, an independent paper called THE PHALANX, devoted to the doctrines of Fourier, and edited by himself and Osborne Macdaniel. It professed to be a monthly, but was published irregularly the latter part of its time. The volume we have consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> numbers, the first of which is dated October 5, 1843, and the last May 28, 1845. In the first number Brisbane gives the following condensed statement of practical experiments then existing or contemplated, which may be considered the results of his previous labors, and especially of his fourteen months _reveille_ in the _Tribune_: \"In Massachusetts, already there are three small Associations, viz., the Roxbury Community near Boston, founded by the Rev....", "...1A committee for the county and borough of Norfolk and town of Portsmouth, Virginia.

The tragedy of his life cannot be told too often, and may be told again here.[13] For want of the final proof that bacteriology, and the inoculation of animals, alone could give, he was unable to hold out against his enemies till Pasteur could rescue him.

For many years, the mortality in the lying-in wards had been about 1.25 per cent., and no more. Then, under a new professor, it had risen; and, for some years before Semmelweis came on the scene, it had been 5 per cent., or even 7 per cent. In October 1841, there had been an epidemic that had lasted till May 1843. In these twenty months, out of...", "...heresies if he could thereby save his life. When the proposition was made to him, he accepted it with eagerness. His punishment was to be commuted into the hardly less severe one of perpetual imprisonment; but he was too happy to escape the clutch of the executioner at any price, and he made the amende honorable in face of the assembled multitudes of Rome on the 27th of October 1672. He was then transferred to the prisons of the Castle of St. Angelo, where he remained till his death, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years afterwards. It is said that, towards the close of his life, considerable indulgence was granted him; that he was allowed to have a laboratory, and to cheer the solitude of his dungeon by searching for the philosopher's stone. Queen Christina, during her residence at Rome, frequently visited the old man, to converse with him upon chemistry and the doctrines of the Rosicrucians. She even obtained permission that he should leave his prison occasionally for a day or two,...", "...brilliant investor, and through his long business life, which lasted until 1901, he followed the growth of railroads in the United States with steady optimism, and almost unvarying profit.

He at once interested himself in local enterprises, and Akin Hall Association and Mizzen-Top Hotel were at that time founded by him and others. Until his death, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years later, he was the leading citizen and the most interesting personality among this social population. Such was his place and so masterful as well as constructive his influence that it was a true expression of the feeling of all which one resident wrote at that time to another: \"The king is dead, the man on whom we unconsciously leaned and whom none of us thought of disobeying, though only his personality held us to allegiance, is gone from us.

All the earlier submarines were equipped with engines which used gasolene (petrol) as a fuel, but the gas from this fuel, when mixed with a proper proportion of air, is highly explosive.

The most disastrous was that on board the Italian submarine _Foca_, in which it is reported that <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> men were killed. Therefore, several years ago, all governments demanded the installation of engines using a non-explosive fuel; and builders then turned to the \"Diesel\" engine as offering a solution of the problem.

The returns for 1904 omitted certain classes previously enumerated so that for comparative purposes the figures given have to be corrected. On the corrected basis these reports show that the total number of prisoners in the United States increased from 6,737 in 1850 to about 100,000 in 1904, while the total population increased during the same time only from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> to eighty millions (Fig. 2). The ratio of prisoners to the total population is of course the significant relation here, and this increased from 29 per 100,000 in 1850 to 125 per 100,000 in 1904. Not all of this increase can be attributed to more rigid enforcement of the law or raised standards of morality; there is some reason for thinking that whatever change there has been in these respects has tended to have the opposite effect.

Chasser speaks of a case in which there was concurrent pregnancy in both the uterus and the Fallopian tube. Smith cites an instance of a woman of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> who became pregnant in August, 1870. In the following December she passed fetal bones from the rectum, and a month later gave birth to an intrauterine fetus of six months' growth.

The _Nobla Leyczon_ containing a brief narration of the contents of the Old and New Testaments confirms this opinion. It opposes, however, the old law to the new, making them antagonistic.

Kirby would not, in my opinion, have numbered years he was proud of below their due quantity. He was more, if he died at ninety-one; and Chillon Switzer John Kirby, born eleven months after the elopement, was, we know, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old when the old man gave up the ghost and bequeathed him little besides a law-suit with the Austrian Government, and the care of Carinthia Jane, the second child of this extraordinary union; both children born in wedlock, as you will hear.

But even during these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years, the price of silver was so low that home production was given up because it did not pay off. In the eighteenth century, silver again continued to enter China, while silk and tea were exported. This demand led to a strong rise in the prices of silk and tea, and benefited the merchants.

Mr. and Mrs. Severance and I have just returned from a three-days' expedition to Puna in the south of Hawaii, and I preferred their agreeable company even to solitude! My sociable Kahele was also pleased, and consequently behaved very well. We were compelled to ride for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> miles in single file, owing to the extreme narrowness of the lava track, which has been literally hammered down in some places to make it passable even for shod horses. We were a party of four, and a very fat policeman on a very fat horse brought up the rear.

The country at this time was ruled by Alfred, the grandson of Egbert. Alfred came to the throne in 871 A.D., when he was only about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old. In spite of his youth, he showed himself the right sort of leader for the hard-pressed West Saxons. For several years fortune favored the Danes. Then the tide turned. Issuing from the marshes of Somersetshire, where he had rallied his dispirited troops, Alfred suddenly fell on the enemy and gained a signal success. The beaten Danes agreed to make peace and to accept the religion of their conquerors. THE DANELAW Alfred's victory did not end the war.

At this time Astoria, or _Fort George_, as the British traders called it, contained sixty-five inmates, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> of whom were whites, and the remainder Canadian half-breeds and Sandwich Islanders. Besides this number of men, there were a few women, the native wives of the men, and their half-breed offspring.

Diana is never abrupt; her voice is ever modulated to soft, even tones; she rises from a chair or couch with the lithe, sinuous motion of a serpent uncoiling. Her face, critically regarded, is not so admirable as her form.

He could not have been more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age while still playing with the Queen's Children in 1608; and he would certainly not have been styled \"sole king of actors\" at that age.

On the other hand Dr Copinger's _Supplement_ had hardly appeared before additional lists began to be issued registering books unknown both to him and to Hain, and the new _Repertorium_, begun in 1905, under the auspices of the German government, seemed likely to register, on its completion, not fewer than thirty...", "...strength of the seven[15] German Corps on that day amounted to 178,818 men.

Whereas by the war-establishment the average is one officer to every forty men, in this battle one officer fell to every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> men; glorious testimony to the example set by their leaders to their brave men, but also a loss which could not be restored during the course of the war. Altogether the six battles fought in the first fourteen days of August had cost the German army 50,000 men.[16] It was naturally impossible immediately to call out at home a sufficient levy in substitution for the losses; but reinforcements drawn from the time-expired cadres were already bespoken.

Of the eighty-six English officers all but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> were killed or disabled, and but a remnant of the soldiers escaped. When the Indians returned to the Fort, they brought with them twelve or fourteen prisoners, their bodies blackened and their hands tied behind their backs.

The loss of the French was slight; of the regulars there were but four killed or wounded, and all the Canadians returned to the Fort unhurt except five.

After we had passed over this desert, we found several garisons to defend the caravans from the violence of the Tartars.

At this place, the Spaniards, in the year 1581, built a town, which they called Phillippeville, and left in it a colony, consisting of 400 persons.

It is, however, in the territory about the Great Lakes that the greatest interest now centers, for in this region a very interesting problem of origin is being worked out.

But the only preliminary concession that Sigismund and his party could obtain was the issue of a decree in October, 1417, that another council should meet within five years, a second within seven years, and that afterward a council should be regularly held every ten years. For the new election it was decided that the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> cardinals should be joined by thirty delegates of the council, six from each nation. The conclave met on November 8th, and three days later their choice fell upon Cardinal Oddo Colonna, who took the name of Martin V.

But their fears as to the ultimate fate of the cause of reform were fully justified.

Sulla was away in the East, and did not return till 83 B.C. In the interval was that period of peace, fit for study, of which Cicero afterward spoke. \"Triennium fere fuit urbs sine armis.\"[54] Cicero was then twenty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, and must well have understood, from his remembrance of the Marian massacres, what it was to have the city embroiled by arms.

The Red Star line followed in 1821, and soon after the Swallowtail line. The packets were ships of from six hundred to fifteen hundred tons burden, and made the eastward trip in about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> days and the return trip in about forty days.

For several generations previous the representatives of the family had withdrawn themselves from any active participation in public affairs, and living here at small expense upon their lands, which were at that time very large, had amassed a quantity of wealth that, for the age, might fairly be called enormous. Thus, Sir Stephen de la Molle, the grandfather of the Sir James who lived in the time of James I., left to his son, also named Stephen, a sum of no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand pounds in gold. This Stephen was a great miser, and tradition says that he trebled the sum in his lifetime. Anyhow, he died rich as Croesus, and abominated alike by his tenants and by the country side, as might be expected when a gentleman of his race and fame degraded himself, as this Sir Stephen undoubtedly did, to the practice of usury. \"With the next heir, Sir James, however, the old spirit of the de la Molles seems to have revived, although it is...", "...answer. In fact, he had scarce looked at it, ere he threw it on the table with a violent movement of ill humour. This slip of deer-skin contained the sale of the valley and the surrounding territory made by Itsichaiche or Monkey-face, one of the principal sachems of the Snake Pawnees, in his name and that of the other chiefs of the nation, in exchange for fifty muskets, fourteen dozen scalping-knives, sixty pounds of gunpowder, sixty pounds of bullets, two barrels of whisky, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> complete militia uniforms. Each of the chiefs had placed his hieroglyphic at the foot of the deed, beneath that of Monkey-face. We will say at once that this deed was false, and the Captain in the affair was the perfect dupe of Monkey-face. This chief, who had been expelled from the tribe of Snake Pawnees for various causes, as we shall reveal at the proper moment, had forged the deed, first to rob the Captain, and next to avenge himself on his countrymen; for he...", "...of sadness and mourning\": \"Dark tree! still sad when others' grief is fled-- The only constant mourner of the dead.\"--BYRON. \"Perhaps the oldest tree on record is the Cypress of Somma, in Lombardy. It is supposed to have been planted in the year of the birth of Christ, and on that account is looked upon with reverence by the inhabitants; but an ancient chronicle at Milan is said to prove that it was a tree in the time of Julius Caesar, B.C. 42. It is one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> feet high, and twenty-three feet in circumference at one foot from the ground. Napoleon, when laying down the plan for his great road over the Simplon, diverged from a straight line to avoid injuring this tree.\"[1] [1] Mass.

They were often of vast size, sometimes girting...", "...any girls of their own rank or circumstances, and that they had been carefully and systematically taught to make them in the best manner possible. The only instructions which they had received from one of their own sex had been given to them by an excellent plain needlewoman, a first-class dressmaker, and a fashionable milliner; and in the last two branches Elsie's taste had made her excel her sister even more than in French and Italian. At the time of their uncle's death, Jane was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years old, and Elsie two years younger. They had but very recently given up regular study, for their uncle thought girls were far too soon \"finished\", as it is called, and turned out in a very incomplete state of mental and moral development. He would not let them think themselves educated till they had seen more of the world than could be done in Edinburgh, which was a city he had rather a contempt for, as a mere provincial capital, too superstitious and narrow-minded for...", "...that each stimulation was so nearly like the one immediately preceding that no difference could be noticed. The subject has been led to call a thing two which ordinarily he would call one, and apparently he loses the distinction between the sensation of one and the sensation of two. After going through the procedure just mentioned I put one knob of the aesthesiometer down one hundred times in succession, and one subject (Mr. Meakin) called it two seventy-seven times and called it one <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> times. Four of the times that he called it one he expressed doubt about his answer and said it might be two, but as he was not certain he called it one. Another subject (Mr. George) called it two sixty-two times and one thirty-eight times. A third subject (Dr. Hylan) called it two seventy-seven times and one twenty-three times. At the end of the series he was told what had been done and he said that most of his sensations of two were perfectly distinct and he believed that...", "...as the Annex; this is seventy-four feet long by twenty-four feet wide, exclusive of a \"lean-to\" on the east side, which is forty-three feet by nine feet. The Annex was built in 1882. It contains boiler and engine rooms, apartments for the guard, a refectory for the accommodation of workers, recorder's offices, etc. The St. George Temple was built by free-will offerings and by appropriations from the tithings of the people. In one year, specifically the year 1875, over one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> thousand dollars were expended {215} in the work, and the total cost of the completed building was considerably more than five hundred thousand dollars. The structure was practically finished by the close of 1876. Some parts were dedicated on January 1, 1877, so as to permit of certain ordinance work to be done before the dedication of the building as a whole, which event occurred on the sixth of April following. At the preliminary dedicatory service, January 1, 1877,...", "...Salaun Lebrenn, am the writer of the following narrative. To you, my last-born, Alain Lebrenn, the child of my old age, I bequeath this legend, a continuation of our plebeian annals. I shall join to these pages the head of a blacksmith's hammer. It will increase the number of our family relics. You are to transmit it, jointly with our annals, to your own descendants. My grandfather Antonicq Lebrenn died in his sixty-eighth year, on November 11, 1616. Stephan, Antonicq's son, was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> years of age at the time of his father's decease. He continued to be a farmer on the Karnak farm, a dependency of the fief of Mezlean, held under the suzerainty of the seigniory of Plouernel. Obedient to the _law of usage_, after a certain number of years Stephan became a vassal of the seigniory. At the age of twenty-six, in 1619, he married, and had two sons--myself, Salaun, born in 1625, and my brother Gildas, born in 1628. Our father Stephan, a good man, but timid and...", "...skin of creamy velvet. And what once threatened to be a violent red head had softened into beaten gold. But the most charming feature of all was the deep spiritual tenderness of her eyes, blue sometimes, gray and blue sometimes, but always with little brown spots in them which Nature seemed to have dropped by accident the day she painted them. Stuart always imagined she had picked up a brown brush by mistake. He thought with a sudden pang of the possibility of losing her. She was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> now, in the pride and glory of perfect young womanhood, and yet she had no lovers. He wondered why? Her music of course. It had been the one absorbing passion of life. Her progress had been slow for the first years, while at college. But during the past two years of training every lesson seemed to tell. He had watched her development with pride and brooding tenderness. And her eyes had always sparkled with deep joy at his slightest word of praise. For the first time it had...", "...their destination. On June 28th, 1916, Lord Robert Cecil in reply to a question in the House of Commons, said: \"As the result of the Paris Conference His Majesty would be advised to issue an Order in Council withdrawing the successive Orders which had been issued adopting with modifications the Declaration of London, and a general statement should also be issued explaining the reason for this step.\" Amidst the loud cheering which followed a voice was heard to exclaim, \"After <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-three</span> months!\" How Potsdam must have hugged itself with delight in 1909, 1910, and 1911 at the absurdly childish simplicity exhibited by the English Liberal Government in nullifying all its geographical advantages by accepting such a one-sided code of sea-law which gave Germany the right to stop food _en route_ to British ports, while forbidding Great Britain to stop food _en route_ to Germany, and whilst in force rendered any effective blockade of Germany impossible.
