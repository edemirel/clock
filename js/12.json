HENRY VIII {1527.} Notwithstanding the submissive deference paid to papal authority before the reformation, the marriage of Henry with Catharine of Arragon, his brother's widow, had not passed without much scruple and difficulty. The prejudices of the people were in general bent against a conjugal union between such near relations; and the late king, though he had betrothed his son when that prince was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of age, gave evident proofs of his intention to take afterwards a proper opportunity of annulling the contract.[*] He ordered the young prince, as soon as he came of age, to enter a protestation against the marriage;[**] and on his death-bed he charged him, as his last injunction, not to finish an alliance so unusual, and exposed to such insuperable objections.

Now when the good monks saw this they remembered the saying of the Book: \"Spare the rod and spoil the child,\" and whenever Elidore forgot a letter they tried to make him remember it with the rod. At first they used it seldom and lightly, but Elidore was not a boy to be driven, and the more they thwacked him the less he learned: so the thwackings became more frequent and more severe, till Elidore could not stand them any longer. So one day when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years old he upped with him and offed with him into the great forest near St. David's. There for two long days and two long nights he wandered about eating nothing but hips and haws.

We marched <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles before camping. It rained before we started out from Manila and cleared up, but left the roads very muddy and made marching very hard.

Rawains, chief of staff to General Grant at Washington, I described at length all the preparations that were in progress for the active campaign thus contemplated, and therein estimated Schofield at <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand, Thomas at forty-five thousand, and McPherson at thirty thousand. At first I intended to open the campaign about May 1st, by moving Schofield on Dalton from Cleveland, Thomas on the same objective from Chattanooga, and McPherson on Rome and Kingston from Gunter's Landing. My intention was merely to threaten Dalton in front, and to direct McPherson to act vigorously against the railroad below Resaca, far to the rear of the enemy. But by reason of his being short of...", "...so that the surprise could not help being impressive.

At Lady Annesley-Seton's suggestion they drew lots for these turns, and Constance herself drew the first chance. She and the gleaming figure of the Countess went out together, and ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> minutes later she returned alone. Everyone stared eagerly to see if she looked excited, and it took no stretch of imagination to find her face flushed and her eyes dilated. \"Well? Has she told you anything wonderful?\" A clamour of voices joined in the question. \"Yes, she has,\" replied Constance. \"She's simply _uncanny_!

She has told me in what sort of place the heirlooms are now, but that we...", "...apprentice houses, and in 1802 Sir Robert Peel, himself an employer of nearly a thousand such children, brought the matter to the attention of Parliament. An immediate and universal desire was expressed to abolish the abuses of the system, and as a result the \"Health and Morals Act to regulate the Labor of Sound Children in Cotton Factories\" was passed in the same year. It prohibited the binding out for factory labor of children younger than nine years, restricted the hours of labor to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> actual working hours a day, and forbade night labor. It required the walls of the factories to be properly whitewashed and the buildings to be sufficiently ventilated, insisted that the apprentices should be furnished with at least one new suit of clothes a year, and provided that they should attend religious service and be instructed in the fundamental English branches. This was the first of the \"Factory Acts,\" for, although its application was so restricted, applying only to...", "...the infantry were halted at Saara, the sun having now set. Exhausted as they were by their work, which had begun at midnight and continued until now without pause or break, not yet was their task completely done. The king, riding up the line, asked if any battalion would volunteer to follow him to Lissa, a village on the river bank. Three battalions stepped out. The landlord of the little inn, carrying a lantern, walked by the king's side. As they approached the village, ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> musket shots flashed out in the fields to the right. They were aimed at the lantern, but no one was hurt. There were other shots from Lissa, and it was evident that the village was still not wholly evacuated. The infantry rushed forward, scattered through the fields, and drove out the lurking Croats. The king rode quietly on into the village, and entered the principal house. To his astonishment, he found it full of Austrian officers, who could easily have carried him off, his...", "...horse, and next morning at daylight reached General Sheridan's headquarters at Fort Hays. The general was surprised to see me, and still more so when I told him of the time I had made on the rides I had successfully undertaken.

To sum up, I had ridden from Fort Larned to Fort Zarrah, a distance of sixty-five miles and back in <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hours. Ten miles must be added to this for the distance the Indians took me across the Arkansas River. In the succeeding twenty-four hours I had gone from Fort Larned to Fort Hays, sixty-five miles, in eight hours.

Next to him came Thomas Newcomb, with three presses and a proof press, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> workmen and one apprentice; John Maycocke, with three presses, ten workmen and three apprentices; and then Roycroft, with four presses, ten workmen and two apprentices; while at the other end of the scale was Thomas Leach, with one press, not his own, and one workman.

Later settlers, too, offer curious reminiscences. In 1855, a merchant purchased a tract of unimproved land near the lake, outside the city limits, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred dollars, one-fourth in cash. Before his next payment, a railroad traversed one sandy worthless corner of it, and the company paid him damages to the amount of eleven hundred dollars.

No _general_ superiority had been claimed for the English grammars. For all that had been stated in the original paper they might, as compared with the Greek and Latin, be wrong in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. All that was claimed for them was that they were right in the present instance; just as for a clock that stands may be claimed the credit of being right once in every <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hours. That the inference in favour of altering the _system_ of the Greek grammars is illegitimate is most undeniably true; but then it is an inference of the critic's not of the author's.

There are several patterns of evaporators in use. The most common one consists of a pan of from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to sixteen feet in length and four or five in width, divided into compartments by a series of partitions which run nearly across the pan, at intervals of six or eight inches, but at alternate ends stop three or four inches short of the side.

The work I liked best of all, however, was that with the shoe firm of Bearden and Brantley.

Any commentary would diminish the eloquence of this result. Without lingering over each of the other tests, let us select from the group one which forms a remarkable contrast to the preceding. Just as striking as the equality between the defective and the normal in visual memory of pictures is the difference between them in memory for phrases. The latter is a test of immediate memory. One repeats to the child a phrase of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to fifteen words, and asks him to repeat it immediately afterwards. For this memory is necessary, and also voluntary attention, and some power of comprehension into the bargain; for if some of these phrases are quite easy to understand (_e.g._, Germaine has not been good; she did not want to work; she will be scolded), others, again, are a little involved (_e.g._, The chestnut-tree in the garden casts the quite faint shadow of its new leaves on the ground).

I landed up at a Mr. Jacobs' farm <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles from town and got a job of work at twelve dollars a month. I didn't remain there long though, as I had a chill every other day regular, and therefore couldn't work much. I made up my mind then to pull for Saint Louis and hunt mother and sister.

It varies in width from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to twenty miles, and to the eastward seemed to contain merely detached streams of ice, not likely to obstruct the progress of a vessel; but to the westward lay the closely packed ice, filling South's Bay, and extending to seaward.

It seemed a doubtful sort of music to charm anything with, but a native...", "...we produce the article in a useful state at the same cost, or nearly at the same cost, or at any reasonable approximation towards the same cost, at which we can import it? Some general estimates of the price and profits of labor, in those countries from which we import our iron, might be formed by comparing the reputed products of different mines, and their prices, with the number of hands employed. The mines of Danemora are said to yield about 4,000 tons, and to employ in the mines <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred workmen. Suppose this to be worth $50 per ton; any one will find by computation, that the whole product would not pay, in this country, for one quarter part of the necessary labor. The whole export of Sweden was estimated, a few years ago, at 400,000 ship pounds, or about 54,000 tons. Comparing this product with the number of workmen usually supposed to be employed in the mines which produce iron for exportation, the result will not greatly differ from the foregoing....", "...in evidence except as rough-barked areas. To make a long story short this sprout is still alive and has increased in size and height each year. Although now (1924) it is considerably branched and makes a small bushy tree it is badly diseased in numerous places and is only partially alive, but the dead portions have not resulted from some half dozen of the original disease lesions (apparently girdles), but from later infections. The very fact that a sprout should have lived for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years in the center of one of the most badly diseased areas known to the writer seems at least to suggest the possibility that future chestnut sprouts may yet grow in spite of the disease and persist--at least in a shrubbery form if not as a tree.

In a careful survey in July (1924) of the region immediately surrounding the sprout just mentioned...", "...countries, one of the most important of which was the countship of Champagne, to the northeast, between the Ile-de-France and Lorraine.

In a wide plain, where the Seine divides into several branches, rises the city of Troyes, maintaining to some extent its medieval character, with its narrow, illpaved streets, which of old swarmed with geese and porkers, and with its houses of wooden gables and overhanging roofs. Manufactures prospered at Troyes. Many tanneries were established there, and parchment was exported from all parts of...", "...I felt that I was escaping mile by mile from a bewildering world of serious make-believe. 5 My engagement that night was to dine with Harry Merefield and to discuss something which, he said, he could explain better by word of mouth than in a letter.

We dined at his Club, and, as the only other person present was Barton, who had thrown up his work at Cambridge <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> months before and was now my official chief in the Treasury, I divined that they contemplated a deal in my person. The preliminaries were already settled, and, as we drank our sherry, Merefield confided that the Foreign Office wanted me to go out to America ostensibly to raise money for the War Charities Fund, in reality to carry on a campaign of propaganda; my knowledge of country and people would be invaluable and our relations had reached a point where we could no longer...", "...in the beautiful Mumper's Dingle, where he had the historic fight with the \"Flaming Tinman,\" getting the victory by using his \"Long Melford,\" on the advice of that towering and handsome female bearing the name of Isopel Berners, who now comes on the scene, and who will ever remain one of the most fascinating figures in the wonderful gallery of Borrovian characters. \"I never saw such a face and figure,\" exclaims Borrow, \"both regal--why, you look like Ingeborg, Queen of Norway; she had <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> brothers, you know, and could lick them all, though they were heroes-- \"'On Dovrefeld in Norway, Were once together seen, The twelve heroic brothers Of Ingeborg the queen.'\" (See \"Romantic Ballads,\" p. 59.)

When we find, for instance, in tradition, the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> months of the year associated with twelve old men round the fire, we know that the fire is the sun, round which the twelve months turn in the sky in the space of a year. Here _together_ is amplified to denote, therefore, the period of a year and the entire width of the sky.

They already noticed a change in climate; the ferns and palms became fewer, and were succeeded by pines, while the air was also a good deal cooler, which was easily accounted for by their altitude--though even at that height it was considerably denser than at sea- level on earth--and by the fact that they were already near latitude thirty.

Chudleigh stands a little above, and to the east of the river. From very early times it has been specially connected with the bishops of Exeter, for Bishop Osbert built a palace here about 1080. In the third year of Richard II's reign the palace was fortified under a licence to Bishop Brantyngham, but now only a very few fragments of it are still to be seen. The manor of Chudleigh was bound to provide <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> woodcock for the bishop's table on the day of his election, but should they be unobtainable, twelve pence was considered a just equivalent!

With goods and clothes went the servants. In the course of a few weeks O'Iwa was living in one room, furnished with three _tatami_ in lieu of the usual <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> in number.

Madison wrote every few days, sometimes hopefully, sometimes in gloom, especially if he were not feeling well. Each letter was from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> days old, and it seemed to Hamilton sometimes that he should burst with impatience and anxiety.

The duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, and his duchess,[19] followed; then the princess Matilda, leading her younger brother and sister, prince Luitpold and the princess Adelgonde;--the former a fine boy of about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years old, the latter a pretty little girl of about seven or eight: a single lady of honour; the baron de Freyberg, as principal equerry; the minister von Schencke, and one or two other officers of the household were in attendance. The king bowed to the gentlemen in the orchestra, then to the company, and in a few moments all were seated. The music was entirely vocal, consisting of concerted pieces only, for three or more voices, and all were executed in perfection.

It was not so insufferably hot at night, but on the other hand they were less able to avoid obstructions: and the rest had not been long enough to make up for the terrible exertions of the day. By daybreak they were some distance past Hugli, still keeping about five miles from the river. Desmond was beginning to congratulate himself that the worst was over; Barrakpur was only about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles away. But a little after dawn he caught sight of a European on horseback crossing their track towards the river. He was going at a walking pace, attended by two syces.[#] Attracted, apparently, by the sight, unusual at this time of year, of a string of hackeris, he wheeled his horse and cantered towards the tail of the convoy, which was under Bulger's charge.

Inasmuch, however, as I often visited and fished in these glens and lakes, I may be pardoned for attempting to give the reader a short description of their principal features. Lough Veigh lies to the east of the Derryveigh Mountains, occupying the opening to Glen Veigh. It is a long, narrow sheet of water; on the north side, and running into it, a rocky, almost perpendicular, wall rises to over <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred feet, covered with Alpine vegetation. Over the top of this wall several large streams fall and break into cascades as they find their way to the lake below. Back of this and framing the whole, rises the majestic Dooish, the highest ridge in the Derryveigh range, standing two thousand one hundred and forty-seven feet above the tide. In old times I have counted a dozen eagles that built their nests on the topmost crags overhanging the water, their majestic, circling...", "...\"sir\" with redundant ceremony in addressing Englishmen, however intimate he might be with them, and had the habit (perhaps with a sly intention to startle or puzzle them) of adorning his style of conversation with quaint Americanisms. Nevertheless, the genial amiability and the inherent dignity of his character made him acknowledged as a thorough gentleman by every Englishman, however conventional in tastes, who became admitted into his intimate acquaintance. Mrs. Morley, ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years younger than her husband, had no nasal twang, and employed no Americanisms in her talk, which was frank, lively, and at times eloquent.

It is one of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> panels,--consisting of twenty-six breadths each five feet seven inches long by twenty inches wide, fifteen hundred blocks being used in its printing,--depicting the marriage of Cupid and Psyche, Psyche's lack of faith, and the sad ending of the romance, and is a pattern that is numbered among the most noted designed.

This is, perhaps, the most useful and profitable of all Mexican animals. As beasts of burden and for draught, they are in use over the whole republic, and are excellent for long journeys, being capable of immense fatigue, particularly in those arid, hilly parts of the country, where there are no roads. Those which go in droves, can carry about five hundred pounds weight, going at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> or fourteen miles a day, and in this way they can perform journeys of more than a thousand miles. For constant use they are preferable to horses, being so much less delicate, requiring less care, and enduring more fatigue.

The pine forests of Maine, it is well known, have been for some time failing, under the great demand upon them; and the only resource will soon be in those of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, from which many cargoes have been already sent to the Atlantic ports. The amount of lumber made in these pineries in 1860 is estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred million feet, worth between eight and nine millions of dollars. Most of this goes to the country west of the Lakes,--to Chicago, to St. Louis, and even down the river to New Orleans. Since railroads have penetrated the great prairies and made them habitable, the demand for pine lumber has greatly increased both for building and fencing; and it has been estimated, that, if every quarter-section of land in Iowa and Illinois were surrounded with a \"three-board\" fence, it...", "...see me as I passed in, but a Chinese servant gave \"Good-day\" to the yellow man we'd picked up coming down; and, at that, Miss Ruth--for so I call her, not being able to get Mme.

But, on the very morrow of the day on which Monsieur died, some ladies of the palace, upon entering the apartments of Madame de Maintenon, where was the King with the Duchesse de Bourgogne, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock, heard her from the chamber where they were, next to hers, singing opera tunes. A little while after, the King, seeing the Duchesse de Bourgogne very sad in a corner of the room, asked Madame de Maintenon, with surprise, why the said Duchess was so melancholy; set himself to work to rouse her; then played with her and some ladies of the palace he had called in to join in the sport. This was not all. Before rising from the dinner table, at a little after two o'clock, and...", "...the duchies until the principal affair could be amicably settled. The possessory princes were accordingly established in Dusseldorf with the consent of the provincial estates, in which place those bodies were wont to assemble.

Hardly was the ink dry on the treaty which had suspended for <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years the great religious war of forty years, not yet had the ratifications been exchanged, but the trumpet was again sounding, and the hostile forces were once more face to face.

The States, through the pen and brain of Barneveld, replied that they had already recognized the...", "...of the cliffs. As we wander about in the narrow and quaint streets of Walpi we cannot fail to observe the ladder-poles which are thrust through hatchways, down which we peer into the darkness below with little satisfaction. These lead to the _kivas_, or sacred ceremonial chambers, where all the secret rites of the different clans are held. Here we shall be privileged to enter if no ceremony is going on. The kivas are generally hewn out of the solid rock, or partially so, and are from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to eighteen feet square. When not otherwise occupied it is no uncommon sight to see in a kiva a Hopi weaver squatted before his rude loom, making a dress for his wife or daughter, or weaving a ceremonial sash or kilt for his own use in one of the many dances. In every Hopi town one cannot fail to be struck with the nudity of the children of all ages, from the merest babies up to eight and even ten years. With what Victor Hugo calls \"the chaste indecency of childhood\" these...", "...and Saturday were occupied in preparing the field for the tournament. The lists, nine hundred feet in length and three hundred twenty feet broad, were pitched on a rising ground in the territory of Guines, about half way between Guines and Ardres.

The entrances were guarded by twelve French and <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> English archers; and at the foot of the lists, under a triumphal arch, stood the _perron_, or tree of nobility, from which the shields of the two Kings were suspended on a higher line than those of the other challengers and answerers.

And still he said, \"There is no girl in all Novgorod as pretty as my little river.\" Every time he came back from his long voyages--for he was trading far and near, like the greatest of merchants--he went at once to the banks of the river to see how his sweetheart fared. And always he brought some little present for her and threw it into the waves. For <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years he lived unmarried in Novgorod, and every year made voyages, buying and selling, and always growing richer and richer. Many were the mothers in Novgorod who would have liked to see him married to their daughters.

And then, in the twelfth year since he walked into Novgorod with the coffer on his shoulder, he was sailing in a ship on the...", "...Jesus and John, by Schwartze, of Amsterdam, received general praise. Of this artist I shall have more to say. The great Lake of Harlem, which is thirty miles in circumference, is to be drained; and for several years operations have been in progress to this end.

After leaving Harlem, and taking leave of our kind friend the minister at the Hague, with his amiable family, we again entered the cars, and, after riding <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles, reached Amsterdam. The chief feature on the way was the everlasting wind mill, employed here to grind wheat, &c. We went to the Hotel Doelen, and found it all that Mr. Folsom had said.

It rained that night; then they marched us the next day thirty miles, to Kingston, without anything to eat, except it was, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock, one of the regular captains, who had some crackers in his haversack, gave us about one each, and some of the boys managed to get an ear of corn from the wagons, but the rest of them were pushed back by the guns of the guard; then we were kept in the streets of Kingston until about nine o'clock, when we had a little pork and three barrels of crackers for about two hundred of us.

His back and chest stood out like two short, well-filled bags; and this thick-set body was supported by small thin legs, which seemed hardly sufficient to support their burden; but so much the larger were his arms, which hung down from his body, being of the size of those of a full-grown man; his hands were coarse, and of a brownish hue, his fingers long, like spiders' legs, and when he stretched them to their full extent, he could touch the ground without...", "...which suspended publication early in 1909 and whose place was filled by the _Industrial Worker_ (II.)

In addition to the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hours of actual labor, at least a half-hour must be allowed for breakfast and an hour for dinner. Other minor acts amending or extending this were passed from time to time, till in 1833, after two successive commissions had made investigations and reports on the subject, an important law was passed. It applied practically to all textile mills, not merely to those for the spinning of cotton.

The country near the Hutt River is exceedingly beautiful and fertile, and it supports a very numerous population, comparatively with other districts.

Along the side of this path were seen frequent wells, some of them ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> feet in depth, which were made in a superior manner.

This is made by covering the bottom of the road-bed with stones broken into angular pieces to a depth of from four to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> inches. The bottom of the road-bed should be solid earth, and crowned sufficiently to carry off all water that may reach it.

We Staved five days, during which time <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> persons died in the village, mostly from simple intermittent fever, of the treatment of which the natives are quite ignorant. During the whole of this voyage I had suffered greatly from sunburnt lips, owing to having exposed myself on deck all day to loon after our safety among the shoals and reefs near Waigiou.

We shall not repeat here what we have already stated, but only add a few words, in order the better to specify this division of the order. The diurnal birds of prey have their eyes placed at the sides of the head, and the toes completely bare. They vary in size from that of the Sparrow-hawk, the spread of whose wings is scarcely <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> inches, to the Condor, which stretches its pinions over a space of four or five yards. They lay their eggs, which are generally of an oval shape, in rude nests called \"aeries.\" The Diurnal section of the Rapacious order is divided into three families: the Falcons (_Falconidae_), the Vultures (_Vulturidae_), and the Serpent-eaters (_Gypogeranus_).

At a short distance above its foot is visible the celebrated cave or grotto of Covadonga, an opening forty feet wide, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> feet high, and extending twenty-five feet into the rock. The river sweeps out through a narrow and rocky defile, at whose narrowest part the banks rise in precipitous walls.

These enclosures amply prove, aside from the geological evidences of their antiquity, the existence of a race very different from the Red Indians.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of age, he was sent to the common schools of Winnsboro, S. C., to Northern teachers. So eager was he to learn that he cut light wood up at night and carried it to town on his head, using the money thus obtained to buy his first book. After finishing the common schools, he entered Fairfield Normal Institute, and there prepared himself for a teacher, which vocation he pursued for several years. After his conversion he felt called to...", "...the little, soft, brown things, which shed a circle of phosphorescent light for two or three inches around them. \"Put them into that empty jar with some grass, and we will take them home with us.\" [Illustration: GLOW-WORM.] The glow-worm is the wingless female of a winged beetle.

In general she shines from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock, but often much later, as on this occasion. Why such a brown, ugly little beetle should have such a beautiful light I do not know. Perhaps it is to guide the male to her. This beetle with the wonderful light has plebeian tastes, for she eats the flesh of snails, and, unlike our Gallic neighbours, she does not wait for the snails' decease first.

So the boy put the matter from his thoughts. The incident, however, left a sting of vexation behind it. In agreeing to accompany Diggle to the East, Desmond had harboured a vague hope of falling in with Clive and taking service, in however humble a capacity, with him. It vexed him sorely to think that Clive, whose memory for faces, as his recognition of Bulger after <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years had shown, was very good, might recognize him, should they meet, as the boy who had played a part in what was almost a street brawl. Still, it could not be helped. Desmond comforted himself with the hope that Clive had taken no particular note of him, and, if they should ever encounter, would probably meet him as a stranger.

There is no mention made of the location of the course, but a notice that horses that have won plate here are excepted indicates that it was probably a yearly event.

On the top end of each upright of the trilithons is an accurately cut tenon which dovetails into two mortices cut one at each end of the lower surface of the horizontal block.

Some have suggested that they came from Wales or Cornwall, or even by sea from Ireland. Now, the recent excavations have shown that the blue-stones were brought...", "...fire which had consumed the building, had also broken this monument into two pieces.

For winter quarters the vaults are built from ten to twelve feet high and <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to fifteen feet in diameter. In order to reach this height the builder makes a bench on which he steps while finishing the upper part of the building.

This account is impossible; for the Palatine and Aventine are so near each other that, as every Roman well knew, whatever a person on one of the two hills saw high in the air, could not escape the observation of any one who was watching on the other.

I imagine him to be by trade a minor journalist or himself a writer of sorts, but with not enough of success to have spoiled him. There are other people always there, too.

In his Annals of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the learned Cambden informs us, that the father of the celebrated Sir Francis Drake was the Rev. Edmund Drake, vicar of Upnore on the river Medway, and says he had this information from Sir Francis himself. Yet the industrious John Stowe says, that he was the eldest of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> brethren, the sons of Edmund Drake, mariner, at Tavistock in Devonshire, and was born in 1540. Perhaps both accounts may be true; and Mr Edmund Drake, though a mariner originally, may have had a competent share of learning, and may have been admitted to orders on the final establishment of the Reformation.

He was the eldest brother: his father had also for years basked in the smiles of good King Henry IV. for his unwavering adherence to his fortunes. To this eminent lawyer and statesman was born a patriarchal family of sons and daughters. The youngest of his sons, No\u00ebl Brulart de Sillery, [169] having brilliantly completed his studies at Paris in the classics, entered, at the age of 18, the military order of the Knights of Malta, and resided <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years in that island as a knight; his martial bearing and ability, modesty, and uniform good conduct soon paved the way for him to the highest dignities in this celebrated Order. Soon the Grand Master appointed him \"Commandeur de Troyes\"; this preferment yielded him 40,000 livres per annum. On his return to Paris in 1607, the favour of the court and the protection of Marie de Medicis were the means of having him nominated Knight of Honour.

The tract immediately round Cranford was formerly part of the famous, or rather infamous, Hounslow Heath; and I have heard Mr. Henry Berkeley say that in his youth he remembered perfectly, when he went to London with his father, by day or night, loaded pistols were an invariable part of the carriage furniture.

From among the disciples who followed Him, some of whom had been honored by preliminary calls, He chose twelve men, whom He ordained to the apostleship:--\"And He ordained twelve, that they should be with Him, and that He might send them forth to preach.\"--(Mark 3:14.) Again: \"And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> whom also he named apostles.\"--(Luke 6:13; compare Matt. 10:1, 2.) The twelve special witnesses of Him and His work were sent out to preach in the several cities of the Jews. On this, their first mission, they were instructed to confine their ministrations to the house of Israel, and the burden of their message was \"The kingdom of heaven is at hand.\"--(Matt. 10:7; study the entire chapter.) They were told to use the power with which they had been invested by ordination, in...", "...seats from the platform and the sides. From the platform the preacher called on the others to rise and join them, for it was nearly twelve o'clock, the New Year was at hand. Most of the congregation obeyed him, I counted but fifteen or twenty who refused. The volume of the singing increased as the seats emptied, in it there was religious fervour; it appealed strongly even to me. I saw some young fellows rise and join the procession; perhaps three or four. There were now less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> seated. The preacher spoke to us personally; he insisted on the passing minutes of the dying year. And still the singers passed us. Some leant over and called to us. Our bitter band lessened one by one.

Though I had not picked up much information at school, I had some companions, and they were generally the wildest and least manageable of all the boys of my age and standing. The truth was, I am forced to confess, my grandmother and aunt had spoilt me.

Griffin's and Piatt's brigades took the road to Centreville, either by mistake or otherwise, and were not in the battle.[51] Instead of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand, Porter brought but seven thousand to the field. Sigel's troops were mainly Germans, wanting in discipline, vigor, energy, and endurance. Pope's army was a conglomeration, wanting coherence. He had, besides the troops from the Army of the Potomac, McDowell's, who had been an army by themselves; Sigel's, who had served under Fremont, whom they idolized; Reno's, who looked upon Burnside as the only commander who had achieved victories. General Pope was from the West.

They had merely to drop him into space, in the same way that sailors drop a body into the sea; but, as President Barbicane suggested, they must act quickly, so as to lose as little as possible of that air whose elasticity would rapidly have spread it into space. The bolts of the right scuttle, the opening of which measured about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> inches across, were carefully drawn, whilst Michel, quite grieved, prepared to launch his dog into space. The glass, raised by a powerful lever, which enabled it to overcome the pressure of the inside air on the walls of the projectile, turned rapidly on its hinges, and Satellite was thrown out. Scarcely a particle of air could have escaped, and the operation was so successful, that later on Barbicane did not fear to dispose of the rubbish which encumbered the car....", "...was at fever heat when she wished that she had been a sister of mine. But I kept sufficient command over myself to avoid the slightest contact, for I was conscious that even one kiss would have been the spark which would have blown up all the edifice of my reserve.

At the end of ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> days, I felt that there was no alternative but to put a stop to this state of things, or to become a monster in my own eyes; and I decided for the moral side of the question all the more easily that nothing insured me success, if I chose the second alternative.

She had gained rapidly upon them in the half-hour he had been below. Now he could see her graceful black hull, the shadows in the great sails, and the tiny men here and there upon her deck. \"What a sailer!\" he cried in involuntary admiration. \"She must be an American!\" It was clear that the other schooner, even in that moderate breeze, must be making the better side of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> knots.

Searle's yard, on the River Thames; it was worked by a motor in which rotation was effected by magnets arranged within coils, like galvanometer needles, and acted on successively by currents from a battery. From a recent number of the _Annales de l'Electricite_, we learn that Count de Moulins experimented on the lake in the Bois de Boulogne, in the year 1866, with an iron flat-bottomed boat, carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> persons. Twenty Bunsen cells furnished the current to a motor on Froment's principle turning a pair of paddle wheels. In all these reports there is a lack of data. We are interested to know what power the motors developed, the time and speed, as well as dimensions and weights. Until Trouve's trip on the Seine, in 1881, and the launch of the Electricity on the Thames, in 1882, very little was known concerning the history of electric navigation. M. Trouve originally...", "...an insight into the working merits and defects of the processes then in use. On his return to London he arranged for the use of an old factory in St. Pancras, where he began his own series of experiments. He converted the factory into a small experimental \"iron-works,\" in which his first object was to improve the quality of iron. For this purpose he made many costly experiments without the desired measure of success, but not without making some progress in the right direction. After <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> months spent in these experiments he produced an improved quality of cast iron, which was almost as white as steel, and was both tougher and stronger than the best cast iron then used for ordnance. Of this metal he cast a small model gun, which was turned and bored. This gun he took to Paris, and presented it personally to the Emperor,[23] as the result of his labors thus far. His Majesty encouraged him to continue his experiments, and desired to be further informed of the...", "...brewings--nor dreamed, save, perhaps, in their worst nightmare, of the interference of Government in their monopoly.

Amusing to think that even the quite immature first-rate can so relegate the third. But perhaps it was a little unfair to call poor Mr. Thorpe third.

Some of them issued high up, in rocky clefts; others at the middle heights, among vineyards and orchards; the majority at, or near, the seashore. All of these springs, he tells us, had the following features in common: they were more or less hot, unpleasant to the taste, of foetid odour and therefore unfit for culinary or other common uses. \"But let it not be supposed,\" he hastens to add, \"that they were worthless, inasmuch...", "...Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, 'If I don't think the gal's stark raving mad.

Cold sore may be single or multiple, and near together or widely separated on the face. Having first the appearance of a red patch, it later becomes covered with a brown crust from the drying of the contents of the tiny blisters. Cold sore often gives rise to burning, itching, or tingling, the disfigurement usually causing more annoyance, however, than the pain. The duration of the trouble is from four to twelve days.

On his way to Saragossa with the legates of Marsile, Ganelon laid the impious plot that was to result in the destruction of Roland and the peers. It saved his life at Saragossa, where Marsile threatened to kill him on reading Charlemagne's message. He explained carefully to the Saracens how the rear guard, left at Roncesvalles under the command of Roland and the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> peers, could be destroyed by the pagan forces before the knowledge of the battle could reach Charlemagne, and that, with these props of his kingdom gone, the king's power would be so diminished that Marsile could easily hold out against him.

Twelve grooms were mustered, they unlocked twelve locks, opened <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> doors, and brought forth a magic horse bound in twelve chains of iron. Katoma went up to him. No sooner had he managed to seat himself than the magic horse leaped up from the ground and soared higher than the forest--higher than the standing forest, lower than the flitting cloud.

I had certainly traveled widely, and I was an excellent sailor--excellent to the point of offensiveness.

As for intelligence, I reflected that for ninety-nine people out of a hundred intelligence in others means no more than the discovery of a person who is in intellectual acquiescence with themselves, and that if the necessity arose I could probably affect an acquiescence which would serve all the purposes of a fundamental identity of convictions.

But inwardly his ambition had in no sense declined. He beheld the progress of the Swedish conqueror with secret joy, and when he saw Tilly overthrown at Leipsic, and the fruits of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of war wrested from the emperor at a single blow, his heart throbbed high with hope.

St. Ruth at once removed his army to Ballinasloe, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles from his former post, and subsequently to Aughrim.

Without intending, he has furnished the data to determine when Peter died, if his dates are correct, which is _not even probable_. He says: \"After Vespasian had reigned about ten years, he was succeeded by his son Titus; in the second year of whose reign, Linus, Bishop of the church of Rome, who held the office about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years, transferred it to Anacletus.\" (Eusebius, Ecc. Hist., book iii. ch. 13.) As Linus succeeded Peter, the latter must have died just before his successor took the office. Titus became emperor June 24th, A. D. 79, and as Linus died two years after this, after holding the office twelve years, he became Bishop in A. D. 69; which must have been the year of Peter's death. Nero died in June A.

These were intended to commemorate the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> places at which the Saviour fell down on his journey while bearing the cross to Calvary.

A wide interval seems to separate these intelligent mammals from the lower placentals, the marsupials and monotremes.

Now, these two towns are compelled to keep enough to supply a population...", "...both here and hereafter. We may then ask how this general scheme may be adapted to homes in the countryside. The financial plan for the farm home ought not to present any difficulty, but it seems to, and for two reasons. In the first place the money generally arrives in bulk in connection with harvests, not scattered along through the year as in most other forms of business. But one would think that this peculiarity would aid system; to know all in a month what is to be available for <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> should be the most effective basis for a wise plan. Second, a large part of the supplies for the farm home come directly from the farm without intervention of butcher, baker or candlestick maker. This, again, ought not to prove a difficulty. Why not record the farm-supplies on the day book at market prices, as if they did come from butcher and grocer? This is the normal, systematic and efficient thing to do.

For so perilous a treaty a negotiator was required, and the grand equerry proposed his friend, Viscount de Fontrailles, a man of wit, who detested the cardinal, and who would have considered it a simpler plan to assassinate him; he consented, however, to take charge of the negotiation, and he set out for Madrid, where his treaty was soon concluded, in the name of the Duke of Orleans. The Spaniards were to furnish <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand foot and five thousand horse, four hundred thousand crowns down, twelve thousand crowns' pay a month, and three hundred thousand livres to fortify the frontier-town which was promised by the duke.

No doubt, if a negro slave could be made to feel that the mere circumstance of external bondage was nothing, so long as his inner man was untrammeled, it would add greatly to the convenience both of himself and his master. But the theory did not seem to carry weight so long as the practice accompanied it; and the world, even of Pennsylvania, was not quite ready to abolish negro slavery in 1687.

Then the King said once more to the Lion: 'You have deceived me again; they _are_ men, for they never once looked at the spinning-wheels.' The Lion replied: 'They knew they were being tried, and they did violence to their feelings.' But the King declined to believe in the Lion any longer.

The King, fearing something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to help, and began drawing off his gloves.

It occurred off Malta, and lasted for two hours, when the Tripolitan hauled down his flag. Thereupon the Americans left their guns and were cheering, when the enemy treacherously fired a broadside into the _Enterprise_.

Long before their day the Indians, who taught them its uses, had cultivated it; and wherever we see the bright yellow flowers gleaming like miniature suns above roadside thickets and fence rows in the East, we may safely infer the spot was once an aboriginal or colonial farm. White men planted it extensively for its edible tubers, which taste not unlike celery root or salsify. As early as 1617 the artichoke was introduced into Europe, and only <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years later Parkinson records that the roots had become very plentiful and cheap in London. The Italians also cultivated it under the name Girasole Articocco (sunflower artichoke), but it did not take long for the girasole to become corrupted into Jerusalem, hence the name Jerusalem Artichoke common to this day. When the greater value of the potato came to be generally recognized, the use of artichoke roots gradually diminished.

Only a superficial observer can see at once that the amount of removal has been greatly in excess of the rate mentioned above.

Some wore long and ungainly deer-skin pantaloons and moccasins of the same material; and two or three were indued with coats of coarse homespun, awkwardly garnished with the trimmings...", "...to test their valor. The heroic deeds of those who did advance against the enemy will ever redound to the glory of our arms; and had all the forces of the Left grand division been brought fairly into action, the result might have been different.

During his residence at Cephalonia, Byron was gratified by the interest evinced in him by the English residents. Among these the physician, Dr. Kennedy, a worthy Scotchman, who imagined himself to be a theologian with a genius for conversion, was conducting a series of religious meetings at Argostoli, when the poet expressed a wish to be present at one of them. After listening, it is said, to a set of discourses that occupied the greater part of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hours, he seems, for one reason or another, to have felt called on to enter the lists, and found himself involved in the series of controversial dialogues afterwards published in a substantial book. This volume, interesting in several respects, is one of the most charming examples of unconscious irony in the language, and it is matter of regret that our space does not admit of the abridgment of several of its pages. They bear testimony, on the one hand, to Byron's capability of...", "...merely of the society in which he moves.

Over the poles are placed nets, made of flags, or birch bark, and, sometimes, the skins of animals. The Indian, in defining comfort, evidently does not mean soft beds and generous covering.

When Remus and Romulus commenced their watch no vultures were to be seen from either hill. They waited till evening, still none appeared. They continued to watch through the night. In the morning a messenger came over from the Palatine hill to Remus on the Aventine, informing him that vultures had appeared to Romulus. Remus did not believe it. At last, however, the birds really came into view; a flock of six were seen by Remus, and afterward one of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> by Romulus. The observations were then suspended, and the parties came together to confer in respect to the result; but the dispute instead of being settled, was found to be in a worse condition than ever. The point now to be determined was whether six vultures seen first, or twelve seen afterward, were the better omen, that is whether numbers, or simple priority of appearance, should decide the question. In contending in respect to this nice point the brothers became more angry...", "...all that approached me.

Geological Survey. \"In honor of his great services not only during the past season, but for over <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of unremitting toil as my assistant, oftentimes without pecuniary reward, and with but little of the scientific recognition that usually comes to the original explorer, I have desired that one of the principal islands of the lake and one of the noble peaks reflected in its clear waters should bear his name forever.\"--Hayden.[CJ] [CJ] Page 5, Fifth Annual Report of Dr. Hayden. Mr. Stevenson was born in Maysville, Ky., December 24, 1840. He early displayed a taste for...", "...of wines, generally speaking, is very high, considering what a trifling duty is paid, but the price of good Madeira is surprising. There are certain brands, which if exposed to public auction, will be certain to fetch from twelve to twenty, and I have been told even forty dollars a bottle. I insert a list of the wines at Astor House, to prove that there is no exaggeration in what I have asserted. Even in this list of a tavern, the reader will find that the best Madeira is as high as <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> dollars a bottle, and the list is curious from the variety which it offers. But the Americans do not confine themselves to foreign wines or liquors; they have every variety at home, in the shape of compounds, such as mint-julep and its varieties; slings in all their varieties; cocktails, but I really cannot remember, or if I could, it would occupy too much time to mention the whole battle array against one's brains. I must, however, descant a little upon the mint-julep; as it...", "...and mounted the steps; too dark for him to notice the queer iron railings and newel posts red with rust, and the front door that hadn't had a coat of paint on it for years, nor the knob and knocker that were black with the weather.

He's our landlord. Walk right up. This door ain't locked till <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock, so ye can just shut it to behind ye.

And his whole life which belonged to history, and had been passed on the world's stage before the eyes of two generations of spectators, was a demonstration of the truth of his words. But Burgomaster van Berk knew better. Had he not informed the twenty- four commissioners that, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years before, the Advocate wished to subject the country to Spain, and that Spinola had drawn a bill of exchange for 100,000 ducats as a compensation for his efforts? It was eleven o'clock. Barneveld requested one of the brethren to say an evening prayer. This was done by La Motte, and they were then requested to return by three or four o'clock next morning.

CHAPTER XII THE COST OF A LETTER Discovering the exact cost of a letter is by no means an easy affair. However, approximate figures may always be had and they are extremely useful. The cost of writing an ordinary letter is quite surprising. Very few letters can be dictated, transcribed, and mailed at a cost of much less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> cents each. The factors which govern costs are variable and it is to be borne in mind that the methods for ascertaining costs as here given represent the least cost and not the real cost--they simply tell you \"Your letter costs at least this sum.\" They do not say \"Your letter costs exactly this sum.\" The cost of a form letter, mailed in quantities, can be gotten at with considerable accuracy. The cost of letters dictated by correspondents or by credit departments or other...", "...State, but breed only on the loftiest mountains. They arrive on the plains from the South about the last of April, tarry for nearly a month, then hie to the upper mountain parks, stopping there to spend the month of May. By the first of June they have ascended above timber-line to their summer home amid the treeless slopes and acclivities. Laying begins early in July, as soon as the first grass is started. Most of the nests are to be found at an elevation of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand to thirteen thousand feet, the lowest known being one on Mount Audubon, discovered on the third of July with fresh eggs. During the breeding season these birds never descend below timber-line. The young birds having left the nest, in August both old and young gather in flocks and range over the bald mountain peaks in quest of such dainties as are to the pipit taste. Some of them remain above timber-line until October although most of them...", "...round the hill, appears to have led up to the summit,[39] which, however, could be reached in a shorter time by means of a flight of steps, many of which were cut into the living rock, and the remainder made of pieces of stone firmly cemented together. Davila Padilla, who wrote in the latter part of the sixteenth century, says that he counted five hundred and twenty of these steps, without reckoning those that had already crumbled to pieces.[40] He furthermore adds that for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> steps in the ascent the staircase was tunneled through the solid rock, and became so narrow that only one person could pass at a time. Davila Padilla inquired the reason of this of the natives, and was told by them, as they had heard it from their fathers, that this narrow passage enabled the Tezcucan monarch to assert his rank by taking precedence of his royal visitors when they went in a body to worship the idol that stood upon the summit; not a very polite proceeding...", "...the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before. And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. And those <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal. And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

He sent troops to protect them, but they refused to let them enter, and the soldiers were compelled to take lodgings outside of the city. Still, in spite of all this, they had not become more royalist, for some time later, having arrested the Marquis of La Noussaie and the Viscount of Denoual, it cost the former <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand crowns to get out of prison and the latter two thousand. Then, fearing that Pont-Brient would interrupt commercial relations with Dinan and the other cities in the Ligue, they attacked and subjected it. Presuming that their bishop, who was the temporal master of the city, might be likely to deprive them of the freedom they had just acquired, they put him in prison and kept him there for a year. The conditions at which they finally accepted Henri IV are...", "...upon the jurors. 'They are to decide which of us has perjured ourselves on this trial,' he said; 'and how terrible a thing for me if they should be mistaken in their judgment. There is so little of any thing tangible for their decision to rest upon, that it seems to me as if a breath might blow it either way. They cannot see our hearts, and I feel as if, only God could enable them to discern the truth. Let us spend the evening in prayer that he may give them a clear vision.'\" The <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> jurymen ate their supper in perplexed silence, and were shut in their room for deliberation and consultation. \"I never sat in such a case before,\" said the foreman. \"The plaintiff and defendant have sworn point-blank against each other; and how we are to tell which speaks the truth, I can not see. I should not like to make a mistake in the matter; it would be a sad affair to convict an innocent man of perjury.\" Again there was silence among them, as if each were weighing the case...", "...the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. 66:007:004 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. 66:007:005 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand. 66:007:006 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand.

But our business at present is with the _first-foot_, and we must hold. It matters not on what side of the Borders it may be--and northward the feeling extends far beyond the Borders--there is a mysterious, an ominous importance attached to the individual who first crosses the threshold, after the clock has struck <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> at midnight, on the 31st of December, or who is the _first-foot_ in a house after the New Year has begun. The _first-foot_ stamps the \"luck\" of the house--the good fortune or the evil fortune of its inmates throughout the year! But to begin with our story. There was not a person on all the Borders, nor yet in all Scotland, who attached more importance to the first-foot than Nelly Rogers. Nelly was a very worthy, kind-hearted, yea, even sensible sort of woman; but a vein of...", "...the dear old lady's, I never lost sight of poor Billy from that time. [Illustration] A FRIEND IN NEED Laurence was a little English boy, though he lived in Paris. He had several older brothers and sisters, but none near him in age. So he was often rather lonely, for he was only six years old, and too young to do many lessons. Half-an-hour in the morning and half-an-hour in the afternoon made up his school time, though of course his next brother and sister, who were <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> and thirteen years old, had to do a great deal more than that. I daresay they would not have minded doing a little _less_. I know they were always very pleased to have a holiday, or even a half-holiday, and in the evenings when their lessons were done they were very kind and ready to play with their little brother. Laurence had a German nursery-maid. She was a good girl, but not very lively or quick, and she could not speak either French or English. When she first came to...", "...the people of the Ridge have ever had the diseases of childhood. Scarlet fever I could hear of in but two places, and I suppose that not one person in fifty has had it. Whooping cough and measles have occurred but rarely, and the large majority have not yet experienced the realities of either. Very few people there have ever been vaccinated, nor has smallpox ever prevailed. Typhoid, typhus, and intermittent fevers are unknown. In the great rage of typhoid fever which took place ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years ago in the Tennessee and Sequatchee Valleys, not a single case occurred on the Mountains, as I have been informed by physicians who were engaged in practice in the neighborhood at the time. Diphtheria has never found a victim there; so of croup. Nobody has nasal catarrh there, and a cough or a cold is exceedingly rare. I have said that these observations refer more particularly to Walden's Ridge than to the Cumberland Tablelands in our State as a whole. This ridge was...", "...in his usual costume; Valerian, who is under the horse's feet; Miriades, who stands by Sapor's side; three principal tribute-bearers in front of the main figure; and a Victory which floats in the sky. [Illustration: PLATE 14.] Another important work, assigned by tradition to Sapor I., is the great dyke at Shuster. This is a dam across the river Karun, formed of cut stones, cemented by lime, and fastened together by clamps of iron; it is twenty feet broad, and no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred feet in length. The whole is a solid mass excepting in the centre, where two small arches have been constructed for the purpose of allowing a part of the stream to flow in its natural bed. The greater portion of the water is directed eastward into a canal cut for it; and the town of Shuster is thus defended on both sides by a water barrier, whereby the position becomes one of great strength. Tradition says that Sapor used his power over Valerian to obtain Roman engineers...", "...foaming streams. Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a movable dam. These innumerable multitudes of beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains. Thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours in compact ranks. The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear. This happened to the train in which Mr. Fogg was traveling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand head of buffalo covered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowcatcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course. It is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain. The travelers gazed on this...", "...was the assumption that there are considerable lapses of time at intervals during the continuance of the story. The effort to reconcile poetry with history produced little if any appreciable practical result upon the stage,--seeing that an audience would not think of lapses of time unless those lapses were mentioned in the play-bill. An incessant continuity of action, a ceaseless rush and whirl of events, is the essential life of the play. No auditor can feel that Richard has waited <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years before making any movement or striking any blow, after his aspiration that heaven will take King Edward and leave the world for him \"to bustle in.\" That word \"bustle\" is a favourite word with Richard. And furthermore there is no development of his character in Shakespeare's play: there is simply the presentation of it, complete and rounded at the outset, and remaining invariably and inflexibly the same to the close. Mansfield, however, deduced this effect from his...", "...vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. 10.

At daybreak he opened fire from the river-bed. After his second shot the Boers found him and made wonderful practice, bursting shrapnel all over him. No damage, however, was done as he was well dug into the bank. They continued their shelling for an hour, after which they turned their big guns on to Tunnel Hill for a short time. This hill was held by the Liverpool Regiment, who lost two killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> wounded, of whom five died of their wounds next day. The works on Devon Post and Cemetery Hill were strengthened during the next few nights until the front walls were from twelve to fifteen feet thick. Most of this work was carried on in heavy rain, which greatly added to the general discomfort of the men. On November 28th the garrison was encouraged by the information that the Boers had been badly beaten near Estcourt, that 3000 of them had gone off (it was not reported...", "...the King of England to treat with the Colonies of America had not then passed.

He immediately gave orders for constructing <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> ships of the line, the greater part of the first rate. The city of Paris and several other cities and corporations had offered some others, and it was expected, that the King would, in the course of the next campaign, have twenty new ships to oppose the enemy.

It requires no prophet to foresee the awful consequences of such an experiment on the lives, the liberties, the fortunes, and the morals, of the people of the Southern States. Let us briefly notice some of these consequences. Consider, in the first place, the vast amount of property which would be destroyed by the madness of such an experiment. According to the estimate of Mr. Clay, \"the total value of the slave property in the United States is <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred millions of dollars,\" all of which the people of the South are expected to sacrifice on the altar of abolitionism. It only moves the indignation of the abolitionist that we should for one moment hesitate. \"I see,\" he exclaims, \"in the immenseness of the value of the slaves, the enormous amount of the robbery committed on them. I see 'twelve hundred millions of dollars' seized, extorted by unrighteous force.\"[206] But, unfortunately, his passions are so furious, that his...", "...to their places on the 12th, the Boer searchlight on Bulwana was flashing everywhere, and the mountain guns throwing star shell. It looked as if both sides expected an attack. The officer commanding the two companies had orders to operate on the flank of any attack made on the northern defences. On the following morning the garrison was told that General Buller was moving round by Springfield; in the evening it was given out that he was moving west of Chieveley and Colenso, and was <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles from Ladysmith; and on the 14th the news came in that he was at Potgieter's Drift, and that General Warren was across the Tugela River; and in confirmation of this last information heavy gun fire was heard on the 17th in the direction of Potgieters, and the relieving army's balloon was seen on the following day in the same direction. As an attack was expected on the night of the 19th on Observation Hill, three companies of the Regiment under Major Curry proceeded there...", "...the liquor is cold, for every three gallons beat up an egg with some of the liquor; put altogether into a boiler, and boil gently till the syrup acquires the consistence of treacle.

This syrup, which will be found a better substitute for sugar than treacle, and more wholesome, should be kept in lightly-covered vessels, in a dry place. My own observations, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years ago, acquainted me with the fact, that when the grain in the ear has acquired one half of the full size, the quantity of sugar in the sap has passed its maximum, or begun to decrease, and continues to do so until it disappears entirely.

A light Delaware River skiff, pointed at each end, was purchased, and Mr. Cloud left Philadelphia in the month of August, promising his friend to arrive in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> or fourteen days. After waiting a few days to enable Mr. Cloud to get fairly started upon his voyage, which was to be made principally by canals to the Alleghany River, the manager went to Pittsburgh with letters of introduction to the editors of that busy city.

In the centre of each, and at the end of the wings where these existed, was what seemed to be a door of some translucent material about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> feet in height. But I observed that these doors were divided by a scarcely perceptible line up to six feet from the ground, and presently one of these parted, and a figure, closely resembling that of my guide, came out.

The negotiations apparently fell through, as Taylor was eventually given a commission by the Spaniards. The letter relates how the crew boasted that they had, each man, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred pounds in gold and silver, besides a great store of diamonds and many rich goods. Of the sharing of these diamonds, Johnson tells a story how one man, being given for his share one big diamond instead of a number of small ones, broke it up with a hammer, so that he might have as many 'sparks' as the others.

This iridescence is variable, and seems dependent upon age, season and other circumstances. The female is blackish-brown, and sometimes quite lustrous. The bill, tarsi and toes are pure black, and the iris sulphur-yellow. The male differs from his partner in size, being from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to thirteen inches in length, while the latter ranges from eleven to twelve. In dimensions of wing and tail there are also perceptible differences, the former averaging five and two-thirds inches, and the latter five and one-third in the male.

Fifthly, even in the orthodox Jahveh-worship, some symbols, as the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> oxen in the porch of the temple,[25] the horns of the altar for burnt-offerings,[26] perhaps also the in part oxlike form of the cherubim,[27] point to an earlier worship of the deity under the form of an ox, the symbol of the highest might, especially among the Semitic races.[28] In confirmation of the supposition thus suggested of a community of origin in the religion of the Israelites and in that of the nations related to them, there is also to be remarked, firstly, the...", "...yet I am sensible, it is by sifting his beauties from his conceits that his imitator has been enabled to excel him.

The uncertainty about the apostles of Jesus is quite in keeping with the uncertainty about Jesus himself. The report that Jesus had <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> apostles seems also mythical. The number twelve, like the number seven, or three, or forty, plays an important role in all Sun-myths, and points to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Jacob had twelve sons; there were twelve tribes of Israel; twelve months in the year; twelve gates or pillars of heaven, etc. In many of the religions of the world, the number twelve is sacred.

Then the workmen began to grumble once more, and the King again interviewed them. \"Do you still work twelve hours?\" he asked the deputation. \"Certainly, Your Majesty; but we think half would be quite enough,\" returned the spokesman. \"By all means--why not make it three hours?\" and again his subjects were departing, rejoicing, when once more he added, \"But I shall expect just the...", "...but members of the Civil Service abuse the most admirable forms that ever came out of our office. \"Numerous?

These were simple and brief. It was agreed that <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> paces should be measured out, six each way, from a fixed point; one six to be paced by the admiral, and the other by Marchdale; then they were to draw lots, to see at which end of this imaginary line Varney was to be placed; after this the signal for firing was to be one, two, three--fire!

He considers that the suddenness of the coming of glaciation is one of the strongest arguments against the carbon dioxide hypothesis of glaciation. According to the cyclonic hypothesis, however, the suddenness of the oncoming of glaciation is merely what would be expected on the basis of what happens today. Changes in the sun occur suddenly. The sunspot cycle is only eleven or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years long, and even this short period of activity is inaugurated more suddenly than it declines. Again the climatic record derived from the growth of trees, as given in Figs. 4 and 5, also shows that marked changes in climate are initiated more rapidly than they disappear. In this connection, however, it must be remembered that solar activity may arise in various ways, as will appear more fully later. Under certain conditions storminess may increase and decrease slowly. III....", "...his door. Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him. He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars. \"Faugh!\" he exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars, wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.

Forty years of friendship, uninterrupted by rivalry or envy, crowned the lives of Poggius and Leonard Aretin, two of the illustrious revivers of letters.

Ben Jonson had <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> of these poetical sons. Walton the angler adopted Cotton, the translator of Montaigne.

Moreover, law business in Penfield was growing duller and duller. A younger firm in the county town, only <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles away, was robbing them of clients continually; and there were many long days during which Stephen sat idle at his desk, looking out in a vague, dreamy way on the street below, and wondering if the time were really coming when Mr. Williams would need a clerk no longer; and, if it did come, what he could possibly find to do in that town, by which he could earn money enough to support his mother.

The trees used in the structure are from ten to twelve inches in diameter; and are sunk about three feet in the earth, so as to leave a length of from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to fifteen feet above ground; with spaces between each stanchion sufficiently wide to permit a man to glide through. The uprights are made fast by transverse beams, to which they are lashed securely by ratans and flexible climbing plants, or as they are called \"jungle ropes,\" and the whole is steadied by means of forked supports, which grasp the tie beams, and prevent the work from being driven outward by the rush of the wild elephants.

Make it possible for them to haul it double that distance and you will double the business of our railway.\" And the business of local nature done by a railroad is a good criterion of the prosperity of the country in which it operates. Crops now raised on lands within reach of railways would of course be enhanced in value by good roads; more loads could be taken at less cost; weather...", "...for years, because there were so few suitable occasions for wearing them in a quiet country place, now reappeared in the form of bows and tuckers for the neck.

She was therefore to take a long railway journey, quite an event in itself, as she had rarely been farther by rail than the county town, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles distant, and even there she had always been accompanied by her father or mother. But just now there was so much to be done on the farm, that her father could spare neither the time nor money for a long journey, and the young girl was obliged to travel alone, a formidable undertaking, which seemed almost to spoil the anticipated pleasure of the sea-side visit.

We anchored on the north shore, off a sandy bay, which I think as good a birth as any in the bay; Cape Banks bore east-south-east, and Point Solander south-south-east, the ground clear and good. The wind, either from the north-east or south-east quarters, set in a prodigious sea.

There then arose at Oxford, out of old French, and old oak, and old china, a \"school\" or \"movement.\" It was aesthetic, and an early purchaser of Mr. William Morris's wall papers. It existed ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years before the public \"caught on,\" as they say, to these delights. But, except one or two of the masters, the school were only playing at aesthetics, and laughing at their own performances.

According to Praetorius, the lute had four open strings tuned according to the scale in _a_ below. Later, a G was added above and below, and the tuning was that at _b_. [Music illustration] Another authority--Baron--gives a tuning for an \"eleven-course\" lute, as follows: [Music illustration] The F below the bass staff had ten frets, G eleven, and each of the highest six strings <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> frets. The instrument thus had a compass of three octaves and a half from the C below the bass. All the strings were in pairs, two to each unison, excepting the upper two, which were single. The instrument was a very troublesome one to keep in order. Mattheson, who wrote in the latter part of the eighteenth century, when the lute was still cultivated, said that a lutist of eighty years must have spent nearly sixty in tuning his instrument. The pull of the strings broke down the...", "...them still in that wild land, hunting the reindeer, and digging pits for the mountain sheep to fall into.

The terrible slaughter which bears the name of the battle of Malplaquet showed a new temper in the French soldiers. Starving as they were, they flung away their rations in their eagerness for the fight, and fell back at its close in serried masses that no efforts of Marlborough could break. They had lost <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand men, but the forcing their lines of entrenchment had cost the allies a loss of double that number. Horror at such a \"deluge of blood\" increased the general distaste for the war; and the rejection of fresh French offers in 1710, a rejection unjustly attributed to Marlborough's desire for the lengthening out of a contest which brought him profit and power, fired at last the smouldering discontent into flame.

At last he lighted upon a good device, and much he thanked Zeus for that this once the giant had driven the rams with the other sheep into the cave. For, these being great and strong, he fastened his comrades under the bellies of the beasts, tying them with osier twigs, of which the giant made his bed. One ram he took, and fastened a man beneath it, and two others he set, one on either side. So he did with the six, for but six were left out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> who had ventured with him from the ship. And there was one mighty ram, far larger than all the others, and to this Ulysses clung, grasping the fleece tight with both his hands. So they waited for the morning. And when the morning came, the rams rushed forth to the pasture; but the giant sat in the door and felt the back of each as it went by, nor thought to try what might be underneath. Last of all went the great ram. And the Cyclops knew him as he passed and said: \"How is...", "...I see, being the only two that do anything like men. Prince Rupert do nothing but laugh a little, with an oath now and then.\"[2] But if Rupert was indifferent about Tangiers he was keenly interested in the African question. The quarrels of the English and Dutch traders on the African coast had produced much ill-feeling between the two nations, and, in August {303} 1664, Rupert offered to lead a fleet to Guinea, to oppose the aggressions of the Dutch Admiral, De Ruyter. A fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> ships was accordingly fitted out. On September 3, wrote Pepys: \"Prince Rupert, I hear this day, is going to command this fleet going to Guinea against the Dutch. I doubt few will be pleased with his going, he being accounted an unhappy man;\"[3]--a view which contrasts strangely with the terror which Rupert's mere name had roused in earlier days. Two days later Pepys had encountered Rupert himself: \"And, among other things, says he: 'D-- me!

Like Lee and Stonewall Jackson in Virginia, Grant, with as yet inferior numbers (but with the immense advantage of sea-power), had seized, held, and acted on interior lines so ably that his forty-three thousand men had out-maneuvered and out-fought the sixty thousand of the enemy, beating them in detail on ground of their own besides inflicting a threefold loss. Grant lost little over four thousand. The Confederates lost nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand, half of whom were captured.

McClernand had promulgated an order praising his own. corps to the skies and conveying the idea that he and it had won the battles.

It took us a little over <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hours' swift steaming to run down to the mouth of the river on the upper course of which our progress had been so slow and painful; from source to mouth, according to our itinerary and to Lyra's calculations, the course of the stream down which we had thus come was about 1,500 kilometres in length--about 900 miles, perhaps nearly 1,000 miles-- from its source near the 13th degree in the highlands to its mouth in the Madeira, near the 5th degree. Next morning we were on the...", "...Eighteen Hundred Twenty-eight that an Englishman, Sir David Wilkie, following up the clue of Mengs, began quietly to buy up all the stray pictures by Velasquez he could find in Spain. He sent them to England, and the world one day awoke to the fact that Velasquez was one of the greatest artists of all time. Curtis compiled a list of two hundred seventy-four pictures by Velasquez, which he pronounces authentic. Of these, one hundred twenty-one were owned in England, thirteen in France, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> in Austria and eight in Italy. At least fifteen of the English 'oldings have since been transferred to America; so, outside of England and Spain, America possesses more of the works of this master than any other country. But of this be sure: no \"Velasquez\" will ever leave Spain unless spirited out of the country between two days--and if one is carried away, it will not be in the false bottom of a trunk. Within a year one \"Velasquez\" was so found secreted at Cadiz, and the owner...", "...course of the war might have been altogether changed. Lord Cochrane had gone into the Gulf of Patras in hope of meeting with Captain Hastings, from whom he had parted soon after leaving Spetzas; but the _Karteria_ had been disabled by a squall, which took away both her masts, and so had to return to Poros; and with the ill-manned _Hellas_ alone Lord Cochrane did not deem it prudent, as he had wished, to attack Navarino, whither the besiegers of the Castle Tornese had gone, and where <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> Egyptian frigates, twenty corvettes, and forty or fifty smaller vessels were for some time lying. Several of these came out to take on board the Ottoman troops who had done their work at Cape Clarenza, and Lord Cochrane, on the 1st of June, remained for several hours within sight of them, ready and hoping to be attacked.

He accordingly contented himself with surveying the...", "...the firecock, the thoroughfare must be stopped. The expense also is no slight consideration, for if laid along with the water-pipes, each firecock, if properly laid, and the pit built round with cement, will cost eight or ten times as much as a plug.

When, however, it is necessary to work ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> engines, there is very often a deficiency. In many of the warehouse districts the supply is very limited indeed, although it is there that the largest fires take place. The water companies are generally willing to give any quantity of water, but they object to lay down large mains without any prospect of remuneration. The warehouse keepers decline to be at the expense of laying the pipes, and there the matter seems to rest.

The Count's object she did not know was that they might be compromised. In her trouble she went to the Archbishop, begging him to place her in a convent. It was all so repugnant to her, barely <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years old at marriage. But the Church could give no help: to live with her husband, she was told, was in her covenant. Then she told the frightful thing--of the advances of her husband's brother, who solicited, and said he loved her; told him that her husband knew it all, and let it go on. The Archbishop bade her be more affectionate to her husband, and to let his brother see it. So home she went again, and her husband's hate increased.

As the water of these streams flowed swiftly away from its source and encountered the cold blasts from the yawning gulf, it soon hardened into huge blocks of ice, which rolled downward into the immeasurable depths of the great abyss with a continual roar like thunder.

Whatever additions it may receive, and whatever corrections it may require, this analysis of social evolution will continue to be regarded as one of the great achievements of human intellect. The demand for the first of Comte's two works has gone on increasing in a significant degree. It was completed, as we have said, in 1842. A second edition was published in 1864; a third some years afterwards; and while we write (1876) a fourth is in the press. Three editions within <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of a work of abstract philosophy in six considerable volumes are the measure of a very striking influence. On the whole, we may suspect that no part of Comte's works has had so much to do with this marked success as his survey and review of the course of history. The third volume of the later work, the _Positive Polity_, treats of social dynamics, and takes us again over the ground of historic evolution. It abounds with remarks of extraordinary fertility and...", "...with the aid of the local counts, they are to make a clear report of it to the emperor.

So far as elemental passion and savagery had developed in <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years, and Noodles was not a backward boy, just so far had he developed his malevolence against Regan. Things were in a pretty strained condition in the environment of the Maguire shack; Noodles was unhappy all the time, and hungry most of the time.

The available material shows, indeed, that in England this sexually perverse whipping of children is no mere matter of imaginative literary expression, but that such perversities are a matter of actual experience. Such things are, however, by no means confined to England, as is shown by a large number of recorded observations. In Paris, not long ago, the following case was noted. A woman entered into relations with the parents of girls of eleven and <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of age, in order to hire the children as the subjects of chastisement for perverse sexual purposes. The parents, who must have known for what their children were wanted, received payment.

Early on the morning after our arrival the \"Zealandia\" was again under way, steering north-northeast, until the most northerly point of New Zealand was doubled, then an exact due-west course sped the good ship on her way to Sydney, Australia, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred and eighty miles distant. It is a stormy ocean that lies between these two countries, and it is useless to disguise the fact that the voyager who crosses it must make up his mind to great and unavoidable discomfort. Any one pursuing the course indicated in these pages, however, will have become pretty well seasoned before entering upon this stage of the long journey. The famous English man-of-war \"Challenger\" essayed this voyage between Sydney and Auckland twice before...", "...see, alas! in this beautiful place. Very busy; rather a worrying morning; so much to settle and arrange. Did some final shopping with the children. Met Lord Shaftesbury at lunch.

The wind had been so fresh and fair that we made a smart run of seven hours, sighting the lights at Nobby Head at about half-past ten. Our head was then put off the land, and we hove to, to wait for the tug.

The older was sent to work at once, and the younger a year later. Now, after nine years in this country, neither girl can speak English.

In one of the mining communities of Illinois, visited in the spring of 1919, Italian boys as young as <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> were found working in the mines. In New Mexico, children of twelve and ten, and even younger, were taken out of school each year in the spring to go with their fathers to work on other men's farms or to herd sheep.

Water boils when it reaches two hundred and twelve degrees, Fahrenheit, as any thermometer will tell you. In fact, you cannot heat water hotter than two hundred and twelve degrees, for at that temperature the water becomes steam. A mixture of sugar and water will not boil at two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> degrees but requires a higher temperature. Therefore, as the water passes off the sap in boiling, and as the amount of sugar per gallon increases, it gets hotter and hotter. It is necessary to watch boiling sap carefully to avoid burning. In making sirup it is important to have it just thick enough to taste right and not so thick that it will granulate. Sirup that weighs eleven pounds to the gallon has long been considered as \"just right,\" and it has been found by testing that...", "...12th May, 1735, Swift says, \"I never got a farthing for any thing I writ, except once.\"] * * * * * In the morning I received the letter, in its new form, from Mr. Leckie, with the annexed note. \"My dear Sir, \"I found my friend very ill in bed; he has, however, managed to copy the enclosed, with the alterations proposed.

The Morris Dancers made a considerable figure in the parochial festivals of the olden times. It is said the custom was introduced by the Moors into Spain. A few years ago a dance was performed in Herefordshire by eight men whose united ages amounted to eight hundred years; and Sir William Temple mentions that in a certain year of King James's reign there were ten men in Herefordshire who went about that county as Morris Dancers whose ages altogether numbered <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred years!

There are three Big-Tree groves in the Yosemite National Park, one in the General Grant, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> in the Sequoia. One of these twelve is the famous Giant Forest. The Sequoia and General Grant National Parks have more than a million Big Trees. Of these, more than twelve thousand are ten or more feet in diameter. A few of these trees are upwards of three hundred feet high, but the majority are about two hundred and fifty feet. Galen Clark, who made a long and careful study of the Big Trees, expressed the opinion that the Grizzly Giant was at least six thousand years old....", "...as they appeared, the doors were opened, the bridge lowered, and Sir Daniel himself, with Hatch and the parson at his side, stood ready to receive them. BOOK II THE MOAT HOUSE CHAPTER I DICK ASKS QUESTIONS The Moat House stood not far from the rough forest road. Externally it was a compact rectangle of red stone, flanked at each corner by a round tower, pierced for archery and battlemented at the top. Within, it enclosed a narrow court. The moat was perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> feet wide, crossed by a single drawbridge. It was supplied with water by a trench, leading to a forest pool, and commanded, through its whole length, from the battlements of the two southern towers. Except that one or two tall and thick trees had been suffered to remain within half a bowshot of the walls, the house was in a good posture for defence. In the court Dick found a part of the garrison busy with preparations for defence, and gloomily discussing the chances of a...", "...Consulate constantly broke their chains, and attacked the dogs and a cow, and as the hyaena occasionally got loose, and the wild boars destroyed their mud wall, and nearly killed one of my Tokrooris during the night, by carving him like a scored leg of pork with their tusks, the fact of sleeping in the open air in the verandah, with the simple protection of a mosquito-netting, was full of pleasant excitement, and was a piquante entertainment that prevented a reaction of ennui after <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> months passed in constant watchfulness. The shield over the Consulate door, with the lion and the unicorn, was but a sign of the life within; as the grand picture outside the showman's wagon may exemplify the nature of his exhibition. I enjoyed myself extremely with these creatures, especially when the ostriches invited themselves to tea, and swallowed our slices of water-melons and the greater portion of the bread from the table a few moments before we were seated. These birds...", "...days, which was doubtless founded on the first attempts to measure time by the four phases of the lunar month, became associated with the seven planets in the remotest antiquity, and the names of their seven presiding gods, in the same order and with the same meaning, have descended unchanged to our own times, as will be shown more fully in a subsequent chapter. Observations on the sun's annual course led to the fixing of it along a zodiac of twelve signs, corresponding roughly to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> lunar months, and defined by constellations, or groups of stars, having a fanciful resemblance to animals or deified heroes. Those zodiacal signs are of immense antiquity and world-wide universality. We find them in the earliest mythology of Chaldaea and Egypt, in the labours of Hercules, in the traditions of a deluge associated with the sign of Aquarius, and even, though in a somewhat altered form, in such distant countries as China and Mexico. Probably they originated in...", "...right hand, guided it into making on the ground a cross, when instantly three miracles ensued: (1) A spring of water bubbled from the dry ground; (2) the blind man, bathing his eyes with this water, received his sight; and (3) the man, who before could neither write nor read, was instantly inspired with both these gifts\" (191. 237). Brewer relates other instances of the miraculous power of the child-saint from the lives of St. Genevieve (423-512, A.D.), St. Vitus, who at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> caused the arms and legs of the Emperor Aurelian to wither, but on the Emperor owning the greatness of God, the \"child-magician,\" as the monarch had termed him, made Aurelian whole again; St. Sampson (565 A.D.), who cured a fellow schoolboy of a deadly serpent's bite; Marianne de Quito (1618-1645 A.D.), who cured herself of a gangrened finger (191. 442).

They huddled us all into a sort of hostelry, at the door of which were posted a dozen soldiers; we were for <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> days prisoners of war, and we had to pay a hundred and forty crowns a day.\" Voltaire was furious; Madame Denis was ill, or feigned to be; she wrote letter after letter to Voltaire's friends in Prussia, and to the king himself. The affair was growing daily more serious. Finally the city authorities themselves, who doubtless felt that they were not playing a very creditable part, put an end to it by ordering Freytag to release his prisoner.

She was fully satisfied so far as that part was concerned; she said she herself objected to children and did not intend to have any and knew how to take care of herself. All she wanted to know was, whether she was in danger of being infected. I told her no, but that in my opinion there was some danger of her husband developing general paresis or locomotor ataxia. The girl had been a teacher for about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years, and she was so sick at heart of the work, was so anxious for a home of her own, that she decided to take the risk. And they got married. The marriage remained childless. The man developed general paresis (softening of the brain) three years later and died about a year afterward. The woman, now a widow, I understand, is not sorry for the step she had taken. This shows what things our social-economic conditions and our moral code are responsible for.

One year after this the Moscow Conservatoire was founded, with Nicholas Rubinstein at its head. The position of Professor of Composition and Musical History was offered to Tschaikowsky, then only twenty-six. It was a flattering offer for so young a man, when many older heads would have liked to secure such an honor. He moved to Moscow, and retained his position in the Conservatoire for at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years, in the meantime making many friends for himself and his art, as his fame as a composer grew. One of these friends was the publisher Jurgenson, who was to play rather an important part in the composer's life, through accepting and putting forth his compositions. During those first years in Moscow, Tschaikowsky made his home with Nicholas Rubinstein. His life was of the simplest, his fare always so.

Scrub oaks and bay trees grew in a tangle all about it, even a few young redwoods and an occasional bronze and white madrona tree. Wild roses and field flowers crowded against its very walls, and under the trees there were iris and brown lilies, and a dense undergrowth of manzanita and hazelnut bushes, wild currant and wild lilac trees. The big room that Julia entered first was dim with pleasant twilight, and full of the sweet odours of a dying wood fire. It had...", "...in pieces, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. 52:18 The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away. 52:19 The cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the bowls--that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver,--the captain of the guard took away. 52:20 The two pillars, the one sea, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> bronze bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh.

Nothing of any consequence occurred on the voyage. The Pacific fully bore out its name, and was as calm as Mr. Fogg himself. Mrs. Aouda felt more and more attached to this taciturn man by even stronger ties than...", "...were fifteen nuns in the house at the time and it is likely that the number of children given is a pardonable exaggeration by local gentlemen who were interested in preserving the nunnery; but it seems undoubted that there was a comparatively large school there. At Stixwould, again, in 1440 there were about eighteen children to an equal number of nuns. These, however, are the largest schools of which we have record. At St Michael's Stamford in 1440 there were seven or eight children to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> nuns, at Catesby in 1442 six or seven children to seven nuns. At Swaffham Bulbeck, where there were probably eight or nine nuns, there were nine children in 1483. These also are schools, though small schools. But at other houses there were only one or two children at a time. The accounts of the Prioress of St Helen's Bishopsgate in 1298 mention only two children, there were only two at Littlemore in 1445 and two at Sopwell at the time of the Dissolution. It must be remembered...", "...not quite perpendicular, had been worn by the continual passage of baboons; the second, that something white was hanging on a bush near the top of the ascent.

But the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> or fifteen feet could only be scaled by throwing a rope over the trunk of a stunted tree, which grew at the bottom of the opening. This we accomplished with some trouble, and the rest was easy. A foot or two above my head the handkerchief fluttered in the wind. Hanging to the rope, I grasped it. It was my wife's.

Many came hither to fill bottles, metal cans, and stoneware pitchers. To prevent too great a waste of water, the tap only acted when a knob was pressed with the hand. And thus many weak-handed women lingered there a long time, the water dripping on their feet. Those who had no cans to fill at least came to drink and wash their faces. Pierre noticed one young man who drank seven small glassfuls of water, and washed his eyes...", "...The vaqueros went in pursuit of him with the lazos, and, chasing him round, the spear fell out, and they caught him. In the mean time, the fallen man was picked up by some of his companions, and carried off, doubled up, and apparently cured forever of bull-fighting. We heard afterward that he only had some of his ribs broken. He was hardly out of sight when the accident was forgotten; the bull was again assaulted, worried out, and dragged off. Others followed, making eight in all. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock the church bells rang and the fight ended, but, as we were dispersing, we were reminded that another would begin at four o'clock in the afternoon. At four we were again in our places. Our special reason for following up this sport so closely was because we were advised that in the morning common people only attended, but that in the afternoon all the _gente decente_, or upper classes, of Merida would be present.

He would have to go to our parish church, and I spoke to the rector of St. Sauveur, who promised to let him say mass, for which he would receive the usual sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> sols. This was a very good beginning, and might have led to something worth having; but when we told the worthy abbe of our success, he got into a rage, saying that he was not the man to say mass for twelve sols, nor to toady the archbishop in the hope of being taken into his service.

Will that suit?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You will, of course, put up one hundred dollars as security,\" added the assumed broker. \"What security will you give?\" demanded the bright young man from Newark. \"Oh, I'll give you my personal note,\" answered Hamilton Dart, carelessly. \"Well, I'll think it over.\" \"Eh?

I did not receive the last until Tuesday night. I was so delighted with it that even as I read it I sent him a draught for a thousand guineas. The two poems are altogether no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred and fifteen hundred lines, and will altogether sell for five and sixpence. But he returned the draught, saying that it was very liberal--much more than they were worth; that I was perfectly welcome to both poems to print in his (collected) works without cost or expectation, but that he did not think them equal to what they ought to be, and that he would not admit of their separate publication.

When Francis, fourth Viscount Castlewood, came to his title, and presently after to take possession of his house of Castlewood, county Hants, in the year 1691, almost the only tenant of the place besides the domestics was a lad of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years of age, of whom no one seemed to take any note until my Lady Viscountess lighted upon him, going over the house with the housekeeper on the day of her arrival. The boy was in the room known as the Book-room, or Yellow Gallery, where the portraits of the family used to hang, that fine piece among others of Sir Antonio Van Dyck of George, second Viscount, and that by Mr. Dobson of my lord the third Viscount, just deceased, which it seems his lady and widow did not think fit...", "...acre to his land, and rejoiced in being laird of Abbotsford. The speed with which Scott wrote was marvelous. His house was always full of visitors, yet he always had time to entertain them. He was never known to refuse to see a friend, gentle or simple, and was courteous even to the bores who daily invaded his home. He had unbounded energy. He rose early in the morning, and before the rest of the family was astir had finished more than half of his daily task of writing. Thus by <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock he was free to entertain his guests. If ever man was happy and successful, Scott seemed to be that man. But suddenly all his fair prospects were darkened over. Sir Walter was in some degree a partner in the business both of his publisher and his printer. Now both publisher and printer failed, and Scott found himself ruined with them. At fifty-five he was not only a ruined man, but loaded with a terrible debt of 117,000 pounds.

Palam{=e}des, however, suspecting the frenzy to be assumed, threw Telemachus, then an infant, in the way of the plough, to try if his father would alter its course. This stratagem succeeded; for when Ulysses came to the child he turned off from the spot, in consequence of which Palam{=e}des compelled him to take part in the war. He accordingly sailed with <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> ships, and was signally serviceable to the Greeks. To him the capture of Troy is chiefly to be ascribed, since by him the obstacles were removed, which had so long prevented it. For as Ulysses himself was detected by Palam{=e}des, so he in his turn detected Achilles, who, to avoid engaging in the same war, had concealed himself in the habits of a woman, at the court of Lycom{=e}des, king of Scyros.

But in 1852, the Basutos had plenty of ponies, and used them in the short campaign of that year with extraordinary effect.

The number of deputies, however, who had hitherto been elected in the proportion of one to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> thousand of the population, was reduced in 1905, when the proportion of one to sixteen thousand was substituted; the Chamber of 1906, elected under the new system, consisted of 177 deputies.

The great Portuguese colony of Brazil, like many of the Spanish colonies, was open to the attacks of buccaneers and of free lances of the seas bearing the flags of various countries of Europe.

Its turn for assault came in 1710. In that year a squadron appeared in the waters outside the harbor on which the people looked with doubt. It flew the French flag, and that standard had not been a welcome visitor in the past. In fact, it was commanded by a daring Frenchman named...", "...come quickly the whole of these rifles and ammunition would be theirs. In the joy of knowing this I cared not a jot what happened to us.

I shall discuss this item briefly, using concrete illustrations from our sources. In that early period the voyage was made by sail-ships. These continued to be used for a long time after steam had come into use, clear down into the seventies. The ticket was then generally somewhat cheaper by sailing vessels than by steamship. Passengers furnished their own board and beading, and they were required to bring a supply sufficient for ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> weeks.[208] The price of passage ranged between 33 and 50 _speciedaler_, that is between $25.00 and $38.00. Children under fourteen travelled for half price; those under one went free.

This calculation for a long time seemed thoroughly satisfactory, but it is not the last word on the subject. Quite lately an error has been found in the working, which diminishes the theoretical gravitation-acceleration to six seconds a century instead of ten, thus making it insufficient to agree exactly with fact. The theory of gravitation leaves an outstanding error.

And the revel went whirlingly on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock. And then the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before. But now there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.

The other man really became serious. Perhaps this individual (Hurstwood) really did have a stiff hand. \"I call,\" he said. Hurstwood showed his hand. He was done.

With no one of these propositions can I agree. Whether or not the Northern Americans will succeed in reconquering the South, I do not affect to foresee. That they _can_ conquer it, if their present determination holds, I have never entertained a doubt; for they are twice as numerous, and ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> times as rich.

This was the belief that Jesus himself sought to fasten in their minds; and when he had drawn from Simon Peter a confession of this faith he cried out, \"Blessed art thou, Simon son of John; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\" It was this faith in him as Lord and Ruler of men, as the Founder in this world of a kingdom of righteousness and peace, on which, as he declared, his church should be builded. Such faith as this these <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> men had.

B.

Since they or I might die at any moment, I determined not to delay longer. So I prepared a list of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> men who seemed to me most worth knowing, and then I set out to see them; not with the hope of becoming personally acquainted with them or even with the object of interviewing them, but chiefly to satisfy myself that they really existed.

Second--The Deity. Third--Peter. Fourth--Some <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> or fifteen canonized Popes and martyrs. Fifth--Jesus Christ the Saviour--(but always as an infant in arms.) I may be wrong in this--my judgment errs often, just as is the case with other men's--but it is my judgment, be it good or bad. Just here I will mention something that seems curious to me. There are no \"Christ's Churches\" in Rome, and no \"Churches of the Holy Ghost,\" that I can discover.

The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> he brought only six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.

Right ahead of us, as far as the eye could see, was an open channel, straight as a die and just a little wider than the boat! All was activity now. It seemed only a moment until we were under way.

But when morning dawned, their own ship was out of sight even from the mast head, and with a fair wind for her to go through the straits of Macassar. Being treated coolly by the captain, they agreed with one voice to leave the ship in search of their own. On leaving the vessel, the captain gave them twelve musket cartridges and a round bottle of brandy, but neither water nor provision of any sort. They rowed till <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock at night, in hopes of seeing their own vessel, and then drawing near an island they thought it prudent to go there to get some fresh water.--They landed and made a large fire in hopes their ship might see it.

They soon had the shore...", "...have already given several interesting examples of electricity upon the stage. We now present some engravings of the electric torch and electric jewels for which the theatrical world is indebted to the French inventor M. Trouve. The electric torch was devised for use in M. Saint-Saens' \"Ascanio.\" In the mythological ballet, Ph[oe]bus appears among the Muses, holding the torch of Genius in his hand; the torch is of moderate size and elegant form, and must be brilliantly illuminated from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to fifteen minutes at each performance. An incandescent lamp scarcely concealed under colored glass jewels solves the problem. The principal difficulty was to light this lamp without the use of conductors, which should furnish the electrical current desired. M. Trouve constructed some portable accumulators which are placed in the torch. The accumulators are six in number; the first three occupy the upper part of the torch, and the three others the lower part. They are of the...", "...that their contractions and expansions can so readily obey the will as to produce these effects? The opening of the glottis which forms the voice is so extremely small, and in every variety of tone its diameter must suffer a sensible change; for the same diameter must ever produce the same tone. So _wonderfully_ minute are its contractions and dilatations, that Dr. Kiel, I think, computed that in some voices its opening, not more than the tenth of an inch, is divided into upward of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred parts, the different sound of every one of which is perceptible to the exact ear. Now, what a nice tension of fibers must this require! I should imagine even the most minute change in the air causes a sensible difference, and that in our foggy climate fibers would be in danger of losing this wonderful sensibility, or, at least, that they would very often be put out of tune. It is not the same case with an ordinary voice, where the variety of divisions run through and the...", "...been among the spectators on the bank; he had hardly once left the river. It did not seem to him strange that Carroll should not have been there to welcome him after the struggle was over. Rarely did she get to the booms in ordinary circumstances.

There was no reason why Carroll should drive the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles between Monrovia and the booms, unless curiosity should take her.

The contact of each of the feet of the Pedrail is absolutely free from all slipping action, and attains the absolute ideal of working, being merely placed in position without sliding to...", "...\"Come!\" continued the cavalier, as the train of his reflections was interrupted by some thought prompting him to the necessity of action. \"I must get these letters ready against the arrival of my messengers.

I have insured myself in the Union Office, and have lately received my second policy. I have now paid upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> pounds for policies. F. says that he told him months ago that the demand he made would not be allowed, that I insured myself and was my own agent, and that as he shall see him in a few days he will tell him so again.

Mr. Field said he had often, in the long struggle--nearly thirteen years in the forests of Newfoundland, on ships in stormy seas--almost accused himself of madness, sacrificing everything for what might prove, after all, but a dream. He received the thanks of Congress, with a gold medal--the grand medal of the French Exposition of 1867. Honors were heaped upon him. If he had been a British subject, he would have been made a baronet. He had given <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years without accepting remuneration for time or toil, and his hopeful, at last haggard dream, was a marvellous golden reality. He was forty-seven years of age. He visited Egypt at the opening of the Suez Canal in 1864. He attended the millennial celebration of the settlement of Iceland in August, 1874. He made with his wife a trip around the world in 1880. He was known in all civilized lands as one of the foremost men of his time.

The upper ends of these posts are mortised into a transverse beam which is <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> feet, two palms, and three digits long, and projects five digits beyond the first post and to the same distance beyond the fourth; it is two palms and the same number of digits wide, and two palms thick.

In Florida cat fish will take a fly, and I may also add a spinner. In this State we have a number of species of this fish, and one is a surface feeder. In the evening, when they are feeding on the surface, they will not reject a large and gaudy fly. To those who have been accustomed to capture with a stout rod diminutive specimens of catties, I will say, hook on to a catty weighing from six to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> pounds and there will be \"music in the air,\" and unless skill is exercised on the part of the fisherman the leader will go to where the \"woodbine twineth.\" In Florida, as everywhere else, the best fishing is near where A., B. or C. run a hotel or keep a boarding house, or where certain steamboats make a terminal landing. But in my experience the best places to fish, as a rule, are where there are no hotels or specimens of the colored persuasion with their cast nets.

His father, a surgeon at Lancaster, died, leaving a family of eleven children, of whom William Jackson was the seventh son. The elder boys had been well educated while the father lived, but at his death the younger members had to shift for themselves. William, when under <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years old, was taken from school, and put to hard work at a ship's side from six in the morning till nine at night. His master falling ill, the boy was taken into the counting-house, where he had more leisure. This gave him an opportunity of reading, and having obtained access to a set of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica,' he read the volumes through from A to Z, partly by day, but chiefly at night. He afterwards put himself to a trade, was diligent, and succeeded in it. Now...", "...of Ruins on the Island of Titicaca.----------- The whole appearance of the island shows how highly it was regarded. In one place the remains of a drinking fountain were noticed. Streams from some unknown source were still bringing to it their limpid burden. Perhaps as noticeable a ruin as any is represented in this cut. It is called the Palace. It is in a sheltered nook. The lake washes the very foot of the foundation on which it stands. It is two-storied. In the lower story were <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> rooms, so connected with each other that but four of them communicated by doors with the outside. The others were certainly dark and illy ventilated. The second story was entered by means of the terrace in the rear. The same statement may be made in regard to its rooms; they did not, however, at all correspond in arrangement with the rooms below. The Island of Coati, but a short distance to the south-east, was sacred to the moon. It has also a number of ruins. The approach to...", "...of Chambord. CHAPTER XX THE READING Shortly after the events just narrated, at the corner of the Palais- Royal, at a small and pretty house, numerous carriages were seen to draw up, and a door, reached by three steps, frequently to open. The neighbors often came to their windows to complain of the noise made at so late an hour of the night, despite the fear of robbers; and the patrol often stopped in surprise, and passed on only when they saw at each carriage ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> footmen, armed with staves and carrying torches. A young gentleman, followed by three lackeys, entered and asked for Mademoiselle de Lorme. He wore a long rapier, ornamented with pink ribbon. Enormous bows of the same color on his high-heeled shoes almost entirely concealed his feet, which after the fashion of the day he turned very much out. He frequently twisted a small curling moustache, and before entering combed his small pointed beard. There was but one exclamation...", "...or arched, and tapered at both ends; color brownish-red.

But when it was evening, he sat down with his <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> disciples. 26:21. And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you that one of you is about to betray me. 26:22. And they being very much troubled began every one to say: Is it I, Lord? 26:23. But he answering said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me. 26:24. The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been...", "...twenty-five feet of me a female warbler with nest material in her bill. I stopped instantly and, remaining motionless, was greatly relieved to see the warbler continue undisturbed by my presence. In a moment she dropped to the ground and entered the nest, which was on the sloping right bank of the stream about six feet back from the margin of the rocky stream bed. After working for about twenty seconds the warbler left the nest and flew down the stream bed a hundred and fifty feet. In <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> minutes she was back with more nest material to repeat the performance. Subsequent excursions for building material during the ensuing hour were of three, twelve, six, and twenty-two minutes' duration. Each time she worked at the nest only fifteen to twenty seconds, until the last trip (at 11:43 A. M.) when she worked about two minutes and then departed, probably to feed, for she did not return again while I watched. Each trip to the nest had been made undeviatingly, without any...", "...that one of the prophets of old was risen again. Herod said, I have beheaded John so who is this of whom I hear so much? He wanted to see Him. When they returned, the apostles told Jesus all that they had done. He took them and went into a private desert place that belonged to the city of Bethsaida. But people soon found out and followed Him. Jesus received them. He spoke to them of the kingdom of God and healed those who had need of healing. When the day began to wear away, the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> came and said to Him, Send the multitude away so they may go into the towns and country nearby to find lodging and get food. But He said to them, Give ye them to eat. They answered, We have no more than five loaves and two fish unless we go and buy meat for all these people, about five thousand men.

Each coach carried from ten to twelve passengers, and the trip from Moorgate to Paddington, five miles, was made in a half hour, including stops. On the trial trip a speed of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles an hour, exclusive of stops, was maintained. Later in the same year the Era, with its name changed to the Erin, was sent to Dublin, Ireland, where it was exhibited and run in and about the city, by Hancock, for eight days, before it was reshipped to Stratford.

There never was perfect harmony between Washington and Lee; and the aid of the latter, though a brave and experienced officer, was easily dispensed with. No action of importance occurred during this campaign, and it was chiefly signalized by the arrival of the Count d'Estaing, with twelve ships of the line and four frigates, to assist the Americans. But, in consequence of disagreements and mistakes, this large armament failed to engage the English naval forces.

The manufacturer of our illustration might even keep his <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> cutters at work after the introduction of the machines referred to and do twelve times as much cutting, provided that he could quickly increase his output of finished shoes to twelvefold its former amount. There are practical reasons why he could almost never do this; but if he actually did it, he might, by some reduction in the price of shoes, find a market for this increased product. If the reduction of price were great, some competitors would probably go at once out of the...", "...it has hitherto not been available for commercial purposes.

In one factory the clock was set back during working-hours, so that the operatives worked overtime without extra pay; in another, a whole quarter of an hour overtime was worked; in a third, there were two clocks, an ordinary one and a machine clock, which registered the revolutions of the main shaft; if the machinery went slowly, working-hours were measured by the machine clock until the number of revolutions due in <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hours was reached; if work went well, so that the number was reached before the usual working- hours were ended, the operatives were forced to toil on to the end of the twelfth hour.

The qualification of a burgess or county elector is substantially the occupation of rated property within the borough or county, residence during a qualifying period of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> months within the borough or county, and payment of rates for the qualifying property. A person so qualified is entitled to be enrolled as a burgess, or registered as a county elector (as the case may be), unless he is alien, has during the qualifying period received union or parochial relief or other alms, or is disentitled under some act of parliament such as the Corrupt Practices Act, the Felony Act, &c.

As some of these capsules were very fine, and as five were borne on one twig, I suspect that some minute insect had accidentally got under the net and had brought pollen from the other form to the flowers which produced this little group of capsules. The one uncovered short-styled plant which grew close to the uncovered long-styled plant yielded <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> capsules. From these facts we have some reason to believe, as in the case of L. grandiflorum, that the short-styled plants are in a slight degree more fertile with their own pollen than are the long-styled plants. Anyhow we have the clearest evidence, that the stigmas of each form require for full fertility that pollen from the stamens of corresponding height belonging to the opposite form should be brought to them.

Only when he felt the weight off them, as the sack touched bottom, did he release his hold. Then with cautious steps he continued his progress round the house and, coming to the other side, crouched close by the wall again and waited. Where he was now, he could see the fence that separated the front garden from the road, and he was not more than ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> feet from the front door on his left. As he huddled down there, he could not repress a smile of amusement, even of self-congratulation. However, he turned to the practical job of squeezing the water out of his sleeves. In thus congratulating himself, he was premature. His action had been based on a miscalculation.

Had he been captured in a man-of-war, or a merchantman, he would have done all he could for him; but, as it was, he let him go to Dartmoor--at least, this was the story in the prison. The old gentleman spoke very mildly to us, and said he could not blame us for attempting to escape. I do not think he had ever heard of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> pounds; though none of the navy officers were sorry that the privateer's-men should be punished. As for us, we considered them all enemies alike, on whom it was fair enough to live in a time of war. We were sent back to the island, and were quarantined again; though it was for twenty days, this time.

At ten minutes before <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock the prisoner was brought from his cell and pinioned by the hangman, who was brought from London for the purpose. He appeared resigned, but was so weak as to be unable to stand without support; when his cravat was removed he groaned heavily, and appeared to be labouring under great mental agony. When his wrists and arms were made fast, he was led round towards the scaffold, and as he passed the different yards in which the prisoners were...", "...by all.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock upon the third night of his arrival in the Kalahari village, Parton, who had now made every preparation, rode very silently and with every circumstance of caution, out into the night. With him were his three troopers and the two native allies--one a Bushman, the other a Griqua--who had acted as his spies and were now to show him the road. His broken arm was by no means yet at ease; but Parton, whatever else his demerits, had plenty of pluck, and just now, in his state...", "...with salt. Serve very hot.

Finally, Justine goes to see the woman, whose name is Madame Mahuchet; she bribes her and learns at last that her master has preserved a witness of his youthful follies, a nice little boy that looks very much like him, and that this woman is his nurse, the second-hand mother who has charge of little Frederick, who pays his quarterly school-bills, and through whose hands pass the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred or two thousand francs which Adolphe is supposed annually to lose at cards. \"What of the mother?\" exclaims Caroline. To end the matter, Justine, Caroline's good genius, proves to her that M'lle Suzanne Beauminet, formerly a grisette and somewhat later Madame Sainte-Suzanne, died at the hospital, or else that she has made her fortune, or else, again, that her place in society is so low there is no danger of madame's ever meeting her.

All effort, however, was quite fruitless, till an old _chiffonier_, also once a seamstress, united with her, and persuaded the mothers that they must prepare their children, or, at least, not prevent them from going. At present the school stands as one of the wisest philanthropies of Paris, but neither this, nor any other attempt to better conditions, alters the fact that <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> and fourteen hours of labor have for sole result from thirty to forty sous a day, and that this sum represents the earnings of the average women-workers of Paris, the better class of trades and occupations being no less limited in possibilities.

At about ten o'clock there was a roar like a dozen bulls, and the brother of the two giants came out of the wood, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> heads on him, and fire spouting from every one of them. \"I'll have you, my fine boy,\" cries he; \"how will you die, then?\" \"We'll see,\" says Billy; \"come on!\" And swinging his stick round his head, he made for the giant, and drove him up to his twelve necks in the ground.

It consists merely of a few dried sticks in a wheat-field, and contains from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to eighteen pretty little green and brown eggs. The quail itself is very prettily coloured with black, chestnut, yellow, and white, and the males have a black collar round their throats. The old Romans would not eat the flesh of the quail, because it feeds on the grains of a poisonous plant. But we moderns are not so scrupulous, and find it very delicious food.

I did not have long to wait, for very soon another mixed train came thundering along. As it slacked up, the only advantage offered was another of the Standard Oil tank cars. However, it was not covered with ice. I crawled in under the huge tank, lay flat down on my belly, and hung on to the rods. As yet I had only made about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> miles. As we sped on, I felt relieved that we were cutting down the miles. At the first stop, a voice greeted me. \"Hello.\" It was one of my negro friends.

The squirrels, too, were a pleasure to me in my horseback rides toward Vine Ridge, especially. Your grandfather and I would pause to watch them playing hide and seek just like children, scampering round and round, their pretty gray tails waving, until some noise would send them out of sight, and the silent forest would seem as if no living thing were near.

His uncle, George Pollock Devereux, happened to hear him and rebuked him sharply for so idle a boast, and when your dear grandfather manfully stood his ground, saying that it was not an idle boast, his uncle called him a vain braggart, which so offended your grandfather that he told his uncle that he would prove the...", "...legitimate, and must marry a legitimate.

The maternal uncle's right to the first two daughters is valued at eight out of twenty pagodas, and is carried out thus. If he urges his preferential claim, and marries his own sons to his nieces, he pays for each only <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> pagodas; and similarly if he, from not having sons, or any other cause, foregoes his claim, he receives eight pagodas of the twenty paid to the girl's parents by anybody else who may marry them.\" The price of a wife apparently differs in different localities.

In January I made an excursion with <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> or fifteen sledges to Sandford's camp on the Tilghai, and attempted to move his party to another point thirty or forty versts nearer Gizhiga; but in a severe storm on the Kuil steppe we were broken up, dispersed, and all lost separately, and after wandering around four or five days in clouds of drifting snow which hid even our dogs from sight, Sandford with a portion of his party returned to the Tilghai, and I with the remainder to Gizhiga.

After a time the salt water becomes diffused in the fresh, so that the density of the water in a river decreases as the distance from the sea increases.

The extent to which the suspended matter is carried back again up stream when the current turns depends upon the quantity of upland water which has flowed into the upper tidal part of the river during the ebb tide, as this water occupies a certain amount of space, according to the depth and width of the river, and thus prevents the sea water flowing back to the position it occupied on the previous tide, and carrying with it the matter in suspension....", "...He has fought German airmen high over the waves of advancing battalions and has heard, as a faint whisper coming up to him, the cheers of his fellow countrymen when he shot down his enemies at their feet.

Agnes and Neale found that the two big ice-boats were near at hand. As one of the crew of Mr. Howbridge's boat owned the scooter that Neale and Agnes had...", "...so that if a sudden movement, either of our own troops or of the enemy, necessitated it, we could at once throw the sketch-book over our shoulder, and advance or retreat as requisite.

Disgusted with this unprofitable state of things, Gasca resolved to rid himself of the annoyance at once, by retiring to the valley of Guaynarima, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> leagues distant from the city, and there digesting, in quiet, a scheme of compensation, adjusted to the merits of the parties. He was accompanied only by his secretary, and by Loaysa, now archbishop of Lima, a man of sense, and well acquainted with the affairs of the country. In this seclusion the president remained three months, making a careful examination into the conflicting claims, and apportioning the forfeitures among the parties according to their respective services....", "...Caliph Alhakem's was so large that the catalogue alone filled forty volumes. He had also apartments for the transcribing, binding, and ornamenting of books.

The edifice had <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred columns of Greek, Italian, Spanish, and African marble. The body-guard of the sovereign was composed of twelve thousand horsemen, whose cimeters and belts were studded with gold.

They are in size, when arrived at their full growth, from <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> to twenty feet in length, and from eight to fifteen in circumference. They are extremely fat, so that after having cut through the skin, which is about an inch in thickness, there is at least a foot of fat before you can come at either lean or bones; and we experienced more than once that the fat of some of the largest afforded us a butt of oil.

Reuilly was distant <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> leagues from Campvallon, which could be made shorter by a crosscut. M. de Camors did not hesitate to pass over this distance twice in the same night, to give himself the emotion of breathing for a few minutes the same air with his wife and child. Daniel had accompanied him two or three times, but the Count generally went alone. He left his horse in the wood, and approached as near as he could without risking discovery; and, hiding himself like a malefactor behind the shadows...", "...The old inhabitants of the hive, which, since privation of their queen, had begun twelve royal cells, also gave the fertile queen a good reception; they presented her with honey, and formed regular circles around her.

All was perfectly quiet on the other side of this comb. In the morning of the seventh, the bees had destroyed the <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> royal cells, but, independent of that, order continued prevalent in the hive; the queen laid the eggs of males in the large cells, and those of workers in the small ones, respectively. Towards the twelfth, we found the bees occupied in constructing twenty-two royal cells, of the same species described by M. de Reaumur, that is the bases not in the plane of the comb, but appended perpendicularly by pedicles or stalks of different length, like stalactites, on the edge of the...", "...shameful for a Persian to spit in public, or wipe the nose, or show signs of wind, or be seen going apart for his natural needs.

So it fell out that Mandane came to Astyages, bringing her son Cyrus with her.

Then the \"baying\" of the hounds who found the trail brought the other two parties of freshmen to them. Usually, four or five upper classmen ran with the hounds to decide upon \"captures\" in case of dispute.

Each hound was credited with the hare he captured. Twelve hares ran, also <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hounds. If the hounds captured seven or more of the hares ere the race was finished, then the hounds won. If they captured less than six, the hares won. If six hares were captured, then the race was a \"tie.\" But, as will be seen, with the five minutes' start, and the hares averaging a year more of age, the sophomore class usually won this chase.

Throughout this period the stars were looked upon mainly as points of reference for the observation of planetary motions, and the instruments of observation underwent little change. The astrolabe, which consists of a circle divided into degrees, with a rotating diametral arm for sighting purposes, embodies their essential principle. In its simple form, the astrolabe was suspended in a...", "...fished the last piece of beef out of his ear he went out and offered to stand treat. As the round-up was over, they slid into their saddles and raced for Cowan's saloon at Buckskin. CHAPTER II. The Rashness of Shorty Buckskin was very hot; in fact it was never anything else. Few people were on the streets and the town was quiet. Over in the Houston hotel a crowd of cowboys was lounging in the barroom. They were very quiet--a condition as rare as it was ominous. Their mounts, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> in all, were switching flies from their quivering skins in the corral at the rear. Eight of these had a large C 80 branded on their flanks; the other four, a Double Arrow. In the barroom a slim, wiry man was looking out of the dirty window up the street at Cowan's saloon. Shorty was complaining, \"They shore oughter be here now. They rounded up last week.\" The man nearest assured him that they would come. The man at the window turned and said, \"They's yer now.\" In front...", "...for Stiatta Ridolfi, in the church of Santo Jacopo sopr' Arno; that, namely, beside the chapel of the High Altar; and these works obtained him more credit than was given to his words. The consuls and wardens feeling at length assured, by the writing he had given them, and by the works which they had seen, entrusted the cupola to his care, and he was made principal master of the works by a majority of votes. They would nevertheless not commission him to proceed beyond the height of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> braccia, telling him that they desired to see how the work would succeed, but that if it proceeded as successfully as he expected, they would not fail to give him the appointment for the remainder. The sight of so much obstinacy and distrust in the syndics and wardens was so surprising to Filippo, that if he had not known himself to be the only person capable of conducting the work, he would not have laid a hand upon it; but desiring, as he did, to secure the glory of its...", "...and _Catherine_, six guns. Three of these vessels they let go, and four they burnt. Two they fitted up as pirates, and calling them the _Queen Anne's Revenge_ and the _Flying King_, many of the prisoners joined their bands. These two ships sailed to the West Indies, and careening, started for Brazil, taking several Portuguese vessels, but were finally driven off by a Portuguese man-of-war. The _Revenge_ escaped, but soon after went down at sea; the _Flying King_ ran ashore; <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> of the seventy men were killed, and the rest taken prisoners.

The three feathers will look like this: (Fig. P.) [Illustration: Fig. P.] A boy can hardly make a good quiver unless he were to kill some furred animal and make a cylindrical case such as the Indians have, out of its skin. I am afraid that he usually would have to get a harness-maker to make him a quiver out of leather, somewhat larger at the top than at the bottom. It should hold from eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> arrows. A good target may be made of soft pine, circular or elliptical in shape. In the latter case a line-shot might count, even though it were farther from the centre. Pieces should be tacked to the back of this target at right angles to the grain of the wood. Differently-colored circles or rings, a little more than the width of an arrow, must be painted on this, with a centre twice the width of an arrow. The outer ring counts one, the next two, three, four and so on to the...", "...the state, and not by the contributions of the citizens.(946) This institution of the ancient Dorians, or rather of the ancient Greeks in general, we will consider in a subsequent part of this work, with reference to manners and taste; here it must be viewed as affecting the public economy. In Sparta every member of the phiditia contributed to them, as has been already stated, from his own stock;(947) the amount required was about one Attic medimnus and a half of barley-meal, eleven or <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> choeis of wine,(948) five minas of cheese, with half the same quantity of figs, together with dates,(949) and ten AEginetan oboli for meat.(950) The approximate statement of one Attic medimnus and a half is probably meant as an equivalent to one AEginetan medimnus;(951) the ten oboli are equal to a Corinthian stater, or a Syracusan decalitre; the whole is doubtless the monthly contribution of an individual,(952) and is amply sufficient for the consumption of one person. For the...", "...sorts of insidious assaults; and therefore from morning to night, and from night to morning, rulers must join hands with rulers, and watchers with watchers, receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetual succession. Now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sort with anything like energy. Moreover, the greater number of the senators will have to be left during the greater part of the year to order their concerns at their own homes. They will therefore have to be arranged in <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> portions, answering to the twelve months, and furnish guardians of the state, each portion for a single month. Their business is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen who comes to them, whether to give information, or to put one of those questions, to which, when asked by other cities, a city should give an answer, and to which, if she ask them herself, she should receive an answer; or again, when there is a likelihood of internal commotions, which are always liable...", "...in a week. It sends two members to the assembly. The inhabitants were at first mostly quakers, and so they continue. It was some time before there was a church built after the manner of England; but as soon as one was built, it was called Christchurch. It had, in a few years, a very numerous congregation, and King William ordered an allowance of fifty-three pounds a-year to the minister; which, with voluntary contributions, made a very handsome provision for him. There are about <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> hundred of the inhabitants that are of this congregation, who have for some years had the benefit of the organ; and though it looked and sounded strange to the quakers at first, yet they are now so far reconciled to it, as to bear with their neighbours having it without grumbling. There are, besides this, several meeting-houses; viz., for the quakers, who are properly the church as by law established, being the originals; the presbyterians, the baptists, and a Spanish...", "...Augustan History. Preface To The Fourth Volume Of The Original Quarto Edition. I now discharge my promise, and complete my design, of writing the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, both in the West and the East. The whole period extends from the age of Trajan and the Antonines, to the taking of Constantinople by Mahomet the Second; and includes a review of the Crusades, and the state of Rome during the middle ages. Since the publication of the first volume, <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> years have elapsed; twelve years, according to my wish, \"of health, of leisure, and of perseverance.\" I may now congratulate my deliverance from a long and laborious service, and my satisfaction will be pure and perfect, if the public favor should be extended to the conclusion of my work. It was my first intention to have collected, under one view, the numerous authors, of every age and language, from whom I have derived the materials of this history; and I am still convinced...", "...shell-holes).

Move of the battery ordered for 9.30, then postponed till 10.30. Road crowded with infantry and transport; progress slow. To be mounted and at the head of a column of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> six-horse teams is a very different thing to being alone and ready to slip behind a wall or into a trench if occasion calls for it. Luck was on our side, however, and we got through before any shells came. Occupied the position quickly, emptied the ammunition wagons, and got the horses clear without casualties. The Child reported that a few four-twos had come pretty close while he and his party were digging and had stopped their work for a while: nevertheless, quite a lot...", "...2218 lots, L9236); also that of Frederick William Cosens (twelve days, 4995 lots, L5571); that of Sir Edward Sullivan (choicer portion), L11,002; that of Frank Marshall (six days, 1937 lots, L2187); that of Alexander Young, L2238; and that of T.

Thus we prepared for the day, which soon came. But it did not seem as if it would ever pass. We could not fire a gun. The Johnnies might fire as much as they liked. We must lie as still as the dead men about us. But finally the day did pass, night came on; we were able to get up and stretch ourselves and shake some of the cold from our half frozen bodies. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> o'clock we quietly withdrew, passed through the city, which was now deserted crossed the pontoon bridge and went back to our old camp. After a great battle there are no end of stories of experiences and hair-breadth escapes going the rounds of the camp. The following story which went the rounds at the time, appealed to me and has thus stuck in my memory. A man who was in a Massachusetts battery that was in Hooker's corps and was engaged around to the right of us, on the east...", "...of your friendship, my good Sir Walter.\" \"Well, never, your highness, never--no, never has this friendship been put to a severer test than in this affair,\" said the squire, in a half joking manner. \"How is that?\" \"Disguises as coalheavers, and so on, were nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to the journey I have just made with this infernal Polidori.\" \"What do you say?

It consisted of forty-four commissioners, twelve of whom were bishops, many more privy-counsellors, and the rest either clergymen or civilians. This commission, after reciting the acts of supremacy, uniformity, and two others, directs them to inquire from time to time, as well by the oaths of <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> good and lawful men, as by witnesses and all other means they can devise, of all offences, contempts, or misdemeanours done and committed contrary to the tenor of the said several acts and statutes; and also to inquire of all heretical opinions, seditious books, contempts, conspiracies, false rumours or talk, slanderous words and sayings, etc., contrary to the aforesaid laws. Power is given to any three commissioners, of whom one must be a bishop, to punish all persons absent...", "...other property destroyed. But I am to prove that opposition met the church after 1834, and that in spite of that opposition the work increased, and a knowledge of it became more widely diffused. Be it so. Five years after the expulsion from Jackson County, Missouri, opposition so increased that the inhabitants of the state of Missouri, with the officers of the state at their head, arose against the Saints; directly or indirectly caused the death of some four hundred, and drove between <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> and fifteen thousand from their homes into exile, confiscated their lands, drove off their cattle and wantonly destroyed other property. Eight years after their expulsion from the state of Missouri, the Saints to the number of twenty thousand were driven by mob violence from the state of Illinois, into the wilderness. They fled beyond the confines of civilization--going a thousand miles beyond the frontiers of the United States, and settled in the wilds of the Rocky...", "...to have regard to the points of the compass, but care must be taken to have the sides at right angles. This required the intervention of specialists, expert \"rope-fasteners,\" who laid off a triangle by means of a rope divided into three parts, of three, four, and five units. The Babylonians followed much the same practice in fixing a right angle. In addition they learned how to bisect and trisect the angle. Hence we see in their designs and ornaments the division of the circle into <span class=\"clocktext\">twelve</span> parts, a division which does not appear in Egyptian ornamentation till after the incursion of Babylonian influence. There is no need, however, to multiply examples; the tendency of all Egyptian mathematics was, as already stated, concerned with the practical solution of concrete problems--mensuration, the cubical contents of barns and granaries, the distribution of bread, the amounts of food required by men and animals in given numbers and for given periods of time, the...", "...retained. At Walkerville, about one mile from North Adelaide, another school has been established under the superintendence of Mr. Smith, since May, 1844. Up to October of the same year the average attendance of children had been sixty-three.

They go four times in the week to the council chamber to be instructed by gratuitous teachers.
