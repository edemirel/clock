[Exports.] In 1856 the exports of coffee were not more than seven thousand piculs; in 1865 they had increased to thirty-seven thousand, five hundred and eighty-eight; and in 1871, to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> thousand, three hundred and seventy. This increase, however, affords no criterion by which to estimate the increase in the number of plantations, for these make no returns for the first few years after being laid out. In short, larger exports may be confidently expected. But even greatly increased exports could not be taken as correct measures of the colony's resources. Not till European capital calls large plantations into existence in the most suitable localities will...", "...of 169 barks, came out of the rivers of the island of Repelim to attack our small force. Sixty-six of these were paraws, having their sides defended with bags of cotton by advice of the Italians, to ward off our shot; and each of these had twenty-five men and two pieces of ordnance, five of the men in each paraw being armed with calivers or matchlocks. Twenty of the foysts or large barks were chained together, as a floating battery to assault the caravel; besides which, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> _catures_ and thirty large barks, each of which carried sixteen men and one piece of ordnance, besides other weapons. Besides all these armed vessels, there were a great many more filled with soldiers, so that the whole river seemed entirely covered over. Of this numerous fleet, which contained near 10, 000 men, Naubea Daring was admiral or commander in chief, and the lord of Repelim vice-admiral. All these advanced against the Portuguese, setting up terrible shouts, which...", "...to the Secretary of the Interior by the Commission sent to investigate matters concerning the five civilized tribes of Indians in the Indian Territory.

It was learned by the Commission that <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> murders occurred in the months of September and October in one tribe only, and not one of the culprits was brought to justice. The Dawes Commission recommends that a large portion of the Indian reservation be annexed to Oklahoma; this action to be followed by forming that country into a Territory.

The summary result of Mr. Turpie's investigation is this.

On the other hand, seventy-six passages differ both from the Hebrew and LXX where the two are together, ninety-nine differ from them where they diverge, and...", "...Marcion's Gospel presents simply an _abridgment_ of our St. Luke. Does not this almost at once exclude the idea that they can be independent works? If it does not, then let us compare the two in detail. There is some disturbance and re-arrangement in the first chapter of Marcion's Gospel, though the substance is that of the third Synoptic; but from this point onwards the two move step by step together but for the omissions and a single transposition (iv. 27 to xvii. 18). Out of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> sections peculiar to St. Luke--from iv. 16 onwards--all but eight were found also in Marcion's Gospel. They are found, too, in precisely the same order. Curious and intricate as is the mosaic work of the third Gospel, all the intricacies of its pattern are reproduced in the Gospel of Marcion. Where Luke makes an insertion in the groundstock of the narrative, there Marcion makes an insertion also; where Luke omits part of the narrative, Marcion does the same.

David White led a company of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> into the West, thirty-eight of whom belonged to Friends, five to a member who had ordered that they be taken West at his expense. Six of these slaves belonged to Samuel Lawrence, a Negro slaveholder, who had purchased himself and family.

She added that all members of the Williams family had gone out of town to attend the funeral of a relative, but she wished that they might have remained to attend Penrod's, which she confidently predicted as imminent if the neighbourhood followed its natural impulse.

The artist within him was unsatisfied with his materials: and upon his return to the stable he placed the cat beneath an overturned box, and once more sat down in the inspiring wheelbarrow, pondering.

The river Ouse and the city of York, however, put in a stronger claim as the scene of this miracle, and unfortunately for Pontefract, the town is so named in charters of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years' date before the miracle is pretended to have been performed. Still the etymology is referable to the breaking down of \"_some bridge_,\" (_pons_, bridge; _fractus_, broken,) but this unravelment is not antiquarian.

Thus was the gold safely housed. Upon being weighed its value was found to be about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> thousand pounds of modern money.

Next day twelve ships were burnt in the port of Calicut, and several more in some creeks near the town. The armament proceeded in the next place to _Coulete_, which was fortified in a similar manner to Paniani, with a prodigious number of artillery, an hundred and fifty armed ships, and a garrison of 20,000 men. The Portuguese proceeded to the attack, and after a long and obstinate contest, drove the enemy from their works with great slaughter, and took <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> vessels, most of which were laden with pepper, with the loss of fifty-four Portuguese killed and many wounded. The other vessels belonging to the enemy, being much shattered in the engagement, were all burnt, and the town was destroyed.

Mistress Fawcett was no longer a woman of consequence, for even her personal income was curtailed by the great drought of 1737, and Nevis, complaisant to the gallantry of the age, was scandalized at the novelty of a public separation.

When the story of the national government's part in wild-life protection is finally written, it will be found that while he was president, THEODORE ROOSEVELT made a record in that field that is indeed enough to make a reign illustrious.

He helped to establish three national bison herds, four national game preserves, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> federal bird refuges, and to enact the Alaska game laws of 1902 and 1907. It was in 1904 that the national government elected to accept its share of the white man's burden and enter actively into the practical business of wild life protection.

He succeeded his father-in-law, William Prestidge, who died 24 March, 1886, after holding the office <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years. His predecessor was Thomas Collis, who died 30 January, 1833, after holding the office fifty-two years, and succeeded John Colledge, who, according to an old weather-beaten stone still standing in the churchyard, died 12 September, 1781.

After the wars of York and Lancaster, the links which connected the nobility and commonalty became closer and more numerous than ever. The extent of destruction which had fallen on the old aristocracy may be inferred from a single circumstance. In the year 1451 Henry the Sixth summoned <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> temporal Lords to parliament. The temporal Lords summoned by Henry the Seventh to the parliament of 1485 were only twenty-nine, and of these several had recently been elevated to the peerage.

The constitution of the House of Commons tended greatly to promote the salutary intermixture of classes.

And they stripped likewise much of the veneer of civilization--all of its follies, most of its foibles, and perhaps a few of its virtues. Maybe so; but they reserved the great traditions and at least lived frankly, laughed honestly, and looked one another in the eyes. And so it is not well for women, born south of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> and reared gently, to knock loosely about the Northland, unless they be great of heart. They may be soft and tender and sensitive, possessed of eyes which have not lost the lustre and the wonder, and of ears used only to sweet sounds; but if their philosophy is sane and stable, large enough to understand and to forgive, they will come to no harm and attain comprehension.

The Prologue and Epilogue were probably written by Snorre himself, and are nothing more than an absurd syncretism of Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Scandinavian myths and legends, in which Noah, Priam, Odin, Hector, Thor, AEneas, &c, are jumbled together much in the same manner as in the romances of the Middle Ages.

The bills for white paper during the year were upwards of seventy thousand dollars, which, in those ante-war times, was a large sum. The circulation averaged over forty thousand per diem. In 1859 the system of keeping an accurate account of the circulation was inaugurated, and the actual figures of each day's issue were recorded and published.

Twelve compositors were regularly employed this year, and the weekly composition bill was two hundred dollars.

The women work forty-five hours a week in eight-hour shifts--the men <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> hours on twelve-hour shifts. There is no difficulty whatever in obtaining a full supply of women's labour--indeed, the factory has now a waiting-list of 500.

The same year, a generous friend called Eckstein published his first collection of _Lieder_. Wolf up to that time had been smothered, but this publication stirred the life in him, and was the means of unloosing his genius.

The play remained popular throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Genest lists it as being presented in twenty-three seasons from 1709 to 1800. It was certainly presented much more frequently than this record shows, for Dougald MacMillan in _The Drury Lane Calendar_ lists <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> performances from 1747-1776, whereas Genest records two performances in this period. The greatest number of performances in any season was fourteen in 1758-59, the year David Garrick appeared in the play.

The same principle of calculation being applied to the other residencies, it appeared that the mean annual produce of one thousand vines, in all the various stages of bearing, taken collectively throughout the country, deduced from the experience of twelve years, was four hundred and four pounds.

In January 1820, when only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years of age, the Duke died quite suddenly from inflammation of the lungs, following upon a neglected cold.

It was immediately read a first time; and the Duke of...", "...been aptly termed \"the apostles of pledges.\" The elections were generally in favour of the ministerial candidates, or at least of candidates who professed the same general views, and declared their adherence to a reforming ministry. This was natural, for in almost all the boroughs success depended on the newly created electors, who could scarcely refuse their votes to that party by whose means they had procured the right of voting. The Whigs were most successful in Scotland: out of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> representatives elected in that portion of the empire, not more than twelve were Conservatives; nor could half that number be termed \"apostles of pledges.\" In Ireland, however, the Whigs were not so successful. O'Connell had denounced the ministers, even while the reform bill was in progress, as acting with insult and injustice towards Ireland in the measure of change meted out to her; and the refusal to abolish the Protestant established church in Ireland had converted him...", "...were to be directed to obtain for Ireland a greater share in the representation of the United Kingdom. He developed his plan for accomplishing this design in a series of letters to the people. In these letters he founded his allegation, that Ireland had not her fair proportion of members of the house of commons, on this data. By the last census it appeared that the population of England and Wales was 13,899,675; of Scotland, 2,365,930; and of Ireland, 7,943,940. Scotland, he said, had <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> representatives, while Ireland had only one hundred and five; so that the Scotch had more than half the number of representatives possessed by the Irish; whereas, in order to be on an equality, the latter ought to have one hundred and fifty-nine. In order to be on an equality with the English, he said, they ought to have one hundred and sixty-six; but Mr. O'Connell said that he would be satisfied with one hundred and fifty. In order to obtain that number he proposed the...", "...26th of February he submitted a motion to the house embodying the principles for which he had contended at public meetings. The chancellor of the exchequer showed that no reductions which even Mr. Cobden himself dare submit to the house would reduce the national expenditure to the proposed extent, and proved that the defence of the commerce and independence of the country forbade any such reduction. Mr. Cobden only obtained seventy-seven to support him, in a house of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> members. This did not arise from any indisposition to reduce the public burdens, but from a conviction that Mr. Cobden rested his motion upon false data, and that his scheme was utterly inapplicable to the circumstances of the times. THE BUDGET. On the 29th of June the chancellor of the exchequer brought forward his budget. He estimated the ordinary income at L51,550,000, and the extraordinary income at L580,000. The expenditure he estimated at L53,287,000.

The _Evening Post_ notice states that while the Rev. Mr. Smith was quite unknown below the Harlem, he had won a certain prestige in his own neighbourhood through his old-fashioned homilies, delivered twice every Sunday in the year, on love, charity, pure living, clean thinking, early marriage, and the mutual duties of parents towards their children and of children towards their parents.

All their artillery, ammunition, horses, etc., were captured, and a very small portion of the army escaped.

The loss of the patriots was incredibly small,--only thirteen killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> wounded.

That same evening a messenger arrived from Milan with the news of his son's arrest, and a letter from his son-in-law, begging him to come at once. The mark on his hand grew and grew for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> days, gradually mounting up the finger, until the last fatal day, when it extended to the tip of the finger, and shone bright like fiery blood. The morning after Gian Battista's execution the mark had almost vanished, and in a day or two no sign of it remained.

In the same year he painted the poet Ariosto, who mentions the painter with high honour in his verse. In 1530, Titian, a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years, was at Bologna, where there was a meeting between Charles V, and Pope Clement VII., when he was presented to both princes. Charles V, and Philip II, became afterwards great patrons and admirers of Titian, and it is of Charles V. and Titian that a legend, to which I have already referred, is told.

Of their whole armada only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> shattered vessels brought back their beaten and wasted crews to the Spanish coast, which they had quitted in such pageantry and pride. Some passages from the writings of those who took part in the struggle have been already quoted, and the most spirited description of the defeat of the armada which ever was penned may perhaps be taken from the letter which our brave vice-admiral Drake wrote in answer to some mendacious stories by which the Spaniards strove to hide their...", "...color is natural: I have seen it come and go! _Lady Teaz._ I dare say you have, ma'am: it goes off at night, and comes again in the morning. _Sir Ben._ True, ma'am, it not only comes and goes; but, what's more, her maid can fetch and carry it! _Mrs. Can._ Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk so!

In this treatise he inquires into the origin of compounds and of minerals; also he conceived that all the rocks as well as all chemical compounds and minerals originated from organic life. These inquiries were reiterated in his \"Memoirs on Physics and Natural History,\" which appeared in 1797, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years old. The atmosphere of philosophic France, as well as of England and Germany in the eighteenth century, was charged with inquiries into the origin of things material, though more especially of things immaterial. It was a period of energetic thinking. Whether Lamarck had read the works of these philosophers or not we have no means of knowing. Buffon, we know, was influenced by Leibnitz. Did Buffon's guarded suggestions have no influence on the young Lamarck? He...", "...of the Senate, or to go out of Italy. He could not even ride on horseback without the permission of the people.

Republican Rome had eighty-eight dictators. This intermittent institution continued for one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years, from the year of Rome 552, to the year 711. It began with Servilius Geminus, and reached Caesar, passing over Sylla. It expired with Caesar. The dictatorship was fitted to be repudiated by Cincinnatus, and to be espoused by Caesar. Caesar was five times dictator in the course of five years, from 706 to 711. This was a dangerous magistracy, and it ended by devouring liberty. [1] Lib. vii., cap. 31. [2] De Republica.

To prevent disrupting these vital operations, the theater limited the number to 2,500, turning down about 3,000 men. Early in January 1945 the volunteers assembled for six weeks of standard infantry conversion training. After training, the new black infantrymen were organized into <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> platoons, each under a white platoon leader and sergeant, and were dispatched to the field, two to work with armored divisions and the rest with infantry divisions.

Black strength had increased even more dramatically, from 8,876 (or 11 percent) to 27,267 (or 13 percent). The majority of black soldiers in Europe served in segregated units, the number of which more than doubled because of the Korean War. From sixty-six units in June 1950, the figure rose to 139 in March 1952. Most of these units were not in divisions but in service organizations; 113 were service units, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> were transportation units.

In Louisiana, for example, where we know that the negro population is worn down by cruel toil, and would not, if left to itself, keep up its numbers, there were, in 1830, one hundred and seven thousand slaves; in 1840, one hundred and seventy thousand.

John let off two sharp whistles (an imperative duty on the part of every driver before starting an engine) and let on the steam.

Another puff, and slowly the iron horse moved out of its stable. There was a gentle, oily, gliding, effect connected with its first movements that might have won the confidence even of timid Mrs Captain Tipps. Another puff of greater strength shot the engine forward with a sudden grandeur of action that would certainly have sent that lady's heart into her throat.

It was an eight-wheeled engine, and the driving-wheels were eight feet in diameter. The cylinder was eighteen inches, with a piston of two feet stroke, and the total weight of engine and tender was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> tons.

At times he was exposed to danger, at other times to want. But as a rule he was treated with consideration, although his teachings were ignored. Yet thirteen years of homeless wandering, of hopes deferred and frustrated, must have been hard to bear. When he left office Confucius was already <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years old, and his life so far seemed a failure. The sense of his wasted powers may well have tempted him now and again to take office under an unworthy ruler; but knowing that no good could come of it he refrained, and probably he never seriously thought of doing so. In 483 B.C., when Confucius was sixty-six years old, through the influence of his disciple Jan Yu, who was in the service of the Chi, the Master was invited to return to his native land. Here he remained...", "...beneath the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw out some scraps of paper that scattered in the wind, and farther off lighted like white butterflies on a field of red clover all in bloom.

He succeeded...", "...and the other ten feet and seven inches.

The Bornean said Bujang was a great hunter, for he had killed <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> crocodiles that year. The yacht, with the sampan still in tow, started up the river, keeping in the middle of it. Just before sunset she reached the junction of the Simujan and Sadong. On one side of the branch stream there was a considerable Malay village, backed by an abundance of cocoanut palms; and, of course, the houses were built on stilts close to the water. On the other side was the Chinese kampon, or quarter, consisting largely of shops and trading-houses. Louis...", "...to hold its own in the opening which the water had made. At last two large railway waggons were filled with stones in wire cages, securely tied into the waggons with steel ropes. These, weighing altogether fifty tons, were pushed along a pair of rails on the top of the 'sudd' (or thick growth of weeds and flotsam) till they fell with a tremendous splash into the opening. Then the Nile was beaten. It could not move such a weight, and the masons worked on in peace--three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> of them, night and day. Fortunately, too, the builders were encouraged by telegraphic reports received from stations farther up the river to the effect that the waters showed no signs of rising. The flood, in fact, proved unusually late that year, and by the time it came, the dam at Assuan was raised sufficiently high to be independent of the temporary 'sudds.' For three months work was suspended while the water roared through and over the stonework, but at the end of that...", "...Sharp's sermon, the Lords had again gone into a committee on the state of the nation, and had ordered the resolution which pronounced the throne vacant to be read clause by clause. The first expression on which a debate arose was that which recognised the original contract between King and people. It was not to be expected that the Tory peers would suffer a phrase which contained the quintessence of Whiggism to pass unchallenged. A division took place; and it was determined by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> votes to forty-six that the words should stand. The severe censure passed by the Commons on the administration of James was next considered, and was approved without one dissentient voice. Some verbal objections were made to the proposition that James had abdicated the government. It was urged that he might more correctly be said to have deserted it. This amendment was adopted, it should seem, with scarcely any debate, and without a division. By this time it was late;...", "...these, was the sense that church life was a means to an end, not an end in itself, and that that end was the building up of a true and noble Christian life in all its different phases.

An usher has peculiar opportunities to study human nature, both individually and collectively. His first acquaintance is with the pewholders, and these he quickly learns to distinguish.

Bindley formed a very large and valuable collection of rare books, engravings, and medals, which he commenced at a very early age, and to which he devoted all his spare time and money. When only fifteen years of age he constantly frequented the book-shops, where he bought everything which he considered rare or curious. He was a man of very regular and retired habits, and it is said of...", "...were Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_, bound with Lydgate's _Life of St. Margarete_, on vellum, with illuminations, and the _Mystere de la Vengeance de Nostre Seigneur_, also on vellum.

The sale, which consisted of nine thousand three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> lots, lasted forty-two days, commencing on the 18th of May, and ending on the 4th of July. It was followed by a supplementary one of seven hundred and sixty-seven lots, which began on the 13th of July, and lasted till the 16th of the same month.

The sales occupied altogether forty-two days. The first commenced on the 16th of March, and the last on the 25th of May 1829. There were eight thousand seven hundred and ninety-four lots, representing about twenty thousand volumes; and the total amount realised was twenty-one thousand seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> pounds, nine shillings. The books sold for comparatively small sums. A copy of the sale catalogue, with the prices obtained for the books and the names of the purchasers, is preserved in the library of the British Museum.

This was the last book printed at the Kelmscott Press. It was finished at No. 14 Upper Mall, Hammersmith, on the 4th of March 1898. In it the aims of Morris in founding the Press are given in his own words.

There is no evidence that the change was meant for a censure. Much more probably it was a token of the Queen's personal regard. He sent with the squadron his ship, the Ark Ralegh, under the command of Captain Thynne, another of his innumerable connexions in the West. The English had to wait for the plate galleons so long at the Azores that news was brought to Spain. A fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> Spanish sail was despatched as convoy. Ralegh was engaged officially in Devonshire. The Council directed him in May to send off a pinnace to tell Howard that this great Spanish force had been descried off Scilly.

The bridge is supported by three vast piers, measuring sixty-two feet by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet at their base. This wonderful work is considered to surpass that of the Menai Bridge. It may be asked how these tubes could ever have been got up to their present positions. This was accomplished by means of hydraulic presses of the most powerful description; indeed, it is asserted that one of them could throw a stream of water twenty thousand feet into the air,--above five times higher than Snowdon, and five thousand feet higher than the summit of Mont Blanc.

It is a _waste of power_, and like every waste of human power results in suffering. The <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> chapters of the work before us present the results of the Port Royal Mission, the truths gleaned from the contrabands of their past life, great additions to our Northern knowledge of the practical treatment of slaves, many observations on these facts, and an array of Instances to prove the capacity of the negro.

The Spaniards then tried to reduce the place by a continuous bombardment, and between the 10th of that month and the end of June threw into it 75,000 shot and 25,000 shells. At first Eliott replied even more fiercely; but, always careful of his ammunition, he relaxed his fire on finding that the Spanish bombardment did him small harm, for though the town was virtually destroyed, the garrison lost only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> killed and 260 wounded, and the fortifications were not seriously damaged. While Spain was thus foiled in her principal effort, she completed the reduction of West Florida, and her ships increased the risks which attended the commerce of England.

The Sultan was regarded as \"the sick man of Europe.\" In 1891 the total external debt, including unpaid interest, reached the figure of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> million pounds sterling. In 1881 there was a consolidation of the debt. It was reduced to one hundred and six million pounds, but the finances of Turkey were placed under the control of a committee representing the creditors, to whom was transferred certain domestic Turkish monopolies and the collection of several categories of taxes. This enabled the European powers to intervene in the affairs of Turkey. Only by the removal of this foreign tutelage could Turkey hope to...", "...Madame Daudet lived during many years of their early married life. The author of _Les Rois en Exile_ has not yet utilised Champrosay as a background to any of his stories; he takes notes, however, of all that goes on in the little village community, much as he did in the Duc de Morny's splendid palace, and in time his readers may have the pleasure of perusing an idyllic yet realistic picture of French country life, an outcome of his summer experiences. Alphonse Daudet was born just <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years ago in the sunlit, white _batisse_ at Nimes, which he has described in the painful, melancholy history of his childhood, entitled _Le Petit Chose_. At an age when other French boys are themselves _lyceans_, he became usher in a kind of provincial Dotheboys Hall; and some idea of what the sensitive, poetical lad went through may be gained by the fact that he more than once seriously contemplated committing suicide.

Consequently, I shall give attention only to the reckoning made a few years ago. The ministries corresponding to those souls are first, as I have written, those of the venerable clerics, who have sixteen beneficed curacies, in the archbishopric of Manila; in the bishopric of Cebu, fifteen; in that of Camarines, eighteen; and in that of Cagayan, four. Consequently, the clerics have <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> beneficed curacies, in the archbishopric of Manila and the three suffragan bishoprics. In them there are, according to the best reckoning, one hundred and forty-two villages, besides the visitas, collections of huts [_rancherias_], and missions. This year of 1750 the Christians therein are reckoned at one hundred and forty-seven thousand two hundred and sixty-nine. The calced Augustinian religious have charge of two hundred and fifty-two thousand nine hundred and...", "...villages.

The Order of St. Dominic, ninety-nine thousand seven hundred and eighty souls, in fifty-one regular villages, without counting the visitas and missions. The Recollect religious of St. Augustine have charge of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> thousand three hundred and eighty-four souls, in one hundred and five villages.

On the 22nd day of December, 1860, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years ago, I sat in the editorial room of the _Colonist_ office on Wharf Street, concocting a leading article. Mr. Amor De Cosmos, the able editor and owner, had contracted a severe cold and was confined to his room at Wilcox's Royal Hotel, so the entire work of writing up the paper for that issue devolved upon me. The office was a rude, one-story affair of wood. It had been erected for a merchant early in 1858, and when he failed or went away the building fell into Mr. De...", "...I heard a low chuckling sound behind me.

But whether he did so or not, I have taken the liberty, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years after the event, of exposing the part I took in the deception and craving forgiveness for my manifold sins and wickednesses on that occasion.

The first division was on the question whether secondary evidence of what Goodman could have proved should be admitted.

A hundred and twenty-six lords were present, a number unprecedented in our history. There were seventy-three Contents, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> Not Contents. Thirty-six of the minority protested against the decision of the House. [768] The next great trial of strength was on the question whether the bill should be read a second time. The debate was diversified by a curious episode. Monmouth, in a vehement declamation, threw some severe and well merited reflections on the memory of the late Lord Jeffreys. The title and part of the ill gotten wealth of Jeffreys had descended to his son, a dissolute lad, who had...", "...& Co., of Downieville; and E. M. Stranger of Murphy's.

At length, in 1830, appeared a volume of poems by a young man, then but twenty-one years of age, which distinctly marked the setting in of a new order of things. It bore the following title: `Poems, chiefly Lyrical. By Alfred Tennyson, London: Effingham Wilson, Royal Exchange, Cornhill, 1830.' pp. 154. The volume comprised <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> poems, among which were `The Poet' and `The Poet's Mind'. These two poems were emphatically indicative of the high ideal of poetry which had been attained, and to the development of which the band of poets of the preceding generation had largely contributed.

The entire force of the confederated cities abandoned the Milesians to their fate, and took to their ships, three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> in number, with a view of fighting the Phoenicians, who had six hundred ships. But there was a want of union among the Ionian commanders, and the sailors abandoned themselves to disorder and carelessness; upon which Dionysius, of Phocaea, which furnished but three ships, rebuked the Ionians for their neglect of discipline. His rebuke was not thrown away, and the Ionians having their comfortable tents on shore, submitted themselves to the nautical labors imposed by...", "...Mithridates, secure in the Crimea, then planned a daring attempt on Rome herself, which was to march round the Euxine and up the Danube, collecting in his train the Sarmatians, Gaetae, and other barbarians, cross the Alps, and descend upon Italy. _His_ kingdom of Pontus was already lost, and had been made a Roman province. His followers, however, became disaffected, his son Pharnaces rebelled, and he had no other remedy than suicide to escape capture. He died B.C. 63, after a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years, in the sixty-ninth year of his age--the greatest Eastern prince since Cyrus. Racine has painted him in one of his dramas as one of the most heroic men of the world. But it was his misfortune to contend with Rome in the plenitude of her power.

Beginning with the birth of the Saviour, these inches stand for years.

It was not until six years after the great Oxfordshire match that I myself first met the man, but what follows is literally true in all essentials. There was a long, narrow strip of yard, or alley, at the back of Mrs. Stott's paper-shop, a yard that, unfortunately, no longer exists. It has been partly built over, and another of England's memorials has thus been destroyed by the vandals of modern commerce.... This yard was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet long, measuring from Mrs. Stott's back door to the door of the coal-shed, which marked the alley's extreme limit. This measurement, an apparently negligible trifle, had an important effect upon Stott's career. For it was in this yard that he taught himself to bowl, and the shortness of the pitch precluded his taking any run. From those long studious hours of practice he emerged with a characteristic that was--and still remains--unique. Stott never took more than two...", "...The cellars and warehouses, on the quay, are made over the river three stories high. Here are two fairs in a year, and two markets in a week.

Several skirmishes took place between portions of the Austrian rear and various corps of the French van, in which the latter were decidedly checked. Marmont was obliged to assume the defensive under the walls of Znaim. The Austrian losses at the battle of Wagram were computed at twenty-four thousand, including seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> officers. Those of the French were certainly not less, if we include seven thousand who were taken prisoners. They lost, moreover, twelve standards and eleven guns. In the early hours of July sixth, Charles had despatched an adjutant to Presburg with orders to the Archduke John to march at once and attack the enemy's rear.

It is commonly supposed that they did; but I doubt the fact. For, appended to the memoir 'De l'Ourang-outang,' in the collected edition of Camper's works, tome i., pp. 64-66, is a note by Camper himself, referring to Von Wurmb's papers, and continuing thus:--\"Heretofore, this kind of ape had never been known in Europe.

In Galicia, northwest of Tarnopol, in the regions of Gliadki and Cebrow, heavy fighting developed for the possession of heights, which changed hands several times.

At dawn of June 10, 1916, Russian troops entered Buczacz on the west bank of the Strypa and, developing the offensive along the Dniester, carried the village of Scianka, eight miles west of the Strypa. In the village of Potok Zloty, four miles west of the Strypa, they seized a large artillery park and large quantities of shells.

On May 5, 1916, the Turks attempted to regain the trenches in the Erzingan sector lost the day before, but although their attack was supported by artillery, it was not successful.

It consisted of eight mounted coast defense guns, fourteen 6-inch guns, one field gun, more than 100 rifles, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> ammunition wagons, supply trains and other war material. This, taken in connection with the fact that practically the entire Turkish garrison escaped, confirms the view expressed previously that the capture of Trebizond was of great importance to the Russians, not so much on account of what they themselves gained thereby, but on account of what the Turks lost by being deprived of their principal harbor on the Black Sea, comparatively close to the Caucasian theater of...", "...Castlewood, putting on sword and uniform, took a brief leave of their dear lady, who embraced and blessed them both; and went to her chamber to pray for the issue of the great event which was then pending.

Southeast of Brzezany the battle continued with less intensity. In that region the Russians captured <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> officers and 2,200 men. Between the Baltic and the Pripet the activity of the fighting increased only at Riga and Smorgon; there was heavy artillery fighting on the middle course of the Stokhod, where, however, Russian local attacks on the Kovel-Lutsk railway line failed with heavy losses, and also on the Zlota Lipa.

The story should be printed and distributed for the people in general to read. July 27, 1905. C. A. FULMER, _Superintendent of Public Schools_, Beatrice, Neb. At a single sitting, with intense interest, I have read the manuscript of \"In the Early Days.\" It is a very entertaining narrative of adventure, a vivid portrayal of conditions and an instructive history of events as they came into the personal experience and under the observation of the writer <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years ago. An exceedingly valuable contribution to the too meager literature of a time so near in years, but so distant in conditions as to make the truth about it seem stranger than fiction. REV. N. A.

Not a tree nor an obstacle was in sight; only the great rolling sea of brightest green beneath us and the vivid blue above. I think it must have been just such a scene as this that inspired a modern writer to pen those expressive and much admired lines: \"I'm glad the sky is painted blue And the grass is painted green, And a lot of nice fresh air All sandwiched in between.\" Sky, air, grass; what an abundance of them! in all the pristine splendor of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years ago, was ours upon that spring morning. This, then, was the land which in later years was called the \"Great American Desert.\" I have now lived in Nebraska for a quarter of a century and know whereof I speak when I say that in those days the grass was as green and luxuriant as it is today; the rivers were fringed with willow green as they are today; the prairie roses, like pink stars, dotted the trail sides through which we passed; and, later on, clumps of golden-rod...", "...to every 240 feet of perfected track.

The placing of the final tie on the Pacific lines, as has been hinted, was a ceremonious undertaking. The event took place on Monday, March 10th, 1869.

The livery fine is 53s. 4d. The Mercers' Company, though not by any means the most ancient of the leading City companies, takes precedence of all. Such anomalous institutions are the City companies, that, curious to relate, the present body hardly includes one mercer among them. In Henry VIII.'s reign the Company (freemen, householders, and livery) amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> persons; in 1701 it had almost quadrupled. Strype (1754) only enumerates fifty-two mayors who had been mercers, from 1214 to 1701; this is below the mark. Halkins over-estimates the mercer mayors as ninety-eight up to 1708. Few monarchs have been mercers, yet Richard II. was a free brother, and Queen Elizabeth a free sister. Half our modern nobility have sprung from the trades they now despise. Many of the great mercers became the founders of noble houses; for...", "...master and wardens also gave from the Company's bounty quarterly sums of money to about fifty or sixty other poor persons. In cases where members of the court fell into decay, they received pensions during the court's pleasure. One person of high repute, then recently deceased, had received the sum of L200 per annum, and on this occasion the City had given him back his sheriff's fine. The attendance fee given to members of the court was two guineas. From 1531 to 1714, Strype reckons <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> Draper mayors. Eight of these were the heads of noble families, forty-three were knights or baronets, fifteen represented the City in Parliament, seven were founders of churches and public institutions. The Earls of Bath and Essex, the Barons Wotton, and the Dukes of Chandos are among the noble families which derive their descent from members of this illustrious Company.

In fact, the period of Calippus containing 27,759 days, and the octaeteris 2922 days, the sum, which is 30,681, is exactly the number of days in eighty-four Julian years. But the addition was very far from being an improvement on the work of Calippus; for instead of a difference of only five hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> minutes between the places of the sun and moon, which was the whole error of the Calippic period, this difference, in the period of eighty-four years, amounted to one day, six hours and forty-one minutes.

According to the account of Prideaux, the fifth cycle must have begun in the year 46 of our era; and it was in this year, according to St Prosperus, that the Christians began...", "...of old, to the Indian.

To-day it is the home of more than a million people. It is for his political genius that Iyeyasu particularly deserves fame. Once more, in 1615, he was forced to fight for his supremacy, against the son of the late premier. A bloody battle followed, ending in victory for Iyeyasu and the burning of the castle of Ozaka, in whose flames the aspirant for power probably met his doom. No other battle was fought on the soil of Japan for two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years. Iyeyasu had the blood of the Minamoto clan in his veins. He had therefore an hereditary claim to the shogunate, as successor to the great Yoritomo, the founder of the family and the first to bear the title of Great Shogun. This title, Sei-i Tai Shogun, was now conferred by the mikado on the new military chief, and was borne by his descendants, the Tokugawa family, until the great revolution of 1868, when the mikado again seized his long-lost authority.

Two more brought him to Panipat, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles to the north-west of Delhi. There he halted and fortified his camp. The date was April 12, 1526.

When, however, he heard that Akbar had reached Sirhind, he despatched his artillery to Panipat, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles to the north of Delhi, intending to follow himself with the infantry and cavalry. But, on his side, Akbar was moving from Sirhind towards the same place. More than that, he had taken the precaution to despatch in advance a force of ten thousand horsemen, under the command of Ali Kuli Khan-i-Shaibani, the general who had fought with Tardi Beg against Hemu at Delhi, and who had condemned his too hasty retirement.[2] Ali Kuli rode as far as Panipat, and noting there the...", "...and strength I would try my sword (that is I would fight him).' On Akbar's refusal, Bairam himself cut down the prisoner. [Footnote 3: This is the generally received story, though Abulfazl states that the driver, to save his own life, betrayed his master. Elliot, vol. v. p. 253, note.] [Footnote 4: Compare Elliot, vol. v. p. 253, and Blochmann's _Ain-i-Akbari_, p. 359.] Bairam sent his cavalry to pursue the enemy to Delhi, giving them no respite, and the next day, marching the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles without a halt, the Mughal army entered the city. Thenceforward Akbar was without a formidable rival in India. He occupied the position his grandfather had occupied thirty years before.

The man whose words brought the Continental Congress to action was John Witherspoon, of New Jersey, the President of Princeton College. He was born in Gifford, Haddingtonshire, Scotland, February 5, 1722, and died near Princeton, N.J., September 15, 1794. A graduate of Edinburgh University, he became a prominent Calvinistic pastor, essayist, and educator.

Accordingly, a few months later, that prince was relieved of the responsibility for the maintenance of the public peace, for the administration of justice, and for the enforcing of obedience to the law. In a word, the Company became the rulers of the three provinces, the Nawab-Nazim a cypher. Nay, more, the sum of money which the Nawab-Nazim was to have at his disposal was limited to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> lakhs of rupees; from this he was to defray the entire expenses of his court.

The only change made on the occasion was the reduction of the allowance for all the expenses of the office from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> to forty-one lakhs of rupees. On one point Clive continued firm. Although, practically, the English had now become the masters of the three provinces, the Subahdar only the show-figure, he insisted that the former should still remain in the background.

It extends to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> huge folios, though it has reached only to the middle of October,(69) each day having a number of saints assigned to it for commemoration. It contains, among a mass of the greatest absurdities, a good deal of valuable information relating to the history of the middle ages, particularly in respect to the customs and prevailing ideas of that period.

When that terrible crisis of free trade had arrived, when the repeal of the Corn Laws was carried by those very men whom Mr. Thorne had hitherto regarded as the only possible saviours of his country, he was for a time paralysed.

For the definition of large numbers we may employ either of two methods, which will be called the _grouping_ method and the _counting_ method. (i) _Method of Grouping._--The first method consists in defining the first few numbers, and forming larger numbers by groups or aggregates, formed partly by multiplication and partly by addition. Thus, on the denary system (S 16) we can give independent definitions to the numbers up to ten, and then regard (e.g.) <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> as a composite number made up of five tens and three ones. Or, on the quinary-binary system, we need only give independent definitions to the numbers up to five; the numbers _six, seven_, ... can then be regarded as _five and one, five and two_, ..., a fresh series being started when we get to _five and five_ or _ten._ The grouping method introduces multiplication into the definition of large numbers; but this, from the teacher's point of view, is not now such a serious...", "...ever since the revolt of the Spanish colonies in Central and South America in the early years of last century.

Within the last few years, a considerable quantity of coals, in order to prevent the breakage occasioned by discharging them into the keels from the spout, and then casting them into the ship, have been put on board the keels in _tubs_, which are afterwards raised by machinery to the vessel's deck, and then discharged into the hold. These tubs are exactly like coal waggons without their wheels, and contain the same quantity--one Newcastle chalder, or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> cwt.[6] Each keel carries eight of these tubs. The number of keels employed on the Wear is above 500.

Telford therefore recommended the erection of a suspension-bridge; and the plan, after due consideration, being approved by government, the work was commenced in 1820, carried on with great spirit, and in 1826 brought to a most successful termination. It is partly of stone, partly of iron, and consists of seven stone arches. These arches connect the land with the two main piers, which rise on an elevation of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet above the level of the road, over the top of which the chains are suspended, each of which measures from its fastenings in the rock, one thousand seven hundred and fourteen feet.

Heeding, as it seemed, very little the counsels or warnings showered on her by the bystanders, not one of whom, to Conyers's intense amazement, had ventured to accompany her, she urged her horse steadily forward. \"Don't hurry,--take it easy!\" called out one of the horsemen, as he looked at his watch. \"You have <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> minutes left, and it's all turf.\" \"She 'll do it,--I know she will!\" \"She 'll lose,--she must lose!\" \"It's ten miles to Foynes Gap!\" \"It's more!\" \"It's less!\" \"There!--see!--she's in, by Jove! she's in!\" These varying comments were now arrested by the intense interest of the moment, the horse having impatiently plunged into a deep pool, and struck out to swim with all the violent exertion of an affrighted animal. \"Keep his head up!\" \"Let him free, quite free!\" \"Get your...", "...ears of my mother that I am.

The steamer was on her way from Aspinwall to New York, with passengers and gold from San Francisco, when she sprang a leak and began to sink. The women and children, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> in all, were taken off to a small brig which happened to come in sight, leaving on board, without boats or rafts, five hundred men, all of whom went down, and of whom all but eighty were drowned.

The great wars of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, which arrested the growth of continental nations, gave England the control of the markets of the world. When peace was restored, England enjoyed something in the nature of a monopoly. The competition of France ceased for a time to be an important factor. What is now the German empire was a mere congeries of small states, waging perpetual tariff wars upon each other. In the old Prussian provinces alone there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> different customs frontiers, and German manufactures could not develop until the growth of the Zollverein brought with it commercial consolidation, internal freedom and greater homogeneity of economic conditions.

For 1731 about twenty survive, of which half a dozen may belong to 1732, a deduction which still preserves Bach's steady average. In 1735 he produced actually nineteen Cantatas between the New Year and the following November, though not all of them are positively dated. Thereafter his activity is less certainly measured.

The Antrim tower is in fine preservation to the very summit, but no trace has been found to indicate that a church existed in its vicinity. It is ninety-three feet high, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet in circumference at its base, is built of rough stone, and has a stone flooring, underneath which it is supposed a sepulchre, as at Ardmore, exists. Above the door-way is a bas-relief like a Maltese cross. I climbed into the tower through the entrance, two feet by four. Its width inside is about eight feet, but narrows gradually to the top.

The number of inhabitants, which in 1810 was estimated at eighty-seven thousand, in 1842 was reduced to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> thousand. It must be observed, however, that the manner of taking the census is loose and imperfect, and these numbers may need rectification. At the same time, there can be no doubt that the population has long been, and still is, daily diminishing. Of this diminution the causes are various, and may easily be traced to the physical and political state of the country. Terrible earthquakes have buried thousands of persons beneath the ruins of their dwellings; the struggle...", "...and the Trouee d'Aulnoet. Generally speaking, the ground occupied by the French, and which was to be the theatre of the battle, may be described as a rough and woody natural barrier, stretching across the high plateau which separates the Haine and the Trouille, and pervious only by the two openings of Louviere and Aulnoet, both of which are in a very great degree susceptible of defence.[31] The allied army consisted of one hundred and thirty-nine battalions, and two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> squadrons, with one hundred and five guns; mustering ninety-three thousand combatants. The two armies, therefore, were as nearly as possible equal in point of military strength--a slight numerical superiority on the part of the French being compensated by a superiority of twenty-five guns on that of the Allies. Among the French nobles present at the battle, were no less than twelve who were afterwards marshals of France.[32] The son of James II., under the name of the...", "...\"Kingsburgh,\" says Boswell, in his account of the great moralist's tour, \"is completely the figure of a gallant Highlander, exhibiting the graceful mien and manly looks which our popular Scotch song has justly attributed to that character.

Iberville landed without hesitation, invested the fort with forty Canadians, worked with his usual energy and skill, and in fourteen days he had his outworks established, his batteries placed and mortars in position.

Her dress cost one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> dollars and thirty-seven cents. I did not think the train was necessary and there was no need of a veil, leastwise not so long a one, but it was Mabel's wish to have them, so I did not object.

The English Government in Ireland had a reputation for treachery that was not undeserved, and the place and peerage seekers went {208} to Cornwallis to seek endorsement of Castlereagh's offers. The viceroy gave his personal guarantee that they would be fulfilled, and, satisfied with this, the ready-made majority went to the Commons, and with a force numbering one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> persons overwhelmed the opposition of eighty-eight. Many of the latter had refused heavy bribes; as many had endangered their political lives.

The new company was to have the land two hundred miles north and two hundred miles south of Point Comfort and stretching from sea to sea west and northwest, and the islands within one hundred miles of the coast. The government was vested in a council, which was given power to appoint its own officers, to make laws for the government of the colony, and to take in new stockholders. The English church was established as the religion of the colony. The starving...", "...the top of the dome seventy-five feet: from mortices in the walls, this tower appears to have been divided into four floors. The ruined chapel also is a conspicuous object viewed externally;--and immediately underneath it, in the body of the rock, is the Wogan, a grand cavern deemed natural: if it be so, however, Nature has taken more pains in turning it correctly circular, and raising its elevated roof, than she generally is found to have done in works of this kind. Its diameter is <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet; and just within the entrance we observed a spiral staircase which led through the rock to the chapel within the castle. From the foundations of an outwork, which we traced among shrubs and brambles on the margin of the river, opposite the cavern's mouth, it appears to have been less a place of concealment than an avowed sally-port, or regular entrance from the river. The castle is remarkable in history for having been the birth-place of Henry the Seventh; and also...", "...thirty-four quotations from thirteen books. In the Gospel of John there are eleven quotations from six books. In the four Gospels alone there are more than one hundred and sixty quotations from the Old Testament.

Well, if I believe that, I have to accept these hundred and sixty quotations from the Old Testament. In Paul's letter to the Corinthians there are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> quotations from the Old Testament; sometimes he takes whole paragraphs from it. In Hebrews there are eighty-five quotations, in that one book of thirteen chapters. In Galatians, sixteen quotations. In the book of Revelation alone, there are two hundred and forty-five quotations and allusions. A great many want to throw out the Old Testament.

The lighthouse does not blow a trumpet; it goes on shedding its light all around. So the Bible is lighting up the nations of the earth.

The Bible was about the first book ever printed, and to-day New Testaments are printed in three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> different languages, and are going to the very corners of the earth. Wherever the Bible has not been translated, the people have no literature. It will not be long before the words of Jesus Christ will penetrate the darkest parts of the earth, and the darkest islands of the sea.

This party went out in a westerly direction and passed over the interior of Victoria Land, which they found covered with an ice-cap forming a great plain 9000 feet above the sea-level.

The work was translated into English under the title, \"Israel and the Gentiles,\" by Mary Kennedy (London, 1850), and into German by a friend of God's Word (Miss Thumb), published by K.

About 700 men were cast ashore in Scotland, were humanely treated, and subsequently sent, by request of the Prince of Parma, to the Netherlands.

On the 4th July, in the same year, the steam frigate made a passage from New York to the ocean and back, and went the distance--which, going and returning, is <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles--in eight hours and twenty minutes, by the mere force of her engine. These trials suggested the correction of some errors, and the supplying of some defects in the machinery.

And here I am to-day, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years of age, and good for a deal more mischief yet,\" continued Zabern with a grim twinkle in his eye. \"To see me holding the post of minister is gall and wormwood to the Russians; they have required my extradition, but the princess has resolutely refused to grant it.\" Such in brief was the history of Zabern, and though his attempts to win freedom for his country were deserving of sympathy, Paul could not avoid a feeling of regret that Barbara should have admitted to her...", "...very scrupulous in his dress; easy in his movements; not old before his time, but having already something of the refinement of age upon the nobility of his advanced manhood; one of whom a woman would expect great things in an extremity, but to whom she would no longer turn for the little service, the little fetching and carrying, which most women expect of men still in prime. But he did such things unasked, and for any woman, when it seemed natural to do them. After all, he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years old, and it seems to be established that sixty is the age of man's manumission from servitude, unless the period of slavery be voluntarily extended by the individual. That leaves ten years of freedom if one live to the traditional age of mankind. But Sylvia saw no sign of age in Colonel Wimpole. In connexion with him the mere word irritated her when he used it, which he sometimes did quite naturally, and he would have been very much surprised could he have...", "...a tiresome old man.\" At that word, one beat of the girl's heart sent resentful blood to her face. \"You are not old at all!\" she cried. \"And you could not be tiresome if you tried! And I am not good to you, as you call it!\" The girl's young anger made him think of summer lightning, and of the sudden flashing of new steel drawn silently and swiftly from the sheath into the sunshine. \"Goodness may be a matter of opinion, my dear,\" said he. \"But age is a matter of fact. I was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years old on my last birthday.\" \"Oh, what do years matter?\" Sylvia rose quickly and turned from him, going towards the window. The colonel watched her perfectly graceful movements. She wore grey, with a small black band at her throat, and the soft light clung to the lovely outline of her figure and to her brown hair. He thought again of the daughter that might have been born to him, and even of a daughter's daughter. It seemed to him that his own years might be a...", "...Frenchman and he nearly exploded with indignation. \"No,\" he said, \"me, you shall not dismiss,\" and he showed his bugle to his major with the mouthpiece carried away by a stray bullet. \"The mouth was shoot off,\" he said. \"I could not bugle wiz my bugle and so I bugle wiz my pistol and sabre.\" The major recalled the order of dismissal. So ended one of the most desperate charges of the Civil War. One hundred and forty-eight men had defeated twenty-two hundred, with the loss of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> killed and more than thirty wounded. CHAPTER VI THE LOCOMOTIVE CHASE Courage does not depend upon success. Sometimes it takes a braver man to lose than to win. A man may meet defeat and even death in doing his duty, but if he has not flinched or given up, he has not failed. A brave deed is never wasted whether men live or die. In the spring of 1862, James J. Andrews and a little band of nineteen other men staked their lives and liberty for the freedom of...", "...to 1834, and company records commencing as early as 1787. Three \"independent companies\" of infantry were listed in the roster of 1788 as connected with the 1st Division, Suffolk. One of these disappeared from the records the following year, and another in 1792. The lone survivor yet survives--in fact is the 3d Company, M. C. A., otherwise known as the Independent Boston Fusiliers. On May 11, 1787, the Governor's Council voted to approve an application signed by Thomas Adams and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> others, and to charter a company. Gov. James Bowdoin presided at the Council meeting and himself introduced the petition. On the following July 4, he stood with the members of the new company on the slope of Bunker Hill and, at that shrine of American liberty, presented them their official charter. They next proceeded to the home of John Hancock, soon to be Governor, and at his liberal table, as his guests, enjoyed an inaugural dinner. The Fusiliers have excelled in many...", "...\"You said something, sister,\" declared Murray. \"Wait! I think I got something.\" He fumbled with the radio dials before him, swinging them this way and that: then clamped on the headset. \"Oh, boy, there's something coming through ... we're not alone in the world then.... Yes, there she is.... Damn, I wish they wouldn't send so fast.... AAM2 calling.... Now who is AAM2?\" His fingers pressed the key in reply as the others watched him with bated breath. \"Position, seventy-three, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> west longitude; forty, o-three, north latitude.

Call Ben, will you Gloria?\" She dashed off to return with the dictator of the colonists just as Beeville, who had been fumbling over the charts with one hand, called suddenly, \"Why, the position they give is right near here--hardly a hundred miles away. I don't know just what ours...", "...our city streets, and are still in some places where English sparrows have not taken everything, and boys are not allowed to throw stones or shoot. I know one city in Massachusetts where trees are very lovely and musical with yellow-throats. We can still have these and other birds in our yards--we who do not live in the middle of a big city--by protecting them from cats and bad boys, and furnishing good places to nest. Mr. Lloyd Morgan tells of a garden near his own where there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> nests, besides swallows'. The owner planted thick bushes, and some cone-bearing trees. He put bird-boxes and old flower-pots and other things suitable to build in, in convenient places in the trees. The birds appreciated all this and came and stayed with him.

Eventually--as the result of open competition--the Martini-Henry rifle was produced by combining Henry's system of rifling with Martini's mechanism for breech-loading. This weapon had seven grooves with one turn in twenty-two inches, and weighed with bayonet 10 lb. 4 oz. It fired with great accuracy, the trajectory having a rise of only eight feet at considerable distances, so that the bullet would not pass over the head of a cavalry man. Twenty rounds could be fired in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> seconds. Now in the latter years of the century all these weapons have been superseded by magazine rifles, _i.e._ rifles which can be fired several times without recourse to the ammunition pouch. They differ from the revolver in having only one firing chamber, into which the cartridges are one by one brought by a simple action of the breech mechanism, which also extracts the empty cartridge-case. The bore of these rifles is smaller and the rifling sharper; they therefore...", "...is the result. Triumph! The conquest of the air. Mastery of the upper element; with none to gainsay us.\" \"But--but there are limits to the power of these ships,\" suggested Andrew, his words almost faltering. \"There are limits to their range of travel.\" Mr. Carl Reitberg put one fat finger artfully to the side of his nose. It was perhaps a little peculiarity he had picked up in England, for we hasten to explain that he was cosmopolitan. Carl Reitberg had spent many of his <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years in South Africa. There he had enjoyed the protection of the Union Jack. He had a house in London now, and one also at Brighton. It may be said that he had made his fortune, thanks to his own astuteness and the opportunities given him by our British colonies. But he was not English. He was not entirely German. He belonged to the world. One day he was resident in Berlin, a second found him in London or in Brighton, while as likely as not the following weeks saw him...", "...Turning a little down, we came to another piazza, in which stands a sumptuous vase of porphyry, and a fair fountain; but the grace of this market, and indeed the admiration of the whole world, is the Pantheon, now called S. Maria della Rotonda, formerly sacred to all the Gods, and still remaining the most entire antiquity of the city. It was built by Marcus Agrippa, as testifies the architrave of the portico, sustained by thirteen pillars of Theban marble, six feet thick, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> in height, of one entire stone. In this porch is an old inscription. Entering the church, we admire the fabric, wholly covered with one cupola, seemingly suspended in the air, and receiving light by a hole in the middle only. The structure is near as high as broad, viz, 144 feet, not counting the thickness of the walls, which is twenty-two more to the top, all of white marble; and, till Urban VIII. converted part of the metal into ordnance of war against the Duke of...", "...donkeys, and portable chairs were \"a weak invention of the enemy,\" for the road, although winding, was broad, easy, and delightfully shady and romantic. We passed an old Roman mile-stone on the road, and after crossing a drawbridge, reached the royal castle. This most beautifully restored relic of the middle ages was, in 1802, a ruin of a castle of five hundred years before; in 1823 it was partially restored, and since then has been completely rebuilt and beautified at a cost of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> thousand pounds sterling. Everything is in good proportion, Stolzenfels being somewhat of a miniature castle, its _great_ banquet hall scarcely double the size of a good-sized drawing-room; but its whole interior and exterior are a model of exquisite taste. It has its little castle court-yard, its beautifully contrived platform overlooking the Rhine, its watch-towers and its turrets, all undersized, but in exact proportions. Through the tower windows, which are wreathed...", "...of luxurious carving prodigally displayed on every part of the exterior, strike the visitor with amazement. Its architecture is Gothic, and the form that of a Latin cross; and to give an idea of its size, I copy the following authentic figures of its dimensions: \"The extreme length is four hundred and eighty-six feet, and the breadth two hundred and fifty-two feet; the length of the transept two hundred and eighty-eight feet, and the height inside, from pavement to roof, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet; height from pavement to top of the spire, three hundred and fifty-five feet.\" After taking a walk around the exterior of this wonderful structure, and gazing upon the architectural beauties of the great white marble mountain, we prepared to ascend to the roof before visiting the interior. This ascent is made by a broad white marble staircase of one hundred and fifty-eight steps, the end of which being reached, the visitor finds himself amid an endless variety of...", "...the Leaning Tower of Pisa were familiar in my mind, I was not prepared for the surprisingly graceful beauty of the structure, which is of white marble; and though it was built nearly seven hundred years ago, it is remarkably clear and fresh-looking. The very decided lean is at once observable on approaching it; indeed, you experience something of an uncomfortable sensation on being at the side where it appears to be ready to fall. Its beauty consists in its being a perfect cylinder of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> feet in diameter, and one hundred and seventy-nine feet high; this great cylinder being formed of eight regular tiers of columns, supporting graceful arches, one above the other, and forming as many open marble galleries running round the tower, the whole surmounted with a graceful open-arched tower or belfry, giving it the appearance of a tall marble column sculptured into circles of open arches and pillars. We started for the summit, an easy ascent of two hundred and...", "...has been made.

Its horns have eleven well-marked rings, besides one or two faintly-marked ones, and are (measured round their curvature) fifty-four and a half centimetres in length. The horns of the first-mentioned specimen (measured in the same way) had a length of only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> and a half centimetres, although they were ornamented with nearly double the number of rings, and were presumably of double the age, of the other.(53) The keepers and the chasseurs of this district not only say that the rings upon the horns of the ibex tell its age (each one reckoning as a year), but that the half-developed ones, which sometimes are very feebly marked indeed, show that the animal has suffered from hunger during the winter. Naturalists are skeptical upon...", "...Hush-money to Germany in the shape of periodically new \"places in the sun\" would have kept her quiet for spells. But the blackmailing process would have been resumed.

A conviction of the importance of public instruction was one of the earliest sentiments of our ancestors. No lawgiver of ancient or modern times has expressed more just opinions, or adopted wiser measures, than the early records of the Colony of Plymouth show to have prevailed here. Assembled on this very spot, a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years ago, the legislature of this Colony declared, \"Forasmuch as the maintenance of good literature doth much tend to the advancement of the weal and flourishing state of societies and republics, this Court doth therefore order, that in whatever township in this government, consisting of fifty families or upwards, any meet man shall be obtained to teach a grammar school, such township shall allow at least twelve pounds, to be raised by rate on all the inhabitants.\"...", "...to the West, and more especially to the Southwest.

On this bill, New England, with her forty members, gave more affirmative votes than the four Southern States, with their fifty-two or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> members. These two are far the most important general measures respecting the public lands which have been adopted within the last twenty years. They took place in 1820 and 1821. That is the time _when_. As to the manner _how_, the gentleman already sees that it was by voting in solid column for the required relief; and, lastly, as to the cause _why_, I tell the gentleman it was because the members from New England thought the measures just and salutary; because they...", "...for his loss. Mr. Daniels, by the rules of the House, had one hour to reply, after the expiration of the time for closing debate. He attempted to reply to some of the arguments offered against the bill, but advanced no new position. At the expiration of his speech the vote was taken, and the bill reported to the House as agreed to in committee. The previous question was then called, and under its operation the bill passed--seventy-nine members voting in favor of its passage, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> against it. One member from the slave States, Williamson R. W. Cobb, of Alabama, voted against the bill.

In addition to the flocks that habitually grazed within the camp, a great number of cattle had been brought by the fugitives to the plateau.

Between the towers the guarding of the ramparts was intrusted to a thousand men, put under the order of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> chiefs; the two entrances were under the command of warriors of tried courage, and well known to Sigild. This garrison, consisting of about two thousand men, had long been settled in the camp, and had partly executed the work of its fortification.

Norway's losses from the beginning of the war to the end of April, 1918, amounted to 755 vessels, aggregating 1,115,519 tons, and the lives of 1,006 seamen, in addition to about 700 men on <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> vessels missing, two-thirds of which were declared to be war losses.

About thirty years afterward died an eccentric recluse, _John Rous_, called the hermit of Guy's Cliff.

Its descent was witnessed by two persons; and when the stone was dug up, it was found to have penetrated through no less than eighteen inches of soil and hard chalk. It originally weighed about fifty-six pounds, but that portion of it preserved in the British Museum is stated in the official catalogue to weigh forty-seven pounds nine ounces and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> grains--just double the weight of the Devonshire aerolite. When we come to inquire into the various opinions which have been held in different ages respecting the origin of aerolites, and the power which causes their descent, we must go back to the times of the ancient Greeks, and we find that those of their philosophers who had directed their attention to the subject had four theories to account for this singular phenomenon.

But repose had a restorative effect, and, in the third week, Mrs. Cross felt the revival of her energies.

We had to thank a kind Providence that such was not the case, since it had extended its mercy to us at so critical a moment.

I calculated that we could not have run less than forty-five miles during the day, a distance that, together with the eight miles we had advanced the evening previously, would give the length of the lake at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles. We had approached to within twelve miles of the ranges, but had not gained their southern extremity. From the camp, Mount Barker bore nearly north. The ranges appeared to run north and south to our position, and then to bend away to the S.S.W., gradually declining to that point, which I doubted not terminated in Cape Jervis.

Of one thousand Jews born, two hundred and seventeen die before the age of seven years; while four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> Christians--more than twice as many--are likely to die within the same period.

There are crypts between the arches of the choir and nave and the stone roof; and there is a square tower on each side of the building, at the junction of the nave and choir. Taken as a whole, there is no specimen of its kind in the British empire so perfect or curious. The cathedral, as already stated, consists of a choir, nave, and transepts, with a square tower in the centre.

During the year 1907 there were eight murders in Ireland and eighteen in the District of Columbia and only seventeen assaults with dangerous weapons in Ireland to fifty-one in the District of Columbia, notwithstanding the difference in population. The population of Ireland is 4,398,565, and that of the District of Columbia is 317,380. During the year 1905 there were 9,728 persons indicted for crimes in Ireland; in 1906 the total was 9,465, and...", "...of fifty-two persons, mostly Quakers from the parish of Skjold, was ready to journey to America.

The festive-prologue written by counsellor _Niemeyer_ followed; then my new opera \"Der Berg-Geist,\" which in truth was received by the thronged and brilliantly lighted house with as much boisterous applause as \"Jessonda,\" but which neither pleased me so much, nor was so popular on other stages as the latter.

His holdings in Walla Walla county embrace altogether about fourteen hundred and seventy acres, all located in township 8 north, range 35 east, much of this being of the very best and most valuable land in the county. Mr. Dague also has heavy land holdings in Morrow county, Oregon, and in Benton county, Washington. His record is...", "...Wiseman, of Tacoma.

He made use of every spare hour and as a consequence he has prospered. In 1909 he purchased the Electric Farm of five hundred and fifty acres. Prior to this, or in 1907, he had purchased the Boley Robbins farm of four hundred and eighty acres, which he traded in on the Electric Farm in 1909. In 1913 he traded the latter property for seven hundred and thirteen acres adjoining his home place, which thus was extended, becoming a tract of nine hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> acres. It is located in the heart of the Spring valley district, the richest wheat growing belt of Walla Walla county. Mr. Stonecipher not only successfully cultivates this land but for the past fourteen years he has also rented and farmed the T. P. Ingall's place of seven hundred and four acres.

Agostino Barbarigo led the left wing with as many galleys, hoisting a yellow flag. Don Alvaro di Baxan, Marquis of Santacroce, was appointed to the command of the rear-guard with thirty galleys, and displayed a white flag on his ship, ready to come to assistance wherever the need required. Don John of Cardona, also carrying a white flag, led the advanced-guard with eight galleys.

In the manner of the climate, a few wisps of misty rack came sailing from the south-east, the wind rose, snow commenced to fall and a blizzard held sway for almost three days. It was just as well that we had found that depot when we did. The <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles to the Hut melted away in the pleasures of anticipation. The first two miles, on the morning of January 14, gave us some strenuous work, but they were luxurious in comparison with what we expected; soon, however, the surface rapidly and permanently improved.

Their object was to find the depot of instruments and rocks which the Eastern Coastal Party were forced to abandon when <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> miles from home. They were unsuccessful in the search, as an enormous amount of snow had fallen on the old surface during the interval of almost a year. Indeed, on the knoll crowning Mount Murchison, where a ten-foot flagpole had been left, snow had accumulated so that less than a foot of the top of the pole was showing. Nine feet of hard compressed snow scarcely marked by one's footsteps--the contribution of one year!

Remote from land, exposed to all the fury of the tempest, ignorant of their course, and amid the darkness of night, they were dashed to pieces against those fearful rocks termed \"The Hollows,\" and not a single galley escaped the general destruction. Thus the fleet of the barbarians was rendered more equal to that of the Greeks. Re-enforced by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> ships from Athens the next day, the Greeks proceeded at evening against that part of the hostile navy possessed by the Cilicians. These they utterly defeated, and returned joyfully to Artemisium.

The conversation that evening had dealt so largely with Fenn--the whole school, indeed, was talking of nothing but his great attempt to win the cricket cup single-handed--that Kennedy, going out into the road for a breather before the rest of the boarders returned from preparation, made...", "...lasted four afternoons--four solid afternoons of glorious, up-and-down cricket. Mr Dexter did not see a single ball of that match bowled. He was prowling in sequestered lanes and broken-down barns out of bounds on the off-chance that he might catch some member of his house smoking there. As if the whole of the house, from the head to the smallest fag, were not on the field watching Day's best bats collapse before Henderson's bowling, and Moriarty hit up that marvellous and unexpected <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> at the end of the second innings! That sort of thing definitely stamps a master. \"What do you want to see O'Hara about?\" asked Clowes. \"He's got my little gold bat. I lent it him in the holidays.\" A remark which needs a footnote. The bat referred to was made of gold, and was about an inch long by an eighth broad. It had come into existence some ten years previously, in the following manner.

O'Mulligan was a young man between <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years of age and was chiefly distinguished for being the son of his aunt on his great grandfather's side. Schnappsgoot was a man of liberal education, having passed three weeks at Oberlin College. He was a man of great hardihood, also, and would frequently read an entire column of \"railway matters\" in the \"Cleveland Herald\" without shrieking with agony. _______________ CHAPTER II.--THE KING.

To prevent this, the King had them put into cases formed of wood and white horn. And these were the first lanthorns ever made in England.

He bore it, as he had borne all the troubles of his life, like a brave good man, until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> years old; and then, having reigned thirty years, he died. He died in the year nine hundred and one; but, long ago as that is, his fame, and the love and gratitude with which his subjects regarded him, are freshly remembered to the present hour.

It was the slackest House in the School, and always had been. It did not cause any overwhelming surprise, accordingly, when Leicester's beat them without fatigue by an innings and a hundred and twenty-one runs. Webster's won the toss, and made thirty-five. For Leicester's, Reece and Gethryn scored fifty and sixty-two respectively, and Marriott <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> not out. They then, with two wickets down, declared, and rattled Webster's out for seventy. The public, which had had its eye on the team, in order to see how its tail was likely to shape, was disappointed. The only definite fact that could be gleaned from the match was that the junior members of the team were not to be despised in the field. The early morning field-outs had had their effect.

The late wars have had much more fatal effects on the cacao trade of Caracas than on that of Guayaquil. On account of the increase of price, less cacao of the first quality has been consumed in Europe. Instead of mixing, as was done formerly for common chocolate, one quarter of the cacao of Caracas, with three-quarters of that of Guayaquil, the latter has been employed pure in Spain.

He had the knack. I could never get it. I sent up <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-three</span> in all in the first year of my literary life, and only two stuck. I got fifteen shillings from one periodical for \"Men Who Have Missed Their Own Weddings,\" and, later, a guinea from the same for \"Single Day Marriages.\" That paper has a penchant for the love-interest.
