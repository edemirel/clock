The navigation of the Atlantic by means of the immense sea-going steamers of the present day, with all its superiority in most respects, is attended with <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> very serious disadvantage, at least for all romantic people, and those who particularly enjoy what is grand and sublime. To passengers on board an Atlantic steamer, a storm at sea--that spectacle which has, in former times, been so often described as the most grand and sublime of all the exhibitions which the course of nature presents to man--is divested almost entirely of that imposing magnificence for which it was formerly so renowned.

Taking the cue, he set to work to compose more fitting words to correspond with the notes to which this final _a_ was sung. So these lines of euphonious and fitting words appear to have had their beginning in Notker's scanning of that fugitive Antiphonary, and his devising labour. Their primary purpose was a musical one; for they were a device--mnemotechnic, if one will--to facilitate the chanting of cadences previously vocalized with difficulty through the singing of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> simple vowel sound. Notker showed his work to his master, Iso, who rejoiced at what his gifted pupil had accomplished, and spurred him on by pointing out that in his composition one syllable was still sometimes repeated or drawn out through several successive notes. One syllable to each note was the principle which Notker now set himself to realize; and he succeeded. He composed some fifty Sequences.

A belief in God as exclusively One, involves a distinct negation of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> God, and that negation is possible only after the conception, whether real or imaginary, of many gods. The primitive intuition of the Godhead is neither monotheistic nor polytheistic, and it finds its most natural expression in the simplest and yet the most important article of faith--that God is God.

Time is merely an aspect of consciousness in its limitation and does not inhere in the mind in the same manner that does space. In fact, it is not a part of the mind's nature as it has been shown that space is. It would, therefore, seem to be a grave mistake so to coordinate the two notions. Space is the progenitor of mind and is continually identified with mind. Time is the child of consciousness. That is, it is <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the illusions of consciousness which the ego will shed as his consciousness expands. Duration alone is a coordinate of space. The mind now recognizes space as something apart and separate from itself only because of its unconsciousness of the identity existing between it and space.

At that moment Sir Raven, uttering a loud and prolonged scream, shot downward and alighted on the thwart next Yaspard, too exhausted to do more than utter <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> faint croak, which might have been a parting anathema on the shooies, but which charity impels me to believe was an expression of thankfulness for such an ark of refuge as the boat of a Viking. Yaspard leaned quickly forward, exclaiming, \"Why, can it be? Yes, sure enough--Thor, old fellow, how came you to be in such a plight?\" Still gasping, but self-possessed, Thor hopped from the thwart on to Yaspard's arm, and then, turning up one side of his head, he leered at the shooies...", "...Therefore, as a specimen of his subjects, he took a child and set him before them. It was not, it could not be, in virtue of his humanity, it was in virtue of his childhood that this child was thus presented as representing a subject of the kingdom. It was not to show the scope but the nature of the kingdom. He told them they could not enter into the kingdom save by becoming little children--by humbling themselves. For the idea of ruling was excluded where childlikeness was the <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> essential quality. It was to be no more who should rule, but who should serve; no more who should look down upon his fellows from the conquered heights of authority--even of sacred authority, but who should look up honouring humanity, and ministering unto it, so that humanity itself might at length be persuaded of its own honour as a temple of the living God. It was to impress this lesson upon them that he showed them the child. Therefore, I repeat, the lesson lay in the...", "...to give up. He lets the data collect, and bides his time.

Every kind of \"bosh\" has its own factors and laws; and patient study will bring them definitely to light. The only way to rescue the \"pure bosh\" view of the matter is one which has sometimes appealed to my own fancy, but which I imagine few readers will seriously adopt. If, namely, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> takes the theory of evolution radically, one ought to apply it not only to the rock-strata, the animals and the plants but to the stars, to the chemical elements, and to the laws of nature.

Little by little, out of all the haphazard possibilities of that time, a few connected things and habits arose, and the rudiments of regular performance began.

A tone of gray, midway between these two extremes, changes their relations and opens up a whole new field for creative activity. Now we must think of different degrees of Notan,--the \"value\" of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> tone against another. This simple set of three notes is the basis of the mezzotint, aquatint, charcoal sketch and wash drawing. The old masters drew on gray paper with black and white. From three, it is an easy step to many values, and in these refinements of Notan lies the true meaning of the word \"values.\" That property of painted shapes, whereby they \"take their places\" one beyond another in a picture, is aerial perspective, not values. It is a desirable quality of...", "...backwoods with which I was familiar, and the story itself was founded on the adventures and experiences of my companions and myself. When a second book was required of me, I stuck to the same regions, but changed the locality. While casting about in my mind for a suitable subject, I happened to meet with an old, retired \"Nor'wester\" who had spent an adventurous life in Rupert's Land. Among other duties he had been sent to establish an outpost of the Hudson's Bay Company at Ungava Bay, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the most dreary parts of a desolate region. On hearing what I wanted, he sat down and wrote a long narrative of his proceedings there, which he placed at my disposal, and thus furnished me with the foundation of _Ungava, a tale of Eskimo-Land_. But now I had reached the end of my tether, and when a third story was wanted I was compelled to seek new fields of adventure in the books of travellers.

A quaint old Essex village of single-storied cottages, some ivy mantled, with dormer windows, thatched roofs, and miniature gardens, strewed with picturesque irregularity round as fine a green as you will find in the county. Its normal condition is rustic peace and sleepy beatitude; and it pursues the even tenor of its way undisturbed by anything more exciting than a meeting of the vestry, the parish dinner, the advent of a new curate, or the exit of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the fathers of the hamlet. But this morning the place is all agog, and so transformed that it hardly knows itself. The entire population, from the oldest gaffer to the last-born baby, is out-of-doors; the two inns are thronged with guests, and the road is lined with all sorts and conditions of carriages, from the four-in-hand of the wealthy swell to the donkey-cart of the local coster-monger.

He lay groaning under his canoe on the bank, looking very woebegone. You would not have thought, if you had seen him lying about thus, that he was worth six thousand dollars and had been to Washington. It seemed to me that he made a greater ado about his sickness than a Yankee does, and was more alarmed about himself. We talked somewhat of leaving him with his people in Lincoln,--for that is <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of their homes,--but he objected on account of the expense, saying, \"Suppose me well in morning, you and I go Oldtown by noon.\" As we were taking our tea at twilight, while he lay groaning under his canoe, he asked me to get him a dipper of water. Taking the dipper in one hand, he seized his powderhorn with the other, and, pouring into it a charge or two of powder, stirred it up with his finger, and drank it off. This was all he took to-day after breakfast beside his tea.

If, within <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> week after we effect our withdrawal, the Soviets are not out--or if they later come back in, against the wishes of the German nation--we should break off diplomatic relations with _all_ communist countries; deny all representatives of all communist nations access to United Nations headquarters which are on United States soil; and exert maximum pressures throughout the world to isolate all communist countries, economically and diplomatically, from all non-communist countries....", "...a man of such a gift, so wittie and inventive of all devises, would be able to persuade the people to whatsoever his mind stood; and that it was a daungerous and ticklish point to put the libertie of so great a state as Carthage was, into the hands and managing of him, who could handle and tame the furious violence of so savage a beast: and thereupon condemned and banished him.\" He then relates two examples of the gentleness of this animal, or rather of his confidence in man.

Ab raged up and down, and, ever in the front, faced the oncoming foe and slew as could slay the strong and utterly desperate. More than once his life was but a toy of chance as men sprang toward him, two or three together, but ever at such moment there sang an arrow by his head and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of his assailants, pierced in throat or body, fell back blindly, hampering his companions, whose heads Ab's great ax was seeking fiercely. And, all the time, nearer the northern end of the barrier, old Hilltop fought serenely and dreadfully.

It was hardly possible for a Roman Catholic to find a seat in England, and Sir John Acton sat for the small Irish burgh of Carlow, disfranchised in 1885. He was counted as a Whig, and a supporter of Lord Palmerston. But there was no sympathy, no point of contact, between the jaunty Premier and the erudite, philosophical, reflective Member for Carlow. \"No <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> agrees with me and I agree with no one,\" said Sir John, with unusual tautology.

Clinging to <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of these branches, Peggy leaned forward as far as she dared, and began to angle for her hat. \"He rises well,\" she muttered, \"but he doesn't bite worth a cent.\" Twice she succeeded in working the end of the bulrush through the loop of ribbon that perked cheerfully on the top of the hat; twice the loop slipped off as she raised it, and the hat dropped back.

He caught many men, but most of them got away and went home laughing at Harald. Then they came back the next summer and did the same deeds over again.

His daughters, Semele, Ino, Autonoe, Agave,--his grandsons, Melicertes, Actaeon, Pentheus,--lived sorrowful lives or suffered violent deaths. The misfortunes of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> branch of his family, sprung from his son Polydorus, remain to be told. The curse seems to have spared Polydorus himself. His son Labdacus, also, lived a quiet life as king of Thebes and left a son, Laius, upon the throne. But erelong Laius was warned by an oracle that there was danger to his throne and life if his son, new-born, should reach man's estate. He, therefore, committed the child to a herdsman with orders for its destruction; but the herdsman, moved with pity yet not...", "...Riot\" at Westminster. But the figures do not convey a tithe of the horror, the unforgettable shame and horror, of the people's attack upon the Empire's sanctuary. The essence of the tragedy lay in their demand for immediate and unconditional surrender; the misery of it lay in \"The Destroyers'\" weak, delayed, terrified response, followed almost immediately by the order to those in charge of the firing parties--an order flung hysterically at last, the very articulation of panic. No <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> is likely to question Martin's assertion that Friday's tragedy at Westminster must be regarded--\"not alone as the immediate cause of Black Saturday's national humiliation, but also as the crucial phase, the pivot upon which the development of the whole disastrous week turned.\" But the Westminster Riot at least had the saving feature of unpremeditation. It was, upon the one side, the outcry of a wholly undisciplined, hungry, and panic-smitten public; and, upon the other side, the...", "...thou art mad,\" he said, \"to wish that the suffering of thy brothers should be prolonged.

He had a gallon of rum in the hut, to be used in case of snake-bite and in other emergencies, and he now gave each man a little rum and water, and a small piece of damper. Rum was a curse to the convicts, immigrants, and natives. Its average price was then about 4s. 3d. per gallon.

But he completed only six books of his poem in the course of six years. The Faerie Queene is not only an epic but a double allegory, for many of the characters represent both abstract virtues and the noted people of Spenser's time. For instance, the poem opens with a description of the court of Gloriana,--who impersonates Elizabeth and is the champion of Protestantism.

She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had taken their departure, Thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs. \"Is that all?\" said she. It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the master's acts. The blow told. \"You are right, in sooth,\" said he; \"I am a fool. Give me my hat.\" He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ran out in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.

That was the only thing that I was sure about. I suppose that in each of our heads at first there was just <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> thought: \"I'm in a fix; how shall I get out?\" And in his training or mine there was absolutely nothing to suggest an immediate answer.

Much of the mountainous land can be used only for pasturage and, as a result, dairying claims considerable attention. Only a very small portion of the area (about four per cent) is suitable for agriculture and owing to this limitation of opportunity, comparatively few of the people are farmers. Their numerous fisheries supply cargoes, and train loads of fresh and cured fish to the markets of the world. Fishing is, in fact, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the most important industries, and a large percentage of the wage earners of the country engage in it. Since the bulk of their travel and transportation is by water, a great many become sailors. A certain amount of manufacturing also is done, and this provides another means of earning a livelihood.

In <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> event the difference was mainly in the gunnery of the crews, in the other, it was mainly in the tactical skill of the captains. The question is merely as to how soon Carden, in his headlong, foolishly rash approach, was enabled to close with Decatur.

On one occasion, when AEmilius Rectus sent home from Egypt a larger amount of taxes than was usual, he hoped that his zeal would be praised by Tiberius. But the emperor's message to the prefect was as stern as it was humane: \"I should wish my sheep to be sheared, but not to be flayed.\" On the death of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the prefects, there was found among his property at Rome a statue of Menelaus, carved in Ethiopian obsidian, which had been used in the religious ceremonies in the temple of Heliopolis, and Tiberius returned it to the priests of that city as its rightful owners.

Rachel had grown up quite beyond her power of restraint, and if it came to the worst, thought Mrs. Garman, this unusual _penchant_ for a clergyman was not the worst <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> Rachel could have hit upon.

The odd thing about it was that every man felt sure that he was the only man who had not asked her; and a general impression had grown up in the town that Hetty Gunn had refused nearly everybody. She was so evidently a favorite; \"Gunn's\" was so much the headquarters for all the young people; it was so open to everybody's observation how much all men admired and liked Hetty,--she was never seen anywhere without <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> or two or three at her service: it was the most natural thing in the world for people to think as they did. Yet not a human being ever accused Hetty of flirting; her manner was always as open, friendly, and cordial as an honest boy's, and with no more trace of self-seeking or self-consciousness about it. She was as full of fun and mischief, too, as any boy could be. She had slid down hill with the wildest of them, till even her father said sternly,-- \"Hetty,--you're too big.

San Miniato took the Marchesa's hand and raised it to his lips, pressed it a little and then nodded slowly, with a significant look. The Marchesa's sleepy eyes opened suddenly with an expression of startled satisfaction, and she returned the pressure of the fingers with more energy than San Miniato had suspected. She was...", "...methinks this counsel must be for our advantage; and at any rate it cannot be without some object and purpose.

As a colourist--his most distinguished role--he was perhaps the greater of the two. The collector may be interested to note that practically all Shuncho's work is printed with the utmost sharpness and refinement; poor impressions of his prints are almost unknown. In this particular he is in striking contrast to many of his contemporaries; and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> may perhaps trace his care to the training of Shunsho, of whose work also I have seldom seen a really poor impression. Shuncho's work is unfortunately not common; finely preserved copies are scarcer than Kiyonaga's. SHUNZAN. Katsukawa Shunzan was a little-known artist who worked from about 1775 to about 1810. He was first, as his name would suggest, a pupil of Shunsho; in his rare early prints in _hoso-ye_ form he produced actors in the manner of that school with...", "...to everything when he came around.

At the time Ignatius declared the doctrine of the Church, as to the way by which Christ was brought into the world and how he was made manifest, the Gospel of Matthew had not yet appeared; for, if it had, he would have given the story of the star, and the wise men of the East, rather than that of the sun, moon, and all the stars, for the former was the most probable and most sensible of the two. Why should he give <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> story which was false and impossible on its face, if he could give another which, if false, was not manifestly absurd. It is quite easy to tell why the story of the stars and moon leaving their orbits to dance attendance to a bright particular star was abandoned. Such a commotion of the heavenly bodies would have put the universe out of joint; and as the star projected its light above all the other stars, and all the other stars and the moon and sun sang chorus to it, the display...", "...You have no idea of the indignation and wrath of that poor man, whom you have deceived.

The chance, at any rate, was worth taking; Cambridge, moreover, was worth seeing, and it was as good a way as another of keeping his holiday. It occurred to him, indeed, that Cambridge was a big place, and that he had no particular address.

They preferred that the legislature should each year make a grant of money such as it should deem suitable for the governor's expenses, and this sum it might increase or diminish according to its own good pleasure. This would keep the governor properly subservient to the legislature. Before 1750 there had been much bitter wrangling over this question in several of the colonies, and the governors had <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> after another been obliged to submit, though with very ill grace. Sometimes the thoughts of the royal governors and their friends went beyond this immediate question. Since the legislatures were so froward and so niggardly, what an admirable plan it would be to have the governors paid out of the royal treasury and thus made comparatively independent of the legislatures! The judges, too, who were quite poorly paid, might fare much better if remunerated by the crown, and the same...", "...an earl of Douglas and a peer of France, or my servant that he should come forth to spy upon his master?\" \"Then,\" she whispered, smiling, \"you will indeed abide with me?\" He gave her his hand. \"I will abide with you till death!

That beautiful daughter of King David, and sister to Absalom, who was the finest looking man of his day, was called Tamar, which is the Hebrew word for _palm_. Doubtless she was called Tamar on account of her beauty. Absalom named his daughter Tamar for this same reason: \"And unto Absalom there was born three sons and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.\" Moses was so close to God and heaven during those days on the mount, that his face literally shone.

With a cry of anguish I started to my feet and was about to rush away towards the village when a dazzling flash of lightning made me pause for a moment. When it vanished I turned a last look on the girl, and her face was deathly pale, and her hair looked blacker than night; and as she looked she stretched out her arms towards me and uttered a low, wailing cry. \"Good-bye for ever!\" I murmured, and turning once more from her, rushed away like <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> crazed into the wood. But in my confusion I had probably taken the wrong direction, for instead of coming out in a few minutes into the open border of the forest, and on to the savannah, I found myself every moment getting deeper among the trees. I stood still, perplexed, but could not shake off the conviction that I had started in the right direction. Eventually I resolved to keep on for a hundred yards or so and then, if no opening appeared, to turn back and retrace my steps. But...", "...herself? Was it near Ravensrick she wondered? This was not the moment for such reflections. One of the men came for the chair on which she was sitting. Rhoda then went into the garden, and looked about for the last time, walking once more round the old gravel-walk. George's strawberry-plants had spread all over the bed; the verbena was green and sprouting; the vine-wall was draped with falling sprays and tendrils. She pulled a great bunch down and came away, tearing the leaves one by <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> from the stem. Yes, she would write to Mrs. Boswarrick, she thought. Old Betty was standing at the garden door.

I once heard of a man who stayed in New Orleans for six weeks, looking every day for the advertisement of some steamboat going up that river. He saw announcements of boats for the Ouachita River, of course, but none for the 'Washitaw.' Finally, somebody enlightened him.

But the great work carried through by Mr Chamberlain for Birmingham was the municipalization of the supply of gas and water, and the improvement scheme by which slums were cleared away and forty acres laid out in new streets and open spaces. The prosperity of modern Birmingham dates from 1875 and 1876, when these admirably administered reforms were initiated, and by his share in them Mr Chamberlain became not only <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of its most popular citizens but also a man of mark outside. An orator of a business-like, straightforward type, cool and hard-hitting, his spare figure, incisive features and single eye-glass soon made him a favourite subject for the caricaturist; and in later life his aggressive personality, and the peculiarly irritating effect it had on his opponents, made his actions and speeches the object of more controversy than was the lot of any other politician of his time.

These philtres were of various kinds. Some were for exciting and troubling the senses, like the stimulants so much abused in the East. Others were dangerous, and often treacherous draughts to whose illusions the body would yield itself without the will. Others again were employed as tests when the passion was defied, when <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> wished to see how far the greediness of desire might derange the senses, making them receive as the highest and holiest of favours, the most disagreeable services done by the object of their love.

As he approached nearer he observed that Tory was seated with an easel in front of her, and at a short distance away Lucy was posing. The other girls were not in sight. So intent was Tory upon her work that she did not see Lance until he was within a few yards. Then he called out to her, and Lucy, glad of a chance to change her position, ran down to meet him. They came up hand in hand. \"Not so bad, Tory, for a girl, and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> no older than you!\" Lance murmured, staring at the drawing of the youthful artist, his brows drawn into a fine line, half of criticism, half envy. Donald and Dorothy McClain and most of her younger companions would have felt only enthusiastic admiration for Tory's work. Had they known, Lance's attitude was more flattering. He expected more of Tory's ability than the others knew how to expect. She shook her head. \"This is my third attempt, Lance, to make a picture of Lucy...", "...but the majority of them were bona fide home-seekers, who believed as citizens of this country they had a right to quarter-sections in the promised land, and who were determined to enforce those rights. No matter, however, what were the motives of the \"boomers,\" as they were called from the first, it is certain that they went to work in a business-like manner, planned a regular invasion, and formed a number of colonies or small armies for the purpose. We will follow the fortune of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of these colonies in order to show what extraordinary difficulties they went through, and how much more there is in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in our humdrum philosophy. The town of Caldwell, on the southern line of Kansas, was the camp from which the first colonists started. It consisted of about forty men, and about 100 women and children.

But it's rather pathetic.\" \"It's disgusting,\" said his wife; and at this General Triscoe, who had been watching the actress through his lorgnette, said, as if his contrary-mindedness were irresistibly invoked: \"Well, I don't know. It's amusing. Do you suppose we shall see her when we go behind, March?\" He still professed a desire to do so when the...", "...you so hardy in the eyes, as to look up to a kingly seat, or measure your head for a king's crown?' Jehane had plenty of spirit, which a very little of this sort of talk would have fanned into a flame; but she had irony too.

The Queen-Mother took her by the wrist 'My girl,' said she, 'you know very well that you are no Countess at all in my son's right, but are what <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of your nurture should not be.

Alas, it would be well if you could, without offence.' 'Why, whom should I...", "...leader, at times an impassioned lover, and an inexorable foe. Tchaikovsky has not given a very powerful musical presentment of this daring and passionate Cossack, who defied even Peter the Great. But the characterisation of the heroine's father Kochubey, the tool and victim of Mazeppa's ambition, is altogether admirable. The monologue in the fortress of Bielotserkov, where Kochubey is kept a prisoner after Mazeppa has treacherously laid upon him the blame of his own conspiracy, is <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of Tchaikovsky's finest pieces of declamation. Most of his critics are agreed that this number, with Tatiana's famous Letter Scene in the second act of _Eugene Oniegin_, are the gems of his operatic works, and display his powers of psychological analysis at their highest. The character of Maria, the unfortunate heroine of this opera, is also finely conceived. Tchaikovsky is almost always stronger in the delineation of female than of male characters. \"In this respect,\" says...", "...from it. I lied about it. At first, perhaps, I lied through vanity. Any coloured scholar will understand the feeling. Later on I lied through habit; later still because, after all, the classics were all that I had and so I valued them. I have seen thus a deceived dog value a pup with a broken leg, and a pauper child nurse a dead doll with the sawdust out of it. So I nursed my dead Homer and my broken Demosthenes though I knew in my heart that there was more sawdust in the stomach of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> modern author than in the whole lot of them. Observe, I am not saying which it is that has it full of it. So, as I say, I began to lie about the classics. I said to people who knew no Greek that there was a sublimity, a majesty about Homer which they could never hope to grasp. I said it was like the sound of the sea beating against the granite cliffs of the Ionian Esophagus: or words to that effect. As for the truth of it, I might as well have said that it was like the sound of a...", "...might insure them?\" \"Tut, tut, child,\" said Professor Porter. \"Captain Dufranne is willing to remain, and for my part I am perfectly willing, perfectly willing--as I always have been to humor your childish whims.\" \"We can utilize the morrow in recovering the chest, Professor,\" suggested Mr. Philander. \"Quite so, quite so, Mr. Philander, I had almost forgotten the treasure,\" exclaimed Professor Porter. \"Possibly we can borrow some men from Captain Dufranne to assist us, and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the prisoners to point out the location of the chest.\" \"Most assuredly, my dear Professor, we are all yours to command,\" said the captain. And so it was arranged that on the next day Lieutenant Charpentier was to take a detail of ten men, and one of the mutineers of the Arrow as a guide, and unearth the treasure; and that the cruiser would remain for a full week in the little harbor. At the end of that time it was to be assumed that D'Arnot was truly dead, and that the...", "...is that the custom has died of surfeit. As increased facilities of travel made the world smaller, the circle of those that might be visited and saluted by the active grew boundless; so that on both sides limits were desired. Another consideration is that with new facilities came increased opportunities and hopes. To-day we live in the happy consciousness that friends, however distant, may be brought across the world to our doors by the urgencies of business or pleasure; and thus no <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> knows what the coming year may bring forth. In the sixteenth century men knew that opportunities lost might never recur, and that they must seize or make them as best they might. At that time visits of ceremony were in great vogue.

In so many hours great things may be done; the slow tortoise makes a long journey by losing no time.\" Just think what an hour's reading daily would amount to in a year. You can read easily a page of an ordinary youth's paper in twenty minutes, and at that rate could get through, in three hundred and sixty-five hours, no fewer than one thousand and ninety-five pages. And suppose the matter were printed in small pages, of, say, three hundred words apiece, your daily reading for <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> hour would in a year cover something like twelve thousand pages. As to the books in which the year's reading is to be found, let every one take his choice, remembering that people are known by the company they keep, and that to lead a noble life one should associate as much as possible with the noble. Instead of reading, suppose one took to writing: an hour a day would then produce quite as remarkable results.

Four kings went before Arthur and the clerks, bearing swords in their hands. Pommel, scabbard, and hilt of these four swords were of wrought gold. This was the office of these kings when Arthur held state at his court. The first of the princes was from Scotland, the second from South Wales, the third was of North Wales, and as to the last it was Cador of Cornwall who earned the fourth sword. All these fair princes were at <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> in their purpose, being altogether at unity, when Arthur was crowned king. To holy Dubricius it fell, as prelate of Caerleon and Roman legate, to celebrate the office and perform such rites as were seemly to be rendered in the church. That the queen might not be overshadowed by her husband's state, the crown was set on her head in another fashion. For her part she had bidden to her court the great ladies of the country, and such dames as were the wives of her friends.

As an eloquent pleader in the courts, he excelled all his contemporaries, and it was a common saying among solicitors, that Cameron ruled the Bench by force of argument, and the jury by power of persuasion. In the Legislature he was no less influential. His speeches on the Clergy Reserve question, on the Duval case, and many others, excited the House of Assembly to such a degree, that on <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> occasion an adjournment was carried on the motion of the ministerial leader, to give time for sober reflection. So it was in religious assemblies. At meetings of the Synod of the Church of England, at missionary meetings, and others, his fervid zeal and flowing sentences carried all before them, and left little for others to say.

After that...", "...these complaints of Madame des Ursins, since he had done nothing to deserve them. The King, after reflecting for a moment, said he thought, all things considered, that M. d'Orleans had better not return to Spain. In a few days it was publicly known that he would not go. The withdrawal of so many of our troops from Spain was the reason alleged. At the same time the King gave orders to M. d'Orleans to send for his equipages from Spain, and added in his ear, that he had better send some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of sense for them, who might be the bearer of a protest, if Philip V. quitted his throne. At least this is what M. d'Orleans told me, although few people believed him in the end. M. d'Orleans chose for this errand a man named Flotte, very skilful in intrigue, in which he had, so to speak, been always brought up.

Crows seem to know exactly what guns are intended for. But they are seldom afraid of a wagon. They expect no danger from it, and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> can frequently drive along a country road while crows are quietly feeding in the field adjoining, quite close to the fence. But if any one goes out to shoot crows in this way he had better be very careful that he has an excessively mild and unimpressible horse.

This might not have been manly or generous, perhaps, but we believe it is the manner in nine cases out of ten in which such sudden emotions expire, especially if the ardour of the youth has precipitated a declaration that the more chastened feelings of the damsel are not yet prepared to reciprocate.

In connection with this wonderful new edifice of steel and stone, which is <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the wonders of the new world, it is appropriate to add that two world's series have been played on the field of the Polo Grounds since it has been erected. The rules for these world's series were formulated and adopted upon the suggestion and by the advice of Mr. Brush and since a regular world's series season has been a feature of Base Ball the national game has progressed with even greater strides than was the case in the past.

The market was <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> chiefly for meat, and the shops and sheds were mainly occupied by butchers.

It is probably in allusion to this that Polyeuktus[623] of Sphettus said that Demosthenes was the best orator, but that Phokion was the most powerful speaker. As the smallest coins are those which have the greatest intrinsic value, so Phokion in his speeches seemed to say much with few words. We are told that once while the people were flocking into the theatre Phokion was walking up and down near the stage, plunged in thought. \"You seem meditative, Phokion,\" said <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of his friends. \"Yes, by Zeus,\" answered he, \"I am considering whether I can shorten the speech which I am going to make to the Athenians.\" Demosthenes himself, who despised the other orators, when Phokion rose used to whisper to his friends, \"Here comes the cleaver of my harangues.\" Much of his influence, however, must be ascribed to his personal character; since a word or a gesture of a truly good man carries more weight than ten thousand eloquently argued speeches.

As if in compensation for all that the neurologists and psychiatrists had to say of her, she herself had something to say of nervous patients. For her, nervousness so-called was largely selfishness.

In some cases, however, the males and females differ slightly in tint, but Mr. Bate thinks not more than may be accounted for by their different habits of life, such as by the male wandering more about, and being thus more exposed to the light. Dr. Power tried to distinguish by colour the sexes of the several species which inhabit the Mauritius, but failed, except with <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> species of Squilla, probably S. stylifera, the male of which is described as being \"of a beautiful bluish-green,\" with some of the appendages cherry-red, whilst the female is clouded with brown and grey, \"with the red about her much less vivid than in the male.\" (15.

Their coinage was suspended by an order of President Jefferson in 1805, and after this order only 1,300 silver dollars were coined by the United States prior to 1836. From 1836 to 1861 silver dollars were coined in small quantities, the aggregate being less than one and one-half million, and they were generally exported. It is probable that when Mr. Chase became Secretary of the Treasury, there was not in the United States <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> thousand silver dollars. In 1853, and prior to that year, fractional silver coins were worth for bullion more than their face value, and, therefore, did not circulate.

As regards the Crimean War, which in some respects has been compared with this, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> is reminded of the present Commander-in-Chief, who has written these momentous words: The history of the Crimean War shows 'how an army may be destroyed by a Ministry through want of ordinary forethought.'

Whether it shall prove so or not depends chiefly on the manner in which the essential work is done.

Here, therefore, the practice of employing mercenaries became universal, at a time when it was almost unknown in other countries.

It is scarcely possible, that men can pass their lives in the service of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> State, without feeling some interest in its greatness. Its victories are their victories. Its defeats are their defeats. The contract loses something of its mercantile character.

When the queen saw this grand carriage she got her speech and sung, 'Do spare me till I see that grand carriage.' The old woman came into the courtyard, and asked the people if they saw any likeness to any <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> in the children. They said, 'they were like the prince', and asked her how she came by them, and told her she had stolen them. She said she had not stolen them; she had taken them, for they were her own; the prince had taken away her daughter without her leave, and so she had taken his children; but she was willing to give them back, if they would allow that she was right. So they consented, and the old woman made the prince and his queen a present of the grand carriage, and so...", "...stately and slow-moving Turk With freight of slipper piled beneath his arm....

Hood; and, above Klickitat, the great dome which we now call Mt. Adams. Of the miscellaneous myths which pertain to the forces of nature, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the best is that accounting for the Chinook wind. All people who have lived long in Oregon or Washington have a conception of that marvellous warm wind which in January and February suddenly sends them almost summer heat amid snow banks and ice-locked streams, and causes all nature to rejoice as with a resurrection of spring time. Scarcely anything can be imagined in nature more picturesque and dramatic than this Chinook wind. The thermometer may be down nearly to zero, a foot...", "...daring in walking these woods so coolly, unattended by squire or guard, the knight deftly fitted an arrow to his bow, and with a clever shot brought down a fine stag. \"Well hit,\" cried Robin, who could never abstain from admiration of a good bowman. \"You have used your bow full well, Sir Knight.\" The scarlet knight turned towards Robin, and, taking him for some husbandman or hind, called out in high tones, asking how he dared to speak to his betters in that insolent way. \"How is <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> to know one's betters, Sir Knight?\" queried Robin, cheerfully. \"A noble is not always known by his dress, but rather by his manners and his deeds.\" \"Your insolence shall be well paid for,\" returned the other, putting by his bow and drawing his sword. Without further argument he approached Robin angrily, and struck at him with meaning. Robin was too quick for him, however, and caught the blow upon the edge of his own trusty blade. After a few passes Robin feinted, and, catching...", "...before, it is no more a question of liking,\" answered he. \"And if it were,\" said the doctor, \"I have no idea that Monsieur Emile and Madame Renney would be satisfied with the style of a country kitchen, or think the interior of Yankee land a hopeful sphere for their energies.\" \"What sort of a house is it?\" said Mrs. Rossitur. \"A wooden frame house, I believe.\" \"No but, dear uncle, do tell me.\" \"What sort of a house?--Humph--Large enough, I am told. It will accommodate you, in <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> way.\" \"Comfortable?\" \"I don't know,\" said the doctor shaking his head;--\"depends on who's in it. No house is that per se. But I reckon there isn't much plate glass. I suppose you'll find the doors all painted blue, and every fireplace with a crane in it.\" \"A crane!\" said Mrs. Rossitur, to whose imagination the word suggested nothing but a large water-bird with a long neck. \"Ay!\" said the doctor. \"But it's just as well.

In the direction of the engine-room he heard the furious ringing of a bell. The screw stopped. The _Mazatlan_ wallowed helplessly in the trough of the sea. Vandover's very first impulse was a wild desire of saving himself; he had not the least thought for any <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> else. Every soul on board might drown, so only he should be saved. It was the primitive animal instinct, the blind adherence to the first great law, an impulse that in this first moment of excitement could not be resisted.

When a silver dollar was worth 104 cents, no one wanted it as a means of liquidating debts; when it came to be worth 86 cents, it was capable of serving debtors even better than the then appreciating greenbacks. Thus, while from 1853 (and even before) we had legally two standards, of both gold and silver, but really only one, that of gold, from 1873 to 1878 we had both legally and really only <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> standard, that of gold. It might be here added, that I have spoken of the silver dollar as containing 371-1/4 grains of pure silver. Of course, alloy is mixed with the pure silver, sufficient, in 1792, to make the original dollar weigh 416 grains in all, its \"standard\" weight. In 1837 the amount of alloy was changed from 1/12 to 1/10 of the standard weight, which (as the 371-1/4 grains of pure silver were unchanged) gave the total weight of the dollar...", "...the new building, let us see how the Mothers contrived to carry on school work in the interim.

In <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> respect, this book is a parallel to Franklin's well-known apologue of the hatter and his sign. It was commenced with a sole view to exhibit the present state of society in the United States, through the agency, in part, of a set of characters with different peculiarities, who had freshly arrived from Europe, and to whom the distinctive features of the country would be apt to present themselves with greater force, than to those who had never lived beyond the influence of the things...", "...as the numbers, whispered to her by her companion, climbed to the fatal ten. The last deal was Shon's; there was that much to his advantage. As he slowly dealt, the woman--Lucy Rives--rose to her feet behind Lady Jane. So absorbed were all that none saw her. Her eyes passed from Pierre to Shon, and stayed. When the cards were dealt, with but one point for either to gain, and so win and save his life, there was a slight pause before the two took them up. They did not look at <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> another; but each glanced at the revolver, then at the men nearest them, and lastly, for an instant, at the cards themselves, with their pasteboard faces of life and death turned downward. As the players picked them up at last and spread them out fan-like, Lady Jane slipped something into the hand of Lucy Rives. Those who stood behind Shon McGann stared with anxious astonishment at his hand; it contained only nine and ten spots. It was easy to see the direction of the sympathy of...", "...I can't stop to answer them.

He did so, but reported that it would have to be made in rear of the line of encampment as it then ran. The new line, while it would be nearer the river, was yet too far away from the Tennessee, or even from the creeks, to be easily supplied with water, and in case of attack these creeks would be in the hands of the enemy. The fact is, I regarded the campaign we were engaged in as an offensive <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> and had no idea that the enemy would leave strong intrenchments to take the initiative when he knew he would be attacked where he was if he remained. This view, however, did not prevent every precaution being taken and every effort made to keep advised of all movements of the enemy.

It is with these unemotional beings that the Scarabee passes his life. He has but <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> object, and that is perfectly serious, to his mind, in fact, of absorbing interest and importance. In one aspect of the matter he is quite right, for if the Creator has taken the trouble to make one of His creatures in just such a way and not otherwise, from the beginning of its existence on our planet in ages of unknown remoteness to the present time, the man who first explains His idea to us is charged with a revelation.

Its freedom is not real, for it is not a _common benefit_ to all: it is but a particular benefit, that is, a _privilege_. Taxation there forbids the use of newspapers to the poor. Absence of taxation enables your journals to be published at <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> tenth, or even one twentieth, of the English price: hence several of your daily papers reach from thirty to sixty thousand readers, while in England one paper alone is on this scale,--the London 'Times,' which circulates thirty thousand, perhaps.

It haunted me night and day, until the very burden of it threatened to undermine my health. I hid the book away, and locked it close from all knowledge but my own. For the universe I would not have told Jessie <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> word of the awful crime it revealed. I think it would have killed her. But all this time my soul grew faint with apprehension. The year was wellnigh at its close. Would this woman carry out her project and meet Mr. Lee in Paris? The thought drove me wild. I resolved to leave home and cross the ocean rather than allow a noble and good man to be wiled on to a union with that terrible woman. But this was difficult. How could I leave Jessie to such perfect loneliness?

A civilization which destroys faith in genius, in heroism, in sanctity, is the forerunner of barbarism. Individuality is man's noblest triumph over fate, his most heavenly assertion of the freedom of the soul; and a world in which individuality is made impossible is a slavish world.

An absolutely decisive proof that that portion of the Conte du Graal which goes under Gautier's name (though it is by no means clear that all of it is of the same age or due to <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> man), cannot be based upon the Didot-Perceval as we now possess it, is afforded by the adventure of the Ford Amorous or Perillous, which in the two versions is quite dissimilar.

All of us nations in Europe, without <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> exception, have shown our philosophy in that way at times. Even people \"_qui ne se rendent pas_\" have deigned both to run and to shout, \"_Sauve qui peut_!\" at odd times of sunset; though, for my part, I have no pleasure in recalling unpleasant remembrances to brave men; and yet, really, being so philosophic, they ought _not_ to be unpleasant.

Then that they should dig out a little hole in the bottom of the brook with a hoe, so deep that when they put in the log, the upper end would be a little above the surface of the mole. Then she said they might put in the log, with the sawed end uppermost, and while one boy held it steady, the other might throw in stones and sand all around it till it was secure in its place. Then they could build the mole a little beyond it; and...", "...one that is procrastinating, one that is of a crooked disposition, one that is an object of universal obloquy, one that dishonours the life of his preceptor, one that is addicted to the seven well-known vices, one that casts off distressed friends, one possessed of a wicked soul, one that is shameless, one whose sight is ever directed towards sin, one that is an atheist, one that is a slanderer of the Vedas, one whose senses are not restrained, one that gives free indulgence to lust, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> that is untruthful, one that is deserted by all, one that transgresses all restraints, one that is deceitful, one that is destitute of wisdom, one that is envious, one that is wedded to sin, one whose conduct is bad, one whose soul has not been cleansed, one that is cruel, one that is a gambler, one that always seeks to injure friends, one that covets wealth belonging to others, that wicked-souled wight who never expresses satisfaction with what another may give him according to...", "...She had uttered a promise which, a month before, she would not have dreamed herself capable of making. In so doing she had acquired an almost unendurable happiness.

They survive, but they are marred in type by the stigmata of sex-immaturity or abnormality.

IV Of the many theories advanced to explain the determination of Sex in offspring, the true <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> is, undoubtedly, the relative parental power of the respective parents. Normally, this being well-balanced, the ratio of the sexes is about equal; the preponderance being on the male side, however, owing to the maternal parental potential being normally greater, because conserved by reason of her less onerous role in life. When parental potential is relatively greater in the father, female offspring is born. When greater in the mother, male offspring results. In the families of...", "...suspect Chloe herself as suspect the poor woman of working any harm to her adored young mistress.\" Remembering the woman's solicitude on the occasion of his first visit to Cherry Orchard, Anstice was compelled to admit it was unlikely she was the culprit; and his impression was deepened by Sir Richard's next speech. \"As a matter of fact, it came out that the poor old thing couldn't even write her name.

Socrates was not the first nor the only <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> in Greece who had taught \"new gods.\" That he in particular was called on to drink the hemlock was due to reasons of State policy, which had but a very slight and unessential relation to the acts of sacrilege of which he was accused.

And to offset that one jest, the Tribune paid me <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> compliment Dec. 23, by publishing my note declining the New York New England dinner, while merely (in the same breath,) mentioning that similar letters were read from General Sherman and other men whom we all know to be persons of real consequence.

He opened the gate and entered. He went straight to the right-hand window, and, wetting his forefinger, rubbed it up and down on the pane.

An exclamation of surprise and displeasure burst from the officers, but the Esquimaux gave vent to a loud laugh.

The chief indictment to be made against Blom's translation is its prosiness, its prosy, involved sentences, its banality. What in Shakespeare is easy and mellifluous often becomes in Blom so vague that its meaning has to be discovered by a reference to the original. We gave, some pages back, Ivar Aasen's translation of Hamlet's soliloquy. The interesting thing about that translation is not only that it is the first <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> in Norwegian but that it was made into a new dialect by the creator of that dialect himself. When we look back and consider what Aasen had to do--first, make a literary medium, and then pour into the still rigid and inelastic forms of that language the subtlest thinking of a great world literature--we gain a new respect for his genius. Fifty years later Blom tried his hand at the same soliloquy. He was working in an old and tried literary medium--Dano-Norwegian.

Security of person and property was in any case complete, and it was remarkable that there did not appear to be any proper distinction of caste between the Russian-Siberian natives and those who had been exiled for crime.

This process, while it promoted the development of a medieval as distinct from the primitive style, led also to much deterioration in the quality of hymns, of which, perhaps, some of the strongest examples may be found in a volume published in 1865 by the Irish Archaeological Society from a manuscript in the library of Trinity College, Dublin.

There was in the circle another trance medium, Mrs. Taylor, who was put into the trance condition very easily and readily. Well, this spirit 'Winnie' would exchange from Mrs. Green to Mrs. Taylor every once in a while, talking through each medium with equal facility, and to the great delight and edification of the members of the circle. This was indeed something remarkable, and I ventured to inquire of the spirit 'Winnie' if this was a common occurrence. She replied, through <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the mediums, that it was so uncommon that she never knew of it occurring at a circle sitting before; that spirits always had their own medium, and it was very seldom that they would or could talk through more than one chosen medium, and especially at the same sitting of a circle, as was the case with us. \"To narrate all that occurred at this remarkable seance would fill many printed columns.

But no one wearing a heavy crape veil should go to a gay reception, a wedding, or a theatre; the thing is incongruous. Still less should mourning prevent one from taking proper recreation: the more the heart aches, the more should one try to gain cheerfulness and composure, to hear music, to see faces which one loves: this is a duty, not merely a wise and sensible rule.

By this act he made John of Nepomuck the patron saint of Bohemia.

Co. decided to make a new standard to replace the one they had at that date. Mr. O. J. Beale was detailed to do this work. He prepared steel bars about 40 inches long by 1-1/4 inch square, and after planing them, they were allowed to rest for several months. At the ends of these bars he inserted two gold plugs, the centers of which were about 36 inches apart, and a little beyond these two others about <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> meter apart. A bar was placed in position upon a heavy bed. This was so arranged that a tool carrier could be passed over the bar. The tool carrier consisted of a light framework, holding the marking tool. One feature of the marking was that the point of the marking tool was curved and had an angle, so that if dropped it made an impression in the form of an ellipse. In graduations, ordinarily, the line, when highly magnified, is apt to present at its ends an impression less definite...", "...commended it to people, especially to those who did not look very deep.

These teachers with their abundant forms impose upon the popular imagination, as if they were altogether given up to devout contemplation and prayer. But if <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> looks a little more closely at them, one sees that their devotion is the indulgence of their own will and not surrender to God's. They are not worshipping Him as He has appointed, but as they have themselves chosen, and as they are rendering services which He has not required, they are in a very true sense worshipping their own wills, and not God at all. By \"will-worship\" seems to be meant self-imposed forms of religious service which are the outcome not of obedience, nor of the...", "...restraints on him, treat him with severity? Perhaps by urging it very importunately, and asking it as a personal favour, Caroline might have gained this difficult conquest, and led her father to subdue the feelings of his heart, and make use of one weakness to combat another; but she did not have recourse to this dangerous method; her natural sense of uprightness deterred her from making use of it, and taught her that truth alone has the privilege of finally triumphing over error; that <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> passion is not well vanquished by another; and that though it be a longer, it is at all events a surer way to appeal to reason, the sole legitimate and absolute sovereign of our moral nature.

At 27 I took rooms and formed acquaintance with the family occupying the house. The boys, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> by one, were allowed to sleep with me and I conceived an extraordinary passion for one of them, an attachment which lasted till I finally left England.

Meffia sprawled uncouthly and was forever spreading her knees apart, generally with <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> up in the air. Her postures were so disgusting that Brinnaria was hot all over with determination not to be like Meffia. She succeeded. Great was her exultation when she perceived that it was no longer Brinnaria and Meffia who gave cause for concern to Causidiena, but Meffia and Brinnaria, great her triumph when she made sure that Causidiena had ceased worrying about her, or worried only at long intervals, but was perpetually solicitous concerning Meffia.

It was to be our first outing--our trial trip, \"by the measured mile,\" as navy sailors call it. Not so much a trial, however, for the caravan itself, as for a certain horse that was to be attached thereto; and, considering the weight of our house upon wheels, I thought it at least doubtful if any <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> horse would be sufficient to do the work. The horse in this instance was--a mare. A splendid powerful dark bay draught mare, with small head, strong, shapely, arching neck, good shoulders, and long enough in body not to look cloddy. Her tail, about two yards long, had been specially plaited and got up for the occasion.

Flexibility in the structure of a sentence is often gained by what is known as \"overlapping\"[62] of phrases, _i.e._, where the closing measure of a sentence, the 8th or 12th for example, is identical with the first measure of the following phrase. A clear example is this passage from the first movement of Beethoven's Third Sonata, _e.g._ [Music] [Footnote 62: This effect is clearly brought out in symphonic music where <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> portion of the orchestra, with a certain tone color, may be ending a phrase at the same moment at which another part, with a contrasting tone color, begins. An excellent example is the first theme of the Slow movement of Schumann's Second Symphony (measures 7-8).] As the principles of sentence-formation are closely involved with the general subject of rhythm, something must be known about the number of beats within the measure itself.

Pisistratus did thus more than continue the laws of Solon--he inculcated the intellectual habits which the laws were designed to create. And as in the circle of human events the faults of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> man often confirm what was begun by the virtues of another, so perhaps the usurpation of Pisistratus was necessary to establish the institutions of Solon. It is clear that the great lawgiver was not appreciated at the close of his life; as his personal authority had ceased to have influence, so possibly might have soon ceased the authority of his code. The citizens required repose to examine, to feel, to estimate the blessings of his laws--that repose they possessed under...", "...morrow will bring no regrets.

Supposing the late Thomas Carlyle had been a little more attentive to his brilliant and devoted wife during their long and lonely life in the plain home in Cheyne Row, in Chelsea, London, such words as these, which escaped her in a letter to a friend, could never have been said: \"Those little attentions which we women attach so much importance to he was never in the habit of...", "...of enjoyment with which the Creator has endowed him.

Jonson outlived Shakespeare twenty-one years and helped to usher in the decline of the drama. Ben Jonson, the son of a clergyman and the stepson of a master bricklayer, received a good education at Westminster School. Unlike Shakespeare, Jonson learned much Latin and Greek. In <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> respect Jonson's training was unfortunate for a poet. He was taught to write prose exercises first and then to turn them into poetry. In this way he acquired the habit of trying to express unpoetical ideas in verse. Art could change the prose into metrical riming lines, but art could not breathe into them the living soul of poetry. In after times Jonson said that Shakespeare lacked art, but Jonson recognized that the author of _Hamlet_ had the magic touch of nature. Jonson's pen...", "...error, he declared, was, that several of the men whom he had hired for the purpose of capturing the gipsies were too late at the rendezvous, and several did not come at all. These disappointments, and the delay they occasioned, had prevented his taking advantage of the moment when the gipsies' guns were discharged after the slaughter of the deer, and, as time lost is never regained, had caused the ultimate failure of his whole plan. He assured the peer, however, that Pharold had been <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the party engaged in the destruction of the game; and that he had been active in the affray wherein Sir Roger Millington and the keeper had been wounded. Some of the other men, he said, were not very clear about these facts, but he was ready to swear to it. He then related how the boy William had been seized by two of his party, who had been detached for that purpose; and he added a long account of the measures which he had taken in order to trace the gipsies in their flight....", "...unearth him.

But not a clue could we discover. Nobody had known of the proposed expedition except Goody Picker; and she, as everybody testified, was true to the backbone. As the day went on, and nothing came of it, Tod had one of his stamping fits. \"If one could find out whether it was man or woman! If <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> could divine how they got at the knowledge!\" stamped Tod. \"The pater does not look sure about us yet.\" \"I wonder if it could have been Roger Monk?\" I said, speaking out a thought that had been dimly creeping up in my mind by starts all day. \"Roger Monk!\" repeated Tod, \"why pitch upon him?\" \"Only that it's just possible he might have got it out of Goody Picker.\" Away went Tod, in his straightforward fashion, to look for Roger Monk.

So were passed on from lip to lip the scanty phrases of news that came direct from the banks of the Canal, where at <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> time rather a panic set in amongst the Arab population. Naturally these rumours percolated to the camps, and, with certain orders to brigades of the 1st Division and the New Zealanders to get equipped and stores to be got in as quickly as possible, it was no wonder that the troops were eagerly anticipating their marching orders. They would at this time, too, have given a lot to have escaped from the relentless training that was getting them fit: the monotony of the desert had...", "...as are those of Christians.

But the first little <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> dropped his head obstinately at the tree and stopped short. The next one did the same thing; only he ran his head into the first one's legs and knocked them out from under him. The others whirled with a _ba-a-a-ah_, and scampered round the tree and up to their mothers, who had turned now and stood watching anxiously to see the effect of their lesson. Then it began over again.

It is a sentiment as immense as if it were mad, and yet it is wise, and of human things it is the only perfect one. There is no great sentiment which is not completely held on the arms of compassion. To understand life, and love it to its depths in a living being, that is the being's task, and that his masterpiece; and each of us can hardly occupy his time so greatly as with <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> other; we have only one true neighbor down here. To live is to be happy to live. The usefulness of life--ah! its expansion has not the mystic shapes we vainly dreamed of when we were paralyzed by youth. Rather has it a shape of anxiety, of shuddering, of pain and glory. Our heart is not made for the abstract formula of happiness, since the truth of things is not made for it either. It beats for emotion and not for peace. Such is the gravity of the truth. \"You've done well...", "...discriminate it from several others of the same name; they are all great streams, not to be confounded, in spite of their homonymity: 1.

Then, he always had the fire well prepared.

Some have supposed that the line of Horace [96]-- \"Turgidus Alpinus jugulat dum Memnona,\" refers to him, the nickname of Alpinus having been given him on account of his ludicrous description of Jove \"spitting snow upon the Alps.\" Others have assigned the eight spurious lines on Lucilius in the tenth satire of Horace to him.

Negotiations were carried on, in the first place by Lord Salisbury, and in the second by Lord Rosebery, with the Chinese minister in London, and the draft of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> convention was prepared. Among such contemplated arrangements were the dispatch of a mission from Burmah to China, and of a return one from China; the appointment of the Head Priest of Mandalay as the person to send the mission, thus making it a purely native matter, outside the participation of the British government; and the concession of material advantages on the Irrawaddy and in the Shan country, as the equivalent for the surrender of the tribute.

The most remarkable examples occur in the valley of the Kale Water at Blinkbonny, a mile or so above the village of Eckford. At that place a bank of morainic matter at <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> time blocked up the valley of the Kale, and thus formed a wide and extensive lake that stretched up to and beyond Morebattle. Numerous curious hillocks of gravel and sand are banked against the moraine, and point to the action of the flood-waters that escaped from the melting glacier. Other gravelly moraine mounds occur higher up the same valley, as near Grubbit Mill.

The favourite argument of some, that no religious doctrine can be true which is rejected by the \"common opinion\" and popular feeling of mankind,--that any texts which contradict this common popular feeling must be wrongly interpreted,--and that therefore eternal punishment cannot be true, because the inward feeling of the multitude revolts against it,--this argument appears to me alike most dangerous and unsound....", "...were ordered, but the suspicion was so great that people insisted upon the glasses of the telescopes being unscrewed, in order to be quite sure that there was no pill behind them.

It springs up suddenly, mysteriously, in unexpected places. A simple peasant girl, tending her flocks, hears a Voice; and she becomes a warrior, a leader of men, the saviour of her country. A maidservant, after a day of scrubbing floors and washing dishes, is darning stockings in the kitchen when she smells fire, rushes into the bedroom where the children are asleep, and carries them <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> by one through the flames into safety, at the cost of her own life. Such opportunities fall to few. The most of us trudge a very unheroic journey through life. The road may be dusty, with ups and downs, dangerous corners and wearisome hills; but we plod along, keeping pretty closely to the highway, and taking great care at the crossings. It is only the odd one here and there who, by what we call the accident of circumstance, or by some compelling adventurousness of spirit,...", "...ye, isn't it?' \"And I, havin' thought of a glen in ould Ireland that I'll never see again, nor any that's in it, said: 'Not, only burn them to the water's edge, Duke Lawless, but swear to your own soul that they never lived but in the dreams of the night.' \"'You're right there, Shon,' says he, and after that no luck was bad enough to cloud the gay heart of him, and bad enough it was sometimes.\" \"And why do you fear that he is not alive?\" \"Because I met an old mate of mine <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> day on the Frazer, and he said that Lawless had never come to Cloncurry; and a hard, hard road it was to travel.\" Jo Gordineer was calling to them, and there the conversation ended.

This does not prove that Gen. xxiii. is early, because writing was used in Palestine about 1400 B.C., and, on the other hand, the more simple forms of agreement are still familiar after the time of Jeremiah (e.g. Ruth, Proverbs).

Presently he opened one eye and then the other, and some spoonfuls of whisky and water, which Surgeon O'Shea poured down his throat, contributed still further to revive him. In the course of half-an-hour Larry asked in a low voice, \"Did yer beat back the O'Sullivans, yer honour? shure they were coming after us at a mighty great rate, and I fancy some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of them gave me a whack on the crown which brought me to the ground.\" \"Keep quiet and don't be talking,\" answered the surgeon, who, proud of his success, had been carefully watching his patient. \"He'll do now, gentlemen,\" he added, looking up at my uncle and me. \"We'll put him to bed, and by to-morrow morning he'll be as blithe as a lark, barring a stiff neck.\" CHAPTER FOUR.

As the family could not wait two years before moving, it was decided that the change of residence should be made at once, but that the son should live with his uncle until the next year. The uncle's home was, however, inconveniently remote, and so the young man stayed as a visitor at his father's house for the remaining months of the year, after which he became once more a member of the household.

Then the serpents turned into twenty black vultures with fiery beaks, and they tried to pick out his eyes; but with his trusty blade he kept them off, and one by <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> he killed them all, and then found himself surrounded by forty dark-haired and dark-eyed lovely maidens, who would have thrown their arms around him, but that he, fearing their intentions were evil, kept them off; when, looking on the ground, he saw the White Cat panting, and heard her bid him \"strike.\" He waited no longer, but struck at them and cut off their heads, and then saw that the ground was covered with burning coal, which would have scorched the White Cat and killed...", "...how a woman's understanding of the words \"Steel wasp,\" when applied by her to one of her own sex, may differ widely from a man's understanding of them; and that Miss Rieppe, through her thick veil, saw from her seat in the automobile something which my own unencumbered vision had by no means detected.

Most of my hopes of the successful termination of my love were based, it must be remembered, on the fortune which floated within the ribs of the huge Leviathan, and then my feelings may well be imagined, when, on the morning of the 24th of February, I saw a signal of distress flying on board her.

But then, \"forgiveness of sins\" had been preached to them in the name of Jesus. Was this preaching true, or was it not? Was it for them, or was it not? Was it all a dream--a shadow--a myth?

These are plain questions, demanding a plain answer from those who assert that no one can know for certain that his sins are forgiven. If, indeed, no <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> can know it now, then how could any one have known it in apostolic times?

There was something very inconsistent about the statement \"most powerful vessel\" with a crew of six men and <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> officer, but apparently the Spaniards overlooked this. The fact of the matter is that Admiral Sampson decided to close the harbor effectually, and in order to do this sent the collier _Merrimac_ to the entrance of the channel and had her sunk there.

At the outskirts of the ruined village the houses are lower and have only <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> story, while in its central part they must have been at one time at least four stories high. They were not palaces, but simply dwellings, and the whole village, which probably once housed 3,000 or 4,000 people, resembles, in its general characteristics, the pueblos in the Southwest, and, for that matter, the houses we excavated from the mounds.

But the entire inadequacy of Darwinism to account for the primitive origin of life forms, for the original diversity in the different branches of the tree of life forms, the interdependence of the creation of ancient faunas and floras on geological revolutions, and consequent sudden changes in the environment of organisms, has convinced us that Darwinism is but <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of a number of factors of a true evolution theory; that it comes in play only as the last term of a series of evolutionary agencies or causes; and that it rather accounts, as first suggested by the Duke of Argyll, for the _preservation_ of forms than for their origination.

The teacher recognises what is good in the child's disposition and endeavours to build on it a self-respect which may at all times be invoked against temptations to bad conduct. Child depravity sometimes exists, but it can generally be traced to injudicious methods of education in the family, the school, or the community. Dickens has laid so much emphasis on defects of method in these three directions that he has made the generation in which he lived and the next succeeding <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> sensitively conscious of them. He has even caricatured them with such vehemence of style as to make our ideals so vivid that we see at once any wrong tendency in its very beginning. Walter Scott, in his schoolmasters, has caricatured pedantry; so has Shakespeare. But Dickens has discovered a variety of types of pedantry and made them all easily recognisable and odious to us.

He never attempted to do this endwise, like other animals, for the obvious reason that, like every one else, he was unable to make any sense of the time-tables; and unless he should by good luck begin the manoeuvre when a train was said to be due, it was likely he would be abbreviated; for of course no one is idiot enough to cross a railway track when the time-table says it is all clear--at least no <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> as long as Jerusalem. So he would advance his head to the rails, calling in his outlying convolutions, and straightening them alongside the track, parallel with it; and then at a signal previously agreed upon--a short wild bark--this sagacious dog would make the transit unanimously, as it were. By this method he commonly avoided a quarrel with the engine. Altogether he was a very interesting beast, and his master was fond of him no end.

His one thought was that the college would suffer heavily if this game were lost, and he hardly gave a thought to his private grievances. The college was the thing that counted.

The visiting team did nothing, however, for although they got a runner to third at <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> time, he was put out by a quick throw from pitcher to first. Thus ended the second inning, and to the casual observer it seemed as though the teams were pretty evenly matched. To Reddy's practised eye, however, it was apparent that the Blues had a little the edge on their opponents, except in the matter of pitching. Here, indeed, it was hard to tell who was the better pitcher, the Maroon boxman or Winters. Both were pitching good ball, and Reddy realized that it would probably...", "...growth of rubbish; and no creatures rejoiced but the creatures of the night--the vermin here and there in the beds, and the cats everywhere on the tiles.

We cross to the L. wall, where the rich collection of works by Watteau and his followers is placed: 983, Gilles, a scene from a Comedy, is <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of Watteau's most precious pictures.

It was quite evident, however, to Herbert, that these were very familiar acquaintances of his family; for, in the surprise of the moment, Lord Cadurcis had saluted his daughter by her Christian name.

His philosophical opinions grew out of a diligent study of Descartes and Malebranche. John Norris of Bemerton also strongly influenced him by his _Essay on the Ideal World_ (1701-1704). It is remarkable that Collier makes no reference to Locke, and shows no sign of having any knowledge of his works.

To tell the truth affairs were not going very well at Rainbow Ranch. The big creek which ran along through Rainbow Valley for nearly a mile and supplied their ranch with water was almost dry in the middle of October. There might soon be nothing for the cattle and horses to drink until the winter snows fell. Jim had confided to Jack that he suspected some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> was draining their creek by digging a channel for the water lower down the valley. He could not find out, but if it were true, it meant ruin for the ranch girls! There was another, even more serious difficulty, that might be in store for them, but of this the girls would not speak. \"Has anything happened, Jack?\" Jean asked hurriedly. Jack shook her head. \"Nothing unusual,\" she replied. \"Only I shall feel dreadfully sorry if we have to send the Indian girl back to her people....", "...all the lies that she had heard in chapel.

It was scarcely to be expected that his uncle would break the custom of years in a sudden burst of confidence just because his nephew happened to surprise him in <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of his difficult situations. His life was full of such difficult situations, no doubt,--had been for years--and the Honorable Milton was accustomed to relying upon himself to surmount them as he saw fit.

The reservoir of the pen contained a little air, which expanded as the atmospheric pressure diminished, and at 10,000 feet I found most of the ink emptied into my pocket.

Strange to say, in private life Swift appears to have been not only moral in conduct, but refined in conversation, and he is even said to have rebuked Stella on <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> occasion for a slightly coarse remark. His imagination was diseased, and he was himself always apprehensive of the calamity under which he became at last 'a driveller and a show.' 'I shall be like that tree,' he said once to the poet Young, 'I shall die at the top.' It has been already said that _The Tale of a Tub_ was written at Moor Park. It appeared in 1704, and although published anonymously and never owned, the book effectually stood in the way of Swift's high preferment in...", "...all of them together depend upon a cause which is out of themselves, and through which they began to exist; the universe, then, has had a cause, an Author.

Consequently, we must either suppose an endless progression of causes and effects, which is repugnant to reason, or arrive at last at a Being existing by and of himself,--that is to say, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> who owes not his existence to others, and has caused all other things to exist;--and in that case, the reason of his existence must be part of his _own_ essence and nature, and, consequently, inseparable from him and indestructible.

The horse is stopped about fifty yards from the house, and the groom appears on the roof of his father's house with three red apples in his hands. Kissing each <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> he tries to throw it over the bride. When the apples strike the ground there is a crowd of boys ready to scramble for them as there is a superstition that the lucky boy will be the next to marry. The bride now goes to her new home.

Six years later the poem was printed with others in a volume, quickly followed by a second, _Vane's Story_, _etc._ Thomson's melancholy death attracted fresh attention to him, and much--perhaps a good deal too much--of his writings has been republished since. His claims, however, must rest on a comparatively small body of work, which will no doubt <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> day be selected and issued alone. \"The City of Dreadful Night\" itself, incomparably the best of the longer poems, is a pessimist and nihilist effusion of the deepest gloom amounting to despair, but couched in stately verse of an absolute sincerity and containing some splendid passages.

They had no sooner fortified the island than there began the nine months' siege of the Turks, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the most memorable sieges in history. When it was ended, the Turks re-embarked ten thousand of the forty thousand men they had landed, and of the nine thousand Knights present under the Grand Master Jean de la Valette when the siege had opened, but six hundred capable of bearing arms remained alive. The order continued in possession of their island until the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the French, under General Bonaparte, took it with but little trouble.

Our native literature, whether referring to pagan or Christian times, is full of references to music and to skilful musicians, who are always spoken of in terms of the utmost respect. Everywhere through the Records we find evidences that the ancient Irish, both high and low, were passionately fond of music. It was mixed up with their daily home-life, and formed part of their amusements, meetings, and celebrations of every kind. In the religious tales music is always <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the delights of heaven; and a chief function of the angels who attend on God is to chant music of ineffable sweetness to Him, which they generally do in the shape of beautiful white birds. A good example of the people's intense fondness for music is found in an old Irish religious poem, in which the hard lot of Adam and Eve for a whole year after their expulsion from Paradise is described, when they were--as the poem expresses it--\"without proper food, fire, house, _music_, or...", "...kept occasionally blowing the horn as they went, as the road is parallel with the mountain.

The Tuscaroras then went back and kept in the rear of the white people in their flight. The British Indians perceiving that it was the Tuscarora Indians that killed <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of their number and repulsed them, made their way to their reservation, (the nation had already deserted their homes), and began to burn their houses indiscriminately, and also a meeting-house which was built by them, except eight dollars, a convenient chapel where the early christian Tuscaroras such as Sacaresa and Solomon Longboard, both sachems, with many others, delighted to worship the Almighty in the simplicity of their faith.

At first the Adjutant declined, not seeing how it was possible for him to perform both duties, since either one of them seemed quite as much as any <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> man could perform. The General urged that, as he would be held officially responsible for whatever the provost-judge might do, he must have some one in whom he had implicit confidence, some one whom he could see and converse with at every meal-time, some one who was familiar with the workings of courts of justice, and since he, the Adjutant, had drawn up the plan, there was no one whom he could detail that could put the plan in operation so well as he.

Ridicule, satire, and sarcasm are suitable for use against an open enemy, such as a political opponent, against a public nuisance which ought to be suppressed, or in behalf of higher ideals and standards. The one thing that makes this style of little effect is anger or morbid intensity. While some thing or some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> is attacked, perhaps with ferocity, results are to be obtained by winning the reader. So it comes about that winning, good-natured humor is an essential element in really successful ridicule.

First: The words \"nature\" and \"natural,\" are used as though they had one clear, simple, and invariable meaning, whereas in this passage they are used so as to include phenomena which widely differ from <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> another. We are not told what is included under the term \"nature,\" whether it is restricted to matter, its forces, and its laws, or whether it also includes mind and all its phenomena. When we speak of interruptions in the order of nature, we usually intend it to be assumed that volition is the cause of these interruptions. This being so, the author has included in nature phenomena which differ so widely from one another as those of mind and matter. He then speaks of the chief...", "...equal to 73,938 degrees.

Assuredly, not only in the eyes of the law, but in the judgment of the whole community, I would be regarded a criminal. So when <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> man steals another and offers him for sale, no one, in view of the Divine law, can buy him, for the reason that the Divine law forbids that man shall in the first place be made a merchantable article. The inquiry must be, if I buy, I buy in violation of the Divine law, and it will not do for me to plead that I bought him. I have him in possession, and that is enough, God condemns me for it as a man-stealer.

The astonishing thing is that with so little storage of energy it should be possible to transmit intelligence to a distance of a hundred miles without connecting wires. One consequence, however, of the small amount of energy which can be accumulated in a simple Marconi aerial is that this energy is almost entirely radiated in <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> oscillation or wave. Hence, strictly speaking, a simple aerial of this type does not create a train of waves in the ether, but probably at most a single impulse or two.

Then, as if conscious that his reply might have seemed ungraciously curt, he turned toward me and said: \"I'm looking for a line that I ought to know where to find, but do not.\" He gave me the substance of what he sought and fortunately I recognized it as a part of a half-remembered passage in <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of Abraham Cowley's poems. I told Mr. Bryant so, and while he sat I found what he wanted. Apparently his concern for it was gone. Instead of looking at the book which I had placed in his hands open at the desired page, he turned upon me and asked: \"How do you happen to know anything about Cowley?\" I explained that as a youth, while idling time away on an old Virginia plantation, where there was a library of old books, as there was on every other ancestral plantation round...", "...him into the field, he found him dead, with a large piece of meat hanging to his neck. The news of his death soon went abroad, also the cause of it, and when old Mr. Clarkson found it out he was very angry at his son Thomas, and his punishment was, that he was driven from his plantation with orders never to return, and that he should not have any of his property. This seemed to grieve Thomas very much, and he made several attempts to regain his father's affections, but failed. Finally, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> night, Thomas made an outcry that he had found a pearl of great price, that the Lord had pardoned his sins, and that he was at peace with all mankind. When his father heard of this, he sent for him to come home, and he gave him quite a sum of money and willed him the portion of property that he had said he should keep from him. But poor Jim was not there to forgive him. A MAN MISTAKEN FOR A HOG. Two negroes went to steal hogs from their masters. The swine were under a barn,...", "...did two lads work harder. They were accompanied by Fred, and a day later their uncle also joined them. The dirt from the pocket had been cleaned up, and it had yielded over twenty ounces of gold. They were now working on the regular sand and gravel scraped from the bedrock of the gulch, and though this did not pay so well, yet it brought in enough to make them all satisfied. There was a good deal of excitement, too, when it came to cleaning out the sluice boxes, for almost every day <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> or another found a nugget, sometimes small, and then again as large as a walnut. \"How much do you think we are averaging?\" asked Randy, one day, and his uncle replied that he could not figure very closely, but he would put it down as over a hundred dollars per day. This meant twenty-five dollars a day as the boy's share, and he felt more content than ever to slave along in the gulch. For it was slaving along, this constantly picking and digging and carting the dirt, sand, and...", "...to obey the order, and Glavour with an oath stepped toward her, his one good arm outstretched in a grasping gesture. Lura did not move until his hand almost closed on her arm and then she sprang back. Her hand sought the bosom of her robe and the Viceroy recoiled as a glittering dagger flashed in the air. \"Back, Jovian!\" cried Lura in ringing tones. \"Think you that the daughter of a king of men is to be a toy for your base Jovian passions? The point of this dagger is poisoned so that <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> touch through your skin will mean death. One step nearer and I will strike!\" * * * * * The Viceroy hesitated for a moment and then drew from his robe a short thick tube.

However, it is not lost for good. I found the most of it on my shoulder afterward. (I stood near the door when she squeezed out with the throng.)

RILEY-NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT One of the best men in Washington--or elsewhere--is RILEY, correspondent of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the great San Francisco dailies. Riley is full of humor, and has an unfailing vein of irony, which makes his conversation to the last degree entertaining (as long as the remarks are about somebody else). But notwithstanding the possession of these qualities, which should enable a man to write a happy and an appetizing letter, Riley's newspaper letters often display a more than earthly solemnity, and likewise an unimaginative devotion to petrified facts, which surprise and...", "...a narrow passage: the stairs swayed and shook; the air was heavy with a mixture of frankincense and sullage; until at last we crawled through a trap-door that opened as by magic, and found ourselves at our journey's end. [Illustration: Fateh Muhammad] Imagine a small attic, some fifteen feet by ten, under the very eaves of the 'chal,' filled with the smoke of frankincense so pungent that the eyes at once commenced to water nor ceased until we were once again in the open air. In <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> corner was spread a coarse sheet with a couple of pillows against the wall, upon which the silent Mahomedan bade us by a sign recline; in the opposite corner a 'panja', a species of altar smothered in jasmine wreaths and surmounted by a bunch of peacock's feathers; and immediately in front of this an earthen brazier of live charcoal. Behind the brazier sat three persons, Fateh Muhammad, a Musalman youth with curiously large and dreamy eyes, and two old Musalman beldames, either of...", "...hearing, I thrust my head from the aforesaid aperture and cried aloud as follows: \"Walk up, gentlemen! It's my annual free day. No charge for seats.\" Macbeth and Banquo were not more affrighted by the apparition of witches on the blasted heath than were these two individuals when they heard the voice from the box, and saw the face of him that spake. They stopped dead, stared, and, though I won't give this on oath, turned pale. I believe they were genuinely scared. Presently <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of them--say Macbeth--broke into a loud and merry laugh. The sound of it was worth more to me at that moment than a sheaf of testimonials, for I remembered Carlyle's dictum that there is nothing irremediably wrong with any man who can utter a hearty laugh. \"All right, guvnor,\" came the reply, \"we'll take two stalls in the front row.\" \"Good!\" I replied. \"Wire just received from the Prince and Princess of Wales resigning their seats!

For this was the divisional camp, the first divisional camp Australia had ever assembled. It was, also, the first time that Major-General Bridges had seen his command mustered together. With his Staff he took up his headquarters in a section of Mena House for use as offices, with their living tents pitched close by. This was the chance to organize and dovetail <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> unit into another, work brigade in with brigade, artillery with the infantry, the Light Horse regiments as protecting screens and scouts. The Army Service Corps, Signallers, Post Office, all came into being as part of a larger unit for the first time. The troops became part of a big military machine, units, cogs in the wheel. They began to apply what had been learnt in sections, and thus duties once thought unnecessary began to be adjusted and to have a new significance. Of...", "...another hour after the time set.

It was not a small thing to instal a woman luxuriously in a house in which no woman had set foot since Carlo had lived there, and to do this within sixty minutes. It is true that the rich young merchant had great store of thick carpets and fine stuffs, and all sorts of silver vessels, and weapons from Damascus, and carved ivory chessmen from India; but though some of these things quickly furnished the upper rooms which Zeno set apart...", "...I say or do now? But strangely and suddenly, under the influence of this thought, my anger died away. I saw with his eyes and felt with his heart; I saw how he stood, and I knew that I had brought him to that pass. Was it strange that he fired at me without faltering, although I might be ten times a king? It seemed to me almost just that he should kill me. Varvilliers would not give him a revolver. Did Varvilliers also suspect? I think his fear was rather of our extreme rage against <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> another. It occurred to me that I would not aim at my opponent. But then I thought I had no right to act thus; it would make matters worse for him if I fell. Besides my own life did not seem to me a thing to be thrown away lightly. Varvilliers produced another pair of pistols, similar to those which Wetter and I now held. He loaded both, fired them into the targets, and placed one on a shelf at either end of the room. \"Those are the first shots. You understand?

The event itself happened in 778; the first known MS. was made, by a scribe, about 1150. All during the long interval, ballad-singers and minstrels had been extolling France and Roland; the love of the heroic was as strong as before Homer; the hero's name had grown: with his fame into titanic proportions; the actual author, (conjectured to have been <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> Turoldus or Theurolde, a monk,) had but to take the poetic material ready at his hand and fashion it into the epic. Time had dimmed and enlarged the details; the _Song of Roland_ deals in mass and massive heroes; in this it is like a book from the Iliad. It is not a long poem; there are only about 3,500 lines in all, but the Old French in which it is written makes it difficult reading, at least to one not a Frenchman.

No doubt Traugott had stepped on to <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of these conductors at the moment when he began sketching the old man and the page, without having any idea that they were standing behind him in the flesh; for the strange apparition of them had gone darting through him like a flash of lightning, and he felt that he now clearly knew and understood things which had formerly been but presages and dreams.

There, looking about him as a very reserved man might who had never looked about him in his life before, he saw some six or eight young children come merrily trooping and whooping from one of the cottages, and disperse. But not until they had all turned at the little garden gate, and kissed their hands to a face at the upper window: a low window enough, although the upper, for the cottage had but a story of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> room above the ground. Now, that the children should do this was nothing; but that they should do this to a face lying on the sill of the open window, turned towards them in a horizontal position, and apparently only a face, was something noticeable. He looked up at the window again. Could only see a very fragile though a very bright face, lying on one cheek on the window-sill. The delicate smiling face of a girl or woman.

Mrs. Baxendale believed for a moment that the sufferer had lost consciousness, but the utterance of her name caused Emily to raise her lids. 'Why did he do this?' she asked, regarding her friend fixedly. 'No <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> can say, dear.' Emily drew a deep sigh; a gleam passed over her face.

The irony of the historic whirligig showed itself in the fact that the Catholic Auto-da-fe had its counterpart in the frightful doom of a king and an army led by the flower of his nobility, who, barely a hundred miles from the coast of their kingdom, had to choose between apostasy or being immured alive for the edification of the vengeful Moor.

Her husband viewed her with a malicious grin till her task was completed; then, walking up to the table, he opened the treasury of sacred knowledge, and deliberately tore out every leaf, flinging them, now on <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> side, now on the other, to each far corner of the apartment; then striding towards the fire-place, he planted himself on the hearth, with his back to the chimney, his legs spread in the attitude of a colossal statue, the tails of his coat turned apart under his arms, and his hands in his side-pockets. \"Now,\" he said, looking at his wife, \"pick them up!--pick them up! pick them up!\" he continued, till all were collected.

Rinaldo, in spite of his aberrations with Armida, knew the path to renown, and so did his poet. Tasso's epic, with all its faults, is a noble production, and justly considered one of the poems of the world. Each of those poems hit some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> great point of universal attraction, at least in their respective countries, and among the givers of fame in others. Homer's poem is that of action; Dante's, of passion; Virgil's, of judgment; Milton's, of religion; Spenser's, of poetry itself; Ariosto's, of animal spirits (I do not mean as respects gaiety only, but in strength and readiness of accord with the whole play of nature); Tasso looked round with an ultra-sensitive temperament, and an ambition which required...", "...voyage across the German Ocean, to find myself in the midst of innumerable islands, a dead calm--so dead that it seems impossible that it should ever come alive again--and scenery so wild, so gorgeous, that one ceases to wonder where the Vikings of old got their fire, their romance, their enterprise, and their indomitable pluck.

CHAPTER XXVIII TOSSED BY THE STORM Very little information could be obtained from Mr. Rossmore. He was so \"flustered,\" as he expressed it, from what had taken place, and so unnerved by the thought that he had been harboring in his barn two desperate bank robbers, that he could hardly answer simple questions. \"All I know,\" he said, \"is that I was out in the garden when their airship whizzed overhead. It flopped on <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> side, and the men were spilled out. They fell in a tree, or they'd have been killed instantly. I ran to help them, so I didn't notice which way their machine went off.\" \"But you must have some idea,\" insisted Jerry. \"Well, as near as I can tell it went over that way,\" and he pointed to the west. \"It's a terrible lonesome country there.

Professor Harlan, M.

He took me to the water-works at Fair Mount, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the most interesting spots near the city, which are indeed worth seeing. The road led past the House of Correction, where young offenders, who are still capable of being reclaimed, are confined.

The latter protested against the action of the governor, and retired to the convent of Guadalupe, near Pasig. Informed that there was a conspiracy against his life and needing the counsel of some person, or persons, on whom he could rely, Bustamante was well-nigh desperate. His government, as it then stood, lacked the complexity of legality which the presence of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> oidor of royal nomination would have given it. In order to remedy this defect he released Torralba, the guiltiest of the former magistrates, and the man under arrest for the defalcation of 700,000 pesos of the king's revenue. Torralba's crimes had been notorious, and the act of Bustamante in associating himself with a person of the unsavory reputation and the unpopularity of Torralba not only divorced him from whatever popular sympathy he might have had among the residents of the...", "...this morning. \"Francois and I have been looking all about the town before breakfast and we can't even find a bunch of pansies.\" Pansies would be a good offset to forget-me-nots; but as only sweet peas and roses were to be found, Archie scorned to bestow these which grow in such abundance, and so contented himself with a beautiful basket of fruit which we all enjoyed.

The actress he had in mind was Laura Seymour, then appearing at the Haymarket under the management of Buckstone; and this visit proved to be the turning-point in Reade's whole life. Laura Seymour was the daughter of a surgeon at Bath--a man in large practise and with a good income, every penny of which he spent.

The yellow gilliflower is an emblem of a neglected lover.[233] The narcissus[234] is very highly esteemed. Galen says, \"He who has two cakes of bread, let him dispose of <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of them for some flowers of the narcissus; for bread is the food of the body, and the narcissus is the food of the soul.\" Hippocrates, too, gave a similar opinion.[235] The following flowers complete the list of those celebrated as most appropriate to add to the delights of wine:--the jasmine, eglantine, Seville-orange-flower, lily, sweet-basil, wild thyme, buphthalmum, chamomile, nenuphar, lotus, pomegranate-flower, poppy, ketmia, crocus or saffron, safflower, flax, the blossoms...", "...feeling almost wholly deserts you.

Those three years of married life had wrought a very great change in her. She had left Vienna a bright, athletic girl, fond of all sports, a great walker, a splendid horsewoman, sweet, natural, and quite unaffected; yet now, after those three years of a Court, smaller yet far more severe than that of Austria, she had become rebellious, with one desire--to forsake it all...", "...conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life of-never mind-; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.\" The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said: \"From all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one's want of courage under torture, that one's want of money, the other's want of advocacy, and...", "...feared; he desired mee to forsake Paspahegh, and to live with him upon his River, a countrie called Capa Howasicke; he promised to give me corne, venison, or what I wanted to feede us, Hatchets and Copper wee should make him, and none should disturbe us.

Their judgment is swayed by a hundred side-considerations which have nothing to do with art, but happen easily to impress the imagination, or to fit in with the fashion of the hour. The reputation of Mrs. Inchbald's contemporary, Fanny Burney, is a case in point. Every <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> has heard of Fanny Burney's novels, and _Evelina_ is still widely read. Yet it is impossible to doubt that, so far as quality alone is concerned, _Evelina_ deserves to be ranked considerably below _A Simple Story._ But its writer was the familiar friend of the greatest spirits of her age; she was the author of one of the best of diaries; and her work was immediately and immensely popular.

It soon changed to a carnage, in which the victims were all on <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> side. A small number of veterans, headed by Vargas, Mendoza, Tassis, and other chivalrous commanders, routed the undisciplined thousands at a single charge. The rude militia threw away their arms, and fled panic-struck in all directions, at the first sight of their terrible foe. Two Spaniards lost their lives and two thousand Netherlanders. It was natural that these consummate warriors should despise such easily slaughtered victims. A single stroke of the iron flail, and the chaff...", "...the minds of the boys.

But yet there is not a single group of boughs in any <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> tree which does not show exceptions to the rule, and present boughs lower in insertion, and yet steeper in inclination, than their neighbors.

Besides this, the Douglas idea of \"popular sovereignty,\" or, as we now call it, home rule, in the Territories, had won many adherents.

If the _Isis_ opened fire, by all the previous rules of space-combat, she would need to use <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> missile to counter every one of the battleship's, there would still be one left over to destroy the _Isis_--unless she fired a second spread of missiles, which was virtually impossible before she would be hit. It was mockery by the skipper of the battleship. He was doubtless much amused at the idea of toying with this small, insolent vessel. But Bors did not try to match him missile for missile. He said evenly, \"Fire one. Fire two. Fire three. Fire four.\" He stopped at four....", "...\"Do you know, Tom,\" said Mr. Damon, when they were nearing the town, and their search, thus far, had been in vain, \"I think we're going at this the wrong way.\" \"Why, so?\" \"Because Mr. Nestor may have fallen, and been hurt, and have been carried into any one of a dozen houses along the road. In that case we wouldn't see him. We've passed over the most lonely part of the journey and haven't seen him. If the accident occurred near the houses his cries would have brought some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> out to help him. He is well known around here, and, even if he were unconscious and couldn't tell who he was, he could be identified by papers in his pockets. Then his family would be notified by telephone.\" \"Perhaps you are right, Mr. Damon. We may be wasting time this way. What do you suggest?\" asked Tom. \"That we don't delay any longer, but call up the hospitals at once. If he isn't in either of those he must be in some house, and in such condition that his identity cannot...", "...but here once more he who loved darkness rather than light was worsted, and the day triumphed.\" Here we have the same great battle between Light and Darkness. The Darkness proposes to be perpetual; it says, \"There shall be no more day.\" After a long struggle the Light triumphed, the sun returned, and the earth was saved. Among the Tupis of Brazil we have the same story of the battle of light and darkness. They have a myth of Timandonar and Ariconte: \"They were brothers, <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of fair complexion, the other dark. They were constantly struggling, and Ariconte, which means _the stormy or cloudy day_, came out worst.\" Again the myth reappears; this time among the Norsemen: Balder, the bright sun, (Baal?) is slain by the god Hodur, the blind one; to wit, the Darkness. But Vali, Odin's son, slew Hodur, the Darkness, and avenged Balder. Vali is the son of Rind--the rind--the frozen earth. That is to say, Darkness devours the sun; frost rules the earth;...", "...the starlight that filtered between the alder branches chequering her with a faint diaper of light and shade.

Vividly aware that he had no right to watch her, Lawrence stood watching her, though afraid at every breath that she would wake up: it was hard to believe that even in her sleep she could remain insensible of his eyes.

The facts of history may have little influence in developing character, but the noble deeds of our ancestors performed for high purposes are the surest sources for the development of the strong and true emotions that make human character vital instead of inert. Emotions form the battery power of character, and among the emotions that give strength and virility and beauty to character, reverence for the dead who wisely struggled and nobly achieved, is surely <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the most productive of dignified and transforming character. The history of the past is valuable chiefly for the opportunities it gives to be stirred to deep, true enthusiasm for heroism, for honour, for patriotism, for love of freedom, for devotion to duty, and for sublime self-sacrifice for high ideals. Whatever else we may neglect in the training of the young, I trust we shall never fail to fill their hearts with profound reverence for the men and women of the past to whom...", "...by the point _c\"_. Such a system, however, will separate into two conjugate ternary solutions, the composition of which will be represented by the ends of the tie-line passing through the point _c\"_. So long as the total composition of the system lies below the point S, _i.e._ the point of intersection of the line C_c'_ with the boundary curve, two liquid layers will be formed; while all systems having a total composition represented by a point on the line C_c'_, above S, will form only <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> homogeneous solution. From the figure, also, it is evident that as the amount of acetic acid is increased, the relative amounts of the two liquid layers formed differ more and more until at S a limiting position is reached, when the amount of the one liquid layer dwindles to nought, and only one solution remains. The same reasoning can be carried through for different initial amounts of chloroform and water, but it would be fruitless to discuss all the different systems which...", "...now she heard Octavius telling you that my nephew, Champney Googe, is in town--when did he come?\" \"I don't know--Tave didn't say.\" \"I wonder Alice Van Ostend didn't mention that he was coming here before going on the yachting cruise they've planned. I had a letter from her yesterday--I know you'd like to hear it.\" \"Of course I should! It's the first one she has written you, isn't it?--Where is it?\" She spoke with her usual animated interest. \"I have it here.\" She took up <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of several letters in her lap, opened it, turned it over, adjusted her glasses and began to read a paragraph here and there. Aileen listened eagerly. \"I suppose I may as well read it all--Alice wouldn't mind you,\" said Mrs. Champney, and proceeded to give the full contents. It was filled with anticipations of the yachting cruise, of a later visit to Flamsted, of Champney and her friends.

Myself and comrade were soon ready for the attempt, our baggage being confined to a tooth-brush each, our revolvers, and a good-sized piece of soap; the Canton men took little besides their formidable short Chinese swords, and a supply of those huge double-barrelled pistols in which their countrymen delight. Proceeding to <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> of the Shanghae wharves, I engaged a boat, embarked with my men, and in a moment we were proceeding as fast as possible towards the vessel of the enemy. We started in broad daylight; in fact, but a short time after noon. About one o'clock we were close up to the steamer. Sculling against the ebb tide, our boat was slowly worked past the enemy, while, having observed all that could be seen from outside, I made arrangements to board. My plan was to drop alongside the steamer's bow,...", "...with herself. When she ceased to play this fitful soft music, she rose and went to the window which looked toward the lake. She shaded her face with her hands, so she could see the still, pale glory of the night, and the lake, lying in melancholy beauty under the soft shining stars. There was a deep and perfect silence within and without, and it seemed to cast a spell upon Francezka and upon me, so near together, and she all unknowing. And then, feeling rather than seeing some <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> near me, I turned and saw a figure in a black cloak pass me; the same figure that had passed before me in the shadowy streets of Prague--the man I thought to be Gaston Cheverny. He walked straight to the great door of the chateau, and without knocking, opened it as if he were the master of all there. And then, as I stood unable to move, with all my faculties concentrated in my eyes, I saw the door of the yellow saloon open. I saw the real Gaston Cheverny enter. I saw Francezka...", "...of the approach. It is not easy to follow the path which leads from the world of common thought into the world of philosophical reflection. One becomes bewildered and discouraged at the outset. Sometimes, after listening to the directions of guides who disagree among themselves, we are tempted to believe that there can be no certain path to the goal which we have before us. But, whatever the difficulties and uncertainties of our task, a little reflection must show that it is not <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> which has no significance for human life. Men can, it is true, eat and sleep and go through the routine of the day, without giving thought to science or religion or philosophy, but few will defend such an existence. As a matter of fact, those who have attained to some measure of intellectual and moral development do assume, consciously or unconsciously, some rather definite attitude toward life, and this is not independent of their conviction as to what the world is and...", "...a losing hand--wanted to break up the game. That meant a fight. Take you and me. You wouldn't let me out of this if you saw anything more in it. You don't see anything more in it. I don't, either. I'd do exactly the same, for the same reason. Never shove a man farther than you need to make your point. I don't compete with you any more in anything. I keep out of your way and avoid offence. For the rest, I compete. The law is an artificial line. The line is moved now and then. At <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> time it's criminal to lend money at interest and innocent to fight a duel.

So he suddenly called out the <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> word: \"Now!\" Instantly a new sound broke the silence. Bobolink elevated the object he was hold in his hands.

It was all Bobolink's idea. He had brought a little garden pump aboard during the afternoon, with the hose...", "...moon and the stars were the same in his country as in theirs, &c., &c.

Hence art holds a higher rank than philosophy, for only in art has the intellectual intuition objectivity. There is nothing, therefore, higher to the philosopher than art, because this opens before him, as it were, the holy of holies, where that which is separate in nature and history, and which in life and action, as in thought, must ever diverge, burns, as it were, in <span class=\"clocktext\">one</span> flame, in an eternal and original union. From this we see also both the fact and the reason for it, that philosophy, as philosophy, can never be universally valid. Art is that alone to which is given, an absolute objectivity, and it is through this alone that nature, consciously productive, concludes and completes itself within itself.
