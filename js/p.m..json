The barn was on a knoll, so that its floor was almost as high as the roof of the house. Which would have been the best place for the tank: high up on the windmill (which stood on the knoll by the barn), or the basement of the house, or the attic of the house? [Illustration: FIG. 2.

This stopper has a small hole _h_, through which the mercury descends; the size of the outlet _o_ being properly determined with respect to the section of the fall tube _t_, which is sealed to the reservoir instead of being connected to it in the usual manner.

Especial care was taken in fitting the grinding surfaces of the stoppers p and p_{1}, and both of these and the mercury caps above them were made exceptionally long.

He thinks it consists in making a great show, in having great possessions, in doing things which attract a great deal of attention; but _happiness would be strangled, suffocated in such an environment_. The essentials of real happiness are few, simple, and close at hand. Happiness is made up of very simple ingredients. It flees from the complex life. It evades <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and show. The heart would starve amid the greatest luxuries. Simple joys and the treasures of the heart and mind make happiness. Happiness has very little to do with material things. It is a mental state of mind.

One must remember, of course, that in that rigorous and ascetic court high rank connoted no <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> or luxury. Julian had dismissed the thousand hairdressers, the innumerable cooks and eunuchs of his Christian predecessor. It probably brought with it only an increased obligation to live on pulse and to do without such pamperings of the body as fine clothes or warmth or washing.

For instance, the railway to Port Arthur was cut by them near Wa-fang-tien at 11 <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> on May 6. The Russians repaired the line, and by May 10 a further train-load of ammunition was sent over it into Port Arthur.

On the other side of the yard, Barney released the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> windmill clutch. While Johnny watched from the porch, the weight of the heavy slop cauldron slowly turned the big windmill and as the arm adorned by the kettle rotated downward, the cast-iron pot slipped off and fell to the hard-packed ground with a booming clang. \"Well, for the luvva Pete,\" Johnny said in amazement. \"Hey, Barney, time to eat.

The inhabitants turned out and provided _dilus_ (buckets) and ropes, willingly giving the men water. Company after company filed past, each man getting half a canteen full of water. After this halt no more water was obtainable, as the route lay inland, and the men had to rely on their...", "...was back in my field.

There was the usual display of banners and crosses, guards and policemen; there were bands of music and palm-branches. The long march required frequent refreshment, which was offered by the faithful, and it is said that many of the captives and some of the professionally...", "...about the moon. This, together with the heavy swell and the pronounced fall of the barometer, showed that something might be expected. And, sure enough, on Sunday, March 19, we were in a cyclone. By manoeuvring according to the rules for avoiding a cyclone in the southern hemisphere, we at any rate went well clear of one semicircle. About 4 p.m. on Sunday afternoon the barometer was down to 27.56 inches (700 millimetres), the lowest barometer reading I have ever heard of. From noon to 4 <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> there was a calm, with heavy sea. Immediately after a gale sprang up from the north-west, and in the course of a couple of days it slowly moderated to a breeze from the same quarter.

THOMAS CROMWELL.--A man of great power and mark now rises to our notice. Upon the disgrace of Wolsey, a faithful attendant of his named Thomas Cromwell straightway assumed in Henry's regard the place from which the Cardinal had fallen. He was just the opposite of Wolsey in caring nothing for <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and parade. For the space of ten years this wonderful man shaped the policy of Henry's government. What he proposed to himself was the establishment of a royal despotism upon the ruin of every other power in the State. The executioner's axe was constantly wet with the blood of those who stood in his way, or who in any manner incurred his displeasure. It was to the bold suggestions of this man that Henry now listened, when all other means of gratifying his passion had been tried...", "...the result may be indeed be said to have produced a great end. The engine of Savory was used for some years as a machine to raise water. The principle of his engine was just as I have stated, and consisted of two cases and other various parts, and this engine possessed advantages over that of the Marquis of Worcester in sucking up the water as well as forcing. Savory's engine consisted of two steam vessels connected to a boiler by tubes; a suction pipe, or that pipe which leads from a <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> of the present day to the well, and communicating with each of the steam vessels by valves opening upwards; a pipe going from these steam vessels to any required height to which the water is to be raised. The steam vessels were connected to this pipe by other valves, also opening upwards, and by pipes. Over the steam vessels was placed a cistern, which was kept filled with _cold_ water. From this proceeded a pipe with a stopcock. This cistern was termed the condensing cistern, and...", "...force increases as the speed and holds in check the impressed electro-motive force. This acts very perfectly as a governor, and motors operate with notoriously constant speed under variable loads.

II. JOURNEY TO THE BANKS OF THE RHINE Before having himself crowned by the Pope, after the example of Charlemagne, Napoleon was anxious to go to meditate at the tomb of the great Carlovingian Emperor, of whom he regarded himself as the worthy successor. A journey on the banks of the Rhine, a triumphal tour in the famous German cities which the France of the Revolution had been so proud to conquer, seemed to the new sovereign a fitting prologue to the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> of the coronation. Napoleon was desirous of impressing the imaginations of people in his new Empire and in the old Empire of Germany. He wished the trumpets of fame to sound in his honor on both banks of the famous and disputed river. The Empress, who had gone to Aix-la-Chapelle to take the waters, arrived there a few days before her husband. Napoleon wrote to her, August 6, 1804:-- \"MY DEAR: I have been here at Calais since midnight; I am thinking of leaving this evening...", "...they practised, still existed.

This, though not always clearly understood by mere practical men, or by persons superficially informed, is, in fact, among the fundamental principles of mechanical science. (89.)

Besides imparting to this mass the momentum corresponding to the velocity with which it will be moved, it will also have to encounter the resistance due to the preponderance of the weight of the water and pump rods over that of the steam piston. The pressure of steam, therefore, upon the piston at the commencement of the stroke must, in accordance with the mechanical principles just explained, have a greater force...", "...weather.

The only type of steam engine then in existence was the Newcomen beam engine, which had been introduced in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen, also an Englishman.

It was arranged with a vertical steam cylinder located beneath one end of a large pivoted working beam and a vertical plunger-type <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> beneath the other end. Heavy, flat chains were secured to a sector at each end of the working beam and to the engine and pump piston rods in such a way that the rods were always tangent to a circle whose center was at the beam pivot.

I therefore showed my written orders, and after reading them, the General said, \"It is not your fault, but march to Colenso as quickly as possible\"; and he detached Lord Tullibardine to show us the way; I had seen a good deal of him at Springfield. \"The Pontoon bridge is up,\" he added; \"you must use the Boer pont and so ferry across the Tugela.\" So off we went, and got to Colenso at 2 <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> after a very hot march.

By 9 <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> the fog had cleared and all was quiet again. The fire was believed to have originated through a bullet striking the ammunition in the equipment of one of those who still lay out in front of the trenches.

The arterial circulation consists of those channels which convey the blood--supposed pure blood--away from the heart to the different parts of the body, loaded with the life-giving principle of sustenance, invigoration and heat, while the veins or venous circulation conveys to the heart and lungs the impure blood, loaded many times with disease-breeding germs.

Those who have alleged that Luis de Leon came of Jewish stock may have been--apparently were--mistaken; but their mistake is comprehensible, for more than any contemporary Spanish poet--more even than Herrera in his odes--is he saturated with the Jewish spirit.

With the Jewish and Hellenic blend of influence we must rate the Latin influence--that of Horace and of Virgil. The influence of Horace on Luis de Leon has been often noted. It exists no doubt, but has perhaps been exaggerated: why should we suppose that his love of moderation was learnt from Horace and was not partly, at least, temperamental? May not the references to Horace be a characteristic of humanism? An opinion...", "...at sixes and sevens.

If a plunger fitting tightly in a glass cylinder be drawn upward, while the lower end of the tube is under water, the water will rise in the tube (Fig. 30). The common explanation of this is that the water rises because of \"suction.\" The philosophers of the ancient Greeks explained it by saying that \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" and therefore the water rises.

Galileo was applied to for an explanation.

There is good reason to believe that the Christian bishops purposely multiplied sacred rites for the sake of rendering the Jews and pagans more friendly to them.

Mr. Field, and Professor Thomson, who was on board the Agamemnon, were in favour of another trial, and it was decided to make one without delay. The vessels left the Cove of Cork on July 17; but on this occasion there was no public enthusiasm, and even those on board felt as if they were going on another wild goose chase.

The whole proceeding, however, is very slow, and it takes them several days to <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> their fill. No pain or itching is felt, but serious sores are caused if care is not taken in removing them, as the proboscis is liable to break off and remain in the wound. A little tobacco juice is generally applied to make them loosen their hold. They do not cling firmly to the skin by their legs, although each of these has a pair of sharp and fine claws connected with the tips of the member by means of a flexible pedicle.

Occasionally some vision of the past floated through her drowsy brain. She had lived in that residence for over forty years. She had brought up eleven children and two husbands there. She had coddled thirty-five grandchildren there, and given instruction to some half-dozen daughters-in-law. She had known midnights when she could scarcely move in that residence without disturbing somebody asleep. Now she was alone in it. She never left it, except to fetch water from the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> in the Square. She had seen a lot of life, and she was tired.

Wrapped in a mantle of cloth of gold; crowned with the ducal cap; sword by side and spurred with gold, all that remained of the great Doge Foscari lay in state in the hall of the Senate, guarded by four and twenty nobles in scarlet robes to indicate that if the Doge were dead the Signory yet lived. The bier was borne by a picked body of sailors. Pasquale Malipiero, clothed as a simple senator; the officers of State; the clergy; the guilds followed. With solemn <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> the pageant went its way lighted by innumerable tapers along the Merceria and across the Rialto bridge to the Church of the Frari. The sumptuous monument, erected in the choir to his memory, by Ant. Riccio, still testifies to his fame.

The honor of laying the first stone of the new church, the same that is now standing, is attributed to one of the most celebrated of the abbots, John Roussel, more commonly known by the name of _Marcdargent_.[175] He had been elected to the prelacy in 1303; and, fifteen years afterwards, he commenced the structure. He presided over the monastery thirty-seven years, and was buried in the Lady-Chapel of the church, which he had completed as far westward as the transepts. The <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> with which his funeral was conducted, is recorded at length in the _Neustria Pia_; and the same work has also preserved the following inscription, engraved upon his coffin, which describes, with great precision, the progress made by him in the building:-- \"HIC JACET FRATER JOANNES MARCDARGENT ALIAS ROUSSEL, QUONDAM ABBAS ISTIUS MONASTERII, QUI COEPIT AEDIFICARE ISTAM ECCLESIAM DE NOVO; ET FECIT CHORUM ET CAPELLAS, ET PILLIARIA TURRIS, ET MAGNAM PARTEM TURRIS S....", "...interest to the place; For in the silent grave no conversation, No joyful tread of friends, no voice of lovers, No careful father's counsel--nothing's heard, For nothing is, but all oblivion, Dust, and an endless darkness.

In consequence of the panic after Gates' defeat on the 16th of August, 1780, and the surprise and dispersion of Sumter's forces at Fishing creek by Tarleton's cavalry on the 18th following, Colonel McDowell disbanded, for a time, his little army, and he himself retreated over the mountains. This was a dark and doleful period of American history. The British flag floated in triumph over Charleston and Savannah. The troops of Lord Cornwallis, with all the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and circumstance of glory, advanced from the battle-field of Camden to Charlotte, with the fond expectation of soon placing North Carolina under his subjection. Many of the brave had despaired of final success, and the timid, and some of the wealthy, to save their property, had taken \"protection\" under the enemy.

The mercury pumps now in use, whether those of Geissler, Alvergniat, Toepler, or Sprengel, although possessed of considerable advantages, have also serious defects. For instance, Geissler's pump requires a considerable number of taps, that of Alvergniat and Toepler is very fragile in consequence of its complicated system of tubes connected together, and that of Sprengel is only suitable for certain purposes. The new mercury <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> constructed by Messrs.

It has two tubes placed obliquely in respect to its axis, which, when we turn this tap 90 or 180 degrees, are brought opposite one of the three openings in the...", "...on the upper bridge stood the Monarch, attired in full military uniform, with white coat and tight breeches, high top boots, shining silver breastplate and silver helmet, surmounted by an eagle, the dress of the Prussian Guard Regiment so dear to those who portray romantic and kingly roles upon the stage, a figure on whom all eyes were fixed, as splendid as that of Lohengrin, drawn by his fairy swan, coming to rescue the unjustly accused Princess.

Two great acts awaited the attention of this assembly;--both of an interesting and important character, both of national concern. The one was the resignation of Washington; a solemnity which appealed to every feeling of national gratitude and pride, and which would seem to have demanded whatever of <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and dignity and power the United States could display. The other was a legislative act, which was to give peace to the country, by the ratification of the Treaty. Several weeks passed on, and yet the attendance was not much increased.

There can be no doubt that vertical shafts are cheaper to operate than inclines: the length of haul from a given depth is less; much higher rope speed is possible, and thus the haulage hours are less for the same output; the wear and tear on ropes, tracks, or guides is not so great, and pumping is more economical where the Cornish order of <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> is used. On the other hand, with a vertical shaft must be included the cost of operating crosscuts. On mines where the volume of ore does not warrant mechanical haulage, the cost of tramming through the extra distance involved is an expense which outweighs any extra operating outlay in the inclined shaft itself. Even with mechanical haulage in crosscuts, it is doubtful if there is anything in favor of the vertical shaft on this score.

It appears to be advisable to perform the condensation partly in the air pump, instead of altogether in the condenser, as a better vacuum and a superior action of the air <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> valves will thus be obtained. Engines constructed upon this plan may be driven at four times the speed of common engines, whereby an engine of large power may be purchased for a very moderate price, and be capable of being put into a very small compass; while the motion, from being more equable, will be better adapted for most purposes for which a rotary motion is required.

The only water obtainable prior to 1869 (apart from rain-water stored in barrels, etc., by householders) was drawn from the various wells, fed by springs. In January, 1872, owing to a drought, water was sold in the streets by hawkers. This state of affairs resulted in the Corporation arranging to <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> 30,000 gallons of water daily from Seccombe's Well, Khyber Pass Road. The water was stored in a small reservoir, situated on the top of the Domain Hill, the remains of which are still visible. Later, in 1875, the City Council purchased, for L20,000, Western Springs, from which source the city's water supply was obtained for many years. At this period the Council did not embrace the same wide field of activity which it does now; road formation, water and sewerage being the...", "...sir?\" The second officer saluted. The Ensign came to himself instantly. \"Yes, of course. I put back only for an important message,\" he said. \"My man got off, did he?\" \"I think so.\" \"All right. Go ahead.\" Catin, with that rare fortune which sometimes favors the wicked, had chosen precisely the right moment for his ruse. The crew of the submarine were all on deck save those in the engine room, and his quick passage to the vitals of the vessel was unseen. Once in the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> room, he hastily drew from under his coat the bomb placed in his hands at the conference of diplomats, wound its clock-work spring and laid it beside the pumps. There was a strange look on the man's face as he did this--a look at once proud and pitiful. Catin had not sense of treachery or shame. The deed in itself did not lack the dignity of courage, for, with the others, he was planned his own death. And while the others were to die suddenly, ignorant of their peril, Catin...", "...\"There was nobody else to do it,\" said Matilda. \"You're a brick!\" said Norton. \"That's what I said. But is this all, Pink?\" \"It is plenty, Norton.\" \"Plenty for to-day. It won't last for any more. What then?\" \"I don't know,\" said Matilda. \"O Norton, are _you_ going to make the fire?\" Norton showed that such was his intention, and showed besides that he knew very well what he was about. Matilda, after looking on admiringly, ran off to the pump with her kettle. The <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> was at some distance; before she could fill her kettle and come back, Norton overtook her. He quietly assumed the tea-kettle, as a matter of course. \"Oh, thank you, Norton! how good you are,\" Matilda exclaimed. \"It was heavy.\" \"Look here. Do you come here to do this sort of thing all by yourself?\" said Norton. \"I cannot help that,\" said Matilda. \"And I like to do it, too.\" \"You mustn't,\" said Norton. \"Who will, then, Norton?

A silent, shy, peace-loving man, He seemed no fiery partisan To hold his way against the public frown, The ban of Church and State, the fierce mob's hounding down. For while he wrought with strenuous will The work his hands had found to do, He heard the fitful music still Of winds that out of dream-land blew. The din about him could not drown What the strange voices whispered down; Along his task-field weird processions swept, The visionary <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> of stately phantoms stepped: The common air was thick with dreams,-- He told them to the toiling crowd; Such music as the woods and streams Sang in his ear he sang aloud; In still, shut bays, on windy capes, He heard the call of beckoning shapes, And, as the gray old shadows prompted him, To homely moulds of rhyme he shaped their legends grim.

He sacrificed all to that principle; even his ardent wishes to die for Jesus by the hands of the barbarians: for though he breathed after martyrdom, he well...", "...Dog us about like common poachers!

Deinokrates escaped his merited fate by suicide, as did those who had advised that Philopoemen should be put to death, while those who had advised that he should be tortured were themselves reserved for a death of torture by Lykortas. They burned his body and collected the ashes into an urn, not carelessly, but mingling a sort of triumphal <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> with his funeral procession. There one might see men crowned with garlands but weeping at the same time, and leading along his enemies in chains. The urn itself, which was scarcely to be seen for the garlands and ribbons with which it was covered, was carried by Polybius, the son of the Achaean commander-in-chief, accompanied by the noblest of the Achaeans. The soldiers followed in complete armour, with caparisoned horses, not cast down, but yet too sad to feel any pride in their...", "...but the fame he had thirsted for all his life, without in any way injuring the esteemed individual whom he had the honour to call brother-in law. He quite understood about the thousand pounds that had so mysteriously disappeared, and he had learned now for the first time from Susan that her brother, having dissipated every penny of it, had latterly returned and endeavoured to sponge upon her.

Mr. Turvey, having been offered a passage abroad and a little ready money to get drunk with when he landed, communicated to Jabez the whole history of the great gold robbery. A couple of days later Mr. Duck saw his promising brother-in-law safe on board a vessel bound for the colonies, and he then immediately proceeded...", "...need no longer be held in readiness; so normal, semi-peace conditions reigned. They were, however, not destined to enjoy these conditions for long, nor to turn their thoughts towards the completion of Christmas festivities, for at 5 p.m. an urgent message was received by Colonel Bent that the 3rd Brigade, to which the Battalion belonged, was to be ready to march \"as soon as possible.\" It was quite dark when the order came, and though the men were scattered in their billets, at 6.15 <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> the Munsters were in their place in the Brigade, and marching out into the stormy darkness. Behind them the dream of Christmas vanished like so many dreams. Reality took its place, a reality of a road ankle deep in mud, a tearing blizzard of rain and hail, and a black drenching tempest to face with bent heads. For six hours the Battalion marched forward until at Merville a halt was called; and in an empty factory there was rest and shelter for the drenched and weary men....", "...polite reception of the Russians by headless Turks; notwithstanding all these examples would bear us out in our idea of the love of liberty, and the evils of the loss of it. Kings often want liberty, even amidst the multitude of their luxuries. They are not unfrequently the veriest slaves at court, and liege and loyal as we are, we seldom hear of a king eating, drinking, and sleeping as other people do, without envying him so happy an interval from the cares of state, and the painted <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> of palaces. This it is that makes the domestic habits of kings so interesting to every one; and many a time have we crossed field after field to catch a glimpse of royalty, in a plain green chariot on the Brighton road, when we would not have put our heads out of window to see a procession to the House of Lords. Some kings have even gone so far in their love of plain life as to drop the king, which is a very pleasant sort of unkingship. Frederick the Great, at one of his literary...", "...under Arsac.

The seamen exerted themselves for a whole hour without intermission, and the well was again sounded--_eight feet!_ The men did not assert that they would pump no longer; but they too plainly showed their intentions by each resuming in silence his shirt and jacket, which he had taken off at the commencement of his exertions.

The change however was a slow and gradual one. It is with the victory of Towton that the new power of the Monarchy begins, but in the years that immediately followed this victory there was little to promise the triumph of the Crown. The king, Edward the Fourth, was but a boy of nineteen; and decisive as his march upon London proved, he had as yet given few signs of political ability. His luxurious temper showed itself in the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and gaiety of his court, in feast and tourney, or in love-passages with city wives and noble ladies. The work of government, the defence of the new throne against its restless foes, he left as yet to sterner hands.

The Percies had played the chief part in the revolution which gave the crown to the House of Lancaster. Their rivals, the...", "...South America might have such influence on the nature of the lion as to strip him of his mane, reduce his size, and repress his courage; but it appears absolutely impossible that this animal, which inhabits the tropical regions only, and to whom Nature, to all appearance, has shut up every avenue to the north, should pass from the southern part of Asia or Africa into America, those continents being divided towards the south by immense seas. From this circumstance it is probable that the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> is not the lion, deriving its origin from those of the old continent and since degenerated, but that he is an animal peculiar to America, like other animals found on the new continent. When the Europeans first discovered America, the quadrupeds, birds, fishes, insects, plants, and almost every thing appeared to be different from what they had seen before. Of this new world it was therefore necessary to denominate the principal objects. As the names given by the natives were for...", "...215. Metallic vacuum cleaner] [Illustration: Fig. 216.

I would advise E. W. P. to attach his pump to the well tube direct, and he will gain three times the amount of water that he now gets. By having his pump attached to the well tube directly, the working of the pump creates a vacuum, and the atmospheric pressure on the earth's surface violently forces the liquid to fill the vacuum thus formed, thereby giving a much greater amount of water than can be otherwise obtained.

ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS OF THE TEUTONIC SCHOOL AFTER THE TENTH CENTURY. _German MSS. of the XIth century._ Though in the main the eleventh century was a period of artistic decadence, mentioned above as having succeeded the brilliant Carolingian period (see page 78), yet we find that in certain places in Germany there was a very distinct beginning of artistic revival, especially in the illumination of manuscripts, about the middle of the...", "...placed my hands beneath the spout, and said, 'Pump, Jenny,' and Jenny incontinently, without laying down the towel, pumped with one hand, and I washed and cooled my heated hands. And, when my hands were washed and cooled, I took off my neckcloth, and unbuttoning my shirt collar, I placed my head beneath the spout of the pump, and I said unto Jenny: 'Now, Jenny, lay down the towel, and pump for your life.' Thereupon Jenny, placing the towel on a linen horse, took the handle of the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> with both hands and pumped over my head as handmaid had never pumped before; so that the water poured in torrents from my head, my face, and my hair down upon the brick floor.

Marie Antoinette had advanced a few steps. Not a trace of grief and disquiet was longer to be seen in her face. Her figure was erect, her glance was proud and full of fire, and the expression of her countenance noble and majestic. She was still the queen, though not surrounded by the solemn <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> which attended the public audiences at Versailles. She did not stand on the purple-carpeted step of the throne, no gold-embroidered canopy arched over her, no crowd of brilliant courtiers surrounded her, only her husband stood near her; her son clung to her side, and his teacher, the Abbe Davout, timidly withdrew into the background. These formed all her suite. But Marie Antoinette did not need external pomp to be a queen; she was so in her bearing, in every look, in every...", "...laying S.S.E. or thereabout from _Mosa_.

Presently this desire became known, and Braddock, hearing of the young Virginian's past experience, offered him a place on his staff with the rank of colonel where he would be subject only to the orders of the general, and could serve as a volunteer. He therefore accepted at once, and threw himself into his new duties with hearty good-will. Every step now was full of instruction.

This old man, rich, childless, and miserable, had had a romantic history. When very young he had fallen violently in love with his cousin, the Princess Louise of Orleans. He was permitted to marry her, but only on condition that they should part at the church door,--she to enter a convent for two years, he to serve for the same time in the French army. They were married with all <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and ceremony; but that night the ardent bridegroom scaled the walls of the convent and bore away his bride. Unhappily their mutual attachment did not last long. \"It went out,\" says a contemporary memoir-writer, \"like a fire of straw.\"[1] At last hatred took the place of love, and the quarrels between the Prince de Conde (as the Duc de Bourbon was then called) and his wife were among the scandals of the court of Louis XVI., and helped to bring odium on the royal family....", "...and running expenses. On Eastern farms, however, where diversified farming is the business, this expense may be divided among the different lines of work. Where live-stock is kept, it is necessary to have a good, reliable water supply for the animals.

Also the same engine that does the pumping may be used for other work in connection with the farm, so that the irrigation <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> engine, instead of lying idle ten or eleven months in the year, may be utilized to advantage and made to earn its keep. Well-water contains many impurities. For this reason, it is likely to be valuable for crop growing purposes in a wider sense than merely to supply moisture.

Therefore many species of game are still relatively abundant. Of the eight species that originally lived in Tamaulipas, the mule deer, brocket, and black bear never have been abundant there and now are in danger of extirpation. The pronghorn was also rare in the state and now has been extirpated as it has been in many other parts of Mexico. The white-tailed deer, javalin, jaguar, and <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> are still abundant in suitable habitats. The white-tailed deer is found almost everywhere in the state; in some areas it damages cornfields, and for this reason is killed by natives who eat the meat and sell the skins. The price of skins is low; in 1959 at Ciudad Mante tanners paid natives less than one dollar (10.00 Mexican pesos) per hide. Some idea of the abundance of deer in Tamaulipas is provided by our having found in one tanner's shop, in 1959 at Ciudad Mante, about 500...", "...verse.

We could illustrate the remark by a variety of examples, but, in our present sketch, we will only advert to one class as a specimen--that class which is so aptly and expressively designated as 'shabby-genteel.' Now, shabby people, God knows, may be found anywhere, and genteel people are not articles of greater scarcity out of London than in it; but this compound of the two--this shabby-gentility--is as purely local as the statue at Charing-cross, or the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> at Aldgate. It is worthy of remark, too, that only men are shabby-genteel; a woman is always either dirty and slovenly in the extreme, or neat and respectable, however poverty-stricken in appearance.

Aretino, who had particular reasons for desiring to appear before the obdurate Cosimo in all the <span class=\"clocktext\">p.m.</span> and opulence of his later years, was obviously wounded that Titian, true to his genius, and to his method at this moment, should have made the keynote of his masterpiece a dignified simplicity.

The time for rehearsal had passed. We were about to enter upon the real stage of action, and do our part in the mighty tragedy then enacting. The camp was broken. Tents were struck.
