Every general question was to be decided, not by a majority of persons, but by a majority of committee, and as eleven votes would make a majority in a committee, and four committees a majority of seven, M.

As the well focused optical image is transferred to a sensitized surface, reproducing the picture, so were those scenes fixed in...", "...which are found there. Though the Deerfield meadows afford some of the finest farms in New England, the tillage land will not compare in extent with that along the Western road; but in every other respect the resources and latent wealth of the Tunnel route are infinitely superior to those of the Western line. Six years ago, and _twenty-three years after the Western road was opened_, the population lying west of Springfield within ten miles of the Western road on a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> miles, was 42,050; while that west of Greenfield, within ten miles of the Tunnel line on the same distance, without any railroad at all was 32,146. According to the average rate of increase, the population along the Tunnel line, would be more than doubled in twenty-three years. Were the mountain barrier pierced, and communication opened with the West, and the magnificent water power of the Deerfield made available, who doubts that this population would be increased fourfold...", "...All good election laws provide that a definite number of ballots shall be officially issued to each precinct; that the number of those deposited in the ballot box, the number spoiled and those unused shall not only tally with the number received, but the unused ones must be counted, sealed, labelled and returned with the certificate recording the count. This is the law of Iowa; but the report of the investigation, as given to the press, shows that in thirty-five counties out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> investigated no tally list was used and there was nothing by which to check in order to determine the correctness of the number on the certificate. In many cases no unused ballots were returned. The poll lists did not tally with the number of votes and even a recount could not reveal whether fraud or carelessness had led to irregularity.

The narrative of his adventures during this period of suspense and distress exhibits striking instances of hair-breadth escapes on the part of the king, and of unshaken fidelity on that of his adherents. During the night after the battle he found himself in the midst of the Scottish cavalry, a body of men too numerous to elude pursuit, and too dispirited to repel an enemy.

It is a large stone edifice of block coral, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet long and seventy-eight wide, and was one of the first objects we saw after passing Diamond Head. It was commenced in 1838, and was five years in building, at a cost of about thirty thousand dollars.

Never did a commercial company show itself so little mercenary; never was a sovereign more magnanimous and unselfish.

When these appear in the twelfth century the Provencal dialects appear to have the start of French proper. Whether the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> prose sermons of St. Bernard which exist were written by him in French, or were written in Latin and translated, is a disputed point. The most reasonable opinion seems to be that they were translated, but it is uncertain whether at the beginning of the thirteenth or the middle of the twelfth century. However this may be, the question of written French sermons in the twelfth century does not depend on that of St. Bernard's authorship.

The total American loss was fourteen killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> wounded. The Spaniards had 350 killed and over 900 wounded. On August 5 the Spaniards again attacked the American outworks. The trenches were occupied by a battalion each of the 14th and 23rd regulars and Nebraska volunteers, the latter holding the extreme right and a company of regulars the extreme left. They returned the Spanish fire and the battle lasted for a half an hour. Three Americans were killed, and eleven wounded, four of them seriously.

The poor man's mind, never very firmly set in its place, had been thrown completely off its balance, and throughout the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years of his life he was subject to frequent intervals of mental aberration.

On the deck sat a young man and a young woman. The young woman carried, in a little bag hung round her neck, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand rubles in bills, and she and her companion carried pistols in their pockets for use in case of need. Their passports declared that the young woman belonged to the noble class, and was the widow of a college assessor, her name being Maria Solontseva, while the young man was a Pole, Kasimir Bodlevski.

In order to find an account of the Javanese literature in English, we have to go back more than half a century to the works of Raffles and...", "...Of these Sologub has attained the highest reputation. Rich as Russia has become in the short story, Anton Chekhov still stands out as the supreme master, one of the greatest short-story writers of the world. He was born in Taganarok, in the Ukraine, in 1860, the son of a peasant serf who succeeded in buying his freedom. Anton Chekhov studied medicine, but devoted himself largely to writing, in which, he acknowledged, his scientific training was of great service. Though he lived only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years, dying of tuberculosis in 1904, his collected works consist of sixteen fair-sized volumes of short stories, and several dramas besides. A few volumes of his works have already appeared in English translation. Critics, among them Tolstoy, have often compared Chekhov to Maupassant. I find it hard to discover the resemblance. Maupassant holds a supreme position as a short-story writer; so does Chekhov. But there, it seems to me, the likeness ends. The chill wind that...", "...that lay between him and the hut.

In 1776, the British vessels captured by the private armed vessels alone, amounted to the great number of three hundred and forty-two, of which <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> were retaken, eighteen released, and five burned. In the following year, 1777, the success of our privateers was still greater. Vessels were captured to the amount of four hundred and twenty-one.

England could afford no aid to her colonies, but thirty-two merchant vessels and frigates had been impressed into the service, some of them carrying as many as <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> cannon. Artisans, sailors, soldiers, clerks, all classes had volunteered as fighters, to the number of twenty-five hundred men; but there was one thing lacking,--they had no pilot who knew the St. Lawrence. Full of confidence born of inexperience, the fleet set sail on the 9th of August, commanded again by Phips.

On the 21st of March, 1743, Captain Richard Dundas, commander of the frigate _Arethusa_, carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns and 250 men, sailed from Deptford with that vessel in perfect order and condition, and bound for Leith. The ship was one of the finest in the service, and the commander a man of great energy and intelligence. Mr Charles Gordon, superintendent of his Majesty's dockyard at Deptford, a young officer of distinguished ability and exemplary character, was one of the passengers. No incident worthy of notice occurred until they reached St Abb's Head, when they were overtaken...", "...Mulika Zumanee had become alarmed, and it was presented by another and less dangerous person. A few days after, however, the Queen was constrained to allow her fair attendant to attend the King, and receive from him formal proposals of marriage, which she accepted. She was handsome and generous; but there was no discrimination in her bounty, and she is said to have received from the King nearly two millions of money out of the reserved treasury for pin-money alone. Of this she saved <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> lacs of rupees. The King never touched this money, and it formed, in a separate apartment, the greater part of the seventy lacs found in his reserved treasury on his death, out of the ten krores or ten millions sterling, which he found there when he ascended the throne in 1827. She is said to have been the only one of his wives who ever had any real affection for the King. She was haughty and imperious in her temper; and the only female, who had any influence over her, was...", "...for they were skilled in the use of the latter, but the doctor did not take kindly to this suggestion either.

It was a day of much excitement when they arrived, interest in the mountain lion being almost entirely eclipsed. Then the work of putting together the parts of the novel aeroplane began. Perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> boys never before worked so industriously. There was little use of expecting them to do much of anything else during the period and consequently Dr. Byrd wisely suspended temporarily the ordinary routine of the school.

As soon as Frederic had retired a considerable distance from Dresden, he returned, and bombarded it. But he did not succeed in taking it, and was forced to retreat to Silesia. It was there his good fortune to gain a victory over the Austrians, and prevent their junction with the Russians. At Torgau, he again defeated an army of sixty-four thousand of the enemy, with a force of only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand. This closed the campaign, and the position of the parties was nearly the same as at the commencement of it. The heart of Frederic was now ulcerated with bitterness in view of the perseverance of his enemies, who were resolved to crush him. He should, however, have remembered that he had provoked their implacable resentment, by the commission of a great crime. Although Frederic, by rare heroism, had maintained his ground, still his resources were now nearly...", "...and feeling wonderfully well. Sometimes I am astonished myself what one can stand.\" Early in October, 1914, the Germans came closer and closer to Warsaw. At the end of it they were in the south, within twenty miles of the old Polish capital--at Grojec.

These, however--all of them made up of tried Siberian troops--fought heroically for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> hours, especially around the strongly fortified little town of Blonie, about ten miles west of Warsaw. The commander in chief of all the Russian armies, Grand Duke Nicholas, had retired with his staff to Grodno, and Warsaw expected as confidently a German occupation as the Germans themselves. But suddenly the Russians, who up to that time seem to have underestimated the strength of the Germans, awoke to the desperate needs of the situation.

Being obviously derived in part from the word stauros, which primarily signified a stake or pale which was a single piece of wood and had no cross-bar, _sustauroo_ evidently meant affixion to such a stake or pale. Anyhow there is nothing whatever either in the derivation of the word, or in the context in either of the five instances in which it occurs, to show that what is referred to is affixion to something that was cross-shaped. The word _stauroo_ occurs, as has been said, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> times; and of the four words in question by far the most frequently. The meaning of this word is therefore of special importance. It is consequently most significant to find, as we do upon due investigation, that wherever it occurs in the pre-Christian classics it is used as meaning to impalisade, or stake, or affix to a pale or stake; and has reference, not to crosses, but to single pieces of wood.[5] It therefore seems tolerably clear (1) that the sacred writings...", "...come forth immediately and they shall be discharged.\" Captain Tosier had cause to be proud of his success, as the Spanish authorities had never before been known to deliver any British prisoners.

There were hundreds of trails leading through the forests from town to town and it would be but a matter of days or even hours for the enemy to occupy these positions and then strike at Beresnik, thus cutting off not only our forces at Shenkursk but those at Toulgas far down the Dvina as well.

After a break-neck journey of one hundred and sixty miles, during which he ate but one meal, Boone finally arrived at the big fort on June 20th. The settlers were thus given ample time for preparation, as the long siege did not begin until September 7th. The fort was invested by a powerful force flying the English flag--four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> savages gaudy in the vermilion and ochre of their war-paint, and eleven Frenchmen, the whole being commanded by the French-Canadian, Captain Dagniaux de Quindre, and the great Indian Chief, Black-fish who had adopted Boone as a son. In the effort to gain his end de Quindre resorted to a dishonorable stratagem, by which he hoped to outwit the settlers and capture the fort with but slight loss. \"They formed a scheme to deceive us,\" says Boone, \"declaring it was their orders,...", "...is _i_ 3/3 _c_ 1/1 _pm_ 4/3 _m_ 3/3, total 42. In some of the extinct Perissodactyles such as _Lophiodon_[160], the dentition is brachydont and bilophodont, the grinding teeth in general resembling the posterior upper molars of the Tapir. The same type of brachydont tooth is seen in _Palaeotherium_ but the transverse ridges are crescentic instead of straight, and are separated from one another by shallow valleys without cement. Some of the Palaeotheridae have the regular series of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> teeth. A complete series of forms is known showing how from the simple brachydont teeth of the Palaeotheridae, were derived the complicated hypsodont teeth of the Equidae. The increase in depth of the tooth was accompanied by increase in the depth and complexity of the enamel infoldings, and of the cement filling them. Both upper and lower grinding teeth of the Equidae are much complicated by enamel infoldings, but their derivation from the bilophodont type can still be...", "...aside. [510] _i.e._ yawned.

The dirigible balloon has one signal advantage over the aeroplane in the matter of bomb-dropping. It can both carry bigger bombs and remain stationary and hover while it drops them. With the aeroplane, however, there is necessarily great difficulty in hitting underlying objects, on account of the high speed at which it must travel to sustain flight. In order to float, an aeroplane must travel about thirty miles an hour. Even at this speed, it is moving forward at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet a second, and as a bomb travels at the same speed as the aeroplane, except for the retardation of the air, it moves forward forty-four feet the first second, while dropping sixteen feet. The next second the bomb falls sixty-four feet and moves forward forty-four feet, and so on. Sixty miles an hour is a moderate speed for an aeroplane, however, and at that speed the bomb travels forward eighty-eight feet per second when it is dropped, so that, during the first second,...", "...sky was cleared, the time for compromise was gone, the armed hosts stood face to face over the chasm of a broken Union and the clash of arms was at hand.\" And let it be remembered that when Brown had told Douglass the details of his proposed invasion at Harper's Ferry, Douglass begged him to abandon his plans and assured him that they would end, as they did, in untold disaster. The chief authors who have written concerning John Brown and his invasion were not in Virginia during the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> days intervening between the raid and his execution. They were destitute of any personal knowledge of the facts. They were bitter enemies of the South and most intense admirers of the intrepid man executed at Charlestown. Their narratives are replete with errors and contain much romance. They are, generally, saturated with misrepresentation of the Virginia people and are burdened with eulogistic apologies for Brown's conduct in Virginia.

But, though a gambler, she had always so far paid up. Only, this time the stakes were the heaviest a woman can put down. It was her last throw; and she knew it. So long as a woman believed in her attraction, there was hope, even when the curtain fell on a love-affair! But for Leila the lamp of belief had suddenly gone out, and when this next curtain dropped she felt that she must sit in the dark until old age made her indifferent. And between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> and real old age a gulf is fixed. This was the first time a man had tired of her. Why! he had been tired before he began, or so she felt. In one swift moment as of a drowning person, she saw again all the passages of their companionship, knew with certainty that it had never been a genuine flame. Shame ran, consuming, in her veins. She buried her face in the cushions. This girl had possessed his real heart all the time. With a laugh she thought: 'I put my money on the wrong...", "...\"that a man will not believe in his own favour.\" Pope had been flattered till he thought himself one of the moving powers in the system of life. When he talked of laying down his pen, those who sat round him entreated and implored; and self-love did not suffer him to suspect that they went away and laughed. The following year deprived him of Gay, a man whom he had known early, and whom he seemed to love with more tenderness than any other of his literary friends. Pope was now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years old, an age at which the mind begins less easily to admit new confidence, and the will to grow less flexible, and when, therefore, the departure of an old friend is very acutely felt. In the next year (1733) he lost his mother, not by an unexpected death, for she had lasted to the age of ninety-three. But she did not die unlamented. The filial piety of Pope was in the highest degree amiable and exemplary. His parents had the happiness of living till he was at the...", "...square inches would that be, Frank?\" \"Well,\" said Frank, \"a foot is twelve inches long, and if it is square it is twelve inches wide, too.\" \"Then,\" said Uncle Robert, \"if you call them rows of twelve square inches, how many rows would there be?\" \"Why, twelve,\" said Donald. \"And so it would be--\" \"One hundred forty-four,\" said Frank. \"Then,\" said Uncle Robert, \"if there are one hundred forty-four square inches in one foot, how many in one thousand feet?\" \"One hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand,\" said Frank, after a moment's thought. \"But the rain-gauge says that an inch and a half of rain has fallen,\" said Uncle Robert, \"and when an inch is as deep as it is long and broad, it is called a cubic inch.

Of course it was only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years ago that they had been taken from them by their conquerors in the Franco-German war. We knew too that, ever since, they had been longing for revenge, longing to win back what they felt to be part of their own country. Naturally we sympathised with the French in this, and tears came to our eyes, and sobs to our throats, when we read how old Frenchmen who had been through the Franco-German war, welcomed the soldiers with wild and tumultuous joy. Nevertheless we knew...", "...Do events point in that direction? Or do they rather point in the direction that the work, now being realized there as demanding immediate attention, and alone possible and practicable, is the completion of the capitalist revolution, first of all?

He is said to have been reserved and stern in his manners. After his fall, the Indians became anxious to secure peace, convinced that their cause was hopeless.

Then there is \"the best harbour in the world\", where there were friendly natives, and where the ships were refitted, the duration of the stay being given as thirty-seven days in the first, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> days in the second voyage; evidently the same incident, serving for the imaginary as well as for the real voyage. This \"best harbour in the world\" was, according to Las Casas, the Gulf of Cariaco, near Cumana, where Hojeda refitted.

During the long contest, extending through <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> ballots, their votes were scattered among many candidates of different factions, while the Republicans maintained an almost unbroken steadiness of party discipline.

In fact the chiefs had to pay the tax somehow, and it is not surprising that they took steps to oblige their sacopes to pay.

Sir James Yeo of the \"Southampton,\" which was to be sent to England by the first conveyance. As soon as Captain Porter got this message, he knew that the pretended English ships were not the \"Acasta\" and \"Morgiana\" at all, but the \"Constitution\" and the \"Hornet,\" and that the letter from Captain Kerr to Sir James Yeo was...", "...Chechevinski informed the police that the serf girl Natalia Pavlovna (Natasha) had disappeared without leaving a trace, which the housekeeper now announced, as the three days' limit had elapsed. At that same hour the little ship of a certain Finnish captain was gliding down the Gulf of Bothnia. The Finn stood at the helm and his young son handled the sails. On the deck sat a young man and a young woman. The young woman carried, in a little bag hung round her neck, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand rubles in bills, and she and her companion carried pistols in their pockets for use in case of need. Their passports declared that the young woman belonged to the noble class, and was the widow of a college assessor, her name being Maria Solontseva, while the young man was a Pole, Kasimir Bodlevski. The little ship was crossing the Gulf of Bothnia toward the coast of Sweden.

Among the mitres were two for the boy-bishop's use on St. Nicholas Day. There were thirty-seven magnificent copes, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> others, and thirty-four specially fine chasubles. The inventory of 1402 supplies some curious information as to the manner in which the numerous and costly vestments were arranged when not in use. In the treasury, on the west, stood a wardrobe, _armariolum_, in which were twenty-four _perticae_, pegs, or rods, or frames, from which the copes and chasubles could be suspended, one _pertica_ holding from three to six copes. The vestments were arranged according to colour....", "...pay.

Cornwallis permitted his withdrawal, and he was taken to Washington's headquarters. Upon alighting, with a serene countenance he related to the officers who stood around him what had been the effect of their batteries, and how much his mansion had suffered from the first shot. A red-hot ball from a French battery set fire to the Charon, a British <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> gun-ship, and two or three smaller vessels, which were consumed in the night. They were enrobed in fire, which ran like lightning over the rigging and to the tops of the masts. A second parallel was completed, and batteries erected within three hundred yards of the enemy's works.

It was full when you went out?\" he said. \"Yes, sir. Two cartridges gone. You'll find one bullet in yonder deer.\" The corporal, for no particular reason, jerked a cartridge into the chamber, and then snapped it out. \"You use nicked bullets?\" Tomlinson did not, as everybody noticed, appear exactly pleased. In fact, it was not difficult to fancy that he was a trifle embarrassed. It is a little easier to bring down a deer with a bullet that will split up into a...", "...public character. The king, who was sincere at that time in his enmity to the French, called the English the saviours of Italy, and of his dominions in particular. He paid the most flattering attentions to Nelson, made him dine with him, and seated him at his right hand. Having accomplished this mission, Nelson received orders to join Commodore Linzee at Tunis. On the way, five sail of the enemy were discovered off the coast of Sardinia, and he chased them. They proved to be three <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> gun frigates, with a corvette of twenty-four and a brig of twelve. The AGAMEMNON had only 345 men at quarters, having landed part of her crew at Toulon, and others being absent in prizes. He came near enough one of the frigates to engage her, but at great disadvantage, the Frenchman manoeuvring well and sailing greatly better.

Among these Apaches, our companions, were two Comanches, who, fifteen years before, had witnessed the death of the celebrated Overton.

Some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years ago, a Spanish trader had settled among a tribe of the Tonquewas[14], at the foot of the Green Mountains. He had taken an Indian squaw, and was living there very comfortably, paying no taxes, but occasionally levying some, under the shape of black mail, upon the settlements of the province of Santa Fe. In one excursion, however, he was taken and hung, an event soon forgotten both by Spaniards and Tonquewas. He had left behind him, besides a child and a squaw, property...", "...forces, a full description of the country in front.

This promised Cuban aid did not, however, materialize, the Cubans, who had been beaten back by the Spaniards the day before, not appearing on the firing-line until the fight was over. General Young had in his immediate command a squadron of the First Regular Cavalry, two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> strong, under the command of Major Bell, and a squadron of the Tenth Regular Cavalry, two hundred and twenty strong, under the command of Major Norvell. He also had two Hotchkiss mountain guns, under Captain Watson of the Tenth. He started at a quarter before six in the morning, accompanied by Captain A. L. Mills, as aide. It was at half-past seven that Captain Mills, with a patrol of two men in advance, discovered the Spaniards as they lay across where the two roads came...", "...brig.

He gave her two five-dollar gold pieces, and, to his amazement, saw her hand them over immediately, one to a little girl and one to a boy, who had evidently come to get the money--not for her use at all. A cook in my own family asked for the wages due him, which he had been saving for some time; he received <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> dollars, and gave the whole amount at once to his father-in-law, who had come from another island on purpose to get this money.

These tremendous climatic changes succeed each other much more rapidly than do the variations of our seasons. On Mercury the interval between midsummer and midwinter is only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> days, while the whole year is only eighty-eight days. Such rapid variations in solar heat must in themselves exercise a profound effect on the habitability of Mercury.

General Nogi's force had marched up from Port Arthur, but General Kawamura's was a new army formed of special reservists and now put in the field for the first time. The Russians occupied a front <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> miles in extent and from five to six miles in depth. They did not know, apparently, that General Kawamura's army had joined Oyama's forces, nor did they know where Nogi's army was operating.

A more distinguished social hygienist, Professor Max Gruber, of Munich, who took a leading part in organising that marvellous Exposition of Hygiene at Dresden which has been Germany's greatest service to real civilisation in recent years, lately set forth an identical opinion. The war, he declares, was inevitable and unavoidable, and Germany was responsible for it, not, he hastens to add, in any moral sense, but in a biological sense, because in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years Germans have increased in numbers from forty millions to eighty millions. The war was, therefore, a \"biological necessity.\" If we survey the belligerent nations in the war we may say that those which took the initiative in drawing it on, or at all events were most prepared to welcome it, were Russia, Austria, Germany, and Serbia. We may also note that these include nearly all the nations in Europe with a high birth-rate. We may further note that they are all nations...", "...the germ may be, but the germ has to have the right kind of soil to take root in and the right kind of culture afterward. It is a rare thing that an invention, either of commercial or scientific importance, ever comes to perfection without hard work--midnight oil and daylight toil; and it is rarely, if ever, that a discovery or an invention based upon a discovery does not have, sooner or later, a practical use, although we sometimes have to wait centuries to find it put. We had to wait <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years after the galvanic battery was discovered before it became a useful servant of man. It was fifty years or more after the discovery by Faraday of magneto-electricity before it found a useful application beyond that of a mere toy, but now it is one of the most useful servants we have, as shown in its wonderful development in electric lighting and electric railroads, to say nothing of its heating qualities and the useful purpose it serves in driving machinery.

Mr. McCarthy at last rose, and in a few moderate sentences expressed his opinion that there was no use in continuing a discussion that must be barren of anything but reproach, bitterness, and indignity, and he would therefore suggest that those who were of the same mind should withdraw.

It was Berto who gave him the name of Mille-lire to signify that his value far exceeds his price. He has a cart to match and can take four people, but I think they must be rather small people.

General Macpherson had found Mahomed Jan--one of the principal leaders of the Afghans--with 10,000 men, near Chardeh. A fight ensued. The guns shelled the enemy, but the water courses prevented the cavalry with Macpherson acting; and Mahomed Jan, moving across the hills, placed himself between Macpherson and Cabul. Shortly afterwards General Massy--who had with him three troops of the 9th Lancers, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> men of the 14th Bengal Lancers, with four guns under Major Smith-Wyndham--came in sight of a portion of Mahomed Jan's force. It was clear that these had, in some way, interposed themselves between the little force and Macpherson's column; and Massy supposed that they were a party of fugitives, flying before the force of Macpherson or Baker. As they came streaming down the hill, he got his guns into action. After a few shells had been fired, the enemy advanced in full...", "...could perceive anything to excite his mirth in the circumstance of a fellow-creature's being forced out of his bed at such an hour! After exhibiting many contortions of the mouth, produced by a decent desire to maintain a gravity suitable to the occasion, he, at length, burst into a loud laugh; and exclaiming (with a want of feeling I shall never entirely forget) \"Well, I wish you joy of your journey--_you must be UP at four!_\"--away he went. It may be asked why I did not forfeit my <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> shillings, and thus escape the calamity. No; the laugh would have been too much against me: so, resolving to put a bold face on the matter, I--I will not say I walked--positively _swaggered_ about the streets of Bristol, for an hour or two, with all the self-importance of one who has already performed some extraordinary exploit, and is conscious that the wondering gaze of the multitude is directed towards him. Being condemned to the miseries, it was but fair that I should...", "...The railroads of this Commonwealth are prohibited by law from making stock dividends, and yet here stock dividends are allowed to such extent as the parties think proper. One of the greatest impositions ever practised upon the public, from which the people of this Commonwealth now suffer, is the watered stock of the railroads between Albany and Chicago. The amount of stock in these roads issued without any equivalent, upon which our traffic is now taxed, is variously estimated at from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> millions to one hundred and five millions. The annual tax levied is from three millions to six millions, of which we pay a large share. The majority bill provides for just such a watering of stock, to the extent of perhaps ten millions, according to the appraisal by the parties in interest. We believe this to be all wrong, and should not be sanctioned by the Commonwealth. _Second._--We utterly dissent from the opinion of the majority in allowing the Boston and Lowell...", "...to eat at least one loaf a week apiece, and when they do, it will mean that the world's wheat crop must be increased ten per cent.

Now that the world has become so small that a cablegram flashes completely around it in twelve minutes; now that there are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> nations united by The Hague Conferences and fifty-eight by the Postal Union; now that war has grown to be so expensive that one cannon-shot costs as much as a college education and one battleship as much as a first-class University,--it is quite probable that the march of co-operation will continue until there is a Congress, and a central headquarters and a Tribunal, which will represent nothing less than an international fellowship of the wheat.

The President suggested the importance of taking measures of prevention, in his message to Congress in December, 1814, and, after the signing of the treaty of peace with England, despatched two squadrons to the Mediterranean, under Decatur and Bainbridge, both now commodores. The former captured, in June, an Algerine frigate of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns and a brig of twenty-two. He then sailed for Algiers. The American navy had earned an enviable distinction in the war with England, and the sight of our gallant fleet inspired the Dey with a salutary terror. He consented to the terms imposed by Decatur, which were to give up all captured men and property, to pay six million dollars for previous exactions, and to exempt our commerce from tribute for all time to come.

His body was removed to Winwick, and there buried in the family chapel. Colonel Legh, who was only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years of age at the time of his death, had never married; having no legitimate issue, and his only brother having predeceased him, he bequeathed Lyme and the other possessions of the family, with the barony of Newton, to his eldest (natural) son, Thomas Legh, for life, with remainder to his issue in tail male, and on failure with like remainder to his second natural son, William Legh.

He was now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years of age, in the prime of his strength and the fulness of his fame,--a prince of the empire, chancellor and prime minister to the Emperor Francis. On his shoulders were imposed the burdens of the State. He ruled with delegated powers indeed, but absolutely.

He of course submitted all important documents to the emperor, and requested instructions; but all this was...", "...self-control slipping, slipping.... \"Get me some food,\" said the German suddenly. \"We have hardly had one decent meal since your dogs of soldiers began running.

I hate you all, for did you not kill my own father, when your soldiers overran France <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years ago!

He leant out of the window, and called to his servant and another man, who were seated on the doorstep outside. \"Tie this fighting cock up with something,\" he ordered, \"and go to see if there is anyone else in the house.\" An unarmed schoolmaster is no even match for two armed and burly Germans.

We soon arrived at the border of the cataract, which announced itself with frightful roarings. It is formed by the river Niagara, which takes its rise in Lake Erie, and falls into Lake Ontario. Its perpendicular height is one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet. From Lake Erie to the Falls, the river flows with a rapid inclination; and at the leap it is less a river than a sea whose torrents crush each other in the yawning mouth of an abyss. The cataract is divided into two branches, and bends like a horse-shoe. Between the two falls there is an island, hollow underneath, and which hangs with all its trees over the chaos of the waves. The mass of the river which rushes towards the north, assumes the form of a vast cylinder,...", "...each, and fifteen hundred tons in the whole.

Adopting the language of \"Frazer's Key,\" Dr. M'Leod says, \"These witnesses differ as much from their cotemporaries, the one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand sealed ones, (Rev. vii. 4,) as Elijah differed from the seven thousand in Israel in his time.\" The attempt is made to prove this assertion by the following plausible argument:--\"God is never for a moment without a people upon earth.\" This is true,--\"And the visible church is an indestructible society.\" Is this assertion true?

Observing that the river was calm and free from rapids, and desirous of saving the people from as much labour as circumstances would offer, the steel boat sections were brought up to the bank, and Mr. Jephson, whose company had special charge of the _Advance_, commenced to fit the sections together. In an hour the forty-four burdens, which the vessel formed, had been attached together and fitted to their respective places and launched. As the boat weighed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> loads and had a capacity of fifty loads, and at least ten sick, we could then release ninety-eight people from the fatigue of bearing loads and carrying Lieutenant Stairs, who was still very ill.

The Indians agreed to deliver the packets, and one of the messages, carried by an American trader, finally reached Boston by way of China in February, 1807, some six months after Lewis himself had returned to the East. On March 24, 1806, they started back on their long route of four thousand one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> miles to St. Louis. Searching for fish, they found the Multonah or Willamette River, and Lewis wrote that the valley of this stream would furnish the only desirable place of settlement west of the Rocky Mountains. Here he found rich prairies, plenty of fish and game, unusual plants of various sorts, and abundant timber. Soon they reached the village of the Walla Walla Indians, who received them so hospitably that the captain said of all the Indians they had met since...", "...set about writing his Flora Graeca; but he had a rough time of it travelling about in that rude land, and falling ill he had to leave his work undone.

In his will he left an estate the proceeds of which were to be devoted to the completion of his work, which was to be in ten folio volumes, with one hundred plates in each. This was done and the work finished <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years after his death, when thirty copies were issued to the patient subscribers at two hundred and forty guineas a copy. But the whole cost of the work was set down at 30,000 pounds! A costlier work it would be hard to find; I wonder how many of us have seen it? But I must go back to my subject.

After a policy of bullying towards France for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years, Germany has discovered during the course of the war that France is the cat's-paw of Russia and Great Britain--principally the latter. One writer,[182] in some fifty pages of venom, endeavours to show that England is France's executioner.

He bowed his body in continual prayer, and a visitor once counted twelve hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> reverences of adoration made by him in one day.

It rose in a series of eleven steps or terraces, each four feet high, so that the total height of the structure was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet. Each step was formed of a single course of white coral stone, neatly squared and polished. The steps on the long sides were broader than those at the ends, so that at the top it terminated, not in an oblong of the same figure as the base, but in a ridge like the roof of a house. The interior of the pyramid was solid, being filled up with round pebbles which, from the regularity of their figure, seemed to have been wrought. Some of the coral stones were very large; one...", "...its yield to be one dollar once a month.\" [Pageheader: FEAR OF RIDICULE OBSTRUCTS PROGRESS] It seems to be a common belief among Europeans that one has only to abolish the power of the chief to secure to every native the fruit of his own industry. That this is not so is proved by the example of the Tongans, who, being a less conservative people than the Fijians, are more inclined towards social progress. The powers of the chiefs were there abolished by law in 1862, but, during the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years that have elapsed, the principal result of the change has been to impoverish the chiefs without enriching the people, while the loss of the power of combination has deprived them of the power of building any but houses of the poorest description.

That the bulk of exports to Hong Kong may properly be considered as ultimately destined for consumption in China, is shown by the fact that the official reports of the imports into China show that more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> per cent of these imports are from the port of Hong Kong. The 1899 exports to China and Hong Kong combined will show a gain of nearly or quite twenty-five per cent over those of last year, while the total exports from the United States for the fiscal year 1899 will be little if any in excess of those of last year.

But if, by rubbing and wearing, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guineas and a half generally contain less than a pound weight of standard gold, the diminution, however, being greater in some pieces than in others, the measure of value comes to be liable to the same sort of uncertainty to which all other weights and measures are commonly exposed.

For about four years it was not followed at all, and, so far as the evidence at public inquiries could be relied on, there was no improvement in the fisheries during the cessation of this mode of fishing in either the whole, or part of the bay.

Taking the list printed for private distribution by Sir Wollaston Franks in 1887, we find sixteen examples in 1698; seven in 1699; fifteen in 1700; sixteen in 1701; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> in 1702; fifty-eight in 1703; twenty-seven in 1704; and many, but not so many, in the succeeding years. Something--what, I have failed to discover--must have given a stimulus to the fashion of using book-plates just at the close of the seventeenth and opening of the eighteenth century; and not only to using them, but also to putting a date on those used.

Milman says that the murder of the innocents by Herod's orders is a curious instance of the reaction of legendary extravagance on the plain truth of the evangelic history. The Greek Church canonised the fourteen thousand innocents; and another notion, founded on a misinterpretation of Rev. xiv. 3, swelled the number to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand. The former, at least, was the common belief of the Church, though even in the English Liturgy the latter has in some degree been sanctioned by retaining the chapter of Revelation in the \"epistle for the day.\" Even Jeremy Taylor admits without scruple or thought the fourteen thousand.

Substantial agreement is to be noted between the two enumerations, except for the larger percentage of those under 15 years of age in 1905 (19.6 per cent male, 18.4 per cent female), and the smaller percentages in the grouping thirty-five to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years (18.4 per cent male, 16.4 per cent female). Doubtless this effect is produced because so many of the cases in 1909 were individuals attending evening school, who were required to be above 14 years of age, and because few over forty-five years of age are attracted to such a place. The other small difference in percentages is due probably to the small number of individuals, 365, in the figures for 1909.

Early in this year a machine for winding, and coppers for baking, together with appropriate treatises on the art, were sent over by the Trustees, but the people were indifferent and apathetic. The Germans, however, were as active as formerly, and Mr. Bolzius, in a letter to Von Munch, dated May 6, 1747, says, that \"the people last winter planted more mulberry trees than for thirteen years before,\" for which he promised them a...", "...the ceiling. This part of the cavern was in the light from the entrance; but farther along, considerably obscured in the darkness of the subterranean temple, were scores, and perhaps hundreds, of others. The pillars were not the graceful forms of modern times, and many of them had lost all shape. This temple is said to have been excavated in the ninth century. The walls are covered with gigantic figures in relief. The temple is in the form of a cross, the main hall being a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet in depth. The ceiling is supported by twenty-six columns and eighteen pilasters, sixteen to eighteen feet high. They look clumsy, but they have to bear up the enormous weight of the hill of rock, and many of them have crumbled away. At the end of the colonnade is a gigantic bust, representing a Hindu divinity with three heads. Some say that this is Brahma, as the three symbols of the creator, preserver, and destroyer, forming what is sometimes named the Hindu trinity....", "...Romans xii. 2: \"Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Matters of church and patriotism were never far apart in New England; so whenever the spinners gathered at New London, Newbury, Ipswich, or Beverly, they always had an appropriate sermon. A favorite text was Exodus xxxv. 25: \"And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands.\" When the Northboro women met, they presented the results of their day's work to their minister. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> women and they spun 2223 knots of linen and tow, and wove one linen sheet and two towels. By Revolutionary times General Howe thought \"Linen and Woollen Goods much wanted by the Rebels\"; hence when he prepared to evacuate Boston he ordered all such goods carried away with him. But he little knew the domestic industrial resources of the Americans. Women were then most proficient in spinning. In 1777 Miss Eleanor Fry of East Greenwich, Rhode Island, spun seven skeins one...", "...as yet have been; and we know not who can think himself safe, if the accusations of children and others who are under a diabolical influence shall be received against persons of good fame.\" On the 2d of January, 1693, the Rev.

The progress of an ulcer in his thigh might shorten, but it could not disturb, this _celestial_ life; and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.

It lies about six hours of hard walking from Berberah. At midnight we skirted Bulho Faranji, the Franks' Watering-place [14], a strip of ground thickly covered with trees.

He bestirred himself actively at class-meetings, and for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years taught a class in Sunday-school. Only the day before his death he took part in these exercises for the last time. Though a sincere and zealous member of the Methodist Church, he was no bigoted sectarian, but interested himself in the prosperity of all religious bodies, and fraternized with the clergy of all denominations.

A second request for their freedom and for an explanation of their continued detention was made on February 13, 1917. At this date the men had been held as prisoners of war for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> days contrary to international law. After being captured from Allied vessels sunk by the German raider, they were taken before a prize court at Swinemunde, when their status was determined.

Germany disclosed for the first time that she was treating armed merchantmen as ships of war and regarded neutral seamen found on such vessels as...", "...the loads had to be sorted and laid out for the very miscellaneous transport that had been given us. This consisted of ponies, mules, donkeys, bullocks and yaks.

A friend of mine, a cultivated and scholarly clergyman, always used phrases like 'that bookcase cost thirteen _pound_.' This is an old English survival. Thus in Macbeth we find 'this three mile.'

The whole export, therefore, is the product of only 535 square miles: this is less than the 108th part of Georgia, and less than the 520th part of the cotton regions of the U. States.

When Burton opened in Chambers Street, he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years old, in the prime of life, his powers mature and approaching culmination. Let us endeavor to give a portrait of the comedian as he appeared at this time. Above the medium height; rotund in form, yet not cumbersome; limbs well proportioned; deep-chested, with harmonious breadth of shoulder; neck short and robust; large and well-balanced head; the hair worn short behind, longer in front, and brushed smartly toward the temples; face clean-shaven; complexion bordering on...", "...personal feeling. The selection of Evarts for secretary of state in place of Thomas C. Platt for postmaster general did not make him happy.[1569] George William Curtis's ardent support of the President likewise aided in separating him from the White House. Nevertheless, Conkling's attitude remained a profound secret until Thomas C. Platt, as temporary chairman, began the delivery of a carefully prepared speech. [Footnote 1569: New York _Tribune_, February 28, 1877.] Platt was then <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years old. He was born in Owego, educated at Yale, and as a man of affairs had already laid the foundation for the success and deserved prominence that crowned his subsequent business career. Ambition also took him early into the activities of public political life, his party having elected him county clerk at the age of twenty-six and a member of Congress while yet in his thirties. His friends, attracted by his promise-keeping and truth-telling, included most of the people...", "...once for asking, 'Is that the tree, or that?' I soon knew why. We scrambled up a steep bank of broken limestone, through ferns and Balisiers, for perhaps a hundred feet; and then were suddenly aware of a bole which justified the saying of one of our party--that, when surveying for a road he had come suddenly on it, he 'felt as if he had run against a church tower.' It was a Hura, seemingly healthy, undecayed, and growing vigorously. Its girth--we measured it carefully--was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet, six feet from the ground, and as I laid my face against it and looked up, I seemed to be looking up a ship's side. It was perfectly cylindrical, branchless, and smooth, save, of course, the tiny prickles which beset the bark, for a height at which we could not guess, but which we luckily had an opportunity of measuring. A wild pine grew in the lowest fork, and had kindly let down an air-root into the soil. We tightened the root, set it perpendicular, cut it...", "...world Faith, a marked progress in the rise and establishment of these institutions has been clearly noticeable.

The Jesuits sent home each year their _Relations_, and, as these were widely read, they created great interest in the spiritual affairs of the colony. The call for zealots to carry the cross westward into the wilderness met ready response, and it was amid a glow of religious fervor that the settlement at Montreal was brought into being. A company was formed in France, funds were obtained, and a band of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> colonists was recruited for the crusade into the wilderness. The Sieur de Maisonneuve, a gallant soldier and a loyal devotee of the Church, was the active leader of the enterprise, with Jeanne Mance, an ardent young religionist of high motives and fine character, as his principal coadjutor. Fortune dealt kindly with the project, and Montreal began its history in 1642. A few years later Montmagny gave up his post and returned to France.

The total number of years during which the parish was served by this family of clerks was 223, and by only five members of it, giving an average of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years and nine months for each--a wonderful record truly! Nor are these instances of the hereditary nature of the office, and of the fact that the duties of the position seem to contribute to the lengthened days of the holders of it, entirely passed away.

How could they suppose, that they would voluntarily confer, when there are but two places, a share of the honour on the commons, who at the election of military tribunes used to monopolize the eight places? and that they would suffer a way to be opened to the consulship, who kept the tribuneship so long a time fenced up?

At the very moment of his heroic death General Stevens was being considered by the President and his advisers as commander of the armies in Virginia. Mr. Hayes was assured of the fact by a member of the cabinet, and it was currently stated in the press.

The stern old Puritan Abolitionist, his aged father, died August 22, only ten days previous.

This delay was at the time most irksome, as I too frequently pictured the troops pushing on towards Fort Garry while I was detained inactive in Minnesota; but one morning the American papers came out with news that the expeditionary forces had met with much delay in their first move from Thunder Bay; the road over which it was necessary for them to transport their boats, munitions, and supplies for a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> miles from Superior to Lake Shebandowan was utterly impracticable, portions of it, indeed, had still to be made, bridges to be built, swamps to be corduroyed, and thus at the very outset of the Expedition a long delay became necessary.

From the very start our naval vessels and privateers won the most brilliant of victories. This was the more remarkable when several facts are kept in mind. Great Britain had been at war so long that she had the most powerful navy by far in the world. It numbered one thousand and thirty-six vessels, of which two hundred and fifty-four were ships-of-the-line, not one of which carried less than seventy guns of large calibre. This prodigious navy was manned by one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand sailors, and eighty-five of her war vessels were on the American coast, equipped and ready for action. In amazing contrast to all this, we had only twenty large war vessels and a number of gunboats that were of little account. The disparity was so great that our Government, after looking at the situation and discussing the matter, decided that it would be folly to fight England on the ocean, and it was decided not to do so.

Of the outworks, the strongest were the grand battery at Lighthouse Point, at the mouth of the harbour; and that on Goat Island, a rocky islet at its entrance.

In <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> City churches there was service, sometimes twice, sometimes once, every day. In all of them there were evening services on Wednesday and Fridays: in many there were endowed lectureships, which gave an additional sermon once a week, or at stated times.

In April some stores were brought into Calais by sea, and after this Edward ordered a stricter blockade; his fleet dispersed a convoy of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> ships laden with provisions on June 25, and the next day a letter was intercepted from the governor to the French king informing him of the starving condition of the garrison, and asking for relief. Edward sent the letter on to Philip, bidding him come to the relief of the town. In July Philip led an army toward Calais. A portion of it sent to dislodge the Flemings, who were acting with Edward at Quesnoy was defeated. He appeared at Sangatte on the 27th. He was unable to get...", "...After the consolidation in 1880 the line was recommenced, practically new grades being necessary. It was completed in 1882, the work being done under the Colorado Central Railroad Charter.

On the 13th of October, 1893, the United States Court at Omaha appointed S. H. H. Clark, Oliver W. Mink, and E. Ellery Anderson, Receivers, and in the following month Frederick R. Coudert and J. W. Doane were added to represent the interests of the United States, this receivership being forced on the Company by the very general business depression of 1893 and the consequent decrease in traffic and earnings. At the time of appointing...", "...A great drive, and a great coachman, worthily carrying on the good old traditions of the road. It has, however, been already pointed out that neither on his outward journey (3 hrs. 56 mins.), nor on the return (3 hrs. 54 mins.), did he quite equal the record of the \"Criterion\" coach, which on February 4th, 1834, took the King's Speech from London to Brighton in 3 hrs. 40 mins.

Now I say, in that John tells us this wall is an hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> cubits, and waives the manner of the measure of Ezekiel, it is to show us that this wall is for the safety of the hundred and forty-four thousand that have taken sanctuary in Christ, that is, all the holy and truly gracious souls that are with him on the Mount Zion, having his Father's name written in their foreheads (Rev 7; 14:1-3).

Conflans therefore determined to run for it and lead his squadron into Quiberon Bay, trusting and believing that Hawke would not dare to follow, under the conditions of the weather, into a bay which French authorities describe as containing banks and shoals, and lined with reefs which the navigator rarely sees without fright and never passes without emotion. It was in the midst of these ghastly dangers that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> large ships were about to engage pell-mell; for the space was too contracted for fleet manoeuvres. Conflans flattered himself that he would get in first and be able to haul up close under the western shore of the bay, forcing the enemy, if he followed, to take position between him and the beach, six miles to leeward. None of his expectations were fulfilled.

The forty-four signaled by the rodman's left arm, instead of being made up of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> downward strokes, had consisted of four such strokes, followed by a pause, and then four more strokes. \"I'll go along and see you get the course and distance to the third rod,\" said Rutter.

However, this was not to be. Hitherto, for a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years, the Jesuits had it all their own way in Japan; latterly, by virtue of a bull issued by Pope Gregory XIII in 1585--the date of the appointment of the first bishop and of the arrival at Rome of the Japanese mission--and subsequently confirmed by the bull of Clement III in 1600, by which the _religieux_ of other orders were excluded from missionary work in Japan.

The pre-emption regulations were revised for the semi-arid districts where a hundred and sixty acres was too small a unit. Sales of farm lands to colonization companies and of timber limits were continued, with occasional excessive gains to speculators, which the Opposition vigorously denounced. Yet the homesteader remained the chief figure in the opening of the West. The entries, as we have seen, were eighteen hundred in 1896. They were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand in 1911. Areas of land princely in their vastness were thus given away. Each year the Dominion granted free land exceeding in area and in richness coveted territories for whose possession European nations stood ready to set the world at war. In 1908, for {228} example, a Wales was given away; in 1909, five Prince Edward Islands; while in 1910 and 1911, what with homesteads, pre-emptions, and veteran grants, a Belgium, a Holland, a Luxemburg and a Montenegro...", "...at home; I am a domesticated man and strong in housekeeping.

When we, in the course of our Civil War, had withdrawn some of the upper posts, the Sioux edged in at once and pressed back the whites quite to the eastern confines of the Plains. When we were locked in the death grip of internecine war in 1862, they rose in one savage wave of rebellion of their own and massacred with the most horrible ferocity not less than six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> whites in Minnesota and South Dakota. When General Sibley went out among them on his later punitive campaign he had his hands full for many a long and weary day.

There she saw Sir Ralph Sadler, the English Ambassador who, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years before, had stood over her cradle in the nursery at Linlithgow and pronounced her a \"right fair and goodly child;\" there she saw Sir William Cecil (now Lord Burleigh), who had been her ablest and most industrious enemy through all the years of her short reign, and who had contributed more perhaps that any other individual to produce the Scottish anarchy in which she had lost her crown; and there she met, for the first time, the gaze of the crafty and vigilant Sir...", "...French-speaking schoolmasters from the Netherlands--chiefly Walloons and Burgundians--and the English teachers of French formed separate groups apart from the Huguenots. Yet another group was recruited from the ranks of the Roman Catholics. The Burgundians, who did not come from Burgundy, but from that portion of the Netherlands which had been under the rule of the House of Burgundy, formed a very considerable proportion of the foreign population of London. In 1567 there were only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> of them in London, but by 1571 their number had risen to four hundred and twenty-four--almost as many as the total number of French in the city.[432] The Walloons were still more numerous, and no doubt outnumbered the French.

This was the fight between the American frigate President, of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns, and the English sloop-of-war Little Belt, of eighteen guns. This vessel belonged to the British squadron which was ordered to the American coast to break up the trade from the United States to France; and the President was one of the few ships the government had for the protection of its commerce. The ships met a few miles south of Sandy Hook, chased each other in turn, then fired into each other without any reasonable pretext for the first shot, which each accused the...", "...was made speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives at the age of twenty-seven.

The last verse of Psalm cvi. indicates the close of the fourth book. It contains but seventeen psalms, and is the shortest book of the five. The fifth book includes the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> psalms, among them the \"Songs of David,\" or Pilgrim Songs, sung by the people on their journeys to Jerusalem to keep the solemn feasts. It is probable that this fifth book was compiled by the authorities in charge of the temple worship, and that they at the same time collected the other four books and put them all together, completing in this way the greater book of sacred lyrics which has been so precious to many generations not only of Jews, but also of Christians....", "...timber several years, have cut many hundreds of trees, and seen many thousands, but have never found one larger than the one I felled on a little stream which emptied into Jackson Lake, near the head of Baskahegan stream, in the eastern part of Maine.

It was about nine rods in length, or one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet, about sixty-five feet of which was free of limbs, and retained its diameter remarkably well. I was employed about one hour and a quarter in felling it. The afternoon was beautiful; every thing was calm, and to me the circumstances were deeply interesting.

About the beginning of the seventh century Isidore of Seville, the great theologian of his time, took up the subject.

In 1690, a congress of the colonies, called to provide means for the general defence, assembled at New York, and resolved to carry war into Canada: an army was to attack Montreal by way of Lake Champlain, and a fleet to attempt Quebec by the St. Lawrence. The former advanced as far as the lake, when the quarrels of the commanding officers defeated the objects of the expedition. The Massachusetts fleet of thirty-four vessels, (the largest carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns each,) and two thousand men, failed to reduce Quebec, though the defences of that place were then of the slightest character, and armed with only twenty-three guns. In 1704, and again in 1707, Port Royal was attacked by costly expeditions fitted out by the eastern colonies; and again, in 1709, a land force of fifteen hundred men advanced against Montreal by Lake Champlain; but nothing of importance was effected by either expedition.

The officers on board the transports, who were to compose the garrison, had each provided themselves with such live stock as they could find room for, not merely for the purpose of living upon during the passage, but with a view of stocking their little farms in the country to which we were going; every person in the fleet was with that view determined to live wholly on salt provisions, in order that as much live stock as possible...", "...was trained.

The two events are of a radically different sort from what has just been told. They are thus put by themselves, and the run of evil and of judgment upon it, put by itself, so keeping these two quite clear, following the general plan of the book.

Twelve thousand of each tribe are sealed, making a total of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand. The word \"seal\" is used in two senses in the Bible, as a means of fastening up a writing or roll, and, in the New Testament, commonly for the presence of the Holy Spirit in a human life. The seal in this second sense was a mark of ownership. Paul tells us that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit,[140] so indicating that we belong to the Lord Jesus, who gives us this evidence of His ownership.

On December 17, 1897, a fatality occurred during the administration of ether. The patient, a woman aged <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years, who suffered from \"internal cancer,\" was admitted for operation into the new hospital for women, Euston Road. It was considered that an operation would afford a chance of the prolongation of her life. At the time of admission the patient was in a very exhausted condition.

After the expiration of thirty minutes and...", "...and security, which was a type of Christ (Eze 11:16; Heb 6:18).

Now I say, in that John tells us this wall is an hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> cubits, and waives the manner of the measure of Ezekiel, it is to show us that this wall is for the safety of the hundred and forty-four thousand that have taken sanctuary in Christ, that is, all the holy and truly gracious souls that are with him on the Mount Zion, having his Father's name written in their foreheads (Rev 7; 14:1-3).

The fugitive slave law was hateful to the North not only because it was cruel and degrading, but because it was seen to be a move formed for nationalizing slavery. It was unsatisfactory to the South because it was deemed inadequate in its provisions, and because the South did not believe the North would execute it in good faith. So unstable did the compromise seem that in less than a year after the passage of all its measures, Henry Clay and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> Senators and Representatives united in a manifesto declaring that they would support no man for office who was not known to be opposed to any disturbance of the settlements of the compromise.

Lucan seems to have described this serpent in the following lines: Hic, quae prima caput movit de pulvere tabes Aspida somniferum tumida cervice levarit. According to Hasselquist, the aspic's head is raised in a protuberance on both sides behind the eyes; the scales which cover the back are small, of a dirty white colour, and speckled with reddish spots. The lower surface of the reptile is striated with one hundred and eighteen small parallel zones, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> smaller ones are under the tail. The teeth resemble in their structure those of other vipers; and, when the animal is irritated, its neck and throat are swelled up to the size of the body. Authors vary in regard to its length. Hasselquist, from whom we have derived the above description, says that it is a short reptile; while Savary assures us that it sometimes measures six feet. The ancients stated that the poison of the aspic did not occasion any pain, but that the...", "...was sent in to summon them to surrender, and as no answer could be obtained from them the colonists advanced.

Is it because persecution becomes justice when Catholics happen to be the victims, or is it because they are expected, from long usage, to be insensible to torture?

First--Mary reigned only five years and four months. Elizabeth's reign lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years and four months. The younger sister, therefore, swayed the sceptre of authority nearly nine times longer than the elder; and the number of Catholics who suffered for their faith during the long administration of Elizabeth may be safely said to exceed in the same proportion the victims of Mary's reign.

Madame de Stael, however, either clinging to her name or dreading the ridicule of such a strangely assorted marriage, insisted upon its concealment, and Rocca generally passed in society as her lover. A child was born in 1812, but it was only after the death of Madame de Stael that the legitimacy of the connection was...", "...they were exactly like other people.\" To use the newspaper phrase, \"there was no 'story.'\" They were a group of Americans, trained in the social conventions of their own land.

By the evening of the ninth, several batteries and redoubts were completed, and the effect of their fire was soon perceived. New batteries were opened the next day, and the fire became so heavy that the besieged withdrew their cannon from the embrasures, and scarcely returned a shot. The shells and red hot balls from the batteries of the allied army reached the ships in the harbour, and, in the evening, set fire to the Charon of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns, and to three large transports, which were entirely consumed. Reciprocal esteem, and a spirit of emulation between the French and Americans, being carefully cultivated by the Commander-in-chief, the siege was carried on with great rapidity. The second parallel was opened, on the night of the eleventh, within three hundred yards of the British lines. The three succeeding days were devoted to the completion of this parallel, during which the fire of the garrison, which...", "...of, or actors in, the great events of the period. *** To prevent disappointment, the public are requested to be particular in giving their orders for \"COLBURN'S AUTHORISED TRANSLATION.\" HISTORY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS; FROM THE CONVENTION PARLIAMENT OF 1688-9, TO THE PASSING OF THE REFORM BILL IN 1832.

In 1825 John Quincy Adams vainly urged upon Congress the foundation of a National Observatory; but in 1843 the lectures on celestial phenomena of Ormsby MacKnight Mitchel stirred an impressionable audience to the pitch of providing him with the means of erecting at Cincinnati the first astronomical establishment worthy the name in that great country.

So formidable were those armies, and so perilous those wars, that places now abandoned as untenable were then defended as impregnable.

Moreover, the Collins ships were far more expensive to run. Indeed, the cost of the rapid service was enormous. Mr. Collins stated before a committee of Congress that to save a day or a day and a half in the run between New York and Liverpool cost the company nearly a million dollars annually. Accordingly more subsidy was asked for.

The extra allowance lifted the Collins subsidy to $853,000 for twenty-six trips a year, thirty-three thousand dollars per voyage, a rate of upward of five dollars a mile.[GP] The competition now became sharper.

Is the public prosecutor prepared to deny the character of science to that address because of its brevity? Who will not, on the contrary, appreciate that the very brevity imposed by circumstances makes the scientific inquiry contained in this work all the more difficult and the more considerable? I was compelled to condense my exposition within the compass of a two-hours' address, a pamphlet of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> pages, at the same time that I was obliged to conform my presentation of the matter to an audience on whose part I could assume no acquaintance with scientific methods and results.

He had scarcely entered the station, and closed the gates, when an army of four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> Indians, led on by a Frenchman named Duquesne, appeared before the settlement. They soon sent in a flag, demanding, in the name of the King of Great Britain, that the station should instantly surrender. A council was immediately held in the fort.

This discovery consisted of three fragments of black diorite stone and constituted, when fitted together, a monument nearly eight feet in height. This monument embodies a bas-relief of King Hammurabi receiving the Laws from the sun-god, and an inscription of about four thousand lines (the longest inscription yet discovered) arranged in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> columns, engraven on the _stele_ in cuneiform characters as were the Tel-el-Amarna tablets. It is believed by the scholars that this Code was set up in the principal cities of the realm and was designed to be read and observed by the King's subjects.

A considerable addition to this was made by the private stocks of the officers, who were, however, under a necessity of circumscribing their original intentions on this head very much, from the excessive dearness of many of the articles. It will readily be believed, that few of the military found it convenient to purchase sheep, when hay to feed them costs sixteen shillings a...", "...there is no avowal of hostile intent, with two such armies fronting each other with such divers intents and resolves, it will take but a spark to ignite the magazines which is to explode.

I believe that the Swiss-like grip of the people of South Carolina upon their liberties, shaming Georgia so greatly as it does, is mainly due to the influence of Calhoun.

He was a small, bearded, wiry man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> or five, who gave you a curious impression of ferocity and mildness mingled.

In 1768 the indefatigable Gravelot had illustrated an edition of the works of Voltaire, published at Geneva, with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> designs.

But for this disparity and the wanton neglect of humane feelings South Carolinians excuse themselves upon the ground that they have no penitentiary; nor do they believe in that system of punishment, contending that it creates an improper competition with the honest mechanic, and gives countenance to crime, because it attempts to improve criminals.

The theory of evolution is the only thing to compare with it. But Darwin had only to fight a superstition. It wasn't much of a feat to convince thinking people that it took more than one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> hour's to create the world--then his case was practically won.

A violent earthquake, which was felt as far as Reggio, destroyed Catania in the course of a few minutes, burying fifteen thousand people beneath the ruins. It was the vigil of the feast of St. Agatha, and the cathedral of Catania was crowded with people, who were all buried beneath the ruins, together with the bishops and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> Benedictine monks.

CHAPTER XXIII. Introduction to the Study of the History of Political Parties in the United States. A knowledge of the nature of our federal government, and its relations to the State Governments, of which it is composed, is a prerequisite to an understanding of the history of our political parties. The government of the United States is a federal republic, first formed by the voluntary union of thirteen commonwealths. At present it is composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> united States. It is a government of enumerated powers, and in this respect differs radically from the governments of the individual States. As all agree, the Federal Government possesses only those powers specifically granted to it by the constitution. The States possess all powers except those granted to the National Government, and those not prohibited to them by the terms of the constitution. When the government of the United States desires to exercise a power, it must...", "...Christian's armor; that it is not for the flesh, but for the spirit; that it is not for defense against persecution and trials in our life here, but for defense against the wiles of the devil; that it should be constantly worn, and kept bright by daily use.

For many years he groped in the dark; but at length he was put upon the right path by one of those accomplished gardeners so common in Scotland, where the art of gardening is carried to high perfection. He always sought the friendship of gardeners wherever he went. Nevertheless he was forty years old before he became a scientific botanist. During the rest of his life of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years, besides pursuing his favorite branch, he obtained a very considerable knowledge of the kindred sciences and of astronomy. Being obliged to sell his watch in a time of scarcity, he made for himself a pocket sun-dial, by which he could tell the time to within seven or eight minutes.

The month of July saw an interesting duel round Salamanca between Marmont and Wellington. The two armies were very nearly equal in numbers, the French having forty-seven thousand men and the English <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand. The French had the advantage of a broad base with lines of retreat either on Burgos or Madrid. The English had to cover their single line of communication, which ran through Ciudad Rodrigo. The French had the further advantage that their infantry marched better than the English. Owing to these causes their commander was so far able to outgeneral his adversary that by July 22nd he was actually threatening the English line of retreat.

It contains <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> hundred square miles and comprises all the ranges east of the Divide in northern Alberta. It is reached by two transcontinental railroads. This part of the Great North country suggests adventure, romance, and history, and brings back to mind the power, the strangeness, and the picturesqueness of the earlier days of the Hudson's Bay Company.

The first hitch was in the failure of the Toulon fleet, delayed by contrary winds, to join; and Tourville went to sea with only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> ships, but with a peremptory order from the king to fight when he fell in with the enemy, were they few or many, and come what might.

It was also stated that in the year 1911 Germany would possess thirteen dreadnoughts and Great Britain only twelve, which statement was founded upon reasonable assumptions.

But if <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guineas and a-half, containing their full standard weight, a pound weight of gold, could purchase very little more than a pound weight of uncoined gold; forty-four guineas and a-half, wanting a part of their weight, could not purchase a pound weight, and something was to be added, in order to make up the deficiency.

He would not have come here at all, but preceded his army to Strasburg, had his Minister of Finances, Gaudin, and his Minister of the Public Treasury, Marbois, been able to procure <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> millions of livres--to pay a part of the arrears of the troops; and for the speedy conveyance of ammunition and artillery towards the Rhine. Immediately after his arrival here, Bonaparte sent for the directors of the Bank of France, informing them that within twenty-four hours they must advance him thirty-six millions of livres--upon the revenue of the last quarter of 1808. The president of the bank, Senator Garrat, demanded two hours to lay before the Emperor the...", "...to the sea, and their reserves were so disposed as to meet such an attack. But the German blow was directed against the weakest part of the Allied line, the stretch from Rheims to Soissons, where a break might open the road to Paris from the east. The third drive began on May 27. For over a week the French were pushed back, fighting valiantly, across land which had not seen the enemy since September, 1914. The greatest depth of the German advance was thirty miles, that is, to within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> miles of Paris. The enemy had once again reached the Marne River and controlled the main roads from Paris to Verdun and to the eastern parts of the Allied line. The fourth drive started a few days later, on June 9, in a region where an attack was expected.

There were at that time a hundred and nine parish churches in London and Westminster. At <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> of these there was daily service--surely this is a recognized indication of some religious activity--at one of these there were three daily services; at all of them--the whole hundred and nine--there were services every Wednesday and Friday, and on all holy days and saints' days.

Certainly he did not present them in the formal, forcible, and scientific way that Erasmus Darwin did. The result is that the tentative views of Buffon, which have to be with much research extracted from the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> volumes of his works, would now be regarded as in a degree superficial and valueless. But they appeared thirty-four years before Lamarck's theory, and though not epoch-making, they are such as will render the name of Buffon memorable for all time. ETIENNE GEOFFROY ST. HILAIRE.

Of course, this rate for the crumbling away of the Niagara shale on its fresh exposure is much in excess of the average rate for a long period of time; but it is clear that the rate of erosion at the base of the Niagara limestone at the mouth of the gorge can never have been sufficiently slow to reduce the total average much below the assumed rate of a quarter of an inch a...", "...and burned to strike a blow for its honor. President Madison seemed much impressed by their representations, and agreed to take the matter into consideration; and, if it seemed wise, to change the plan.

Under his command were the flag-ship \"President\" of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns, the \"Essex\" thirty-two, and the \"Hornet\" eighteen. In the lower bay these vessels were joined by the \"United States\" forty-four, the \"Congress\" thirty-eight, and the \"Argus\" sixteen. On June 21, 1812, three days after the declaration of war, the whole squadron passed Sandy Hook, and stood out into the ocean.

The second is headed, \"Orders Established for the well governing of His Majesty's Ships, and Preservation of good order among the respective Commanders, Officers, and Seamen serving His Majesty in the same.\" The general instructions are calculated to produce a somewhat unfavourable impression of the moral qualities both of the ships' companies and the workmen in the dockyard.

Two of the vessels, under Commodore James Biddle, were on the coast of Asia; several occupied the Brazil station; and five cruised in African waters to check the trade in slaves. The Pacific squadron, commanded by Commodore John D. Sloat, comprised on July 1, 1846, the frigate _Savannah_, the sloops _Portsmouth_, _Levant_, _Warren_ and _Cyane_, the schooner _Shark_ and the...", "...years old.

Within the borders of this ranch to-day lie such places as Downey and Rivera. Francisco Sanchez was another early _ranchero_--probably the same who figured so prominently in early San Francisco; and it is possible that J. M. Sanchez, to whom, in 1859, was re-granted the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> hundred acres of the Potrero Grande, was his heir. There were two large and important landowners, second cousins, known as Jose Sepulveda; the one, Don Jose Andres, and the other, Don Jose Loreto. The father of Jose Andres was Don Francisco Sepulveda, a Spanish officer to whom the San Vicente Ranch had been granted; and Jose Andres, born in San Diego in 1804, was the oldest of eleven children. His brothers were Fernando, Jose del Carmen, Dolores and Juan Maria; and he...", "...the Westminster Confession; in 1802, however, subscription to the Formula was rescinded. Through Scottish influence, the return to the Westminster Confession was gradually brought about in the early part of the century. That Confession was formally adopted by the Presbytery of Newcastle in 1824; and since 1836, all the ministers of the body have been required to accept it in the most unqualified manner. The Calvinistic Methodists of Wales drew up, in 1823, a Confession consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> articles, agreeing substantially with the Westminster Confession. Subscription is not required: but the clergy, prior to ordination, make a statement of their doctrinal views, which amounts to nearly the same thing. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Methodists depend upon discipline rather than upon Subscription. The Congregational Churches take up almost the same attitude towards their clergy. There is no subscription; but any great deviation from the prevailing views...", "...would soon seize them and transport them, or deliver them over to the hands of their debtor, to be shot as traitors or conspirators.

Immediately after his arrival here, Bonaparte sent for the directors of the Bank of France, informing them that within twenty-four hours they must advance him thirty-six millions of livres--upon the revenue of the last quarter of 1808. The president of the bank, Senator Garrat, demanded two hours to lay before the Emperor the...", "...were admitted, and there was a respectful silence in the presence of this great humiliation to a proud army.

The Tillman movement in South Carolina, nominally Democratic, was akin to Populism, but was complicated with the color question, and later with novel liquor legislation. It was a revolt of the ordinary whites from the traditional dominance of the aristocracy. In Alabama a similar movement, led by Reuben F. Kolb, was defeated, as he thought, by vicious manipulation of votes in the Black Belt. Of the total four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> electoral votes Cleveland received two hundred and seventy-seven, a plurality of one hundred and thirty-two.

The lady at Glasgow wrote to her friend at Edinburgh, deploring her loss, and the Cat was supposed to have formed some new attachment. About a fortnight, however, after her disappearance from Glasgow, her well-known mew was heard at the street-door of her Edinburgh mistress; and there she was with both her kittens, they in the best state, but she, herself, very thin. It is clear that she could carry only one kitten at a time. The distance from Glasgow to Edinburgh is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> miles, so that if she brought one kitten part of the way, and then went back for the other, and thus conveyed them alternately, she must have travelled 120 miles at least.

I believed, without false modesty, that I had not the qualities necessary to fill this important place suitably. When thirty-nine out of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> voters had appointed me, it was quite time that I should give in to an opinion so flattering and so plainly expressed. On the 7th of June, 1830, I, therefore, became perpetual secretary of the Academy for the Mathematical Sciences; but, conformably to the plea of an accumulation of offices, which I had used as an argument to support, in November, 1822, the election of M.

Conditions in North Alabama To the convention of 1861 <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> members from north Alabama were elected as cooperationists, that is, in favor of a union of the southern states, within the old Union, for the purpose of securing their rights under the Constitution or of securing safe secession. They professed to be afraid of separate state secession as likely to lead to disintegration and war. Thirty-one of these cooperationists voted against the ordinance of secession, and twenty-four of them (mostly members from the northern hill...", "...All the better for us.

The charity opened also a smallpox hospital in Bethnal Green, which eventually contained <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> beds. The Inoculation Hospital proper, used for the tedious preparation of subjects, was a house in Old Street, St Luke's, with accommodation for fifteen persons. Besides the smallpox hospital at Islington, the charity had, in 1750, a neighbouring house in Frog Lane, for the reception of patients after they had been inoculated in the Old Street house.

The earliest examples of pottery were found more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet below the surface. In the larger vases and urns the clay appears to have been mixed with chopped straw,[156] the clay itself being as a rule of a yellowish brown colour, but according to Banks, the clay was burnt to a deep brown or black colour in the earliest times. The wheel seems to have been used at all periods, though not to the exclusion of hand-made pottery. One of the pre-Sargonic vases from this site was apparently formed by placing the clay on a flat surface,...", "...Guevara and another sixty-gun ship, which were to windward, bore down upon him, and gave him their broadsides, and then clapped upon a wind, standing in for land. The admiral immediately tacked and stood after them until it was almost night; but there being little wind, and the enemy hauling away out of his reach, he left pursuing them and rejoined the fleet two hours after night. The _Essex_ took the _Juno_ of thirty-six guns, the _Montague_ and _Rupert_ took the _Volante_ of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> guns, and Rear-admiral Delaval, in the _Dorsetshire_, took the _Isabella_ of sixty guns. The action happened off Cape Passaro, at about six leagues' distance from the shore. The English received but little damage: the ship that suffered most was the _Grafton_, for, being a good sailer, her captain engaged several ships in succession, always pursuing the headmost and leaving the ships he had disabled or damaged to be taken by those that followed him.

There were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> children, and the kind council drew lots to decide which of them should be shot.

Cino was also a jurist, and it came to him to be the teacher of one whose name is second to none among the legists of the Middle Ages. This was Bartolus, born probably in the year 1314 at Sassoferrato in the duchy of Urbino. He was a scholar, learned in geometry and Hebrew, also a man of affairs. He taught the law at Pisa and Perugia, and in the last-named town he died in 1357, not yet <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years old. Bartolus wrote and compiled full commentaries on the entire _Corpus juris civilis_; and yet he produced no work differing in kind from works of his predecessors. Moreover, between him and the body of the law rose the great mass of gloss and comment already in existence, through which he did not always penetrate to the veritable _Corpus_. Yet his labours were inspired with the energy of a vigorous nature, and he put fresh thoughts into his commentaries.[398] The...", "...men were sitting like frightened animals.

The students in the two professional departments were no less eager for service, as is shown by the remarkable record of the medical class of '61, thirty of whose <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> graduates saw active service. Among the Michigan men in the Civil War at least twelve, eight of whom held degrees, rose to the rank of brigadier-general, three of them from the class of '61. Of this number apparently only one, Elon Farnsworth, '55-'58, actually commanded a brigade in battle. He was killed while bravely leading a hopeless charge at Gettysburg.

Of the Bohemians and Moravians <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> per cent. are skilled laborers, and only 1.50 per cent. over fourteen are unable to read and write; but of the Poles eighty-five per cent. are unskilled, and thirty per cent. can neither read nor write; and this represents the average.

A strict watch was kept on him.\" We are very glad to know about the \"strict watch,\" but really it was too bad of the authors not to let us know if those <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> minutes, also, were not consecutive. They might, too, have told us to advantage something about the _modus operandi_ of \"walking a plank.\" It has been the general impression that the man who walks a plank performs the operation in an unpleasant hurry--unpleasant for him; and that he will take all the rest he can get--before he begins; and that he has an eternal rest, or unrest, after he has finished. But perhaps this has been a wrong impression.

The most extravagant part of the charge is the thirty-three per cent which is allowed as profit on retailing the book. It is stated, however, that all retail booksellers allow to their customers a discount of ten per cent upon orders above 20s., and that consequently the nominal profit of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> or thirty-three per cent is very much reduced. If this is the case, it may fairly be enquired, why the price of L2 for example, is printed upon the back of a book, when every bookseller is ready to sell it at L1 16s., and why those who are unacquainted with that circumstance should be made to pay more than others who are better informed? 392. Several reasons have been alleged as justifying this high rate of profit. First, it has been alleged that the purchasers of...", "...\"I hold the cards.\" \"Was it necessary to humiliate me in the presence of Miss Westfall?\" demanded Ronador bitterly.

There were 713 acres cleared, 123 acres sown in wheat, and 342 acres waiting to be sown; and the farms were very well stocked, there being an average of about three horses and four or five cows to each settler.

On that day a meeting was called \"to know the sense of the town whether the former vote in placing said meeting-house should be altered.\" After some wrangling, it was decided by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> to thirty \"to place the new meeting-house at the crotch of the roads, near Capt. William Brown's house\" (very near the present junction of Main, Mechanic, and Academy Streets). This decision was final. It is rather difficult to see how it happened to be, for this site was a little east of the town land. The opposition put in one final blow in this way. It was designed to have the house face directly \"down street\" and the underpinning was laid with a view to this, but the...", "...change, or the quartering of the moon, in connection with a gale at sea; thus showing, at least, their faith in the influence of the phenomenon. Yet it is actually the case, at certain times, that in about latitude 40d and 41d, the storms appear about a week apart. There is some reason, also, to suspect, that there is a difference of temperature on opposite sides of the sun. As the synodical rotation is nearly identical with the siderent period of the moon, this would require about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years to run its course, so as to bring the phenomena to exact coincidence again. Since these observations were made, it is understood that Sig. Secchi has determined that the equatorial regions of the sun are hotter than his polar regions. It may be owing to this fact, that we have inferred a necessity for a change, whose period is a multiple of the sun's synodical rotation, but it is worthy of examination by those who possess the necessary conveniences. Another period...", "...crookedly. I lost all patience, and snatched the bottle out of her hand. Just as I drew the cork, the bell rang on the platform. I only waited to pour the soda-water into a glass--but the train was moving as I left the refreshment room. The porters stopped me when I tried to jump on to the step of the carriage. I was left behind. As soon as I had recovered my temper, I looked at the time-table. We had reached Waterbank at five minutes past one. By good luck, the next train was due at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> minutes past one, and arrived at Yateland (the next station) ten minutes afterward. I could only hope that Priscilla would look at the time-table too, and wait for me. If I had attempted to walk the distance between the two places, I should have lost time instead of saving it. The interval before me was not very long; I occupied it in looking over the town. Speaking with all due respect to the inhabitants, Waterbank (to other people) is a dull place. I went up one street...", "...but one half of which are select, and remarkable for their fine preservation. Among five hundred volumes, obtained from the suppressed religious corporations, are to be remarked one hundred and nine port-folios from the abbey of _St. Victor_, in Paris, containing a beautiful series of mythological, historical, and typographical subjects. This forms a valuable addition to the collection of the same kind of which the department of prints was already in possession. In one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> volumes brought from Cologne, there are several scarce and singular engravings. As for sixty articles sent from Italy, they are, with the exception of the _Museum Pio-Clementinum_, in such a state of degradation that they are scarcely fit for any thing but to mark the place which each composition has to occupy. Since 1789, the department of prints has made several acquisitions deserving of notice, such as the works of LEBAS, MARCENAY, and RODE, all extremely difficult...", "...satisfaction hitherto in aerostatic experiments. The doctor, according to very accurate calculations, found that, including the articles indispensable to his journey and his apparatus, he should have to carry a weight of 4,000 pounds; therefore he had to find out what would be the ascensional force of a balloon capable of raising such a weight, and, consequently, what would be its capacity. A weight of four thousand pounds is represented by a displacement of the air amounting to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet; or, in other words, forty-four thousand eight hundred and forty-seven cubic feet of air weigh about four thousand pounds. By giving the balloon these cubic dimensions, and filling it with hydrogen gas, instead of common air--the former being fourteen and a half times lighter and weighing therefore only two hundred and seventy-six pounds--a difference of three thousand seven hundred and twenty-four pounds in equilibrium is...", "...of Christ.\"[1] The parliamentary commissioners (they were eight, with St. John and Vane at their head), secure of the power of the sword, derided the menaces of the kirk.

Laban deceived not only Jacob, but also the guests whom he invited to the wedding. THE MARRIAGE OF JACOB After Jacob had served Laban seven years, he said to his uncle: \"The Lord destined me to be the father of twelve tribes. I am now eighty-four years old, and if I do not take thought of the matter now, when can I?\"[160] Thereupon Laban consented to let him have his daughter Rachel to wife, and he was married <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years after his brother Esau. The Lord often defers the happiness of the pious, while He permits the wicked to enjoy the fulfilment of their desires soon.[161] Esau, however, had purposely chosen his fortieth year for his marriage; he had wanted to indicate that he was walking in the footsteps of his father Isaac, who had likewise married at forty years of age.

In his career, as no doubt in that of many other French leaders of the time, we find no lurid lights, no gay scenes at court--nothing but simple and laborious devotion to duty. Though a grand seigneur, Montcalm was poor. His letters show that his mind was always much occupied with family affairs, the need of economy, the careers of his sons, his mill, his plantations. He showed the minute care in management which the French practise better than the English. In 1756 he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years of age, a soldier who had campaigned in Germany, Bohemia, and Italy, had known victory and defeat, had been a prisoner in the hands of the Austrians, and had made a reputation as a man fit to lead. He lived far from court and went to Paris only rarely. It was this quiet man who, on January 31, 1756, was summoned to Paris to head the military force about to be sent to Canada.

Adult man possesses, like all the other Catarrhine Simiae, thirty-two teeth, whilst the American monkeys (the Platyrrhinae) have thirty-six teeth--namely, one pair of premolars more in the upper and lower jaws. Comparative odontology leads us to the phylogenetic conclusion that this number has been produced by reduction from a still older form with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> teeth. This typical dental formula (three incisors, one canine, four premolars, and three molars, in each half-jaw) is common to all those most important older mammals which in the beginning of the Eocene period constituted the four large groups of Lemuravida, Condylarthra, Esthonychida, and Ictopsida. These are the four ancestral groups of the four main orders of Placentalia--namely, of the Primates, Ungulata, Rodentia, and Carnassia. They seem to be so closely related by...", "...for president.

A second conference was held in 1907 at the suggestion, in part, of President Roosevelt. At this gathering <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> states were represented, including most of the Latin-American republics. During the two conferences many questions relating to international law were discussed, and the conclusions reached were expressed in the form of \"Conventions,\" which the several powers signed.

The _carte de visite_ received that day, June 15, 189-, by the director of the establishment of Healthful House was a very neat one, and simply bore, without escutcheon or coronet, the name: COUNT D'ARTIGAS. Below this name, in a corner of the card, the following address was written in lead pencil: \"On board the schooner _Ebba_, anchored off New-Berne, Pamlico Sound.\" The capital of North Carolina--one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> states of the Union at this epoch--is the rather important town of Raleigh, which is about one hundred and fifty miles in the interior of the province. It is owing to its central position that this city has become the seat of the State legislature, for there are others that equal and even surpass it in industrial and commercial importance, such as Wilmington, Charlotte, Fayetteville, Edenton, Washington, Salisbury, Tarborough, Halifax, and New-Berne. The latter town is...", "...complete and the greater part of five others; but no more, except a fragment of the ninety-first book, has been discovered for several centuries, and in all probability the remainder is for ever lost. Livy was so much abridged and epitomized that during the Middle Ages he was scarcely read in any other form. Compilers like Florus, Orosius, Eutropius, &c. entirely supplied his place. A word should perhaps be said about POMPEIUS TROGUS, who about Livy's time wrote a universal history in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> books. It was called _Historiae Philippicae_, and was apparently arranged according to nations; it began with Ninus, the Nimrod of classical legend, and was brought down to about 9 A.D. We know the work from the epitomes of the books and from Justin's abridgment, which is similar to that of Florus on Livy. Who Justin was, and where he lived, are not clearly ascertained. He is thought to have been a philosopher, but if so, he was anything but a talented one; most scholars...", "...of discovery along an unknown coast and on an unknown sea. \"It is certain,\" says Dr. Campbell concerning Bering at this stage, \"that no person better fitted for this undertaking could have been found; no difficulty, no danger daunted him.

Bering's point of departure was the lower Kamchatka fort, situated 160 deg. 50' east of Greenwich, the variation of the compass being 13 deg. 10' E. The latitude of the cape at the mouth of the Kamchatka River was determined as...", "...I have your cap badge?\" the Prince asked, decently enough. I lied brazenly: \"Sorry, sir; I've lost mine.\" The fact was I had shoved it down under my puttees while lying back of the trench the previous afternoon. Scarfe said: \"You can have mine, sir.\" He took it. \"Thanks so much.\" He glanced at the aide again; rather sharply this time, I thought. The latter blushed and hastily extracted a wallet, from which he handed Scarfe a two-mark piece, equal to one and ten pence, or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> cents. He gave us his name before leaving, and my recollection is that it was something like Eitelbert. Evidently he was a brother of the Duchess of Connaught, whom we knew to have been a German princess whose brothers and other male relatives all enjoyed high commands among our foes.

The vividness of it will stand forever in the minds of the few. No, he was not murdered, but worse. The great leather straps with holes in them were far worse than bullets from a <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> gun. Mr. Openraiser begged for mercy like a child.

Nor were his successors behind him in zeal and munificence. That the prime article of Islamism, the uni-personality of God, is one cause of the downfall, say rather of the merely meteoric existence of their literary age, I am persuaded, but the exclusive scene (in Spain) suggests many interesting views. With a learned class Mohammedanism could not but pass into Deism, and Deism never did, never can, establish itself as a religion.

About this time the statement of Mr. Crankin, of North Yeaston, Rhode Island, that he makes a clear and easy profit of five dollars and twenty cents per hen each year, and nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> dollars to every duck, and might have increased said profit if he had hatched, rather than sold, seventy-two dozen eggs, struck me as wildly apocryphal. Also that caring for said hens and ducks was merely an incident of his day's work on the large farm, he working with his laborers.

Within a year after the publication of his book against Salmasius its foreseen result was complete. From henceforth Milton was dependent upon the eyes of others.

When we reached it, we found it was flag No. 5 -- all our bamboos were numbered, so we knew the exact position of the flag. No. 5 was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> and a half miles from Framheim. This agreed well with the distance recorded -- forty-four miles. The next day was calm and clear, and the temperature began to descend, -13deg. F. But in spite of this lower temperature the air felt considerably milder, as it was quite still.

The wise men or governors of the pueblos are always old men elected out of respect for their superior wisdom, men used to having their slightest word implicitly obeyed.

These tables include cases in which the vessel was tied for wounds, and as a preparatory step in the operation of removal of tumours of the jaw, etc. Later statistics give a very much lessened mortality, due chiefly to the use of animal ligatures. Of thirty-one cases in which it was tied for pulsating tumours of the orbit, only two died from the operation.[15] Rivington's statistics to a later date give forty-six cases on <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> patients with six deaths. Both carotids have been tied in the same patient twenty-five times, at intervals of less than a year; and it is a very remarkable fact that only five of these fifty ligatures proved fatal,--two in which both were tied on the same day, and three in which the operation was performed to arrest haemorrhage from malignant disease of the face and jaws--from gunshot wound,--and from syphilitic ulceration.

The average annual import of wool during 1765-66-67 was 4,241,364 pounds--the average annual export of woollens during the same period was L4,630,384; while the average annual import of wool for the years 1822-23-24 was 18,884,876 pounds, and the average annual export of woollens during the same time, amounted to L6,200,548, showing that the importation of foreign wool was absolutely necessary for the well-being of our manufactures. The importation of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> millions of pounds weight, in the year ending 5th January, 1826, must be ascribed as much to the spirit of over-trading, which then affected every branch of industry, as to the reduction of the duty; but the large importations during 1827, afforded an additional proof of the necessity of foreign wool to the successful formation of a most important article of commerce.

A special election for that purpose was accordingly held in the city on the 24th instant.

They describe, as the author has reason to believe, the most extensive journey ever made by a stranger in that peninsula, and contain the account of visits to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> ruined cities, or places in which remains or vestiges of ancient population were found. The existence of most of these ruins was entirely unknown to the residents of the capital;--but few had ever been visited by white inhabitants;--they were desolate, and overgrown with trees. For a brief space the stillness that reigned around them was broken, and they were again left to solitude and silence. Time and the elements are hastening them to utter destruction.

The gross cotton output, in which the upland crop greatly and increasingly outweighed that of the sea-island staple, rapidly advanced from about forty-eight million pounds in 1801 to about eighty million in 1806; then it was kept stationary by the embargo and the war of 1812, until the return of peace and open trade sent it up by leaps and bounds again.

Therefore, the fourth generation in that line had commenced before Joseph's death. But this is an event of which we can fix the date with accuracy.

Consequently, at that time the posterity of Joseph had already reached the fourth generation. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years yet remained before the Exodus.

You say that Germany is the only great Power which has kept the peace for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years, and made no conquest of territory of any kind by force of arms. It is pertinent to recall in reference to this statement, that in the course of these forty-four years Germany virtually by force has taken a strategically important piece of China, waged war against the Hereros and annexed colonies in Africa and in the Pacific (receiving in exchange for one of them the strategically most valuable island of Heligoland). Yet, speaking generally, the world is bound to...", "...have a plum to her fortune. These delays, however, could not continue for ever; and at a great family meeting held at Passover-time, Rebecca was solemnly ordered to choose a husband out of the gentlemen there present; her aunts pointing out the great kindness which had been shown to her by her father, in permitting her to choose for herself. One aunt was of the Solomon faction, another aunt took Simeon's side, a third most venerable old lady--the head of the family, and a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years of age--was ready to pronounce a curse upon her, and cast her out, unless she married before the month was over. All the jewelled heads of all the old ladies in council, all the beards of all the family, wagged against her: it must have been an awful sight to witness. At last, then, Rebecca was forced to speak. \"Kinsmen!\" she said, turning pale, \"when the Prince Abou Abdil asked me in marriage, I told you I would not wed but with one of my own faith.\" \"She has...", "...brethren that that disciple should not die.\" Peter, James and John were the chosen among the chosen, upon whom the Savior bestowed special favor. Peter was a man of great energy, fitted to be a leader in the church and in society. John possessed a deep, affectionate nature, which made him the dearest of the Savior's three chosen friends. Of James we know very little. He seems to have been of a quiet, earnest, meditative turn. He presided over the church at Jerusalem until the year <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> of our era, when he sealed his testimony with his blood, being the first of that glorious band of apostolic martyrs.

At the close of the month of April, the price of gold, not then, as far as known, under the influence of any speculative movement, was at a premium of about thirty-four per cent. The indications were that, during the months of May and June, the parties interested in the combination made large purchases. By the 20th of May the price had reached a premium of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> per cent. From that time onward, until the last of July, the premium diminished, and at that date the rate was thirty-six per cent.

It is useless to appear only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years old when one is fifty; there are women who think forty-four too old--usually those who are about that age themselves.

Whether it was concluded merely for defensive or also for offensive purposes, and whether France was obliged by her treaty to draw the sword in the present case, remains therefore a matter of surmise. But there is no mystery about the feelings of France with regard to Germany, and no doubt about the greed for revenge which during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> years has swayed the overwhelming majority of her people and been the dominant factor of her foreign policy. It was for this object that she entered into her alliances and agreements, and it is for this cause that she is fighting now.

Two hermaphrodite brigs,--the Advance and Rescue,--of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> and ninety tons respectively, manned by thirty-eight men, all told, and strengthened for Arctic duty beyond all precedent, were prepared for the service. They were placed under the command of Lieutenant De Haven,--Dr. E. K. Kane, of the Navy, being appointed surgeon and naturalist to the squadron. They sailed from New York on the 23d of May, and in less than a month descried the gaunt coast of Greenland at the moment when the distinction between day and night began to be...", "...myself a rather minute description of the state in which I saw it, will not be uninteresting. The streets, with the exception of the principal one, which is about thirty-three feet wide, are very narrow. They are paved with blocks of lava, and have raised side-walks for pedestrians, things very rare in modern Europe. At the corners of the streets are fountains, and also stepping-stones for crossing. The furrows worn by the carriage wheels are strongly marked, and are not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> inches apart, thus giving us the width of their vehicles. \"The houses in general are built with small red bricks, or with volcanic matter from Vesuvius, and are only one or two stories high. The marble counters remain in many of the stores, and the numbers, names of the occupiers, and their occupations, still appear in red letters on the outside. The names of Julius, Marius, Lucius, and many others, only familiar to us through the medium of our classic studies, and...", "...of the grand altar from which to take our bearings. The whole of the eastern side of the church had been swept away and converted into a modern churchyard. \"Perhaps the guide will tell us something,\" Wyman suggested, and at once began to scan its pages, while we stood in the rank grass beneath the shadow of that magnificent arch which is the admiration of all modern builders. Presently he pointed out to me the original measurements, showing that the nave had been one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-four</span> feet long by twenty-eight feet wide and seventy-five feet high, which after careful comparison with other calculations, made it clear that the grand altar must have stood eighty-six feet from the broken pier of the central tower where we stood. We had fortunately purchased a measuring tape in Peterborough; therefore, without delay, we marked out eighty-six feet in a direct easterly direction towards the open fen pastures straight before us, and, looking round, discovered..."]
