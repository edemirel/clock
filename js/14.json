A week ago yesterday they arrived in town, and, contrary to expectation, came in a very private manner.

John Hidle from Stavanger County, Norway, also emigrated in 1836, coming direct to La Salle County. In 1838 he settled at Lisbon, Kendall County, being thus the first Norwegian to locate there and as far as I have been able to find out, the first Norwegian to settle in that county (for Ole O.

When he was but <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> he was required to produce daily a short Latin declamation and to keep a written record of the perennial flow of his father's Latin verse.

This method of equalizing salaries was extended to every section of the city and to every branch of the government. No attempt, apparently, was made to devise some system that would adjust salaries in various localities to local conditions and cost of living.

Loose specimens of rubber prepared during that decade still exhibit no signs of mildew growth.

Of course, there is knowledge about sex which has to be given to the very youngest child, and more and more must be given as they grow older and ask more questions. But what I have in mind here is that detailed and precise knowledge which must be given to the young when they approach the period of puberty. At this age of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> or fifteen the man will take each of the boys apart, and the woman will take each of the girls, and will explain to them what they need to know. This duty will not be trusted to parents, for parents have an imbecile fear of talking straight to their children, and try to get by with rubbish about bees and flowers.

All this was, however, but the work of a few minutes. Most of the Frenchmen were killed; our own wounded amounted to only nine seamen and Mr Chucks, the boatswain, who was shot through the body, apparently with little chance of surviving.

As soon as they were all on board, and laid on the deck--for there were, as near as I can recollect, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> wounded Frenchmen as well as our own--two ropes were got out forwards, the boats were manned, and we proceeded to tow the brig out of the harbour. It was a dead calm, and we made but little way, but our boat's crew, flushed with victory, cheered, and rallied, and pulled, with all their strength. The enemy, perceiving that the privateer was taken, and the French boats drifting empty up the harbour, now opened their fire upon us, and with great effect.

She lived through this ordeal and a trying marital experience, and her children rose up and called her blessed.

Robert Turner states that Hound's Tongue \"cures the biting of dogs, either mad or tame. I lay <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> weeks once under a chyrurgeon's hand for cure of a dog's biting; but, at last, I effected the cure myself, by applying to the wound Hound's Tongue leaves, changing them once in four-and-twenty hours.\" The plant has a strong and disagreeable odour, which Gerarde tells us caused the Dutchmen to change the plant's name, substituting for \"Tongue\" an impolite word, expressive of the odour of the foliage.----_Cynoglossum_ is a herb of Saturn. =HOUSELEEK.=--The House-leek...", "...on the steps.\" During this time they read bits at random out of Lucas's work.

We knew that it brought a good stream down, as full of fish as of pebbles; and we thought that it must be very pretty to make a way where no way was, nor even a bullock came down to drink. But whether we were afraid or not, I am sure I cannot tell, because it is so long ago; but I think that had something to do with it. For Bagworthy water ran out of Doone valley, a mile or so from the mouth of it. But when I was turned <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old, and put into good small-clothes, buckled at the knee, and strong blue worsted hosen, knitted by my mother, it happened to me without choice, I may say, to explore the Bagworthy water. And it came about in this wise. My mother had long been ailing, and not well able to eat much; and there is nothing that frightens us so much as for people to have no love of their victuals. Now I chanced to remember that once at the time of the holidays I had brought dear mother...", "...is called the snake-bird because of its long, slender, snake-like neck, which looks very like the anterior portion of a water-snake when the bird swims, as it often does, with the body submerged. If danger threatens the bird usually sinks in the water until every part of it except the beak disappears. This certainly is a method of hiding superior to that said to be adopted by the ostrich. The snake-bird is a rapid swimmer, and as it frequently remains under water for thirteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> seconds at a time, it is able to move considerable distances while completely submerged. The snake-bird is a powerful flier. While on the wing it does not retract its neck after the manner of the heron, but progresses with neck extended. The neck being so slender gives the bird a comic appearance and renders it easy to identify during flight. When resting from its piscatorial labours it betakes itself to the edge of the _jhil_ or to an islet and squats there to dry its...", "...of all sorts of merchandise, there is an immense saving of time and cost. Travelling by sea has changed entirely the aspect of this kind of transit. With spacious saloons, well-aired sleeping-apartments, roomy promenades protected from the weather, and a steady-going ship, a voyage even to distant lands is now little more than an excursion of pleasure. Eight miles an hour was considered fair work for the steamers of a dozen years ago; the present average rate of steaming on the Clyde is <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles an hour. A very fine vessel, named the _Tourist_, which was exhibited on the Thames during the holding of the 'world's show' last summer, performed seventeen miles with perfect ease.

How she acted at this crisis in her life is best told by herself. \"My husband had been collecting for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years information and materials on a certain subject.

The fact that such an exact scholar as Mr. Sparks does not mention a sign or tradition of an embankment at B C, only <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years after Mr. Lewis \"surveyed\" it, is evidence that it never existed, which cannot come far from convicting the latter of a positive intention to speculate. However, it is well known how loosely early surveying was done. Mr. Sparks gives us four sides for Fort Necessity. Three of these have been described as C A, A B and the broken line B E D.

Of surpassing interest and importance was the magnetic work done by James Clark Ross, a nephew of Sir John.

The locality to which the compass turns is, in fact, nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred miles to the _south_ of the north pole. With this expedition in 1830, James Clark Ross by his many observations proved that the _north magnetic pole_, to which the needle of the compass points, was then very near Cape Adelaide, in 70 deg. 05' north latitude, 96 deg. 44' west longitude.[1] The adventures of the crew in their retreat from Boothia Land by boat and sledge are recorded in this sketch. * * * * * Captain Ross failing to...", "...and the new industrial South, pointing out that as the economic interests of the South were no longer sectional but national, it must follow that politically there is no longer a reason for \"the solid South.\" * * * * * On leaving the Cabinet one day at about this time the President's youngest son, Quentin, came up to me.

How unrelated much of our teaching is to the daily life is well shown by inquiries recently made of the children of New Jersey by Professor Earl Barnes. Inquiries were made of the country school children in two agricultural counties of the State as to what vocation they hoped to follow. As I recall the figures, of the children at seven years of age 26 per cent desired to follow some occupation connected with country life. Of those at <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years, only 2 per cent desired such occupation. This remarkable falling off Professor Barnes ascribes in part to the influence of the teacher in the country schools, who is usually a town or city girl. The teacher measures everything in terms of the city. She talks of the city. She returns to the city at the end of the week. In the meantime, all the beauty and attractiveness and opportunity of the country may be unsuggested.

Loudness is regulated by the quantity of air and force of expulsion.

Indeed, having to teach Euclid, I found to my amazement that it was about something, and actually was a coherent and reasoned scheme of things, not a mere madhouse puzzle, as I had always imagined. But then my own geometrical instruction had been limited. It consisted simply in this: Fourteen Euclids were served out to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> small boys. The mathematical master then said: \"Learn the Definitions, Axioms, and Postulates.\" That was my first and my last lesson in geometry; though I duly went through the accustomed books of Euclid, trying to learn by heart what was to me mere unmeaning gibberish.

In January, 1808, the United States issued to him a patent for the invention for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years from that date. It was contended, for the nonsuit, that after the expiration of the plaintiff's privilege granted by the state, the right to his invention became invested in the people of the state, by an implied contract with the government, and, therefore, that congress could not consistently with the constitution grant to the plaintiff an exclusive right to the invention.

Hence Hales and Jackson, following the larger numbers in the genealogies of the Septuagint, place the date of the creation at a point about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred years prior to that fixed upon by Usher. ANCIENT AND MODERN HISTORY. The periods of history are not divided from one another by merely chronological limits, according to intervals of time of a definite duration. Such a classification may be of use to the memory, but it is arbitrary in its character. The landmarks of history are properly placed at the turning-points where new eras take their start, whether the intervals between them are longer or shorter. Of...", "...in every direction through the jungle. Ruined dagobas and temples jutted their rugged summits above the tree-tops, and many lines of stone columns stood in parallel rows, the ancient supports of buildings of a similar character to those of Pollanarua and Anarajahpoora. We were among the ruins of ancient Mahagam. One of the ruined buildings had apparently rested upon seventy-two pillars. These were still erect, standing in six lines of twelve columns; every stone appeared to be about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet high by two feet square and twenty-five feet apart. This building must therefore have formed an oblong of 300 feet by 150. Many of the granite blocks were covered with rough carving; large flights of steps, now irregular from the inequality of the ground, were scattered here and there; and the general appearance of the ruins was similar to that of Pollanarua, but of smaller extent. The stone causeway which passed through the ruins was about two miles in length, being for...", "...cove back of Point St. Ignace in 1679 while La Salle, \"very finely dressed in his scarlet cloak trimmed with gold lace,\" knelt, his companions about him, and again heard mass where the bones of Marquette were doubtless even then gathered before the Jesuit altar. Thence they pushed on to Green Bay, where some of his advance agents had gathered peltries for his coming. The _Griffin_, loaded with these, her first and precious cargo, was sent back to satisfy his creditors, and La Salle with <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> men put forth in their canoes for the land of his commission, of \"buffalo-hides,\" and of \"the way toward Mexico.\" I will \"make the _Griffin_ fly above the crows,\" La Salle is recorded to have said more than once in his threat toward those of the Black Gowns who were opposing his imperious plans, because they aimed at the occupation, fortification, and settlement of what the order still hoped to keep for itself. But the flight of this aquatic griffin gave to La Salle no good...", "...not, in other points, recommendable at all!--Here, of the night before, is something better:-- TO WILHELMINA. \"NEAR WEISSENFELS [OBSCHUTZ, in fact; does not know yet what the Battle will be CALLED], 5th November, 1757. \"At last, my dear Sister, I can announce you a bit of good news.

It was a kind of Apostolic apprenticeship. Then his evangelistic plans were laid; his powers were practised; his methods of teaching and administration formed and tested. This first, unnoted period of Paul's missionary life held, we imagine, much the same relation to his public ministry that the time of the Arabian retreat did to his spiritual development. [33] These <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years probably amounted to something less in our reckoning,--say, from 38 to 51 A.D. Some six years elapsed before Paul was summoned to Antioch. We are apt to think of the Apostle Paul only as we see him in the full tide of his activity, carrying \"from Jerusalem round about unto Illyricum\" the standard of the cross and planting it in one after another of the great cities of the Empire, \"always triumphing in every place;\" or issuing those mighty Epistles whose voice...", "...sat at Lady Harcourt's right and left, so that Bertram was not called upon to say much to her during dinner.

Each person's voice makes another person emulous, and the difficulty felt is not as to what one shall say, but how one shall get it in. Ten, and twelve, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> are the silent numbers. Every now and again Harcourt endeavoured to make Bertram join in the conversation; and Bertram did make some faint attempts.

The main body of the army, under Merci himself, lay behind a village a couple of hundred yards beyond the hills, and at the head of the passage between them. He had his cavalry on his two wings, his infantry in the centre, and had thrown forward some regiments to hold the village. On the two hills he had planted his cannon, sheltered by intrenchments, and in a position to sweep the entrance to the valley. His army consisted of between <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> and fifteen thousand men, that of Enghien of seventeen thousand. After examining the position a council of war was held. Turenne was strongly against attacking the enemy in a position of such strength, but Enghien as usual overruled his opinion. Turenne then urged that the cavalry on the wings should not charge up the hills and attack the positions held there until the enemy's centre had been defeated, and his advice in this respect was taken. The generals then separated and...", "...two complaints. \"As a matter of fact, I don't believe in any hours for work.

I am sorry to say that the Australian child is rather inclined to be a little too \"free and easy\" in his manners. The climate makes him grow up more quickly than in Great Britain. He is more precocious both mentally and physically. At a very early age, he (or she) is entrusted with some share of responsibility. That is quite natural in a new country where pioneering work is being done. You will see children of ten and twelve and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age taking quite a part in life, entrusted with some little tasks, and carrying them through in grown-up fashion. The effect of all this is that in their relations with their parents Australian children are not so obedient and respectful as they might be. This does not work for any great harm while the child is young. Up to fifteen or sixteen the son or daughter is perhaps more helpful and more companionable because of the somewhat relaxed discipline.

Day after day he would abstain from going to school that he might go forth into the woods and study the habits of the chipmunk. For five years his health was impaired to such a degree that he was not well enough to safely attend school, but just barely robust enough to drag himself away to a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles, where he could snare suckers and try to regain his health. To climb a lightning-rod and skin off the copper wire for snaring purposes with him was but the work of a moment.

Professor White, their father, had died suddenly some years before, while on an expedition out in quest of scientific data, but the White family possessed almost unlimited means, so that Major Dale's sister, while lonely enough in life without her husband, had the pleasant duty of bringing up two talented and good looking boys in a way that befitted the positions they would occupy as their father's sons--the White family being among the most aristocratic in New York...", "...scheme slumbered for years. When the route was surveyed through Princeton, where Commodore Stockton lived, he became interested, and he induced his father-in-law, John Potter, of South Carolina, who had over $500,000 in the United States Bank, to withdraw the money and invest it in the canal, he being the chief shareholder. Thus his fortune was not only saved from the bank's subsequent collapse, but was increased by the profitable investment.

The only sudden elevation of which there is any record occurred in 1822, and this seems to have been less than three feet. Since that year, I was assured by several competent observers, that part of an old wreck, which is firmly embedded near the beach, has sensibly emerged; hence here, as at Chiloe, a slow rise of the land appears to be now in progress.

The general tenor and effect are best seen in Massachusetts, which may be selected as a typical State. In 1837, Massachusetts passed a law \"to restore the trial by jury, on questions of personal freedom.\" This secured to the prisoner a writ of personal replevin, which was to be issued from and returnable to the Court of Common Pleas for the county in which the plaintiff was confined, and was to be issued <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days at least before the return day. If the prisoner were secreted, the court might send out a capias to take the body of the defendant. This act allowed an appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court. In 1842, the Latimer case[276] occurred. This so aroused public sentiment that a great petition, signed by sixty-five thousand people, was sent to the legislature, asking for a new personal liberty law. On the basis of the Prigg decision, a law was enacted which forbade State...", "...had rendered practicable; and the mutual obligation of the states seemed to cease with the hopes on which it had been founded. Several impatiently threw off the yoke which had always been irksome; others hastened to seize the helm which they had unwillingly seen in the hands of Gustavus, but which, during his lifetime, they did not dare to dispute with him. Some were tempted, by the seductive promises of the Emperor, to abandon the alliance; others, oppressed by the heavy burdens of a <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years' war, longed for the repose of peace, upon any conditions, however ruinous. The generals of the army, partly German princes, acknowledged no common head, and no one would stoop to receive orders from another. Unanimity vanished alike from the cabinet and the field, and their common weal was threatened with ruin, by the spirit of disunion. Gustavus had left no male heir to the crown of Sweden: his daughter Christina, then six years old, was the natural heir. The...", "...every square shall be attacked and every bishop guarded by another bishop. I give one way of arranging them in the diagram. It will be noticed that the two central bishops in the group of six on the left-hand side of the board serve no purpose, except to protect those bishops that are on adjoining squares. Another solution would therefore be obtained by simply raising the upper one of these one square and placing the other a square lower down. 299.--BISHOPS IN CONVOCATION. The <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> bishops may be placed in 256 different ways. But every bishop must always be placed on one of the sides of the board--that is, somewhere on a row or file on the extreme edge. The puzzle, therefore, consists in counting the number of different ways that we can arrange the fourteen round the edge of the board without attack. This is not a difficult matter. On a chessboard of n squared squares 2n - 2 bishops (the maximum number) may always be placed in 2^n ways without attacking....", "...or sixteen centuries, and is therefore preferable to any design which might be newly contrived.

In the sources the makers of history, or those who stood close to them, are allowed to speak for themselves, or for their times, and the study of such materials not only helps plant in the student's mind the conception of fairness and impartiality in judging historical characters, but also cultivates the habit of tracing things back to their origins and verifying what others have asserted about them.

The genealogies of Jesus prefixed to two of the gospels are intended to prove that He was a son of David. But not that alone, for in Matt. i. he is traced back to Abraham the father of the Jews, whilst in Luke iii. He, as the second Adam, is traced back to the first man. The two lists are hopelessly inconsistent; not because one of them follows the line of Mary, but because they represent independent attempts. That in Matthew is characteristically arranged in three series of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> generations each through the kings of Judah, whilst Luke's passes through an almost unknown son of David; in spite of this, however, both converge in the person of Zerubbabel.

Upon detection, accompanied by complete proof, the punishment is severe. It consists in being condemned for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years, or for life, to the galleys, and in branding the delinquent with letters denoting his crime: _B F_ for Fraudulent Bankruptcy. At one of the trials of the Aix assizes, at which I was present, a young man of excellent family, son of the Chevalier de St Louis, was convicted of this crime, and although it was proved that he had been deceived by his partner, a man of decidedly bad character, but possessed of deep cunning, he was condemned for fourteen years to the galleys:...", "...on the trip.

First, with regard to the leaders. Bolshevism was founded in 1903, through a split among the Russian Socialists, which took the form of a revolt against Lenin. Who led the revolt? The Jew Martoff, and he was supported by all the most conspicuous Jews in the party, including Trotsky himself.[61] They were followed by the great bulk of the rank-and-file of so-called Jewish Socialists. How true this is, can be shown by an analysis of the Leninite party <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years later. In the autumn of 1917 the Bolsheviks themselves published a statistical analysis of the constituents of the Soviets, with special regard to their geographical and ethnographical distribution. It was there shown that the Bolsheviks had a clear majority over the Mensheviks, or non-Bolshevist Socialists, and that they were far more largely composed of pure Russian elements than the Mensheviks.

We have a compulsory education law, but it is enforced according to the local conditions of different districts,--a sort of local option which is applied where the people of the counties of the districts desire it.

The individuals that hatch from eggs are generally wingless females, and their young, born alive, are both winged and wingless. The winged forms fly to other plants and start new colonies. Plant lice mature in from eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days. The plant louse gives off a sweetish fluid of which some ants are very fond.

The only other family of birds running to such extremes is that of the birds of prey, which include at once the stately condor of the Andes with its wing-spread of fifteen feet, and the miniature red-legged falconet of India and adjoining countries, in which the same measurement would scarcely reach as many inches.

But Mr. Smith soon perceived a distinct demand for a series adapted to the Western market and supplied near at hand. He had the courage to follow his convictions. Mr. Winthrop B. Smith was born in Stamford, Conn., September 28, 1808, the son of Anthony and Rebecca (Clarke) Smith. He was, in his youth, an employee in a book-house in New Haven. At the age of eighteen he went to Cincinnati, declaring that he would not return to his home until he was independent. He labored there <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years before he returned, not rich, but established in an independent career. He often declared that until 1840, he was \"insolvent, but no one knew it.\" Before entering business, Mr. Smith received a sound common school education. This, grounded on a nature well endowed with common sense, great energy, and strong determination, qualified him for success in business. He became a man of great originality, clear-headed and far-sighted. Toward his employees he was just, but...", "...of the said ship, Captain Morgan commanded the bodies of the miserable wretches who were blown up to be searched for as they floated on the sea: not to afford them Christian burial, but for their clothes and attire; and if any had gold rings on their fingers these were cut off, leaving them exposed to the voracity of the monsters of the sea. At last they set sail for Savona, the place of their assignation. There were in all fifteen vessels, Captain Morgan commanding the biggest, of only <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> small guns. His number of men was 960. Few days after they arrived at the Cabo de Lobos, south of Hispaniola, between Cape Tiburon and Cape Punta de Espada. Hence they could not pass, by reason of contrary winds, for three weeks, in spite of every effort to do so. Then Captain Morgan doubled the cape, and spied an English vessel at a distance.

Johnson's writings are now much less read than they deserve to be. For this there are a variety of causes. Fourteen years before he died, William Wordsworth was born at Cockermouth; and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years after his death Wordsworth and Coleridge published the volume which, more perhaps than any {172} other, started English literature on its great voyage into seas unsailed and unimagined by Johnson.

The term of residence before divorce could be obtained was lengthened; certain changes were made in the legal grounds for divorce; in less than twenty years <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> States limited the privilege of divorced persons to remarry until after a specified time had elapsed, varying from three months to two years. Congress passed a uniform marriage law for all the territories.

The doctrine of human deification is carried to such an extent that Indra and other mythological gods are said to tremble lest they should be supplanted by men.

Circumstance, shyness and fastidiousness had caused him to ignore most of the rather frequent opportunities to philander that his good looks and lively imagination created, and upon the rare occasions when he had paused, it was because of curiosity--a curiosity quickly sated. Of course, he had been in love. At twelve years he had betrothed himself to the girl who sat across the aisle, at fifteen, he exchanged rings and vows with a lady of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> who lived in the next block, at seventeen he conceived a violent affection for the merry Irish girl who presided over his uncle's kitchen--but Norah scoffed, and remained true to the policeman on the beat, and Martin, for a space, embraced the more violent teachings of anarchy and dreamed with gloomy glee of setting off a dynamite bomb under a certain uniformed prop of law and order.

This we found equally difficult, the dog had such fast hold of his throat. He was, indeed, perfectly furious. Dennis, by my direction, cut a strong pole twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet long, which we laid across the brute's back, and pressed him down as tightly as we could, which, with the able assistance of Nep. kept my gentleman tolerably quiet till the old man cut and twisted a couple of withes, which he passed under the bear, near the hind and forelegs, and secured him firmly to the pole, which my companions lifted on their shoulders, from which the beast now hung suspended, and commenced our march homewards.

Now and then some girl with an inclination to plumpness has to put up with the officers' coarse witticisms. There, for instance, is Handsome Sara from Cimrishamn, whom everybody knows.

The Greeks galloped bravely to oppose the onset, but the rush of the Bactrians scattered them like chaff. The P[oe]onian cavalry under Aristo was then sent forward with better success. The wild troops of Bessus were curbed and forced back for a space, and Chares could see the bull-necked viceroy raging among them in a frantic endeavor to make them stand. Finding all his efforts in vain, he ordered the main body of the Bactrian cavalry, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> thousand in all, to charge.

It was intolerable that he should interfere in a purely private falling-out between one gentleman and another, but there was nothing to be done. The policeman weighed close upon <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> stone, and could have eaten Mr. Buffin.

I heard Emery call, \"Look out for the big rock!\" then over I went. The wind and water together had turned my boat sideways, and try as I would I could not get it turned around. I saw the rock Emery referred to straight ahead of me. It was about fifteen feet square and about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet from the shore, with a powerful current shooting between the rock and the shore. It seemed as if I must strike the rock broadside, and I ceased my struggle, but held out an oar with both hands, hoping to break the blow. But it never came. The water struck this rock with great force, then rebounded, and actually kept me from even touching the rock with the oar, but it caught the boat and shot it through the narrow channel, bow first, as neatly as it could possibly be done,...", "...of public funds.

They were in principle against any State which violated their somewhat hazy ideas on the subject of Capital: while professing to aim at the holding of wealth in common they secured a great...", "...after mile the bottom of the long valley of Khor Ahrusa, and no provision had been made, or had been thought necessary, for culverts in the embankments where minor hollows were crossed. Thus, when the flood came, it was not merely that the railway was cut through here and there by the rushing deluge. It was covered deep in water, the ballast was swept away, and some of the banks so destroyed that in places rails and sleepers were left hanging in the air across a wide gap.' Nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles of track were destroyed. The camp of the construction gangs was wrecked and flooded. Some of the rifles of the escort--for the conditions of war were never absent--were afterwards recovered from a depth of three feet of sand. In one place, where the embankment had partly withstood the deluge, a great lake several miles square appeared. By extraordinary exertions the damage was repaired in a week. As soon as the line as far as Kosheh was completed, the advance towards...", "...the aid of Anubis and the sacred birds, Isis ascertained these facts, and then went to the royal city.

This she seized and returned with it, and concealed it in the depth of a forest, but Typhon discovered it, and cutting the body into <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> pieces scattered them hither and thither. After a tedious search, Isis found thirteen pieces, the fishes of the Nile having eaten the other. This she replaced by an imitation of sycamore wood, and buried the body at Philae, which became ever after the great burying place of the nation, and the spot to which pilgrimages were made from all parts of the country.

His mother was Anne Cookson, the daughter of a mercer in Penrith. His paternal ancestors had been settled immemorially at Penistone in Yorkshire, whence his grandfather had emigrated to Westmorland. His mother, a woman of piety and wisdom, died in March 1778, being then in her thirty-second year. His father, who never entirely cast off the depression occasioned by her death, survived her but five years, dying in December 1783, when William was not quite <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old. The poet's early childhood was passed partly at Cockermouth, and partly with his maternal grandfather at Penrith. His first teacher appears to have been Mrs. Anne Birkett, a kind of Shenstone's Schoolmistress, who practised the memory of her pupils, teaching them chiefly by rote, and not endeavouring to cultivate their reasoning faculties, a process by which children are apt to be converted from natural logicians into impertinent sophists. Among his schoolmates...", "...edges instead of on the flat sides. I refer to instances where the road is to be ten inches and over. Then put on a light coat or course of one and one-half inch stone, with a light coat of binding, and then put on the roller, thus setting the finer stone well with the foundation and compacting the whole mass together. After the macadam or telford foundation is well laid and compacted, the surface or wearing stone is put on. If the thickness of the road is great enough, say twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches, this surface stone should be put on in courses, say of three and four inches, as may be required for the determined thickness of the road. On each course there should be applied a binding, but only sufficient to bind the metal together or fill up the small interstices. It must be remembered that broken stone is used in order to form a compact mass. The sides of the stone should come together and not be kept apart by what we call binding material; therefore only such...", "...by putting a thin piece of muslin between the fungus and the sponge.

He wrote but little, and that only for the Transylvania Journal of Medicine, edited by two of his colleagues, Professors Cooke and Short. His first article did not appear until 1828, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years after he had begun practice. It was on injuries of the head. It abounded in original views, and did much to shape surgical thought at the time. Today it may be consulted with profit. His second paper was on hydrocele; in this he advocated the operation by incision and removal of the sac. He read so little that he fell into the error of believing that he was the originator of the procedure.

In addition to these men there was a division under General De Villiers operating in Griqualand West, and another under Commandant Van der Merwe in Bechuanaland. The total numbers of these two divisions amounted to about seven hundred men.

Another good rule is to spend no more for meat, fish, and eggs than for milk, and as much for fruits and vegetables as for meat, fish, and eggs.

Three quarts of milk at <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> cents a quart will yield about 2,000 calories. For an expenditure of forty-two cents for beef as free from waste as milk, we would pay perhaps thirty-two cents per pound. A pound and a quarter of lean beef would yield about 1,000 calories. So as fuel alone the milk would be twice as cheap as the meat. Three quarts of milk would yield almost if not quite as much protein as the meat and a liberal supply of calcium to offset the iron furnished by the meat.

He was forced to make peace with the Romans, and to give them hostages, one of whom was Antiochus the Younger, brother of Seleucus, who was heir to the throne. Antiochus for thirteen years languished miserably as a hostage at Rome. His father, Antiochus the Great, was either slain in B.C. 187 by the people of Elymais, after his sacrilegious plundering of the Temple of Jupiter-Belus;[568] or murdered by some of his own attendants whom he had beaten...", "...While one must not press the identity between the scholar and the professor too hard--for a number of reasons--the fact remains that the teaching profession provided the main reservoir from which the country drew.

Mr. Rogers will remember our visit with that astonishing girl at Lawrence Hutton's house when she was <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old. Last July, in Boston, when she was 16 she underwent the Harvard examination for admission to Radcliffe College. She passed without a single condition. She was allowed only the same amount of time that is granted to other applicants, & this was shortened in her case by the fact that the question-papers had to be read to her.

'As to serving out my sentence,' replied the man, 'I can't say that I did; I was sentenced for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years, and I was in Sydney Cove little more than half that time.

The wind was strong from the north, and we travelled at about five miles per hour, the lake expanding as we rounded a promontory until it attained a width of about half a mile. Following the course of the lake for about five miles, we found a river flowing directly into...", "...in this dull place, in the brig; discontent and hard usage on board, and four hands to do all the work on shore. Give me a big ship. There is more room, better outfit, better regulation, more life, and more company. Another thing was better arranged here: we had a regular gig's crew. A light whale-boat, handsomely painted, and fitted out with stern seats, yoke and tiller-ropes, hung on the starboard quarter, and was used as the gig. The youngest lad in the ship, a Boston boy about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old, was coxswain of this boat, and had the entire charge of her, to keep her clean and have her in readiness to go and come at any hour. Four light hands, of about the same size and age, of whom I was one, formed her crew. Each had his oar and seat numbered, and we were obliged to be in our places, have our oars scraped white, our tholepins in, and the fenders over the side. The bowman had charge of the boat-hook and painter, and the coxswain of the rudder, yoke, and...", "...The next day she was still leaking badly, so they lightened her by throwing out some of the cargo. The next day after that, they cast overboard even the ship's furniture. So they drifted with little or no food, day after day and night after night, seeing neither sun nor star, despair growing upon their haggard faces. But Paul stood up and gave them good cheer, practically assuming command, and assuring them that every soul should be saved. At last, after drifting helplessly for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days, at midnight they heard the sound of breakers on some unknown shore. The {466} sailors sounded and found twenty fathoms, then again and found fifteen. Then, fearing to be cast on a rocky shore, they put out four anchors from the stern and waited for the day. Their situation was still desperate, the rain was falling in sheets, and in the pauses of the storm they could hear the roar of the surf. Some of the sailors now attempted to desert the ship.

THE LACHLAN RIVER. Evans started from Bathurst on the 13th of May, 1815. He commenced his journey along the fine flat country then known as Queen Charlotte Vale, maintaining a southerly course for a day or two; but finding himself still amongst the tributaries of the Campbell River, he retraced his steps some twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles in order to avoid a row of rocky hills. He then struck out more to the westward.

The general course of the river had been nearly south-west; but it there turned west-by-north. The width, found by extending a base line, was two hundred and thirty yards, and the depth, as it had generally been in the channel from Herdsman's Cove, was 3 fathoms; but in some parts there may not be more than 2, at low water. We arrived on board the sloop in the evening, with <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> swans, in time to get a short distance down the river, before the ebb tide had done running; and no place more convenient than Risdon Cove having offered itself, we anchored there next day, and proceeded to complete our water, and refit the sloop for returning to Port Jackson.

After a few unsuccessful preliminary trials, I quickly advanced to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred pounds. The stretching of the rope now proved so great an annoyance, that I substituted for it a stout leather band of double thickness, about two inches and a half wide, and which had been subjected to a process which was calculated to render it proof against stretching more than half an inch under any weight it was capable of sustaining.

A recent thorough investigation of 328 of these halls in Chicago showed a nightly attendance of some 86,000 young people, the average age of the boys being sixteen to eighteen years and of the girls <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> to sixteen years. Liquor was sold in 240 halls, 190 had saloons opening into them, in 178 immoral dancing went on unhindered. The worst halls had the least dancing and the longest intermissions. Everything was conducted so as to increase the sale of liquor, and between the hours of one and three A.M. the toughest element from the saloons, which close at one o'clock, poured into the halls to complete the debauch and to make full use of the special liquor license which is good...", "...with the great range of the Rocky Mountains towering in the west, and the illimitable plains stretching 600 miles to the Missouri River on the east, Denver is worthy of the attention and admiration of all who behold it.

It is a very important point in the study of pure Fetish to gain a clear conception of this arrangement of things in grades. As far as I have gone I think I may say <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> classes of spirits exist in Fetish. Dr. Nassau of Gaboon thinks that the spirits commonly affecting human affairs can be classified fairly completely into six classes.[15] Regarding the Fetish view of the state and condition of the human soul there are certain ideas that I think I may safely say are common to the various cults of Fetish, both Negro and Bantu, in Western Africa.

Sugar, ground with water into a thick syrup, is drawn off from the mill into great vats, where it is permitted to ferment; it is then taken into the still, where it is heated and vaporized, and the vapor carried up into high towers for condensation.

After getting some education, first from a hedge schoolmaster, and then from Dr. Keenan of Glasslough, Carleton set out for Dublin and obtained a tutorship. In 1830 he collected a number of sketches, and these were published under the title of \"Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry,\" and at once enjoyed considerable popularity. In 1834 came \"Tales of Ireland,\" and from that time forward till his...", "...immigrants considered desirable and qualified to enter.

The results illustrate the wonderful dimensions of the problem which the cities confront in the assimilation of the foreign element.

Fourteen hundred pounds a year is not great wealth; but it will enable a man to keep up a very respectable style of living: many people in society have got to live on a great deal less.

Eight voted for the tax, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> against it.

The Merino, consequently, rose into importance, and so great was the interest aroused, that from a thousand to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred dollars a head was paid for them. Some of the later importations, unfortunately, arrived in the worst condition, bringing with them those scourges of the sheep family, the scab and the foot-rot; which evils, together with increased supply, soon brought them down to less than a twentieth part of their former price.

The quarterly stipend was paid through various booksellers, but irregularly, so that the poor poet was frequently reduced to great straits, though L40 a-year (L200 of our money) was no bad allowance.

The first time I saw one of these serpents, I had approached very near before discovering it to be a living creature; it opened its mouth wide enough to have received a hat, and breathed on me.

But, halting at the threshold of this chamber, and knocking at the door, Olinthus said, 'Peace be with you!' A voice from within returned, 'Peace with whom?' 'The Faithful!' answered Olinthus, and the door opened; twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> persons were sitting in a semicircle, silent, and seemingly absorbed in thought, and opposite to a crucifix rudely carved in wood. They lifted up their eyes when Olinthus entered, without speaking; the Nazarene himself, before he accosted them, knelt suddenly down, and by his moving lips, and his eyes fixed steadfastly on the crucifix, Apaecides saw that he prayed inly. This rite performed, Olinthus turned to the congregation--'Men and brethren,' said he, 'start not to...", "...many ships are yearly laden thence to supply Flanders, Britannia[9], England, Scotland, Norway, and Denmark; and the produce of this fishing brings great riches into the country.

Antonio remained <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years in Frisland or Orkney; four years of that time along with his brother, and ten years alone after the death of Nicolo. The elder Zeno ingratiated himself so much into the favour of the prince, that he was appointed admiral of a fleet which was sent out upon an expedition against _Estland_[10], which lies between Frisland and Norway.

She was still beautiful, though her voice had begun to show signs of wear. Rossini seems to have fallen in love with her art and herself, and he wrote ten roles for her.

Under the earlier educational conditions the school, unable to handle...", "...do all any horse could. \"All right then. Now make good!\" and with a light spring she was again in the saddle. There is no time to dwell in detail upon that dark, cold, terrible ride between Front Royal and Luray. Beverly had never been so cold in all her life. She let Apache choose his own way, and take his own gait, which was now slow and doubtful, and then like an arrow, as his confidence grew. Luray was reached in time and skirted, then all was plain sailing to Sprucy Branch <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles beyond. Apache had often been to Luray and knew every inch of that road, but Beverly was by that time nearly numb from the cold.

But toward evening, as we sat silent and hardly conscious of where we were--subdued into that meditative calm that comes so surely after a conversational storm--some one shouted-- \"VENICE!\" And sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a great city, with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist of sunset.

This Venice, which was a haughty, invincible, magnificent Republic for nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred years; whose armies compelled the world's applause whenever and wherever they battled; whose navies well nigh held dominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotest oceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every clime, is fallen a prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay. Six hundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat of Commerce; her mart was the great commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the...", "...Other lamps of bronze, including several of an interesting character, are in the same collection. One of these represents a sea-deity; another has its handle shaped like a horse's head and neck; and in a third the orifice for the oil is heart-shaped, while the handle terminates in the head of a swan. There is also a series of three pensile lamps--two in the likeness of the head and neck of a griffin, and the third in that of a theatrical mask; as well as a candelabrum <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches high, terminating beneath in three legs with lions' claws (foreshadowing or repeating oriental motives), and above in a two-handled vessel on which to place the lamp.

Had all Ionians been like Solon and Xenophanes, had there been nothing of Mimnermus or Phocylides in their character, then the Athenians might have avoided the contrary charge of effeminacy and ignobility of purpose and merely aesthetical superiority with which they have been taxed. Contemporary with Phocylides was Theognis, a poet of whose gnomic elegies nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred lines are still extant. Some of these are identical with verses of Solon, and of other writers; yet we need not suppose that Theognis was himself an imitator. It is far more probable that all the gnomic poets borrowed from the same sources, or embodied in their couplets maxims of common and proverbial wisdom. That Aristotle so regarded one of their most important aphorisms on the architectonic supremacy of justice, we have already seen.

The Representatives of Rhode Island, forgetting past differences, voted to raise a hundred and fifty men for the expedition, till, learning that the project was neither ordered nor approved by the Home Government, they prudently reconsidered their action. They voted, however, that the colony sloop \"Tartar,\" carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> cannon and twelve swivels, should be equipped and manned for the service, and that the Governor should be instructed to find and commission a captain and a lieutenant to command her.

How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of my life I ran wild on a common, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas's books of voyages. At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country.

Such is the case with a deposit of volcanic ash which has been discovered in the superficial strata on the plains.[31] It lies scattered in great quantities in a number of localities in Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, and Colorado, having been found in no less than twenty counties in the first-mentioned State. It measures from two to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet in thickness in different localities, and is mostly found imbedded in yellow marl and clay, and has a somewhat striking appearance in the field, due to its snowy whiteness and to the sharpness of the plane which separates it from the underlying darker materials.

St. John saw it many years ago in Kansas, where it appeared as \"an exceedingly fine, pure white...", "...a certain quantity of Wine which hath not altered its nature.

I found it covered with a saline crust, which is the true Essential Salt of Vinegar, and not of the same nature with Tartar: for Tartar of Wine is scentless; whereas the Salt of Vinegar hath a pungent smell, being the Acid of Tartar subtilized by its union with the Sulphureous parts.

Long we hesitated over the letter home, telling of our new plans. Under the new laws, one must stay on a claim <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> months, instead of the eight months required when Ida Mary had filed. At last we wrote to explain that we were not coming home this spring. We were going on to a new frontier. Earnestly as we believed in the plans we had made, it was hard to make that letter carry our convictions, difficult to explain the logic of our moving to an Indian reservation so that Ida Mary could run a non-existent post office in order to mail copies of a non-existent newspaper to non-existent...", "...nevertheless, I made her understand that I wanted something to eat. She came out of the door and hollered for her husband in a shrill voice that would have done credit to a girl of eighteen. The old man came in from his garden and between the two of them they managed to get the idea that I was hungry, and they gave me a piece of bread--a very small piece--which was quite a treat. The house they lived in consisted of just two rooms--the kitchen and a bedroom. The kitchen was perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet square, eight feet of one side of it being taken up by an enormous fireplace. What was in the bedroom I had no way of telling, as I did not dare to be too inquisitive.

At one o'clock this wild winter morning the time came for a final effort to float the ship; and the steam-tug Cambria that had been waiting outside the Sands now moved in, and, guided by the riding light of the Champion lugger, anchored for this purpose in the swatchway, was cautiously manoeuvred in through the narrow channel, and feeling her way with the lead at great risk came even into the broken water in which the Mandalay was lying. This broken water was only <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> or fifteen feet deep, and though barely enough to float the tug-boat in a sort of raging smother of froth, was not deep enough to float the Mandalay, which required three feet more and still lay firm as a rock, and, like a tide-washed rock, was swept by the seas which were flying over her. Directed by the second coxswain, attempts were now made to get the Cambria's steel hawser on board the vessel, and in the boiling turmoil the Cambria came dangerously near the heap of...", "...tranquillity prevailed, there still came at intervals the light laughter of the unseen child. \"Can it be Sophie who is making such a noise?\" suddenly asked the lady-superintendent, whose nerves were somewhat upset by all the worry of the death which she foresaw.

She was now talking to it, so happy, so absorbed in her play, that she laughed quite heartily. \"Hold yourself up, mademoiselle,\" said she. \"Dance the polka, that I may see how you can do it! One! two! dance, turn, kiss the one you like best!\" Madame de Jonquiere, however, was now coming up. \"Little girl,\" she said, \"we have one of our patients here in great pain, and not expected to recover.

All these kopjes were until the day of our attack occupied by a force of 7,000 Boers, but to the west of them were a few lower hills and ridges which we held. We did not know exactly how far to the east the Boer kopjes extended; that is to say, we did not know how broad might be the line of their defences; all we knew was that there were other kopjes to the eastward, and that the enemy probably held them.

The study of Filicaja and Leonico having convinced him that he and all his contemporaries were working in a wrong direction, he resolved to attempt a general reform. In 1690, in conjunction with <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> others, he founded the celebrated academy of the Arcadians, and began the contest against false taste and its adherents. The academy was most successful; branch societies were opened in all the principal cities of Italy; and the influence of Marini, opposed by the simplicity and elegance of such models as Costanzo, soon died away. Crescimbeni officiated as secretary to the Arcadians for thirty-eight years.

During the same years England had launched ships of the type of the _Implacable_. In 1904 came the German ships _Hessen_, _Elsass_, and _Braunschweig_, and in 1905 and 1906 the _Preussen_ and _Lothringen_. They were well behind the English ships of the same years, for they displaced only 12,097 tons, made 18 knots, carried armor of from 9 to 10 inches in thickness, and a primary battery of four 11-inch guns, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> 6.7-inch guns, and twelve 3.4-inch guns, together with rapid firers and other guns in a secondary battery. England at this time was putting 12-inch guns in the primary battery of such ships as the _King Edward VII_.

They ranged in age from <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> to ten. One glance at their faces was sufficient to show that they belonged to the average healthy-minded, hearty, English schoolboy. A girl was pouring out coffee for the quartet. She was standing to her work. Her age might have been sixteen: in some respects she looked older, in some respects younger. She was a tall, slim girl, with a somewhat long face of a pale but clear olive. Her eyes were dark, large, and well cut; her brow was particularly noble. She had quantities of...", "...stars come out And twinkle overhead? I see the sun shine all the day, I gather daisies in my play, But oh, I truly wish that I Could see the stars bloom in the sky!

But I think that two sisters were never more unlike than were Gracie and Norma. Norma, who was the younger, was as orderly a little lady as one could wish to see, while Gracie was just the reverse. Often their mother would say, in a despairing tone, \"Gracie, I do wish you would care for your room and frocks as Norma cares for hers. Why, you go out with buttons loose, or entirely off your dress, or your frocks unmended, not to speak of the untidiness of your room....", "...the sudden cessation of the pain, such as often happens in calculus transit when the calculus passes into the intestine,--it is plain that his sufferings were caused by a gall-stone.

And then, to make the diagnosis more complete, this gentleman, after twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hours of pain, became jaundiced--in the end very much so. There was no absolute constipation, and the stools were of the color of clay from the absence of bile. The points of difference between renal colic and peritonitis are even better defined and easier recognized than those between it and hepatic colic. In intestinal colic there may be some inflation of the bowels, and if it continues a day or two there may be some tenderness; but it is for the most part...", "...runs a little sea, or rather lake of fresh water, sixty leagues long, and thirty broad; which disgorging itself into the ocean, dilates itself about the said two islands.

A brief stay of one day is better than not stopping at all, but to get even an inkling of its greatness and grandeur days and weeks must be spent in making trips up and down and into the canon. After having seen the canon at Bright Angel the next move should be to go to Grand View <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles up the canon. An all day's stage ride from Flagstaff to the canon was tiresome, but the two hours' drive through the pine woods from Bright Angel to Grand View is only pleasant recreation.

But Daubenton and Lacepede devoted serious attention to the nature of the cameleon; and the scrutiny of science has served to rectify a popular error. Cameleons have been brought alive to France, and a pair is now living in the Zoological Gardens of England. But till lately, they were known in Europe only through the preparations of our Museums of Natural History. This singular animal belongs to the lizard tribe, and is found in hot climates. Its length is from thirteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches; of which the tail counts for half. The head is surmounted by a kind of cartilaginous pyramid inclining backwards. The mouth is so formed as scarcely to afford a view of its disproportionably large swallow. For some time too, the cameleon passed for being devoid of hearing; but Camper has established that it possesses that faculty, though in a limited degree. The organs of sight on the other hand, are so acute as to exceed by far those of the lynx.

There would seem to be little doubt that this procedure was responsible for the prolonged freedom from mould growths. Market standards have varied to some degree since, with a tendency to prefer a paler product than that in vogue, say, six or seven years ago. Moreover, standardised methods of preparation have been introduced, with the result that sheets of a desirably high standard can be produced in from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days, when smoke-curing is conducted only during night hours. Some estates are equipped with smoke-houses which, by continuity of working day and night, provide smoke-dried rubber in from five to six days; but the actual hours of smoke-curing are approximately equal to those of the ordinary type of house. This tendency towards the production of sheets paler in colour than the old standard is probably largely responsible in the present for the commonly observed incidence of...", "...so strange was dysentery to that generation.

It lives in small herds or families of four or five individuals, and is not found in mountainous districts, but frequents low stony hills and arid desert wastes.

For a brief period he got a little schooling, first at Paris, next at Amsterdam, and then at Leyden; altogether the amount was insignificant, since he was not quite <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old when he actually found himself engaged in a diplomatic career. Francis Dana, afterward Chief Justice of Massachusetts, was then accredited as an envoy to Russia from the United States, and he took Mr. Adams with him as his private secretary.

In the year 1846 he was twice called to Rose Street U.P. Church, Edinburgh--Dr. Finlayson's--but the call was met each time with a firm refusal. Dr. Eadie first brought himself into prominent notice as an author by the publication of a manual of Cruden, intended for popular use, about the year 1841. This abridged concordance has had an enormous sale among all classes, both at home and abroad. Up to the year 1850 it had gone through no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> different editions, and we believe that the latest edition issued is either the twenty-first or the twenty-third. The preface to Dr. Eadie's \"Cruden\" was furnished by Dr. King, and is a masterly performance of its kind. It is worth while noticing that no other copy of \"Cruden\" is used or recognised by the Tract Society, who have at different times issued it on their own account.

His shield was fastened by two bands in such a manner that it would not interfere with the use of the arm, and it was so hard that it would often turn a rifle shot. Hanging at his horse's mane was a war club which had been made by bending a withe around a hard stone, weighing about two pounds, and with a groove in it. Its handle of wood, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches in length, was bound with buffalo hide. Apparently the warrior carried no firearms, using only the ancient weapons of his tribe. His horse was a magnificent coal black, far larger than the ordinary Indian pony, and he stood with his neck arched as if he were proud of his owner. The Indian's gaze and manner were haughty and defiant. It was obvious to every one, and a low murmur ran among the men of the train. Phil recognized the warrior instantly.

Though it has not the ugly hump of the dromedary, it possesses the same callosities on the breast and knees; its hoof is divided in the same manner, and is of the same formation. Its internal construction, which enables it to go for a long time without drinking, is also similar.

In 1507 the municipalities of Espanola sent delegates to Spain to petition for the rights enjoyed by Spanish towns. The request was granted, and, among other privileges, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> towns were granted coats-of-arms. Conventions of delegates from the towns were often held in these early days, to consider common needs and to draw up memorials to the home government. In 1530 Charles V decreed that such conventions should not be held without his consent, and the tendency thereafter was toward stronger absolutism and away from local political life. But there never was a time when the right of petition was not freely exercised, and with great effect on actual...", "...here navigated by canoes, thirty to forty feet long, some being rudely cut out of a solid log of Sal, while others are built, the planks, of which there are but few, being sewed together, or clamped with iron, and the seams caulked with the fibres of the root of Dhak (_Butea frondosa_), and afterwards smeared with the gluten of _Diospyros embryopteris._ The bed of the river is here threequarters of a mile across, of which the stream does not occupy one-third; its banks are sand-cliffs, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet in height.

Thus it was fully apparent that while the Delawares and Shawanoes were sending one deputation to treat of peace with Bradstreet on Lake Erie, they were sending another to rouse the tribes of the Illinois to war.[416] From Fort Miami, the deputation had proceeded westward, spreading the contagion among all the tribes between the Mississippi and the Ohio; declaring that they would...", "...from Seneca Lake to Niagara, were the western doorkeepers of this household of nations, waging fierce war on their neighbors near Lake Erie. The wily Onondagas, wise old politicians, in the middle of the Long House, at Onondaga Lake, led in council. Their leading chief, the elected president of this first American republic, lit the central council-fire and sat in state among the fifty oyanders (sachems) who formed the Iroquois senate. Ten of these were always Caniengas (or Mohawks), and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> were Onondagas. These two nations and the Senecas were called brothers; while the intermediate Oneidas and Cayugas were always spoken of as nephews, because they were younger and less important nations, with fewer oyanders. Tekakwitha's father may have been one of the ten Mohawk oyanders, but there is more reason to believe that he belonged to a class of war-chiefs who took part only in councils of war. In 1656 these war-chiefs were very influential, for the Iroquois had...", "...strangers, listened to his teachings. His greatest work was an \"Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation,\" which extends from the landing of Julius Caesar to the year 731.

When Orson was seven years old his mother died, and the large family of Nathan Hyde, consisting of nine sons and three daughters, were scattered.

Seven years later, or when young Hyde was <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age, Mr. Wheeler moved from the state of Connecticut to Ohio, settling in the vicinity of Kirtland. Orson accompanied him and continued to live with him in Ohio for about four years, after which he engaged in various occupations on his own account, at last becoming a clerk in the firm of Gilbert & Whitney, merchants.

Of the franc tireurs eight were killed, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> wounded. Of the Uhlans forty-seven were killed, and nineteen wounded remained on the ground. Their large number of killed, in proportion to the wounded, was accounted for by the fact that the firing was so close that, in many cases, the coats of the dead men were actually singed by the explosion; while the slightly wounded men had been able to regain their horses, and escape. The first impulse of the young Barclays, when the fire ceased, was to turn round and to embrace...", "...he was deformed and delicate; and his figure, I am told, bore a resemblance to that of the celebrated Pope.

As the duke left Frederic in possession of the field, it was considered a Prussian victory. But it was a victory decisive of no results, as each party was alike crippled.

As Captain Townley was hard pressed by the Spaniards, he was forced to make a bold run through the before-mentioned narrow channel, between Pacheque and the three small islands; and Captain Harris was obliged to separate from us during the fight. Thus our long-projected design vanished into smoke. According to the report of some prisoners taken afterwards, the Spanish fleet consisted of fourteen sail, besides _periagoes_, or large boats of twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> oars each, and among these there were eight ships of good force, mounting from eight to forty-eight guns, with two fire-ships, and computed to contain 3000 men. In the morning of the 30th we saw the Spanish fleet at anchor, three leagues from us to leeward, and by ten a.m. they were under sail with an easy gale from the S. making the best of their way to Panama. In this affair we had but one man slain, but never knew the loss sustained by the Spaniards.

The crenellations of the palace walls consist of two rectangular masses, of unequal size, placed one upon the other. The lower is two bricks'-length, or about thirty-two inches, wide, and the thickness of three bricks, or about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches, high. The upper mass equals the lower in height, while its width is the length of a single brick, or sixteen inches. The total height of the battlement, between twenty-eight and twenty-nine inches, is thus divided into two masses, one of which is twice the size of the other (see Fig. 104). The battlements are all the same, and between each pair is a void which is nothing but the space a battlement upside down would occupy. Fill this space with the necessary bricks, and...", "...made them dress in a manner more suited to a cold climate.

In the night we stood towards the west-south-west with a southerly wind and got again into soundings.

Two years passed, and Jotham's oxen were almost forgotten. During the second winter, after school had closed in the old Squire's district, Willis Murch, a young friend of mine who lived near us, went on a trapping trip to the headwaters of Lurvey's Stream, where the oxen had disappeared and where he had a camp. One Saturday he came home for supplies and invited me to go back with him and spend Sunday. The distance was perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles; and we had to travel on snowshoes, for at the time--it was February--the snow was nearly four feet deep in the woods.

In order to simplify the calendar, this accumulating fraction of five hours, forty-eight minutes, forty-six seconds (about a quarter day) is added every four years to a bissextile year (leap-year), and thus we have uneven years of three hundred and sixty-five, and three hundred and sixty-six days. Every year of which the figure is divisible by four is a leap-year. By adding a quarter day to each year, there is a surplus of eleven minutes, <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> seconds. These are subtracted every hundred years by not taking as bissextile those secular years of which the radical is not divisible by four.

She made a brilliant appearance, and was much courted; everybody spoke with admiration of the air of fresh youth that hovered around her.

The legislature of Massachusetts, which was the representative of the church, set forth what it conceived to be the biblical ethics on the subject. Recognizing that \"lawful captives taken in just wars\" may be held in bondage, it declared among its earliest public acts, in 1641, that, with this exception, no involuntary bond-slavery, villeinage, or captivity should ever be in the...", "...fate, and before the death of James V. several others including Dominicans and Franciscans, laymen and clerics, were either burned or obliged to seek safety in flight.

Political influences, however, favoured the spread of the new doctrine. It had been the dream of Henry VII., as it was also the dream of his son and successor, to strengthen England at the expense of France, by bringing about an alliance and if possible a union between England and Scotland. It was in furtherance of this design that Henry VII. had given his eldest daughter in marriage to James IV., who was slain with most of his nobles in a battle with the English on...", "...out of the ship.

The custom of exposing dying people on the banks of the Ganges, does not appear to be so general as some travellers state. We sailed on the river for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days, during which time we passed many thickly populated towns and villages, and did not meet with a single case until today. The dying man lay close to the water, and several men, probably his relations, were seated round him, awaiting his decease. One dipped water and mud out of the river with his hands, and put them to the nose and mouth of the dying man. The Hindoos believe that if they die at the river with their mouths full of the holy water, they are quite certain to...", "...of age; 92 per cent of these children were engaged in hawking newspapers, the others being scattered through such occupations as peddling flowers, fruit and vegetables, fish, fancy goods, matches, bottles, pies and milk.[37] _Conditions in Germany_ In December, 1897, the German Imperial Chancellor, referring to the incomplete census returns as to child labor, requested the governments to furnish him with information as to the total number of children under <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> employed in labor other than factory labor, agricultural employment and domestic service, and the kinds of work done. In this circular he said: \"But, above all, where the kind of occupation is unsuitable for children, where the work continues too long, where it takes place at unseasonable times and in unsuitable places, child labor gives rise to serious consideration; in such cases it is not only dangerous to the health and morality of the children, but school discipline is...", "...is a correct aphorism, and is equally true whether applied to good or bad training, for if the mind be as it were mortgaged, or sacrificed to the priest in childhood,**-- * The spirit of priestianity may be, and is, repressed by science and philosophy; but it is utterly unchangeable. The children educated by the Druids to recruit their own ranks were secluded in woods and caverns, and denied all intercourse with their parents till after they had attained <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age. By this mental monopoly it was evidently meant that the esprit du corps, its secret ways and interests, should be so indelibly fixed upon the mind as to be ever afterwards proof against every natural affection. ** The more outrageous against Nature and reason the false notions instilled in childhood are the more difficult it seems to be to eradicate them. \"It was said of an Arab, who was a man of sense, an arithmetician, a...", "...enemy; and as Gabara would lie on his left flank when he moved to Jotapata, he took that city, whence his communications with his base could easily be threatened, first.

Furthermore, it was decided that King Arthur and Sir Mordred should meet in the plain between their hosts, each with <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> persons. 'I am glad of this,' said King Arthur, when he heard what had been done; but he warned his men that if they were to see a sword drawn they were to come-on swiftly and slay that traitor, Sir Mordred, 'for I in no wise trust him.' And in like wise spake Sir Mordred unto his host. Then they two met, and agreed on the truce, and wine was fetched and they drank, and all was well.

By the time the doctor's welcome hail of \"Din-ner!\" came ringing across the ice the bait pail was empty and they had <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> fish, none under three pounds, and from that up to six.

INDIANA REMINISCENCES OF LINCOLN. Abraham Lincoln grew to manhood in Southern Indiana. When he reached Spencer County in 1816, he was seven years of age; when he left in 1830, he had passed his twenty-first birthday. This period of a life shows usually the natural bent of the character, and we have found in these <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of Lincoln's life signs of the qualities of greatness which distinguished him. We have seen that, in spite of the fact that he had no wise direction, that he was brought up by a father with no settled purpose, and that he lived in a pioneer community, where a young man's life at best is but a series of makeshifts, he had developed a determination to make something out of himself, and a desire to know, which led him to neglect no opportunity to learn.

Owing to various delays, the Bill of Exclusion was not brought before the Peers until eighteen months later. Its introduction was followed by a debate lasting six hours, in which Shaftesbury distinguished himself by his force and bitterness. At nine o'clock at night the House divided, when the measure was rejected by a majority of thirty-three votes, amongst which were those of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> bishops present. Mortified by this unexpected decision, the violent passions of the defeated party hurried them on to seek the blood of those peers lodged in the Tower.

From that time the terms gentleman and officer, became synonymous. Every service, civil, military, naval, or ecclesiastic, was divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> grades. The lowest grade in the civil service was held by the registrar of a college, the highest by the Chancellor of the Empire; the cornet was at the bottom, the field marshal at the top in the army; and the deacon in a church was fourteen degrees removed from the Patriarch,--but all were _tchin_. When, in 1700, the Patriarch Adrian died, the dignity was abolished by Peter who did not relish the idea of a rival power in the State.

Napoleon was drilling his hundred rustics on the Island of Elba, and the Congress of Vienna had started upon that round of dinners and gayeties which was to decide the future destinies of the European continent. After the army came the question of a constitution. This problem was settled in the following way: A committee of fourteen members was appointed to make a constitution. These <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> gentlemen represented all the old parties. A concept-constitution, drawn up by Van Hogendorp long before the revolution took place, was to be the basis for their discussions. On the 2nd of March this committee presented the sovereign with a constitution which made him practically autocratic. There was to be a sort of parliament of fifty-five members elected by the provincial estates. But except for the futile right of veto and the exceptional right of proposing an occasional...", "...Clause 4.

The times were filled with conflict and struggle, and Dr. Bascom accepted the presidency of the University of Wisconsin, where he made a glorious record covering <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years.

Though he was obliged to make some disbursements, the largest being for a suit of clothes, he found himself, at the end of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> weeks, possessed of a balance of a hundred dollars. This was a source of great satisfaction to Walter, who had known in Chicago how inconvenient it was to be without money. One day the professor found himself in a Minnesota village.

There is doubt as to the species being distinct from _bancrofti_. Several other species occur in man and are thought to be transferred by various insects, among which have been mentioned Tabanidae and tsetse-flies, but there is no experimental proof in support of such conjectures. _Filaria immitis_ is a dangerous parasite of the dog, the adult worm living in the heart and veins of this animal.

The animal itself is so peculiar, that a brief description of it may not be here amiss. Its favourite haunts are bays into which streams empty themselves, and where the water is from two to five fathoms in depth, feeding on the 'Algae' of the submerged banks, for which purpose the upper lip is very large, thick, and as it turns down suddenly at right angles with the head, it much resembles an elephant's trunk shorn off at the mouth. Its length averages from eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet; there is no dorsal fin, and the tail is horizontal; colour blue, and white beneath. Its means of propulsion are two paddles, with which it also crawls along the bottom, and beneath which are situated the udders, with teats exactly like a cow's. Its flesh is far from bad, resembling lean beef in appearance, though hardly so good to the taste, and the skin can be manufactured into gelatine.

The lodge covering was supported by light, straight pine or spruce poles, about eighteen of which were required. Twelve cowskins made a lodge about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> feet in diameter at the base, and ten feet high. I have heard of a modern one which contained forty skins. It was over thirty feet in diameter, and was so heavy that the skins were sewn in two pieces which buttoned together.

The servants caught and shut up in a hen-house one of the young birds, which the thirst for rapine had doubtless impelled prematurely to leave the maternal abode. The next morning they were surprised to find at the door of the hen-house a freshly-killed Partridge. The idea was that the parent birds, attracted by the cries of the young Owl, had thus provided for its sustenance. The same thing occurred <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days running. M. Cronstedt, wishing to come to a right understanding on the matter, watched during several nights in order to surprise the hen bird in this act of maternal love. But he failed, probably because the bird, thanks to its penetrating sight, took advantage to leave her offspring's provisions at a moment when his attention was diverted. These parental duties ceased in the month of August, when the young bird became capable of providing for itself. The Great Owl...", "...flowers can be had to last for years by this beautiful art.

It was obvious that he had slept for twelve or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hours; and seeing his clothes laid out, dry, upon a chair, he got up and dressed. Then he went down to the living-room, where Prescott rose as he came in. \"You don't look much the worse,\" the rancher said. \"You had a fortunate escape.\" \"How did I get here?\" Jernyngham asked, leaning on the back of a chair, for he felt shaky still. \"That's more than I can tell. Svendsen found you outside the door when he tried to get across to the stable. You couldn't have been there...", "...having fed well, I slept soundly through fatigue. In that sleep, the noise of weeping and lamentation struck my ears; rubbing my eyes, when I looked round, then neither the old man nor any one else was in that apartment. I lay alone on the bed, and the room was quite empty. I began to look with alarm in all directions, and perceived a _parda_ in a corner which was down; going to it, I lifted it up, and saw that a throne was placed there, on which was seated an angelic woman of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age; her face was like the moon, and her ringlets on both sides [of her head] hung loose; she had a smiling countenance; and she was dressed like a European, and with a most charming air; she was seated [on the throne] and looking forward. The venerable old man lay prostrate before her, with his head on her feet, and he was weeping bitterly, and he seemed to have lost his senses. On seeing the old man's condition, and the woman's beauty and perfection, I was quite...", "...that were employed with him in the voyage--and namely of those which Sir Walter Ralegh himself, by his own letter to Secretary Winwood, had commended for persons of worth and credit, and as most fit for greater employments--his Majesty's proceedings have been grounded; whereby it will evidently appear how agreeable they have been in all points to honour and justice.

This proposition of his was presented and...", "...this view of the case, and claimed that the line should run, east and west, three miles north of the mouth of the river. At one time, a royal commission was appointed to consider the subject, but their labors produced no satisfactory result. At last the matter was carried to England for a decision, which was rendered by the king on March 5, 1739-40. His judgment was final, and in favor of New Hampshire. It gave that province not only all the territory in dispute, but a strip of land <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles in width, lying along her southern border, mostly west of the Merrimack, which she had never claimed. This strip was the tract of land between the line running east and west, three miles north of the southernmost trend of the river, and a similar line three miles north of its mouth. By the decision twenty-eight townships were taken from Massachusetts and transferred to New Hampshire. The settlement of this disputed question was undoubtedly a public benefit, although it...", "...on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne, Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.\"[36] The air was full of prodigies. There were terrible storms; the plague wrought fearful ravages. Rumors spread from lip to lip. Men spoke of monstrous births; of deaths by lightning under strange circumstances; of a brazen statue of Nero melted by the flash; of places struck by the brand of heaven in <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> regions of the city; of sudden darkenings of the sun. A hurricane devastated Campania; comets blazed in the heavens; earthquakes shook the ground. On all sides were the traces of deep uneasiness and superstitious terror. To all these portents, which were accepted as true by Christians as well as by pagans, the Christians would give a specially terrible significance. They strengthened their conviction that the coming of the Lord drew nigh. They convinced the better sort of...", "...Before taking leave of Rowlandson and Angelo, the most agreeable of companions, at Vauxhall, we must add a further note of another of their holiday jaunts, once more borrowed from the _Reminiscences_. 'Mrs. Weichsel (Mrs. Billington's mother) was the favourite singer at Vauxhall; upon one occasion she had her benefit at the little theatre in the Haymarket. Her daughter and son added considerably to the entertainment that night; though the former could not have been <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old, her execution on the pianoforte surprised everyone. The son, then a little boy, played a solo on the fiddle in such peculiarly fine style that the audience were both astonished and delighted. Exhibiting his early abilities standing on a stool, I was present that night with Rowlandson the artist, who made a sketch of him playing, which he afterwards finished for me, and which, within these few years, was within my collection.'

Dumbiedikes had been by this time transported into the best bedroom, used only upon occasions of death and marriage, and called, from the former of these occupations, the Dead-Room. There were in this apartment, besides the sick person himself and Mr. Novit, the son and heir of the patient, a tall gawky silly-looking boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> or fifteen, and a housekeeper, a good buxom figure of a woman, betwixt forty and fifty, who had kept the keys and managed matters at Dumbiedikes since the lady's death.

It was presented to Robert Morris. In a few days after his return Lieut. Barney spread the canvas of his little craft in company with the Andrew Dorin with <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> guns and the Lexington--all under the command of Capt. Barry and sailed for the West Indies. On their return they fell in with the British sloop of war Race Horse--tender to Admiral Parker's fleet, which he had sent out from Jamaica on purpose to capture these American \"small craft.\" After a sanguinary action of two hours the English nag was cut in pieces, distanced and surrendered at discretion.

Fourteen Normans, says the chronicler, were in the hall when Hereward burst in. When the sun rose there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> heads upon the gable. Escape had been impossible. Martin had laid the ladder across the door; and the few who escaped the master's terrible sword, stumbled over it, to be brained by the man's not less terrible axe.

Some symbologists have referred the fourteen pieces into which the mutilated body of Osiris was divided, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days during which the body of the builder was buried, to the fourteen days of the disappearance of the moon. The Sabian worshippers of \"the hosts of heaven\" were impressed with the alternate appearance and disappearance of the moon, which at length became a symbol of death and resurrection. Hence fourteen was a sacred number. As such it was viewed in the Osirian Mysteries, and may have been introduced into Freemasonry with other relics of the old worship of the sun and...", "...of bad men, on leaving the body, go at once into a spiritual state of being, where they will live immortally, as God decrees, never returning to be reinvested with the vanished charnel houses of clay they once inhabited.

Calvin lays great stress on it.18 Apinus and others, at Hamburg, maintained that Christ's descent was a part of his humiliation, and that in it he suffered unutterable pains for us. On the other hand, Melancthon and the Wittenbergers held that the descent was a part of Christ's triumph, since by it he won a glorious victory over the powers of hell.19 But gradually the importance and the redeeming...", "...Six days will be given to tilting with the lance, two to fights with the broadsword on horseback, two to fighting on foot at the barriers.

The men who worked at it had need to be enthusiastic, for they rose at half-past three in the morning, and frequently continued toiling for thirteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hours a day. This so wearied them, that they did not know how to keep awake; and Mr. Stevenson says they frequently went off in a profound slumber while standing or eating their meals.

A striking contrast was exhibited in October 1424, when a Stamford friar, John Russell, who had preached that any religious _potest concumbere cum muliere_ and not mortally sin, was sentenced only to retract his doctrine. Further persecutions of a whole batch of Lollards took place in 1428. The records of convocation in Chicheley's time...", "...resign.

Plaids, checks and bars, bright blues, crude violets and hideous crimsons, were seen in French merinos, Irish poplins and English alpacas. Women in short jackets, hooped skirts, hideous bonnets and shawls seemed to have banished their youth. The empress Eugenie, a leader of European fashion, decreed that white muslin should be the evening mode, and at balls, where the steels and whalebones of the crinoline were impossible, the women swelled their skirts by wearing a dozen or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> muslin petticoats at once. Towards the end of the 'sixties the crinolines disappeared as suddenly as they came, and by 1875 skirts were so tight at the knees that walking upstairs in them was an affair of deliberation.

The two armies at once drove the force left behind by Newcastle to take shelter within the walls of York, and formed the siege of that city.

He was not only completely dressed--as was to have been expected from Giorgio's story--but his gloves and his purse containing thirty ducats were still at his belt, as was his dagger, the only weapon he had carried; the jewels upon his person, too, were all intact, which made it abundantly clear that his assassination was not the work of thieves.

Thus in various years there are accounts raised dealing with cattle, hay, flour, flax,...", "...foals, and jennies also; this sight was to me one of peculiar interest. Accustomed as we are in England to value a jackass at thirty shillings, we look down upon them with contempt; but here the case is reversed: you look up at them with surprise and admiration. Several were shown standing fifteen hands high, with head and ears in proportion; the breed has been obtained from the Maltese jackass, crossed by those of Spain and the south of France. Those imported seldom average more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hands high; but the Kentuckians, by great attention and care, have raised them up to fifteen hands, and sometimes even to sixteen. But the price paid for these splendid animals, for such they really were, will prove how much they are in request. Warrior, a jackass of great celebrity, sold for 5,000 dollars, upwards of 1,000 pounds sterling. Half of another jackass, Benjamin by name, was sold for 2,500 dollars. At the show I asked a gentleman what he wanted for a very...", "...year III (1795) separated the various elements which the _D\u00e9p\u00f4t de la guerre_ had found means to preserve.

The _D\u00e9p\u00f4t de la guerre_ was restored solely to its ancient prerogatives. Two years before, it had been under the necessity of forming new geographical engineers and it succeeded in carrying the number sufficiently high to suffice for the wants of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> armies which France had afterwards on foot.[5] These officers being employed in the service of the staffs, no important work was undertaken. But, since the 18th of Brumaire, year VIII, (9th of November, 1799) the Consuls of the Republic have bestowed particular attention on geographical and topographical operations.

Why, when my Lottie was <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> she would have made two of you.\" Mary Rose squirmed. The unjust criticism was very hard to bear. She just had to murmur faintly that it would be some time before she would reach fourteen. \"H-m, I thought so.\" Mrs. Schuneman looked very wise, as if she understood perfectly and there is no doubt that she understood more than Mary Rose. \"Well, well,\" she said, while Mary Rose, scarlet and mortified, stood twisting the corner of Aunt Kate's apron. \"I--I hope you won't...", "...the previous day.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of ceaseless care were quite genuinely forgotten, and she saw him in his strength and in his glory. When Mr. Critchlow arrived at the eulogy of the husband and father, Mrs. Baines rose and left the showroom. The guests looked at each other in sympathy for her.

And so, after parting company with the Dossi, who had worked with him up to that time, he painted by himself in the Church of S.

His studies had, for the past <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years when he had begun to live and to write, passed through the most varied spheres possible to him. But he had passed through them, lending his presence without giving himself to them, with this idea always present in his mind: that he existed to become familiar with other customs, to watch other characters, to clothe other personages and the sensations which vibrated within them. The period of his revival was marked by the achievement of each one of his books which he...", "...Or stay, where be Tibble Steelman and Kit Smallbones?\" \"Tibble is in the hall, well-nigh as sad as uncle Ambrose,\" began Dick; but Giles, better able to draw conclusions, exclaimed, \"Tibble!

At the same time the obsolete curvatures in Brindley's old canal were converted into separate branches or basins, for the accommodation of the numerous mines and manufactories on either side of the main line.

The mother did not have a right to the guardianship of a son who was an heir. Male heirs of sokemen who were under the age of fifteen were in the custody of their nearest kindred. The son of a burgess came of age when he could count money, measure cloth, and manage his father's concerns. Female heirs remained in the custody of their lords until they married. The lord was bound to find a marriage for his ward when she became <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age and then deliver her inheritance to her. She could not marry without her lord's consent, because her husband was expected to be the lord's ally and to do homage to him. But if a female heir lost her virginity, her inheritance escheated to her lord. A woman with property could not do homage because she could not perform military service, but she generally swore fealty. She could receive homage from men. Bastards were not heirs, even if their father...", "...spring when father split them into rails and built the fence. I have often chased the timber wolves with my whip as I drove along. They would follow the team and then when I turned around to chase them they would turn and run in front of the team.

The following summer, my father being away, I planted some popcorn, which we had brought from the east, in this sod roof. It grew about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches high and my father, upon his return, was greatly puzzled by the strange crop which he found growing on his roof. When kindling was needed, my father would raise the puncheons which made our floor and hew some from these.

Five hundred paces west of the pueblo a wall, mostly fallen, encloses a kind of plaza, measuring four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> by nine hundred and thirty feet. The wall was about sixteen feet thick and eighteen in height, with terraces, or steps, on the inside. In the centre were the foundations of what the author supposes to have been a tower, and west of the enclosed area were three heaps of stones, supposed to be burial mounds. Two idols, one in human form, lacking head and feet, the other shaped like an alligator, were found here, carved from a stone called _tanamo_, much like the tetzontli. The...", "...which suddenly became vital at the time of the Renaissance, had long lain neglected on the shores of the dead sea which we call the Middle Ages. It was not their discovery which caused the Renaissance. But it was the intellectual energy, the spontaneous outburst of intelligence, which enabled mankind at that moment to make use of them. The force then generated still continues, vital and expansive, in the spirit of the modern world. How was it, then, that at a certain period, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> centuries after Christ, to speak roughly, humanity awoke as it were from slumber and began to live? That is a question which we can but imperfectly answer. The mystery of organic life defeats analysis.

Two passenger trains a day, and an occasional construction train, formed the only break in the monotonous life which I led. It was a dreadfully solitary existence.

The storm had risen and risen until it was blowing a perfect blizzard from the west.

It was on a bright August morning in 1864 that Admiral Farragut stood on the deck of his stanch frigate the \"Hartford,\" that had borne him through so many desperate battles. Around the flagship were clustered the vessels of the Gulf squadron. There was the battered old \"Brooklyn,\" scarred with the wounds of a dozen fights; the \"Richmond\" and the \"Itasca,\" that received their baptism of fire at the fight below New Orleans. In all there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> wooden vessels and four iron-clad monitors assembled in front of the strongest combination of harbor defences that warships ever yet dared attack. Yet Farragut was there that bright summer morning to enter that bay, and batter the forts of the enemy into subjection. To capture the city was not his purpose,--that he left to the army,--but the harbor forts and the great ram \"Tennessee\" must strike their colors to the navy. Before arranging for the attack, the admiral made a...", "...less. But a few days ago, when weighing sugar and tea, a blast of wind upset the scales, and a second allowance met with a similar fate.

The soldiers' last meal is generally served out about five o'clock in the afternoon, sometimes earlier; and a stretch of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hours intervenes between then and breakfast. About nine o'clock in the evening those who cannot afford to pay for extras feel their waist-belts slacken, and go supperless to bed. And tea is not a very substantial meal; the rations served out for the day have decreased in bulk, bread has wasted to microscopic proportions, and the cheese has diminished sadly in size.

This arrangement was effected in the year 1773, and in the following year Mr. Watt removed to Soho, where a portion of the establishment was allotted to him, for the erection of a foundery, and other works necessary to realise his inventions on a grand scale. The patent which had been granted in 1769 was limited to a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years, and would consequently expire about the year 1783. From the small progress which had hitherto been made in the construction of engines upon the new principle, and from the many difficulties still to be encountered, and the large expenditure of capital which must obviously be incurred before any return could be obtained, it was apparent that unless an extension of the patent right could be obtained, Boulton and Watt could never expect any advantage adequate to the risk...", "...blue wash, which, however, was so nearly obliterated with dirt and the damp of a southern climate, as to leave but little to show what its original color was.

He was married in 1621 to the Duchesse Nicole, his cousin-german, but after a time ceased to live with her. Being at Brussels he fell in love with Madame de Cantecroix, a widow. He bribed a courier to bring him news of the death of the Duchesse Nicole; he circulated the report throughout the town, wore mourning, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days afterwards, in April, 1637, married Madame de Cantecroix. In a short time it was discovered that the Duchesse Nicole was full of life and health, and had not even been ill.

They continued to repute the Duchesse Nicole as dead, and lived together in the face of the world as though effectually married, although there had never been any question either before or since of dissolving...", "...this trust is harvesting. If we wish to put the statement in figures, suppose we take the annual consumption of linseed oil in the country at thirty million gallons. Then the profits of the trust from the increased prices alone will amount to four and one half million dollars per annum. There is another way in which trusts directly affect the public, which has received very much less attention than it deserves. Besides the people who use the linseed oil and pay the trust an extra <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> cents a gallon for the privilege, there are a great number of people who would have used oil if the price had not advanced, but who cannot afford to do so at the advanced price. It is a well-known fact that every increase in the price of any article decreases the demand, and the advance in the price of linseed oil has undoubtedly had a great effect in decreasing the consumption of oil.

Very oft she came to our fort with what she could get for Capt.

The colony of returned exiles seems to have made little progress during that long period. Its members settled down, and much of their enthusiasm cooled, as we see from the reforms which Ezra had to inaugurate <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years before Nehemiah. The majority of men, even if touched by spiritual fervour, find it hard to keep on the high levels for long. Breathing is easier lower down. As is often the case, a brighter flame of zeal burned in the bosoms of sympathisers at a distance than in those of the actual workers, whose contact with hard realities and petty details disenchanted them. Thus the impulse to nobler action came, not from one of the colony, but from a Jew in the court of the Persian...", "...husband is a poor soldier, Peggy: he cannot make soldiers.'

Altogether, the day's work had netted them two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> thousand dollars, and as soon as she could escape Mary Louise rushed home to report their success to her grandfather. \"In one day, Gran'pa Jim!\" she cried exultantly, and the old colonel's eyes sparkled as he replied: \"That makes our great mass-meeting look pretty small; doesn't it, my dear?

He said that he was naturally very arrogant; that it was his easily besetting sin; a state of mind which he ascribed to the severe subjection to which he had been exposed, till he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age, and from which, his own consciousness of superiority made him revolt. He then stated that he had renounced all his Unitarian sentiments; that he considered Unitarianism as a heresy of the worst description; attempting in vain, to reconcile sin and holiness; the world and heaven; opposing the whole spirit of the Bible; and subversive of all that truly constituted christianity. At this interview he professed his deepest conviction of the truth of Revelation; of the...", "...young man of about eight-and-twenty; the other was old O'Ready, the survivor of so many shipwrecks.

BENJAMIN HEATH, D.D., 1739-1817 [Illustration: REV. BENJAMIN HEATH, D.D.] The Rev. Benjamin Heath, D.D., one of the sons to whom Mr. Benjamin Heath gave a part of his books, was born on the 29th of September 1739. He was educated at Eton and at King's College, Cambridge, of which College he became a Fellow. After leaving the University he was appointed an assistant master at Eton, and in 1771 succeeded Dr. Sumner as headmaster of Harrow, a post he held for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years.[85] He died on the 31st of May 1817, at the rectory of Walkerne in the county of Hertford, a living given to him by his College, which he held with the rectory of Farnham in Buckinghamshire. He was buried at Exeter. Dr. Heath, who was 'a scholar and a bibliomaniac,' added greatly to the library given to him by his father, for which he built a large room at Walkerne, where, says Dibdin, 'he saw, entertained, and caressed his friends, with Alduses in the forenoon, and...", "...then, old Cox, just attend to me,' began Mrs. Dunn. 'I have brought something as you don't get offered every day.' Mr. Cox, accustomed to the scant ceremony bestowed upon him by some of the ladies of Daffodil's Delight, took the speech with indifference, and gave his attention to the parcel, from which Mrs. Dunn was rapidly taking off the twine. 'What's this--silk?' cried he, as a roll of dress-silk, brown, cross-barred with gold, came forth to view. 'Yes, it is silk; and there's <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> yards of it; and I want thirty shillings upon it,' volubly replied Mrs. Dunn. He took the silk between his fingers, feeling its substance, in his professionally indifferent and disparaging manner. 'Where did you get it from?' he asked. 'Where did I get it from?' retorted Mrs. Dunn. 'What's that to you!' D'ye think I stole it?' 'How do I know?' returned he. 'You insolent fellow! Is it only to-day as you have knowed me, Tom Cox?

From the first he saw that the one and only way to wear down the Spanish resistance was to capture the fortresses. Hence his operations were twofold--the conduct of sieges and the protection of his convoys from the guerillas. He justified his reasoning; by 1812 he had captured no less than seventy-seven thousand officers and men and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred guns and had pacified Aragon, Valencia, and part of Catalonia. Another great secret of his success lay in the fact that he knew how to profit by victory; the battle of Belchite followed on that of Maria; no sooner was Lerida captured than plans were made to take Mequinenza, and before that fortress was captured the siege train for Tortosa was got ready. Profiting by the depression of the enemy after the fall of Tortosa, he despatched columns to capture San Felipe and...", "...a temple or a city, he builded well.

So instead of going in at once with the king to the pavilion, I ran down to the lines where the horses were picketed, and found Erling on his way to the supper, which was spread under some trees for our servants.

These two powers have for their end, one the spiritual happiness of man, here and hereafter, the other the temporal prosperity of society in the present world.

In the midst of this firing, indeed, Prevost had...", "...desired shape and size.

None of his contemporaries or biographers mention a visit to Venice at the end of August 1529.

By this Act, in which the 'author' first makes his appearance actually in front of the 'proprietor,' it was provided that, _in case of new books_, the author and his assigns should have the sole right of printing them for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years, and if at the end of that time the author was still alive, a second term of fourteen years was conceded. In the case of _existing books_, there was to be but one term--viz., twenty-one years, from August 10, 1710.

A demonstration was made against the city from the bazaar, which occupied the attention of the large force holding the town. The main body of the British were quietly massed on its left, and, crossing three bridges over the canal, attacked the enemy's right with impetuosity. These, cut off by the city wall from their comrades within, were unable to stand the British onslaught and the thunder of Peel's guns, and fled precipitately, pursued by the British for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles along the Calpee Road. Every gun and ammunition wagon of the mutineers on this side fell into the hands of the victors. As the victorious British force swept along past the city, Sir Colin Campbell detached a force under General Mansfield to attack and occupy the position of the Subadar's Tank--which was captured after some hard fighting. Thus the British were in a position in rear of the enemy's left.

He showed that the offer of a two dollar fee was sufficient to induce the majority of these ambassadors of Christ to marry a girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> or fifteen to a boy a few years older. There followed a great outcry from the accused, with the usual demands that the offending paper print a retraction and discharge the guilty writer from its staff.

The result was that he received and reprinted an amazing mass of putrid scandal, greatly to the joy...", "...and Mr. Campbell's.

The labour connected with railway omnibuses is still severer than this, being twenty hours each third day, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> on alternate ones. Nor does the seventh day bring rest, as in most laborious occupations; work goes on in precisely the same manner; and, as on some lines of road, the traffic is greater on Sundays than on other days, the work is so far heavier.

CLOSE OF THE FIRST PUNIC WAR.--The war had now lasted for fifteen years. Four Roman fleets had been destroyed, three of which had been sunk or broken to pieces by storms. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred vessels which had been lost, seven hundred were war galleys,--all large and costly quinqueremes, that is, vessels with five banks of oars. Only one hundred of these had fallen into the hands of the enemy; the remainder were a sacrifice to the malign and hostile power of the waves. Such successive blows from an invisible hand were enough to blanch the faces even of the sturdy Romans. Neptune manifestly denied to the \"Children of Mars\" the realm of the sea.

The process of making cider varies in different localities, but in every case essentially consists of the collection of the fruit, and the expression and fermentation of the juice. The _collection of the fruit_ should not be commenced before it has become sufficiently mature. The apples, after being gathered, are usually left for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> or fifteen days in a barn or loft to mellow, during which time the mucilage is decomposed, and alcohol and carbonic acid developed. The _expression of the juice_ is the next step in cider-making. The apples are ground to a pulp in a mill, consisting of two fluted cylinders of hard wood or cast iron working against each other. The pulp is afterwards put into coarse strong bags, and pressed with a heavy weight so as to squeeze out all the juice.

It had originally been my intention to remain in Japan only so long as was necessary for the finishing of this work, during which time opportunity could be given to the officers and crew of the _Vega_ to rest after the labours and sufferings of the long winter, to receive and answer letters from home, and to gather from the newspapers the most important occurrences that had taken place during our <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> months' absence from the regions which are affected by what takes place in the world. But as appears from the foregoing narrative, the delay was longer than had been intended. This indeed was caused in some degree by the difficulty of tearing ourselves away after only a few days' stay from a people so remarkable, so lovable, and so hospitable as the Japanese, and from a land so magnificently endowed by nature.

Mr. Learmonth, who had to visit some of his people in this direction, accompanied me for several miles along the shores of the loch, and lightened the journey by his interesting snatches of local history, suggested by the various objects that lay along our road,--buildings, tumuli, ancient battle-fields, and standing stones. The loch itself, an expansive sheet of water <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles in circumference, I contemplated with much interest, and longed for an opportunity of studying its natural history. Two promontories,--those occupied by the Standing Stones, shoot out from the opposite sides, and approach so near as to be connected by a rustic bridge.

It was at supper on the evening of the betrothal when soldiers came to arrest him. He was accused of having carried letters to Napoleon, at Elba. In vain did he assert and even prove his innocence before de Villefort, a magistrate. Edmond Dantes was torn from his betrothed, and imprisoned for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years in the Chateau d'If. Another prisoner was there, the Abbe Faria. This prisoner was supposed to be mad, because he had offered to buy his liberty with millions. The Abbe imparted to Dantes the secret of the treasure concealed by the Spadas in the caverns of the island of Monte-Cristo, a desolate rock in the Mediterranean. And this was not all, the old man had also imparted other secrets to his young companion. And now Dantes was master of the treasure of the Spadas,...", "...concluded to allow her to remain at the Indiana House temporarily until he could secure her private accommodations.

It is about the size of a Thrush; and Montagu states that he observed on one occasion a flock of eight or ten on the wing together, in the dusk of the evening, skimming over the surface of the ground, after the manner of Swallows, in pursuit of insects.

These eggs, in number only two, are hatched by the female in <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> days. The Common Night-jar is chiefly found on furzy commons, wild bushy heaths, and broken hilly ground in the neighbourhood of thickets and woods.

There is no necessity for explaining these methods. I will briefly give mine, for what it is worth. I prefer warm, well-drained soils. Plow deeply in autumn, also in spring; harrow and pulverize the ground as completely as possible; then open the furrows with the same heavy plow, sinking it to the beam, and going twice in the furrow. This, of course, would make too deep a trench in which to place the sets, but the soil has been deepened and pulverized at least <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> inches. A man next goes along with a cart or barrow of well-decayed compost (not very raw manure), which is scattered freely in the deep furrows; then through these a corn-plow is run, to mingle the fertilizer with the soil. By this course the furrows are partially filled with loose, friable soil and manure, and they average four or five inches in depth.

Another reason for feeling pretty sure that William Strachey must have known Shakespeare is the fact, of which we have ample proof, that Strachey was well known to the men of letters of the day. To begin with, he was a friend of Ben Jonson and wrote a set of commendatory verses for the Laureate's \"Sejanus.\" These appear in the folio edition of Jonson's works. Probably this sonnet--it has <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> lines--is one of the most cryptic things in the whole of Elizabethan literature. No member of our family or any other family has ever been able to construe it.

On August 16 we began to pack our sledges; two were placed in the Crystal Palace and two in the Clothing Store. It was a great advantage to be able to do this work under cover; at this time the temperature was dancing a cancan between -58\u00b0 and -75\u00b0F., with an occasional refreshing breeze of thirteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles an hour. It would have been almost an impossibility to pack the sledges out of doors under these conditions if it was to be done carefully and firmly; and, of course, it had to be so done. Our fixed wire-rope lashings had to be laced together with lengths of thin rope, and this took time; but when properly done, as it was now, the cases were held as though in a vice, and could not move. The zinc plates we had had under the sledges to keep them up in loose snow had been...", "...boy into a dark corner of the stable. \"'Take her out in front, son,' he said, 'and tow-rope them.

But suppose that, instead of Postmaster-General Burleson, we would have had as Postmaster-General some good-natured feller which when his New York representatives called him up and told him they were holding fourteen packages there for additional postage, would have said: 'Oh, let 'em go. We couldn't afford to be small about a little thing like additional postage.' And what would have happened? Why, the <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> judges, mayors, and assorted Senators and district attorneys to which them packages was addressed would have been lucky if they escaped with nothing worse than singed eyebrows, Mawruss. And to-day yet, Mawruss, them fellers which has got only Postmaster-General Burleson to thank that they can still riffle a deck of cards, understand me, is probably going around beefing about the terrible delay in the delivery of mail under the administration of Postmaster-General Burleson.\"...", "...to be sure, not upon the public enemy, but upon the public treasury. He was Governor of Michigan territory, and ex-officio Superintendent of Indian Affairs, from the 9th of October, 1813, till the 31st of July, 1831--a period of seventeen years, nine months, and twenty-two days. During this period he received from the United States treasury, for personal services and personal expenses, the aggregate sum of ninety-six thousand and twenty eight dollars, being an average of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> dollars and seventy-nine cents per day for every day of the time. This large sum was reached by assuming that he was doing service at several different places, and in several different capacities in the same place, all at the same time. By a correct analysis of his accounts during that period, the following propositions may be deduced: First. He was paid in three different capacities during the whole of the time: that is to say--(1) As governor a salary at the rate per year...", "...the exit wound, but no haemoptysis; about four hours later, however, in the Field hospital bleeding was so free that an incision was made with the object of tying the common carotid.

Jane was in the linen-room mending a sheet when Polly found her, and being rather lonesome was quite willing to enter into conversation with any one who came along. But Polly's question made her open her eyes with surprise. \"A valentine?\" she exclaimed. \"You don't mean to say, Polly, you never heard of a valentine before?\" \"No, never,\" answered Polly, feeling very small and ignorant. \"Well, to be sure,\" said Jane, \"you're...", "...blown over, and we are now in the utmost harmony.

In this rite I had the company of a young New-Yorker, whom I had met on the boat coming down, and who was of the light, hopeful, adventurous business type which seems peculiar to the city, and which has always attracted me. He told me much about his life, and how he lived, and what it cost him to live. He had a large room at a fashionable boardinghouse, and he paid <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> dollars a week. In Columbus I had such a room at such a house, and paid three and a half, and I thought it a good deal.

The traverse which we set out to make on leaving Fort William was <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> miles broad, which made it of some consequence our having a calm day to cross it in our little egg-shell of a canoe.

The luck of the brewer and his wife was no better than that of the Bangletops.

William Clayton was born July 17, 1814, in the village of Charock Moss, Township of Penwortham, County Palatine of Lancaster, England. He was the son of Thomas and Ann Critchley Clayton, who were born in Lancashire, England. William was the eldest of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> children. Three of these children died in infancy and were buried in England. Through the influence of the eldest son, the father, mother and surviving children joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and came to America.

One fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his donkey; another claimed half a dollar for pricking him up, another a quarter for helping in that service, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> guides presented bills for showing us the way through the town and its environs; and every vagrant of them was more vociferous, and more vehement and more frantic in gesture than his neighbor.

But a father and mother with a maiden of genius on their hands were like a hen whose duckling takes to the water. The difference of the training of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn, as distinguished from their musical education, is effectually indicated by the following letter from their father to Fanny, written when she was <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years old. After referring in terms of satisfaction to the compositions of both his son and daughter, Abraham Mendelssohn proceeded to say to the latter of his two gifted children: \"What you wrote to me about your musical occupations, with reference to and in comparison with Felix, was both rightly thought and expressed.

It was during the latter part of our sojourn at Heidelberg that the Stanleys (Aunt Kitty, Arthur, and Mary), with Emmie Penrhyn, came to stay with us on their way to spend the winter at Rome, a journey which at that time was looked upon as a great family event. With them I went to Spires and its beautiful cathedral, and on the anniversary of my adoption we all went over to Mannheim, and dined at the hotel where, seventeen years before, I, being <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> months old, was given away to my aunt, who was also my godmother, to live with her for ever as if I were her own child, and never to see my own parents, as such, any more. I dwell upon this because one of the strangest coincidences of my life--almost too strange for credence--happened that day at Mannheim.

From these various statements it is clear that the full difference in size between the male and female Scotch deerhound is not acquired until rather late in life.

I was taxiing toward the hangar. \"That did it,\" Pick shouted over the noise of my engine. \"Did what?\" I shouted back. \"Broke the record, boy!\" \"You're crazy as hell,\" I answered. It took me sixteen and a half hours. Lindbergh made it in <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> forty-five. THE FLYER HIKES HOME I was hanging around Roosevelt Field one afternoon with nothing much on my mind when a couple of friends came up and said they were just taking off for the South. They wanted to catch the Pan-American plane from Miami the next day. They were amateur pilots. The weather was lousy toward the South and they hadn't had much experience in blind or night flying. I said I would fly with them as far as Washington and maybe by that time the...", "...'Elegy Written in a Country Church-Yard.' This is the one production by which he is known to the great mass of readers and will continue to be known to coming generations; yet in his own time his other poems were important factors, in establishing the high repute accorded to him then and still maintained in the esteem of critics. Nevertheless, living to be nearly fifty-five and giving himself exclusively to letters, the whole of the work that he left behind him amounted only to some <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> hundred lines. His value to literature and to posterity, therefore, is to be measured not by the quantity of his literary contributions or by any special variety in their scope, but by a certain wholesome and independent influence which he exerted upon the language of poetry, and by a rare quality of intense yet seemingly calm and almost repressed genius, which no one among his commentators has been able to define clearly. The most comprehensive thing ever written about...", "...of the moment, Jennings interrupted his employer as the mill owner started to question him sternly as to the cause of the delay. Bonnie, too, broke in with her version of the story, and together they told him how a punctured tire had held them up fifteen minutes just as they were leaving the house in plenty of time. They told him how, to avoid being late at the office, Jennings had taken the old short cut across to the mills, by the way of Red Bridge, only to be halted by a lad of <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> who waved a red handkerchief at them and barred the way across the bridge in spite of the chauffeur's argument and threats. They told him how a heavy lumber wagon, in which three farm hands were rattling home from the city, had come bouncing along to the other side of the river and how the men had howled down the boy's wild warnings and entreaties as they bowled on to Red Bridge as fast as their horses could go. Bruce's stern face went white as his little daughter,...", "...folks and little better'n nothing.\" \"Less than nothin', _I_ should say,\" put in Mrs. Slocum, setting her cup in its saucer with an unnecessary clash, \"for what's here won't pay Mr. Slocum his back rent on the place and the fence rails of the south lot that they've seemingly used for firin'. _I_ should say that the clothes on the girl's back didn't fairly belong to her, mournin' and all. \"If she is only a little turned thirteen from what you say she has schoolin' enough to pass for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> and get work in the factory. I'll keep her if she'll help me evenings and she gets enough to pay full board,--growin' girls eats hearty,\" and Mrs. Slocum settled back in her chair, folding her arms as if she expected Mrs. Lane to be speechless at her generosity. Speechless she was for a few moments, but for a different cause--a struggle between prudence and a quick but just temper--then she said very slowly and distinctly: \"Mis' Slocum, the back rent is not for me to deny...", "...When we arrived there was no one stirring about the mill; but we had no more than driven up and hitched old Sol to a post, when two boys came out from a small red house, a little way along the road, where lived the miller, whose name was Harland. \"There come Jock and George,\" said Addison. \"Maybe the old man isn't at home to-day. \"Where's your father?\" he called out, as the boys drew near. \"Gone to the village,\" replied the larger of the two, who was apparently thirteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years of age. \"We want to get a grist ground,\" Addison said to them. \"What is it?\" they both asked. \"Corn,\" replied Ad. \"If it's only corn, we can grind it,\" they said. \"Take it in so we can toll it. Pa said we could grind corn, or oats and pease; but he won't let us grind wheat, yet, for that has to be bolted.\" We carried the bags into the mill; there were three of them, each containing two bushels of corn; and meantime the two young millers brought along a...", "...it has shown such splendid courage and skill in the Army and Navy, such sympathy at home for our men at the front, and such devoted eagerness, especially among women, to alleviate suffering and humanize the struggle, as to thrill every patriotic heart and make us all prouder than ever of our country and its matchless people. II WAS IT TOO GOOD A TREATY? This speech was made at a dinner given in New York by the Lotos Club in honor of Mr. Reid, who had been its president for <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> years prior to his first diplomatic service abroad in 1889. It was the first public utterance by any one of the Peace Commissioners after the ratification of the Treaty of Paris. Among the many letters of regret at the dinner, the following, from the Secretary of State and from his predecessor, were given to the public: WASHINGTON, D.C., February 9, 1899. _To John Elderkin, Lotos Club, New York:_ I received your note in due time, and had hoped until now to...", "...technical processes of etching or lithography. I studied Liebermann's work from Amsterdam to Vienna, and out of the variety of styles set forth I endeavoured to disentangle several leading characteristics. The son of a well-known Berlin family, his father a comfortably situated manufacturer, the young Max was brought up in an atmosphere of culture and family affection. His love for art was so pronounced that his father, like the father of Mendelssohn, let him follow his bent, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">fourteen</span> he was placed under the tutelage of Steffeck, an old-timer, whose pictures nowadays seem a relic from some nightmare of art. Steffeck had studied under Schadow, another of the prehistoric Dinosaurs of Germany, and boasted of it. He once told Liebermann that Adolf Menzel only made caricatures, not portraits. You rub your eyes and wonder. Liebermann has said that this rigid training did him good. But he soon forgot it in actual practice. Some good angel must have protected him,...", "...would seek o'er the ocean, The folk-leader noble, since he needed retainers.
