As four millions of crowns a year were known to be required for any tolerable campaigning, such empty vaunts as these were preposterous. The king knew full well, said Spinola, and had admitted the fact in his letters, that this enormous sum could not be furnished. Moreover, the war cost the Netherlanders far less in proportion. They had river transportation, by which they effected as much in two days as the Catholic <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> could do in a fortnight, so that every siege was managed with far greater rapidity and less cost by the rebels than by their opponents. As to sending troops from Milan, he had already stated that their arrival would have a fatal effect. The minds of the people were full of suspicion. Every passing rumour excited a prodigious sensation, and the war party was already gaining the upper hand. Spinola warned the king, in the most solemn manner, that if the golden opportunity were now...", "...Wedding-Flight of Lord Lismore--My Return to Florence, and My Departure with the Corticelli My Spaniard was going on before us on horseback, and I was sleeping profoundly beside Don Ciccio Alfani in my comfortable carriage, drawn by four horses, when a violent shock aroused me.

Alfani was beneath me and uttered piercing shrieks, for he thought he had broken his left <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> Le Duc rode back and told me that the postillions had taken flight, possibly to give notice of our mishap to highwaymen, who are very common in the States of the Church and Naples.

It took us a quarter of an hour to get him free.

But Chief Cook's messages had gotten in ahead of the men, and Deputy Tigart, of Sidney, Neb., having received a description of Witherill, proceeded on the very evening after his arrival to Julesburg, a few miles distant from his home in Sidney, to arrest the fugitive. The officers waited for night to come on, and went after him when he was supposed to be asleep. They found him in a barn, with his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> lying about him. He was at first disposed to resist capture, but discovering that he was well surrounded, he surrendered. The prisoner at first denied that his name was Witherill, and said that he was one William Jackson, but ultimately confessed, and then told of the whereabouts of Wight, who, he declared, was as much to blame as was he (Witherill). Gen. Cook and Mr. Smith, when they arrived at Sidney, found Witherill safe in hand, and as he had been captured in Colorado...", "...Hasdrubal and Hannibal on the March As in the times of the utmost danger, Rome once more called out twenty-three legions. Volunteers were summoned to arm, and those legally exempt from military service were included in the levy. Nevertheless, they were taken by surprise. Far earlier than either friends or foes expected, Hasdrubal was on the Italian side of the Alps (547); the Gauls, now accustomed to such transits, were readily bribed to open their passes, and furnished what the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> required. If the Romans had any intention of occupying the outlets of the Alpine passes, they were again too late; already they heard that Hasdrubal was on the Po, that he was calling the Gauls to arms as successfully as his brother had formerly done, that Placentia was invested.

You have then never been threatened by the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> that I bear!' And with the palm of his hand, striking the butt of his gun, he made the hammer click. At the sound of his voice, as at the noise of the hammer, the bird raised its head, manifesting new and redoubled surprise, but without any other movement.

I think it is an unfortunate thing that Adler, who was on that line and did such good work in it, coupled his statements with a sort of denunciation of Freud's views. It seems to me to have been entirely unnecessary. One of the remarkable stories of O.

On the morning of the 16th, Schwarzenberg began the attack. His numbers did not exceed 150,000, for the greater part of the Russian <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> was a march in the rear. The battle was an even one. The Austrians failed to gain ground: with one more army-corps Napoleon saw that he could overpower the enemy. He was still without intelligence of Bluecher's actual appearance in the north; and in the rash hope that Bluecher's coming might be delayed, he sent orders to Ney and Marmont to leave their positions and hurry to the south to throw themselves upon Schwarzenberg. Ney obeyed. Marmont, when the order reached him, was...", "...where he had fallen. The girl's heart stood still an instant in that utmost fear which will come first--was he _dead_?

Finally, the squadron from Constantinople having safely arrived, news came that another was fitting out at Rhodes to retake Egypt itself.

Some French knights, with their Scottish hosts, made an incursion into England, and the Percies, along with the Earl of Nottingham, conducted a devastating raid in Scotland, laying waste the Lothians. About the date of both events there is some doubt; probably the Percy invasion was in retaliation for the French affair. But all the time the two countries were nominally at peace, and it was not till May, 1385, that they were technically in a state of war. In that month a French <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> was sent to aid the Scots, and, under the command of John de Vienne, it took part in an incursion on a somewhat larger scale than the usual raids. The English replied, in the month of August, by an invasion conducted by Richard II in person, at the head of a large army, while the Scots, declining a battle, wasted Cumberland.

The classical formation--if I may employ that term--is still two lines for the infantry. The greater or less extent of the battle-field and the strength of an <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> may necessarily produce greater depth at times; but these cases are the exceptions, because the formation of two lines and the reserves gives sufficient solidity, and enables a greater number of men to be simultaneously engaged.

Although rather seriously wounded in the unfortunate affair of Savannah, I was actively engaged in Virginia, under General Greene, in collecting the remains of the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> commanded by Gates, whom I considered a much greater hero than his more fortunate rival, Washington. We had just learnt of the landing of M. de Ternay's squadron, and the depression which had fallen on us at this period of reverses and distress was beginning to vanish before the prospect of re-enforcements. These, as a fact, were less considerable than we had expected.

His countenance was coldly expressive, with regular features, and a large nose--one of those noses that resemble the prow of a ship, and stamp the faces of men predestined to accomplish great discoveries. His eyes, which were gentle and intelligent, rather than bold, lent a peculiar charm to his physiognomy.

For the lives of natives he had absolutely no regard, and had committed so many murders in the Gilbert Islands that he had been forcibly taken on board a whaler by the few white men living there, and threatened with instant death if he returned. The whaleship landed him on Ponape, and his presence soon became a curse. Being possessed of plenty of <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and ammunition, he soon gained the friendship of a native chief ruling over the western district of the island, and his savage nature at once showed itself by his offering to destroy the inhabitants of a little island named Pakin, who had in some way offended this chief.

Elated with this achievement, Larmer returned to Ponape, and,...", "...armed at the expense of the Government. It was a company of mounted infantry, under command of Captain Wardle, armed with musket, uniformed in the Government blue, and furnished with horses in order to scout the country. The Government found it impossible to turn out arms and clothing fast enough to supply the volunteers at once, and it was late in the Summer of 1861 before they were all equipped. Many armed themselves, as was the case with two hundred of those at the Junction. Their <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> consisted of rifles, shot-guns, and such other weapons as they were able to furnish themselves with. The Junction, as we have said, presented a curious scene. Five tall, white army tents had been erected for Captain Wardle's men, and there were a score or more enclosures, ambitious to be known as tents, made from Virginia wagon-covers, sail-cloth, oil-cloth, sheeting, and bed-ticking. They were of various sizes and shapes; some so small that four men would fill them; others...", "...invited him to attend an Ojibewa rattlesnake-hunt, a form of sport of which he had never before heard. \"What weapons must I take?\" he asked before starting. \"Oh, nothing.

A small party of redskins were squatting outside the inn, and seeing that the two white men were ready to accompany them, they led the way to a hilly and well-wooded spot, just on the eastern shore of the lake.

They are guide-posts pointing with their short <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> to the road of duty; they are voices of mankind uttering impressive warnings, and giving clear direction in moments when the promptings of self-interest or the mists of passion would be likely to lead us astray. It may also be well to select a number of speeches which embody high moral sentiments, like some of the speeches of Isaiah, the speech of Socrates before his judges, and others, and, after having explained their meaning, to cause them to be recited by the pupils. Just as...", "...Miriam tapped the pistol in her hand. \"Do you see this?\" He grunted fearlessly. \"Well, what of it?\" \"Give me that money,\" she insisted, approaching him. As yet she had not levelled the weapon; and Challoner, seeing his opportunity, started once more. \"_Stop!_\" It was a new voice that spoke now: the blow that had struck her face had suddenly transformed her into a desperate woman. Challoner stopped; for he saw the weapon trained upon him. Again, without affecting her <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> she tapped it. \"Listen to me!\" she cried, her voice growing hoarser as she went on, \"this thing has been responsible for one murder, and now, Lawrence Challoner, I'm going to kill you with it.

Throwing open the casement, he let in the fresh morning breeze and took in at a glance the rich Southern landscape.

He went with the Connecticut troops on several expeditions against the French forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga, on Lake Champlain and Lake George.

This movement threw the Greek <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> into disorder, and the three main divisions became separated from one another.

And in truth the more serious note of the impassioned servant of religion whose lips have been touched with altar-fire, whose seriousness came to be like some incurable malady, a visitation of God, as people used to say, is presently struck when, in the natural course of his argument, his thoughts are carried, from a mere passage of <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> between one man or one class of men and another, deep down to those awful encounters of the individual soul with itself which are formulated in the eternal problem of predestination.

He was not disappointed. There was a young moon, and one stream of light fell down into Amir Nath's Gully, and struck the grating which was drawn away as he knocked. From the black dark, Bisesa held out her <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> into the moonlight. Both hands had been cut off at the wrists, and the stumps were nearly healed.

He and his associates made the chart which assisted them in guiding the new government. He established credit, put the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and navy on a permanent basis, fostered commerce, and was ever on the side of education. Everything that he did demonstrates his marvelous foresight. We cannot afford to spare the inspiration that comes from Washington. It promotes patriotism and gives vigor to national life.

Our ideas were in flux. Whether we should <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> against whom we should arm, how we should arm, was decided by the impact of prejudices and shadowy fears against an obstinate and optimistic credulity.

He was astonished at the dream, and he thought about it a great while, remembering everything he had seen. Then he left the chamber, and there stood all the principal knights, who told the king: \"Your grace, all the Moors have set up their tents in front of the city.\" The king did...", "...the cabals which prevail in the Senate, and the feebleness and inertness of those who compose it, you cannot be surprised at the delays and changes which take place.

The gap was forming round Holland. In spite of the secrecy which enveloped the negotiations of Louis XIV., Van Witt was filled with disquietude; favorable as ever to the French alliance, he had sought to calm the irritation of France, which set down the Triple Alliance to the account of Holland. \"I remarked,\" says a letter in 1669, from M. de Pomponne, French ambassador at the Hague, \"that it...", "...Sumner trained himself and tested his strength so carefully that in the following spring he delivered his oration on the barbarism of slavery, more than an hour in length, before the Senate; and in 1863 he made a speech three hours in length, a herculean effort that has never been equalled, except by Hamilton's address before the Constitutional Convention of 1787.

The resolution, as a whole, may have been a rash one, but there was no rashness displayed in the carrying out of its details.

The party was thus to consist of five in all. During the ascent it was proposed that three of those men should always be, not only out of danger, but attached firmly to the rocks; and while they were thus secure, it was thought that the remaining two might take liberties, and commit themselves to ventures which would otherwise be inexcusable or impossible.

Though these forces, convoyed by a squadron from Jamaica, brought the first news to Cape Breton of the danger that threatened it; though the advantage of a surprise would have secured the landing without opposition; though they had but six hundred regular troops to encounter, and eight hundred inhabitants hastily armed, the success of the undertaking was still precarious.

In order to prevent a spread of this Bolshevist movement the three countries prepared to occupy Hungary with troops, whereupon a command came from the Supreme Council in Paris that such aggression would not be tolerated. This encouraged Bela Kun, the Hungarian Trotzky, and made him so popular that he succeeded in raising a Red <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> with which he crossed the River Theiss and invaded Rumania. Whereupon the Rumanian army, being unable to obtain support from the Supreme Council, pushed back the Hungarians, occupied Budapest, overthrew Bela Kun's administration and restored order in Hungary. But the Supreme Council, feeling that its authority had been ignored by the little country, sent several messages to the Rumanian Government peremptorily ordering it to withdraw its troops immediately from Hungary.

Still, nothing daunted, Rodolph displayed his impetuous valor, the lords of Hers and Stramen rushed on the destroyers of their castles, and Gilbert and Henry fought side by side, each trying to outstrip the other.

Sherman's preference was for a movement by way of Yazoo Pass, or Lake Providence, but it was not long before I saw in our daily talks that his mind was tending to the conclusion of General Grant.

Situated in the centre of the Mediterranean, and stretching out their <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> eastward and westward, the extent of their commerce took in all the known world, and wafted it to the coast of Spain, of Mauritania, of Gaul, and beyond the straits and pillars of Hercules.

But, so long as they go no further, there is no definite \"cause\" either to uphold or oppose.

The low kopjes in front of them were blazing with musketry fire. The brigade held its own, but lost the Brigadier (the second in a month) and 150 rank and file. Next morning the main body of the infantry was passed across, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> was absolutely committed to the formidable and unnecessary enterprise of fighting its way straight to Ladysmith.

In 1038 the governor of Lombardy believed he saw the chance that he had long been waiting for, to add Sicily to his own dominions. The Arabs were fighting among themselves and were split up already into several weak and irreconcilable factions, and he begged the Normans to go and help his own <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> to conquer them. After a while Sicily was conquered, but the Normans were not given their share of the glory of the victories; on the contrary, the Lombard governor was too avaricious and ungrateful for his own good, and there was a grand quarrel when the spoils were divided. Two years afterwards the indignant Normans came marching back to attack Apulia, and defeated the Greeks at Cannae so thoroughly that they were only left in possession of a few towns. This was in 1043, and...", "...the conspirators, would have been now lying fast asleep.

There was a great deal of unrest and unhealthy excitement during demobilization, so to keep the troops interested and amused, competitions were got up throughout the E.E.F. in Boxing, Football, Cricket, and sports of all kinds. Soon after we reached Rafa a programme of coming sporting events was circulated from G.H.Q. Naturally, in a fighting <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> like the British, the greatest interest of all was taken in the Boxing competition, and the 38th Royal Fusiliers entered with keenness for all events. By the terms of the contest teams could be chosen from Brigades, or even from Divisions, but, as we belonged to no Brigade or Division, we could only choose our men from our own battalion, which was of course a considerable handicap. However, I considered that this was a grand opportunity of proving that men picked from this...", "...nasty jar on the shin-bone. The pain acted as the last straw to the exasperated Sergeant. With an oath, he drew from his pocket a small steel article known in police circles as a \"come-along\" and, clipping it on one of his prisoner's wrists, he twisted viciously. The exquisite torture drew a shriek from the wretched man. \"Shut up,\" whispered Ellis savagely. \"If you start hollerin' again and still refuse to walk I'll\"--and he gave another slight twist to the wrist--\"I'll break your <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> Now will you come, eh?\" \"Oh, o-o-h.

The Church-ideal of holiness had long since been laid aside; a new world had grown up, in which other <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and another spirit prevailed.

Both on the upper and the lower part of the arm they point towards the elbow. Here they meet at an obtuse angle. This curious arrangement is found only in the anthropoid apes--gorilla, chimpanzee, orang, and several species of gibbons--besides man (Figures 1.203 and 1.207). In other species of gibbon the hairs are pointed towards the hand both in the upper and lower <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> as in the rest of the mammals. We can easily explain this remarkable peculiarity of the anthropoids and man on the theory that our common ancestors were accustomed (as the anthropoid apes are to-day) to place their hands over their heads, or across a branch above their heads, during rain. In this position, the fact that the hairs point downwards helps the rain to run off. Thus the direction of the hair on the lower part of our arm reminds us to-day of that useful custom of our...", "...get over that night in the Masai camp for many a long year.

In this connection the important fact should he recalled that Generals Barnard and Meigs, officers of the highest training and distinction, at the request of General Grant, shortly after the fiasco of Bermuda Hundred, had been sent by the Washington authorities to make an investigation of General Butler's fitness for command in the field, and had with due deliberation reported that while \"General Butler was a man of rare and great ability, he had not had either the...", "...that Duchy, and in the early part of February began the invasion of Schleswig.

As it was they sullenly watched the Prussian and Austrian columns marching north to the invasion of Denmark. It was the first time that the remodelled Prussian <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> had been tested on the field of battle; Bismarck had brought it about that they were fighting for the cause of Germany and in alliance with Austria. As soon as war began, his own position improved.

The Black Boneens, who were suffering more than the Mavericks, on a hill half a mile away, began presently to explain to all who cared to listen-- We'll sound the jubilee, from the centre to the sea, And Ireland shall be free, says the Shan-van Vogh.

The same treatment is bestowed upon any one who desires good health. As many infants die, it is the custom to wait eight or ten days after birth before naming a child, when a similar sacrifice is made, and a leaf prepared in like manner is passed down the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> of the infant by the blian. In selecting a name he resorts to an omen, cutting two pieces of a banana leaf into the shape of smaller leaves. According to the way these fall to the ground the matter is decided. If after two trials the same result is obtained the proposed name is considered appropriate. Also on the occasion of marriage, a similar sacrifice and the same curative practice are used.

But the anguish, the pathos with which it was uttered, made her pulses swell and her heart beat. \"_Rachael!_\" The sound grew familiar, the voice came to her from the depths of the past, as a ghost glides out from the darkness that surrounds it. The knowledge that she had once known a sister came back. \"Rachael, my sister Rachael!\" Her soul gave up its past at the cry. She stretched forth her <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> as she had done a thousand times in her helpless infancy, and fell into the embrace that gathered her up to the very heart of that dying woman. \"Rachael!\" \"Sister!\" Language was mute then, and silence became eloquent; the blood in those two hearts throbbed with kindred fire, those arms clung together like vines rooted in the same soil.

Catherine had persuaded her that his kindness was treachery, and that there was a purpose to poison her.[282] A serious question, however, had risen about the Statute of Succession. The oath had been universally taken by everyone to whom it had been offered save More and Fisher. The reason for demanding it was the notorious intention of the Catholic party to take <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> in Catherine's and Mary's interests. Were others to be sworn, and were the two ladies chiefly concerned to be exempted? Catherine, in ceasing to be queen, might be held to have recovered her rights as a foreigner.

Mary was undoubtedly a subject, and Catherine and she had both intimated that if the oath was demanded of them they would not take it. The Peers and...", "...after him. But, whom have you there?

ARTHUR RIMBAUD Jean Nicolas Arthur Rimbaud was born at Charleville, October 20, 1854, and from the most tender age showed traits of the most insupportable blackguardism. His brief stay in Paris was in 1870-71. He followed Verlaine in England, then in Belgium. After the little misunderstanding which separated them, Rimbaud roved through the world, followed the most diverse trades, a soldier in the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> of Holland, ticket taker at Stockholm in the Loisset circus, contractor in the Isle of Cyprus, trader at Harrar, then at Cape Guardafui, in Africa, where a friend of M. Vittorio Pico saw him, applying himself to the fur trade. It is likely that, scorning all that lacks brutal gratification, savage adventure, the violent life, this poet, singular among all, willingly renounced poetry. None of the authentic pieces of _Reliquaire_ seem more recent than 1873; although he did not die...", "...taking one step forward, stretched out his hand. \"Keith!\" Keith took his hand with a grip that drove the blood from the ends of Norman's fingers. \"Norman!\" Norman drew a chair close to his desk, and Keith sat down.

What was his surprise on reaching the antelopes, to perceive that there was a third one of the party still alive! Yes, a little fawn, not taller than a rabbit, was bounding about through the grass, running around the prostrate body of its mother, and uttering its tiny bleat. Hendrik was surprised, because he had not observed this creature before; but, indeed, he had not seen much of the antelopes until the moment of taking <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and the grass had concealed the tiny young one.

But he felt that he had not wantonly destroyed these creatures for mere amusement, and that satisfied his conscience. The little fawn would make a famous pet for Jan, who had often wished for one, to be equal with his sister. It could be fed upon the cow's milk, and, though it had lost both father and mother, Hendrik resolved that...", "...\"To Sons of Freedom! All true lovers of Liberty of your Country!

Von Kluck was very hopeful. 'The outflanking of the left of the British Army,' he says, 'on the assumption that it remained in position, appeared to be guaranteed.'

Beginning with the defeat on Long Island in late August, Washington and his army had met reverse after reverse.

Dr. Mitchell's entrance into romantic literature was made anonymously and, it might be said, accidentally. Soon after the close of the Civil War, the story goes, he and some professional associates one day discussed all sides of the question whether the loss of the limbs involves the loss of the victim's individuality. As a result of that discussion Dr. Mitchell wrote the story of the fictitious case of one George Dedlow, who had suffered the loss of his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and his legs. The story, which, as they who have read it know, is an intensely interesting complication of romance and science, came to the hands of the Rev.

Dr. Hale, who, at that time, was at the height of his literary power, saw that the story was rare material, and he submitted it forthwith to the editor of _The Atlantic Monthly_.

Her huge <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> were folded tightly across her breast, and, for some inexplicable reason, Chloe found the stare disconcerting.

Now the warmth restored her a little and she resisted feebly and protested. \"But I am dressed--I am not ready for a bath--who are you that expect me here and masquerade so strangely?

At the last moment the Russians brought up reenforcements from the south, and with them almost surrounded one of the German <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> corps which had advanced about ten miles to the southeast of Brzeziny to Karpin. For three days it looked as if this corps would either be annihilated or captured, but at last it succeeded in breaking through by way of Galkow to Brzeziny not only with comparatively small losses of its own, but with a few thousand of captured Russians. For eighteen days the fighting lasted before Lodz. The Russians resisted this time most stubbornly. They had thrown up strong fortifications...", "...that experience, but a few will be alluded to.

But days before the battle began the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of action were all considered. The passage over the mountain was a difficult one to make in the face of an enemy.

After reaching Chattanooga Valley, the creek of the same name, quite a formidable stream to get an <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> over, had to be crossed. I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep Lookout Mountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge. By marching Hooker to the north side of the river, thence up the stream, and recrossing at the town, he could be got in position at any named time; when in this new position, he would have Chattanooga Creek behind him, and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause the evacuation by the enemy of his line across the...", "...pistol than the one found clutched in his own hand.

George, violently awakened, complained that it was before his time, to which he was true; and was for going off again with exalted contentment, though his heels had been tugged, and were dangling some length out of the machine; but his comrade, with a determined blow of the lungs, gave another valiant pull, and George Stokes was on his legs, marvelling at the world and man.

If I commanded someone to rub my refuse over themselves, or even to eat my refuse, it would be done.\" Manguino's tone of speaking was soft and had a pleasurable quality about it, as if the imagery that he was conveying to Orren was pleasing to himself. Orren felt disgusted but tried not to let it show, and he began to speak of something other than the fantasies that go with power. \"You do not have to worry about being overrun, Holiness!\" he told Manguino. \"My <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> is out there ready to die for you, if necessary.\" \"That would be a beautiful sight to see, I think.

[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the opinion of most of the commentators.] Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the other, a victory that is complete. 8.

The conflict was for some time carried on with great ardour, and with equal fortune; but Caesar's <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> being entangled in the entrenchments of the old camps lately abandoned, began to fall into disorder; upon which Pompey pressing his advantage, they at last fled with precipitation.

A large cloak was thrown over him, which partially concealed his shattered frame and crippled limbs; but his bent shoulders, and the difficulty with which he moved, told how much he had undergone.

Here we stayed for six days and carried out a little training, mostly at Luton Hoo and Markyate. We cannot say that we regarded this as the most pleasant of our experiences, as our billets were not of the best either for Officers, who were mostly crowded into a few cottages, and took turns at bathing in small tin baths in the sculleries, or men who were also crowded in somewhat unwholesome schools, while our menu consisted monotonously of bully beef and pickle, and <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> biscuit and cheese.

Before any answer could be received from Ariaeus, heralds[3] appeared coming from Artaxerxes; among them being Phalinus, a Greek from Zakynthus, and the Greek surgeon Ktesias of Knidus, who was in the service of the Persian king. Phalinus, an officer of some military experience and in the confidence of Tissaphernes, addressed himself to the Greek commanders; requiring them on the part of the King, since he was now victor and had slain Cyrus, to surrender their <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and appeal to his mercy. To this summons, painful in the extreme to a Grecian ear, Klearchus replied that it was not the practice for victorious men to lay down their arms. Being then called away to examine the sacrifice[4] which was going on, he left the interview to the other officers, who met the summons of Phalinus by an emphatic negative. \"If the King thinks himself strong enough to ask for our arms unconditionally, let him come and try to seize them.\"--\"The King (rejoined...", "...England.

The young doctor leaned over her. \"Don't, don't, you will hurt yourself! What is the matter? Tell me about it, perhaps I can help!\" \"I cannot bear it!\" The sobs rose wildly.

Torso and limbs were alike, frightfully shrunken; the hands, mere claws. Lounsbury could not see the face. But the hair was uncovered, and it was the hair that made him \"goose-flesh\" from head to heel. It was white--not the white of old age, with glancing tints of silver or yellow--but the dead white of an agony that had withered it to the roots.

He reached out his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> as she swept by and gathered her into them. He kissed her softly. And then, swiftly, he turned away. \"After a few days, come to the cave,\" he said eagerly. \"If I let them take me now it would mean more than my ruin, more than my death, Wanda. They won't take me.

He swung his long <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> backward and forwards, cracking his fingers, and talked unintelligibly to himself, hoarse, guttural murmurings without sense or import. Trent changed his place and for the first time saw the Kru boy. His face darkened and an angry exclamation broke from his lips. It was something like this which he had been expecting. The Kru boy drew nearer and nearer. Finally he stood upright on the rank, coarse grass and grinned at Monty, whose lean hands were outstretched towards him.

In the historic market place, as Saint-Prosper rode down the street, were assembled a number of lease-holders of both sexes and all ages, from the puny babe in <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> to the decrepit crone and hoary grand-sire, listening to the flowing tongue of a rustic speech-maker. This forum of the people was shaded by a sextette of well-grown elms. The platform of the local Demosthenes stood in a corner near the street. \"'Woe to thee, O Moab! Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh,' if you light not the torch of equal rights!\" exclaimed the platform patterer as Saint-Prosper drew near. \"Awake, sons of the free soil!

Many of them, for example, smoked cigars--and some had already begun the practice of inebriation.

Many of the seniors were in love, and showed each other in confidence poems addressed to, or letters and locks of hair received from, young ladies--but Pen, a modest and timid youth, rather envied these than imitated them as yet.

Their <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> were various. Bows and guns were lacking them, which, however, were of little use in night attacks. The greater part were armed with daggers and Turkish yataghans, sling-shots, Tartar sabres, and with horse-skulls fastened to oak clubs with cords. This last weapon, in strong hands, did terrible service, for it smashed every sabre. Some had very long forks pointed with iron, some spears; these in sudden emergencies they used against cavalry. The band which had halted at Sirotski...", "...cigarette and cried: \"'Ere, missis, gimme that axe; I niver like ter see a woman chop wood.\" She looked at him in amazement.

All at once, before the two Europeans could comprehend what was happening, the sides of the tent were cut open, and the Blackfeet bounded into the interior. The Count and Bright-eye were seized and disarmed. The Sachem, with his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> still crossed on his chest, looked like a stoic, while the Kenhas, with their eyes fixed on the Chief, and uplifted tomahawks, seemed to await from him a final signal. There was a moment of intense anxiety; though the two white men were so brave, the attack had been so rapid and unexpected, that they could not refrain from an inward shudder. For a few seconds the Chief enjoyed his triumph; then, raising his hand, with a gesture of supreme authority, he said,-- \"Enough!...", "...the camp I endeavoured to find Raoul, but without success. Several officers informed me that he was rarely with the main body, his troopers being chiefly used for scouting purposes. This was disappointing; so, as there was clearly no chance of meeting him, I returned to St. Germain and delivered my message. How he managed it I cannot explain--some people hinted that Mazarin's craft had most to do with it--but Turenne was as good as his word, and the next evening an officer from his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> galloped into St. Germain with the information that, without striking a blow, Lorraine had broken up his camp and was retreating to Flanders.

For a long time this attitude was sincerely and patiently maintained.

At the top of the slope was another scene of wild anxiety and confusion most pitiable to witness.

An <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> of \"revolutionary guards\", far more effective than the shah's secret police, and quite as brutal, took over control of every aspect of public life.

The notes in their register books range from the simple registration of a man's name and arms to entries of pedigrees many generations long.

And there every islet, every rock, every point, has its legend of terror; here a boat lodged with a man in it, and after a day and night of vain attempts to rescue him, thousands of people saw him take the frightful leap, throwing up his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> as he went over; here a young woman slipped, and was instantly whirled away out of life; and from that point more than one dazed or frantic visitor had taken the suicidal leap. Death was so near here and so easy! One seems in less personal peril on the Canadian side, and has more the feeling of a spectator and less that of a participant in the wild uproar. Perhaps there is more sense of force, but the majesty of the scene is relieved by a hundred shifting effects of light and...", "...in the Savoy. They entered a high ruinous house on the east side, and after threading various passages reached a door which opened on a flight of broken steps where it was hard for more than one to pass at a time. Lovel heard the carriers of the dead grunting as they squeezed up with their burden. At the top another door gave on an outhouse in the yard of Somerset House between the stables and the west water-gate.... Lovel, as he stumbled after them with Oates' bulk dragging at his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> was in a confusion of mind such as his mean time-serving life had never known. He was in mortal fear, and yet his quaking heart would suddenly be braced by a gust of anger. He knew he was a rogue, but there were limits to roguery, and something in him--conscience, maybe, or forgotten gentility--sickened at this outrage. He had an impulse to defy them, to gain the street and give the alarm to honest men. These fellows were going to construct a crime in their own way which would...", "...of Heaven And all the bliss of Eternity. For never a joy are the angels keeping, To lay at my feet in Paradise, Like that of into your strong arms creeping, And looking into your love-lit eyes. I know, in the way that sins are reckoned, This thought is a sin of the deepest dye; But I know, too, if an angel beckoned, Standing close by the Throne on High, And you, adown by the gates infernal, Should open your loving <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and smile, I would turn my back on things supernal, To lie on your breast a little while. To know for an hour you were mine completely-- Mine in body and soul, my own-- I would bear unending tortures sweetly, With not a murmur and not a moan. A lighter sin or a lesser error Might change through hope or fear divine; But there is no fear, and hell has no terror, To change or alter a love like mine....", "...dead or disabled, the Serbians began retiring across the cornfields and up the slopes leading to the heights behind Losnitza. There, on higher ground, which offered more effective shelter, they made a determined stand and continued their fire on the Austrian masses. Having crossed the river, the Austrians threw up defensive breastworks and dug elaborate trenches, thus fortifying their crossing. Next they built a pontoon bridge, and then the main Austrian army poured across; a whole <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> corps and two divisions of a second. Meanwhile, on the same day, August 12, 1914, a similar event was happening at Shabatz, on the Save, where that river takes a sharp southward turn and then swings up again before joining the Danube at Belgrade. Here the country is a level plain, really the southern limit of the great plain which stretches up to the Danube, past Belgrade and so into Hungary. Here, too, the Austrians screened themselves behind an island in the river, then hurled...", "...again, for Jack was upon him, pinning his revolver arm to his side. \"Now,\" said the lad, \"I've got you!\" The two wrestled across the deck. CHAPTER XVI THE FIGHT ON THE U-87 In the meantime, members of the crew hearing the commotion on deck, rushed up to see what was going on. Seeing their commander struggling with an enemy, they hurried across the deck. Jack saw them coming out of the tail of his eye. It was not time to hesitate and the lad knew it. With his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> still wrapped about the German commander, Jack struggled to the rail and leaped into the sea. Down and down he went, never for a moment relaxing his hold on the German. Then they came to the surface. With a sudden jerk the German freed himself and aimed a heavy blow at Jack. This Jack dodged and sought to regain his hold on his foe. But the German wriggled away and struck out for the submarine. In the meantime, Captain Griswold of the Ventura had been watching the struggle as...", "...water. \"He don't look much with his padding off, does he?\" said Billy, who had been eyeing him critically. \"You go below,\" said Dan sharply. \"Garn,\" said Billy indignantly; \"I want to see the fun as well as you do. I thought of it.\" \"Fun?\" said the old man severely. \"Fun? To see a feller creature suffering, and perhaps drowned--\" \"I don't think I had better go,\" said the victim; \"it seems rather underhand.\" \"Yes, you will,\" said Joe. \"Wind this line round an' round your <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and just swim about gently till I pull you in.\" Sorely against his inclination Private Smith took hold of the line, and, hanging over the side of the schooner, felt the temperature with his foot, and, slowly and tenderly, with many little gasps, committed his body to the deep. Joe paid out the line and waited, letting out more line, when the man in the water, who was getting anxious, started to come in hand over hand. \"That'll do,\" said Dan at length. \"I think it will,\"...", "...of indescribable suspense when the sounds of arrival were heard, and figures began to issue from the platform. It was not long--thanks to freedom from luggage--before there came into full light a well-known form, with a little half-awake boy holding his hand. Then Adela quietly let herself out of the brougham, and in another moment her clasping hand and swimming eyes had marked her greeting. She pointed to the open door and the white face in it, and in one moment more a pair of <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> had closed upon Michael, and with a dreamy murmur, 'Mam-mam, mam-ma,' the curly head was on her bosom, the precious weight on her lap, her husband by her side, the door had closed on them, they were driving away. 'Oh! is it real? Is he well?' 'Perfectly well! Only sleepy. Strong, grown, well cared for.' 'My boy, my boy,' and she felt him all over, gazed at the rosy face whenever a tantalising flash of lamplight permitted, then kissed and kissed, till the boy awoke more...", "...that had been told to me by some other dreamer. I had talked with Golden Star, seeking to teach her the lesson that my dear instructress of the new time had taught me, and had awakened half mad with the perplexities of my divided love--the love of the past that was dead and of the present that was alive. I had seen my sister-bride come forth out of her tomb to greet me, clothed in her bridal robes, with the dust of the grave in her hair and on her face. I had clasped her in my longing <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and kissed the dust from her lips, and while I yet held her in my embrace her form had grown cold and stiff again. Then, in the agony of my sorrow, I had strained her to my breast, and, under the pressure of my arms, she had crumbled in my grasp and fallen, a little heap of grey bones and dusty garments, at my feet. Once more I had awakened with my gasping cry of horror still sounding in my ears, and then, not daring to seek sleep again, I had risen and gone out to watch for the...", "...scorn of self--whose hope is beyond the Lazar-house--whose feet, already winded for immortality, trample, with a conqueror's march, upon the graves of Death! While this the ministry and the office of love,--along that street in which Adrian and Irene had met at last--came singing, reeling, roaring, the dissolute and abandoned crew who had fixed their quarters in the Convent of Santa Maria de' Pazzi, their bravo chief at their head, and a nun (no longer in nun's garments) upon either <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> \"A health to the Plague!\" shouted the ruffian: \"A health to the Plague!\" echoed his frantic Bacchanals. \"A health to the Plague, may she ever, as now, Loose the rogue from his chain, and the nun from her vow; To the gaoler a sword--to the captive a key, Hurrah for Earth's Curse!

At this point of the discourse, Mrs. Lewis produced the laboured composition, and placed it in her hand. Miss Hughes raised the letter, glanced at the direction, saw her own name written as plainly as the nervous fingers of its agitated writer would permit, let it fall to the ground, and sunk into the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> of Mrs. Lewis. While this scene was acting in a private room, Grimaldi was acting upon the public stage; and conscious that his hopes depended upon his exertions, he did not suffer his anxieties, great as they were, to interfere with his performance. Towards the conclusion of the first piece he heard somebody enter Mr. Hughes's box--and there sat the object of all his anxiety. \"She has got the letter,\" thought the trembling actor; \"she must have decided by this time.\" He...", "...your House. For the discharge of a constitutional duty, it is a sufficient reward to me to be assured that you will unite in consummating what remains to be done. I feel, also, great satisfaction in learning that the other subjects which I have communicated or recommended, will meet with due attention; that you are deeply impressed with the importance of an effectual organization of the militia; and that the advance and success of the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> under the command of General Wayne is regarded by you, no less than myself, as a proof of the perseverance, prowess, and superiority of our troops. G. WASHINGTON. TUESDAY, December 2. The SPEAKER laid before the House a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, stating his intention of resigning his office on the last day of January next, and which he now communicates, in order that an opportunity may be given, previous to that event, to institute any...", "...ten minutes after they had fired. The country round our camp lends itself in the most unsatisfactory manner to small attacks of this kind, as on all sides there are enormous cemeteries, with thousands of graves and vaults, into any of which a few men could get and hide with absolute safety. The night was dark, the moon having set, and a haze come up, as it generally does here towards morning. On investigation I found that the native officer commanding the patrol was badly wounded in the <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and that 2 horses were slightly wounded, and one soldier and one horse were killed. While I and the Brigade-Major, and the Cavalry Colonel, were standing together, near the man who was killed, an intelligent? native sentry who was posted about 400 yards off, took it into his wise head to decide that we were a party of the enemy, and putting a bullet into his rifle, took a deliberate and, I must say, extremely good shot at us, aiming, I am glad to say, just a few feet too high. I...", "...talk that my son gave about the characteristics of this Stabler tree, namely, its beauty as a shade tree. He didn't mention that, and I don't think any one has mentioned it in connection with the black walnut. Now, the black walnut trees, as we meet them along the roadsides, vary exceedingly in habit of growth. The majority of them have very few main limbs, perhaps not over half a dozen main limbs on a tree, and they will be gaunt, ungainly things, stretched out straight, like great <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> reaching out with very little beauty. Now, if you plant seedlings, that is what you are likely to get on your lawn. You may have something that is not pretty except as a trunk, but the tree that produces these very remarkable nuts is also one of the most beautiful in its conformation. It is shaped just like an umbrella, rather low, very spreading, and very frequently with a very much larger number of limbs than almost any black walnut tree that I have ever seen, and its habit of...", "...in the Strand. The donkey-barrow of a costermonger passed me, loaded with a bluejacket, a flower-girl, several soldiers, and a Staff captain whose spurred boots wagged joyously over the stern of the barrow. A motor cab followed, two Australian troopers on the roof of that, with a hospital nurse, her cap awry, sitting across the knees of one of them. A girl on the kerb, continuously springing a rattle in a sort of trance, shrieked with laughter at the nurse. Lines of people with linked <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> chanted and surged along, bare-headed, or with hats turned into jokes. A private car, a beautiful little saloon in which a lady was solitary, stopped near me, and the lady beckoned with a smile to a Canadian soldier who was close. He first stared in surprise at this fashionable stranger, and then got in beside her with obviously genuine alacrity. The hubbub swelled and rolled in increasing delirium. Out of the upper windows of the Hotel Cecil, a headquarters of the Air Force, a...", "...one that would never be disfigured by envy or malice; never grow black with passion, and oh! never, never look senseless, idiotic, and drivelling, as another face on which he looked so often did; but to Harry's fancy, it was like the sky on a calm summer's day, always pure and bright, and always the same. It was brighter and happier and better altogether when, in the fresh morning time, the little lady went tripping by on the pavement beneath the window with a small market basket on her <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> Then Harry, clambering to the sill, and leaning out, could see straight into it; and sometimes it happened that, attracted by that fixed gaze of earnest admiration, that happy face would be turned upward, and break into a beaming smile, as the sunny eyes met the large, blue, mournful orbs looking down upon them. Then there would be a smile on the lip and a song in the heart of the little watcher for the rest of the day. Cheering and dear as that face had ever been to him since he...", "...pronounced they would fetch no more than four thousand pounds. These diamonds, however, Colonel Esmond reserved, having a special use for them: but the Chelsey house, plate, goods, &c., with the exception of a few articles which he kept back, were sold by his orders; and the sums resulting from the sale invested in the public securities so as to realize the aforesaid annual income of three hundred pounds. Having now something to leave, he made a will and despatched it home. The <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> was now in presence of the enemy; and a great battle expected every day. 'Twas known that the General-in-Chief was in disgrace, and the parties at home strong against him, and there was no stroke this great and resolute player would not venture to recall his fortune when it seemed desperate. Frank Castlewood was with Colonel Esmond; his General having gladly taken the young nobleman on to his staff. His studies of fortifications at Bruxelles were over by this time. The fort he was...", "...of officers, who assured the earl of Mar that the pretender would soon be with them in person. The death of Louis the XIV. struck a general damp upon their spirits; but they laid their account with being joined by a powerful body in England. The earl of Mar, by letters and messages, pressed the chevalier to come over without further delay. He, in the meantime, assumed the title of lieutenant-general of the pretender's forces, and published a declaration, exhorting the people to take <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> for their lawful sovereign. This was followed by a shrewd manifesto, explaining the national grievances, and assuring the people of redress. Some of his partisans attempted to surprise the castle of Edinburgh; but were prevented by the vigilance and activity of colonel Stuart, lieutenant-governor of that fortress. The duke of Argyle set out for Scotland, as commander-in-chief of the forces in North Britain: the earl of Sutherland set sail in the Queen-borough ship-of-war for the...", "...one hundred and twenty thousand warriors with great difficulty. If each one of those cast his pebble on the ground, they would form a figure of this sort. Look this way, worthiness.\" At the side of the first quadrangle lay a second of the same width, but considerably shorter; its color was not uniform either, but was composed of a number of colors. \"This figure,\" said Pentuer, \"is about five yards wide, but is only six yards in length. An immense number of men is now lacking,--our <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> has lost one-third of its warriors.\" \"Wisdom of men like thee, O prophet, will bring more good to the state than an army,\" interrupted the high priest. Pentuer bent before him and continued,-- \"In this new figure which represents the present army of the pharaoh ye see, worthy men, besides the ruddy color which designates Egyptians by blood, three other stripes,--black, white, and yellow. They represent mercenary divisions,--Ethiopians, Asiatics, Greeks, and Libyans.

Her poor eyes were weary of weeping when she at last recognized Victor's familiar step approaching down the passage. She hastily opened the door, and as soon as she FELT that he was near her, for she could not see him, she asked: \"Where have you spent the night? Where have you come from? What has happened?\" His only answer was to fling his <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> round her neck, following alike the impulse of his heart and the advice of experience, which told him that this would be the best explanation he could give. Still it did not prevent him from trying to justify himself, although he was careful not to confess the truth, for he dreaded his mother's censure, knowing well enough that she would be less indulgent than his own conscience. \"I believe you, my son,\" said the good woman, gravely; \"you wouldn't deceive me, I'm sure.\" And she...", "...the churches and cloisters that had not been sold, allowed compensation for what had been sold, reduced the number of bishoprics by six, put education and the censorship of the press under the oversight of the bishops, and declared the Catholic religion the only one to be tolerated.

Meanwhile it had not fully permeated the republican party. The proposal of unrestricted liberty to all forms of worship was supported by a small minority, and the new constitution of 1855 called upon the Spanish nation to maintain and guard the Catholic religion which \"the Spaniards profess\"; yet no Spaniard was to be persecuted on account of his faith, so long as he did not commit irreligious acts.

But the saga records also the fame and prowess of that other Harold, the son of Godwine, and magnifies the power of such an enemy. Perhaps the English king trusted at first in the ability of the northern earls to take care of their own territory, and only tried to stand guard over the southern coast. He gathered an <span class=\"clocktext\">a.m.</span> and kept it together all the latter part of the summer, a most unprecedented and difficult thing in those days; and with help from the local forces, or what we should call the militia, his soldiers kept guard along the shores of Sussex and Kent.
