Of course, subsequent events gave General Grant and most of the other actors in that battle their appropriate place in history, but the danger of sudden popular clamors is well illustrated by this case. The battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing, was one of the most fiercely contested of the war. On the morning of April 6, 1862, the five divisions of McClernand, Prentiss, Hurlbut, W. H. L. Wallace, and Sherman, aggregated about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> thousand men. We had no intrenchments of any sort, on the theory that as soon as Buell arrived we would march to Corinth to attack the enemy. The rebel army, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston, was, according to their own reports and admissions, forty-five thousand strong, had the momentum of attack, and beyond all question fought skillfully from early morning till about 2 a.m., when their commander-in-chief was killed by a Mini-ball in the calf of his leg, which...", "...Berkeley renewed his proposition for admitting ladies to the debates, by moving a resolution, \"that it is the opinion of this house that the resolution of the select committee appointed in 1835 to consider the means of admitting ladies to a portion of the stranger's gallery, together with the plan of Sir R.

One shot struck the schooner to windward in the bow, a foot or two above the water level. Another went through her foresail, close to the mast. \"A foot more, and you would have cut his foremast asunder.\" The vessel to leeward had been struck by only one shot, the other passing under her...", "...dyed red with blood.

He also tried to discover how far the race of Westmoreland and Cumberland farm-folk--the 'Matthews' and the 'Michaels' of the poet, as described by him--were real or fancy pictures, or how far the characters of the Dalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by tourist influences during the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years that have passed since the Lake poet was laid to rest. With regard to the latter point, it will be remembered that Mr. Ruskin, writing in 1876, said that 'the Border peasantry, painted with absolute fidelity by Scott and Wordsworth,' are, as hitherto, a scarcely injured race; that in his fields at Coniston he had men who might have fought with Henry V. at Agincourt without being distinguished from any of his knights; that he could take his tradesmen's word for a...", "...kon-kord'), that most beautiful of city squares, where a sight not so beautiful once stood.

Under the old _regime_ the landlord used to pay one-half of the poor rate and the occupier the other half. The outcry of the landed interest, that under the County Councils they would be liable to be robbed by excessive poor rates, resulted in their share being made a charge on the Imperial Treasury, by which means they secured a dole of L350,000 a year out of the L725,000 concerned in the financial arrangements under the Act.

No one can tell how old this famous saying is. Perhaps it is as old as France herself. Certainly there never was a time when the men of the great family of Montcalm-Gozon were not ready to fight for their king and country; and so Montcalm, like Wolfe, was a soldier born....", "...him in that year very near Henry Clay. That from 1824 he grew more and more averse to the necessary details and results of a protective policy is probably true. Nor ought it to be, even from the standpoint of free-traders, serious accusation that a public man varies his political utterances upon the tariff question, if the variation be progressive and steadily towards what they deem a greater liberality. To Van Buren, however, the tariff question never had a capital importance. Even <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years later, while rehearsing from his retirement the achievements of his party in excuse of the support he reluctantly gave Buchanan, he did not name among its services its insistence upon merely revenue duties, although he had then for years been himself committed to that doctrine.

This boat was, perhaps, two hundred and forty feet long and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> feet wide, with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to; but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her holds.

He was educated at Cambridge: he was apprenticed to his uncle after taking his degree: and he was received into the Mercers' Company at the age of twenty-four.

To insure the safety of this valuable convoy, the Brest Fleet was sent to meet it at a designated point; five ships going first, and twenty-five following a few days later. Robespierre's orders to the admiral, Villaret-Joyeuse, were to avoid battle, if possible, but at all hazards to secure the merchant fleet, or his head would answer for it. About the same time, Howe, who had kept his vessels in port during the winter, sailed from the Channel with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> ships-of-the-line. These he soon divided into two squadrons; one of which, numbering six, after performing a specific service, was not ordered to rejoin the main body, but to cruise in a different spot.

But I now proceed to the discussion of the subject which I have assigned to this chapter. I. THE ANATOMICAL ARGUMENT. There has been a time when the teeth and intestines of man were supposed to indicate the necessity of a mixed diet--a diet partly animal and partly vegetable. Four out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> teeth were found to resemble slightly, the teeth of carnivorous animals. In like manner, the length of the intestinal tube was thought to be midway between that of the flesh-eating, and that of the herb-eating quadrupeds. But, unfortunately for this mode of defending an animal diet, it has been found out that the fruit and vegetable-eating monkey race, and the herb-eating camel, have the said four-pointed teeth much more pointed than those of man and that the intestines,...", "...\"It buys up great estates, which the peasantry could not otherwise acquire.

Now out of eighty millions of acres to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> millions of inhabitants we find one hundred and twenty-five millions of small lots registered on the tax-list (I don't give fractions). Thus, you will observe, we have gone to the utmost limit of agrarian law, and yet we have not seen the last of poverty or dissatisfaction.

The difference between them consists in the self-fertilised flowers in Table 9/G, being produced by self-fertilised parents, and the crossed flowers by crossed parents, which in the later generations had become somewhat closely inter-related, and had been subjected all the time to nearly the same conditions. These two tables include fifty cases relating to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> species. The flowers on many other species were crossed and self-fertilised, but as only a few were thus treated, the results cannot be trusted, as far as fertility is concerned, and are not here given. Some other cases have been rejected, as the plants were in an unhealthy condition. If we look to the figures in the two tables expressing the ratios between the mean relative fertility of the crossed and self-fertilised flowers, we see that in a majority of cases (i.e., in...", "...just before I left New York, and offered for sale.

They set themselves to their task and made the trip from New York to Albany, a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> hours. Success had at last come to the quiet, modest, persevering Fulton. After this trial trip the Clermont was used as a regular passenger boat between New York and Albany. The steamboat was Fulton's great gift to the world and his last work of public interest. He died in 1815. But the Clermont was only the beginning of steam-driven craft on the rivers and lakes of our country.

The one common feature of the Italian provinces is the poverty produced by the crushing taxes and agricultural depression. Absentee landlordism has blighted southern Italy as it has Ireland.

Hence the question with the people in overcrowded districts is simply emigration or starvation. The southern Italian is driven from home by necessity to work, and work is to be found in America, so he comes. His labor is mostly unskilled, and this is in demand here. The result is that almost eighty per cent. of the Italian immigrants are...", "...him.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years he persevered, amid every kind of hardship, danger, and discouragement, in the effort to build up New France. He had personal ambitions as an explorer, which were kept in strict subordination to his duty to the king. He possessed concentration of aim without fanaticism. His signal unselfishness was adorned by a patience which equalled that of Marlborough. Inspired by large ideals, he did not scorn imperfect means. Thus there are certain large aspects of Champlain's...", "...with Stuart was formally dissolved in April, 1841, and one with Logan formed which continued for four years.

The river falling made the current in these bayous very rapid, increasing the difficulty of building and permanently fastening these bridges; but the ingenuity of the \"Yankee soldier\" was equal to any emergency. The bridges were soon built of such material as could be found near by, and so substantial were they that not a single mishap occurred in crossing all the army with artillery, cavalry and wagon trains, except the loss of one siege gun (a <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pounder).

The New World monkeys, on the other hand, have an additional premolar in each half-jaw, or thirty-six teeth altogether.

Achille Pigoult, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years of age, had been eighteen years a clerk in Grevin's office with no means of becoming himself a notary. His father, son of the justice of peace, had died of a so-called apoplexy, having gone wrong in business.

The Trumbull, of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> guns, was commanded by Captain James Nicholson, a spirited and skillful officer. During a cruise in June, 1780, a large ship was perceived bearing down upon the Trumbull's quarter. At half-past eleven, she hauled a point more to stern of her. The Trumbull now made sail, hauling upon a wind towards her, upon which she came down upon the Trumbull's beams. The latter then took in all her small sails, hauled her courses up, hove the main-topsail to the mast, cleared for action,...", "...at the fire of determination in the other's low voice.

Antiochus Eupator commenced his career by bringing a vast army against Judas, consisting of one hundred thousand foot, twenty thousand horse, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> elephants, and three hundred armed chariots of war. Judas's army being so small, compared with that of the enemy, encouraged his men by the watchword which he issued among them: \"Victory is of the Lord.\" Animated by the hope of success, they managed to surprise the enemy at night, and slew upwards of four thousand of them, and then made a safe retreat to Jerusalem.

In the case of print butter, this is a simple matter to determine. As shown in Fig. 2, first mark the pound print in the center in order to divide it in half; after cutting it into two pieces, cut each half into two, and finally each fourth into two. With the pound print cut into eight pieces, divide and cut each eighth into four pieces. As there will be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> small pieces, each one will represent one thirty-second of a pound, or 1/2 ounce. BUTTER SUBSTITUTES 13. In about the year 1870, through a desire to procure a cheaper article than butter for the poorer classes of France, came the manufacture of the first substitute for butter. Since that time the use of butter substitutes has gradually increased, until at the present time millions of pounds are consumed every year. A certain amount of prejudice against their use...", "...Champaign and Iroquois counties, where it becomes connected with the prairies that project eastward from the Illinois River and its tributaries.

But neither Ramman-abaliddin nor his successor was able to take advantage of its weakness; discord and want of energy soon brought about their own ruin. The dynasty of Pashe disappeared towards the middle of the Xth century, and a family belonging to the \"Countries of the Sea\" took its place: it had continued for about one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years, and had produced eleven kings.* * It is no easy matter to draw up an exact list of this dynasty, and Hilprecht's attempt to do so contains more than one doubtful name.

The campaign, from winter quarters to the surrender of Lee and the march to Danville, had been a hard one.

When gold is parted from sixty-six _librae_ of silver, the silver, copper, and sulphur regulus weighs one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> _librae_.

In this manner litharge and hearth-lead are made, which are re-smelted in the first furnace. The cakes that are made from these are placed in the third furnace, so that the lead may be separated from the copper and used again, for it contains very little silver.

The statement that water freezes at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> degrees Fahrenheit has been proved true by innumerable tests.

We must notice, also, the significant fact that of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pilgrims who jogged along together that April day, four were of a military character, eleven belonged to the clergy, and seventeen were of the common people. A century before Chaucer's time, when the feudal spirit was still all-powerful, there were but two classes of men thought worthy of consideration, the knighthood and the clergy; and in the romances of chivalry knights and priests exclusively composed the _dramatis personae_.

This boat was, perhaps, two hundred and forty feet long and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> feet wide, with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to; but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her holds.

Besides which, one Adderly, of Providence, who had formerly been very helpful to Captain Phips in the search of this wreck, did, upon former agreement, meet him now with a little vessel here; and he with his few hands, took up about six tuns of silver; whereof, nevertheless, he made so little use that in a year or two he died at Bermudas, and, as I have heard, he ran distracted some while before he died....", "...both religious and secular.

We followed the same road we had taken in coming, till about four miles before reaching Ponte de Pinheiro, and then struck off towards Porto de Praja. This road was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> miles longer by land, but so much shorter by sea, that the passage is made by steamer from Porto de Praja to Rio Janeiro in half an hour.

The purpose of this provision is to avoid having the entire senate renewed at the same time. As a result, not more than one third are new and inexperienced members at any particular time.

For this review, we selected from our Regiment, eight companies of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> men each--the best drilled soldiers that we had. It was my place to ride in the rear of the Regiment as it marched down Pennsylvania Avenue, and no command made a better show than ours. From the Capitol to the reviewing stand, the marching and wheeling were simply perfect.

F. C. Hessel in 1830 that thirty-two types of symmetry are possible in crystals. Hessel's work remained overlooked for sixty years, but the same important result was independently arrived at by the same method by A. Gadolin in 1867. At the present day, crystals are considered as belonging to one or other of thirty-two classes, corresponding with these <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> types of symmetry, and are grouped in six systems. More recently, theories of crystal structure have attracted attention, and have been studied as purely geometrical problems of the homogeneous partitioning of space. The historical development of the subject is treated more fully in the article CRYSTALLOGRAPHY in the 9th edition of this work. Reference may also be made to C. M.

The number of faces and corners seems to be variable in this genus, but may perhaps be typical in some species....", "...with their cameras, and accompanied by Mr. Alcando, they were on the concrete wall.

This would seem to lead to the conclusion that Ryerson after all was not a statesman, since a statesman must, in our age, carry out his measures and at the same time retain the confidence of his colleagues and the electors. But this is just what Ryerson did, although he did not do it directly through the Legislature. He appealed to a Court beyond the Legislature--the whole body of intelligent men and women of Upper Canada--and this Court sustained him in his work for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years, during which time it is doubtful if any single constituency in the country would have elected him to two successive Parliaments. If this be true we may safely assume that it was a happy chance which gave us a non-political Education Department during our formative period.

Compared with other nations, France has least been able to hold her own in the matter of trade with the Argentine. In 1876 the importations from France formed 23.2 per cent. of the total imports; while in 1908 they formed only 9.9 per cent. of the totals, making a proportional diminution of 13.3 per cent. in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years. Our imports from England, however, which in 1876 were 24.9 per cent. of the total, had increased to 34 per cent. by 1908; representing a proportional increase of 9 per cent. We are thus justified in concluding that all our efforts to develop the current of Franco-Argentine exchange will contribute powerfully to fortify the influence of France, and the sense of confraternity between the two Latin nations.

Of late years, publishers have often given the length and width of their books in inches. After the sheets come from the press, they are folded to page size.

Lee was born in 1807, of an old aristocratic Virginia family; he graduated from West Point (1829) and spent <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years in the regular army; he distinguished himself in the Mexican War. Just before the Civil War broke out, he wrote to a friend: \"If the Union is dissolved and the Government disrupted, I shall return to my native state and share the miseries of my people, and, save in defense, will draw my sword no more.\" A few days after the fall of Fort Sumter, he was offered the command of the United States Army and declined it. He resigned and after Virginia...", "...the worst of the lot. The truth is of course that I am wholly worked out; but it's nearly done, and shall go somehow according to promise.

B._, no hope, I fear, this mail, but we'll see what the afternoon does for me. 4.15.--Well, it's done. Those tragic 16 pp. are at last finished, and I have put away <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pages of chips, and have spent thirteen days about as nearly in Hell as a man could expect to live through. It's done, and of course it ain't worth while, and who cares?

But, to make it entirely satisfactory, and to enable every citizen to understand the important point of the government expenditures--a point on which the citizens of a free and representative government should be always well informed--to attain this full satisfaction, let us...", "...a higher education, and enjoy the works of the elder Persian poets, or the books of Nevai, who stepped forward as the first of the Tchagatay poets in that kind of accomplishment, by which all the rest of the poets of the Islamitish polite world acquired renown.

Of our nine hundred and twenty-six dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> cents, ninety-one dollars and twenty-six cents went for butter. Remember that your butter is one-tenth part of the whole. Next comes flour. Our seven barrels cost us seventy dollars and eighty-three cents.

The parliament, for the present, contented themselves with empowering the king to appoint <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> commissioners to compile a body of canon laws, which were to be valid, though never ratified by parliament.

So the siege dragged on into June. Two deserters informed Pompey of a weak spot in Caesar's line. At this point Pompey made a sudden attack. For once Caesar's troops were surprised and panic-stricken. Even his own presence did not cause them to rally. Nearly one thousand of his men fell, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> standards, and a few hundred soldiers were captured. This victory was the ruin of Pompey's cause. Its importance was exaggerated. His followers were sure that the war was practically over; and so certain were they of ultimate success that they neglected to follow up the advantage gained, and gave Caesar opportunity to recover from the blow.

It is evident that when he prepared the oration against Meidias he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years of age, and had not as yet acquired any fame or reputation. This appears to me to be the chief reason for his having made up his quarrel with Meidias for a sum of money, for he was far from being a \"mild-mannered\" man, but keen and savage in avenging the injuries which he received. It must have been because he saw, that to ruin a man who was so rich, so able a speaker, and so well-befriended as Meidias, was too difficult a task for a man of his political power, and so...", "...reading the letter that the priest had written for her. \"If the lawyers are English, that shows that your parents are English.\" \"Oh, I'd rather be the same as Lise and the others.

Attempting to recover them, he was defeated again at Ghajdewan and driven {24} back to Hisar.[2] Finding, after a time, his chances there desperate, he returned to Kabul.

What seems more singular still is that the factories which work at the King's expense are generally administered in a thriftless fashion, and that the factory of Guadalajara was being greatly mismanaged at the time in question. However, subsequently to my visit, changes...", "...The fog lifted, and all the guns of the fleet and the forts began to play upon the breastworks. General Pope brought up his heavy field guns, and replied. He paid but little attention to the fort, but sent his shot and shell at the gunboats. Captain Mower, of the First United States artillery, commanded the batteries, and his fire was so accurate that the gunboats were obliged to take new positions. Shortly after the cannonade began, a shot from the fort struck one of Captain Mower's <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pounders in the muzzle and disabled it; but he kept up his fire through the day, dismounting three guns in the lower fort and disabling two of the gunboats. Nearly all of the shells from the Rebel batteries fell harmlessly into the soft earth. There were very few of General Pope's men injured. They soon became accustomed to the business, and paid but little attention to the screaming of the shot and the explosions of the shells. They had many hearty laughs, as the shells...", "...But there is also an old cycle to be taken into account: the original thirteen-decade period of the Hans, that began in 194, and ended its first \"day\" in 63 or so,--to name convenient dates.

It is about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> and a half feet thick, and in places is still in position to the height of twenty-six feet. Captain Cros also excavated a large rectangular building, and brought to light various objects of interest, including implements of flint and copper, together with a brick-stamp of Naram-Sin, which latter may be regarded as evidence that building operations were carried on in Lagash by a Semitic king of Agade during the period of Semitic supremacy.

There are, indeed, a large number of known asteroids; our catalogues contained four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> of them up to the time when Witt exposed his now famous plate. Had the asteroid Witt then found been merely as other asteroids, it would never have received the prominent position that has now to be assigned to it in any account of the astronomy of the century. That object found by Witt on this night which is to be henceforth memorable in astronomy is of a wholly exceptional kind. Had Eros been merely an ordinary asteroid, Witt might no doubt have received the credit to...", "...all the apartments on the ground floor.

How it will compare with Panama as an avenue of commerce is a question to which Americans anxiously await the answer.\" The jubilee of the Suez Canal, work on which commenced in 1859, took place on April 25, 1909. When I passed through in 1874 its depth was about twenty-six feet; the present depth is about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> and a half feet, and improvements are now going on which will bring it to thirty-four feet. The original width was seventy-one feet on the bottom, and this has been gradually increased until at present the bottom width is ninety-seven and a half feet. In 1870 there passed through the canal four hundred and eighty-six ships, whose gross tonnage was 654,914. Last year 3,795 ships used the canal, and their total tonnage was over 19,000,000.

Lastly the sugar production of the island developed another product, which was not only popular on the island, but became an article of exportation. From 1760 to 1767 Havana, which was the only port qualified to export sweetmeats, sent out annually thirteen thousand cases of sixteen arrobas each. In the period of five years from 1791 to 1795 inclusive, the export was 7,572,600 arrobas. White sugar was then worth <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> reals per arroba, brown sugar twenty-eight. The French immigrants from Santo Domingo were an element that contributed to the improvement and promotion of the sugar industry. Though they furnished a far smaller proportion of the island's wealth, hides, cane, brandy, refined honey and wax also began to figure in the economic records of Cuba. Wax became a valuable product about the year 1764 when Bishop Morell brought a few swarms of bees from his Florida exile. It was...", "...and mining for gold.

They met an armed party of one hundred Indians; but these men put away their weapons when signals of peace were made, and brought presents in token of good-will. The house to which they went was round, with a hemispherical roof or dome. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> paces in diameter, divided by wicker work into different rooms. Smaller houses, for persons of rank lower than the chiefs, surrounded it. The natives told the explorers that Guacanagari himself had retired to the hills.

We know that the body can stand an acceleration of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> feet per second without trouble.

The objections to this plan are as follows: assuming the most favorable conditions of climate, and the largest possible produce, the wheat could certainly not take up the whole of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pounds of nitrogen applied, and the crop which requires nearly one pound of nitrogen in every one hundred pounds of gross produce, would be certainly less than three thousand two hundred pounds, if supplied with only thirty-two pounds of nitrogen.

When <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years old he wrote his \"Researches on the Causes of the Principal Physical Facts,\" though this work did not appear from the press until 1794, when he was fifty years of age. In this treatise he inquires into the origin of compounds and of minerals; also he conceived that all the rocks as well as all chemical compounds and minerals originated from organic life. These inquiries were reiterated in his \"Memoirs on Physics and Natural History,\" which appeared in 1797, when he was...", "...if served with a new impulse,\" the guns of Sumter redoubled their fire.

It was made for me; the \"rest of the Club\" went without. He invented the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> members and their names. He invented the five favorite speakers and their five separate styles. He invented their speeches, and reported them himself. He would have kept that Club going until now, if I hadn't deserted, he said.

In the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> unions to which Outdoor Labour Test Orders were applied by themselves--these culminating in the Outdoor Relief Regulation Order 1852 (still in force)--the policy of the Central Authority was to leave the discretion of the local authorities unfettered, with regard to the grant of outdoor relief to married women, except the wives of those men (\"the able-bodied and their families\") to whom outdoor relief was only to be granted in return for labour.

One day, while in prison, he observed the lid of the pot in which his dinner was being prepared lifted up by the vapour of the water boiling inside.

On the next day, the Saratoga hoisted English colors, and came along side a ship which had two brigs in company, then running up the American ensign, she poured in a broadside, while Lieutenant Barney, with fifty men, boarded the enemy. The immediate result was, the conquest of a ship of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> guns and ninety men. The two brigs, one of fourteen and the other of four guns, were also captured. The division of prize money would have made the officers rich, but no division took place, for all but the Saratoga were captured by a seventy-four and several frigates.

Buffon was rich, but, greatly to his credit, devoted all his life to the care of the Royal Garden and to writing his works, being a most prolific author. He was not an observer, not even a closet naturalist. \"I have passed,\" he is reported to have said, \"fifty years at my desk.\" Appointed in 1739, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years old, Intendant of the Royal Garden, he divided his time between his retreat at Montbard and Paris, spending four months in Paris and the remainder of the year at Montbard, away from the distractions and dissipations of the capital. It is significant that he wrote his great _Histoire naturelle_ at Montbard and not at Paris, where were the collections of natural history. His biographer, Flourens, says: \"What dominates in the character of Buffon is elevation, force,...", "...if not _de jure_.

The defeat was a crushing blow to the aged Warham who never recovered from it and died three months later; and it caused the immediate resignation of the Chancellorship by Sir Thomas More--a _rara avis_ among statesmen of the day, with whom conscience actually had the last word, not the King's will.

Discomfort and oppression in a room lighted by candles or oil are less felt than in one lighted by any of the older forms of gas burner; and the partial explanation of this is to be found in the fact that, when a room is illuminated with candles or oil, people are contented with a feebler and more local light than when using gas. In a room of the size described, the inmates would be more likely to use two candles placed near their books, or on a table, than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> scattered about the room. Moreover, the amount of water vapor given off during the combustion of gas is greater than in the case of the other illuminants.

Manhattan, it is true, also added eleven churches, but they were all above Forty-second Street, most of them far uptown. The tenth of November, 1883, was a red letter day in our calendar. It was the quadricentennial of Luther's birthday. The preparations for the celebration met with a hearty response in the city. The large dailies gave much space to the occasion. Dr. Seiss delivered a memorable address in Steinway Hall. Under the auspices of the Evangelical...", "...calculate, and Latimer was too plain spoken on dangerous questions to be useful as a political supporter. The session commenced on the 15th of January. The first step was to receive the final submission of convocation. The undignified resistance was at last over, and the clergy had promised to abstain for the future from unlicensed legislation. To secure their adherence to their engagements, an act[678] was passed to make the breach of that engagement penal; and a commission of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> persons, half of whom were to be laymen, was designed for the revision of the Canon law.[679] The next most important movement was to assimilate the trials for heresy with the trials for other criminal offences. I have already explained at length the manner in which the bishops abused their judicial powers. These powers were not absolutely taken away, but ecclesiastics were no longer permitted to arrest _ex officio_ and examine at their pleasure.

Every purchaser enters free.\" How ordinary mortals can resist buying Barnum's Autobiography for one dollar--such a bargain as never was--is incomprehensible. I believe they can not.

Every accessible part of the camp was fortified with lines and heavy pieces of battering cannon, and the foot of the hills secured by difficult defiles.

KING OF PRUSSIA DEFEATED AT KOLIN. On the thirteenth day of June, the king of Prussia quitted the camp before Prague, escorted by a few battalions and squadrons, with which he joined the prince of Bevern at Milkowitz, Mareschal Keith, it is said, strenuously opposed this measure, and advised either raising the siege entirely, and attacking the Austrians with the united forces of Prussia, or postponing the attack on the camp at Kolin, until his majesty...", "...New England feeling and New England votes. These measures, and the New England votes in support of them, may be taken as samples and specimens of all the rest. In 1820 (observe, Mr. President, in 1820) the people of the West besought Congress for a reduction in the price of lands. In favor of that reduction, New England, with a delegation of forty members in the other house, gave thirty-three votes, and one only against it. The four Southern States, with more than fifty members, gave <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> votes for it, and seven against it. Again, in 1821, (observe again, Sir, the time,) the law passed for the relief of the purchasers of the public lands. This was a measure of vital importance to the West, and more especially to the Southwest. It authorized the relinquishment of contracts for lands which had been entered into at high prices, and a reduction in other cases of not less than thirty-seven and a half per cent on the purchase-money. Many millions of dollars, six or...", "...also to those just coming into the blessed light. All honor to that God-loving, God-fearing woman, Mary Baker G.

RUPTURE AND OTHER SERIOUS ILLS HEALED When I took up the study of Christian Science nearly three years ago, I was suffering from a very bad rupture of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years' standing. Sometimes the pain was so severe that it seemed as if I could not endure it. These spells would last four or five hours, and while everything was done for me that could be done, no permanent relief came to me until I commenced reading Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. After I had once looked into it I wanted to read all the time. I was so absorbed in the study of the \"little book\" that I hardly realized when the healing came, but I was healed,...", "...appearance in politics was as a member of the Legislature of New York, in 1784, when twenty-eight years old; five years after, he was appointed Attorney-General; in 1791 he was elected to the Senate of the United States; and in 1801, at the age of forty-five, _seventeen_ years after he fairly entered public life, he became Vice-President. Hamilton was a member of Congress at twenty-five, and at thirty-two was Secretary of the Treasury; Jefferson wrote the great Declaration when only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years old; and the present Vice-President is a much younger man than Burr was when he reached that station. The statement, that Burr was the rival of Washington and Adams for the Presidency, is absurd. Under the Constitution, at that time, each elector voted for two persons,--the candidate who received the greatest number of votes (if a majority of the whole) being declared President, and the one having the next highest number Vice-President. In 1792, at which time Burr...", "...suspicions of the Lieutenant-Governor's motives. But the excitement was not confined to the Opposition. It was participated in by the Conservatives, and, even, for a time, by most of the ultra-Tories. On the 14th of March, the House, by a vote of fifty-three to two, adopted a resolution unequivocally assertive of the principles which the ex-Councillors had endeavoured to maintain. Ten days later an address to the Lieutenant-Governor, based on this resolution, was passed by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> to nineteen. It expressed deep regret that his Excellency had consented to accept the resignation of his late Council. It declared the Assembly's entire want of confidence in the new appointments, and humbly requested that immediate steps might be taken to remove the new Councillors from office. Meanwhile, petitions on the all-engrossing subject poured into the Assembly from all over the Province.[231] Public meetings were called in Toronto, as well as in some other of the...", "...but took good care to make certain there were ropes and hobble straps in plenty for tying up the horses and fettering those that were likely to stray, because I knew from experience how much of such supplies might be lost or stolen during the long journey.

MAKING THE BARGAIN We talked over the matter fairly and at great length, all the men of the company and some of the women taking part in the parley. The bargain, as I understood it, was that I was hired for no other service than to guide this company, and also to make suggestions as to the best places for camping, as well as how...", "...corn-field hand. \"Why did you leave, John?\" said a member of the Committee. He coolly replied that \"Handy (his master was named George Handy) got hold of me twice, and I promised my Lord that he should never get hold of me another time.\" Of course it was the severity of these two visitations that made John a thinker and an actor at the same time. The evil practices of the master produced the fruits of liberty in John's breast.

The measurement, it is expressly stated, is based on the measurements of Aristarchus, who makes the diameter of the sun 1/170 of its orbit. Archimedes adds, however, that he himself has measured the angle and that it appears to him to be less than 1/164, and greater than 1/200 part of the orbit. That is to say, reduced to modern terminology, he places the limit of the sun's apparent size between thirty-three minutes and twenty-seven minutes of arc. As the real diameter is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> minutes, this calculation is surprisingly exact, considering the implements then at command. But the honor of first making it must be given to Aristarchus and not to Archimedes. We need not follow Archimedes to the limits of his incomprehensible numbers of sand-grains. The calculation is chiefly remarkable because it was made before the introduction of the so-called Arabic numerals had simplified mathematical calculations.

Gold now commands a premium of thirty-two per cent., payable in treasury notes; but, if such issues be increased one half, they would fall to fifty per cent., and, if doubled, to at least sixty per cent. below specie. At the last rate, if our yearly expenditures, paid in paper, reached $700,000,000, this would command but $280,000,000 in gold, thus subjecting the Government to a loss of $420,000,000 per annum, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> per cent. discount, $224,000,000 per annum. These notes, it is true, bear no interest, which at six per cent. on $280,000,000, would save $16,800,000 a year. But as under the Secretary's plan (hereafter developed) the Government would only pay an annual interest of four per cent. on this loan, the saving would only be $11,200,000.

Jack's story is soon told. He had been to the brig. She had <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> hands, but three men were sick. A strict watch was kept by the mate, not more than ten natives were allowed on board at once. In the port bow boats and the starboard quarter boats hanging on the davits there were two sailors armed with muskets.

The new arrival, who was destined to be the principal figure in the tragic scenes about to be enacted, was a Kentuckian, named Reid. He was some twenty-eight or thirty years of age, of medium size and finely proportioned, but very athletic. He had a frank and engaging expression of countenance, and nothing in his appearance would seem to indicate the hardened ruffian; yet he was reported to have slain <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> men in affrays or personal difficulties since he came into the mining country. From the very day of his arrival, this man became the acknowledged leader of all the lawless elements of our community; and as he seemed to be thirsting for notoriety, outrage followed outrage in rapid succession. Among our own original party was a quiet, inoffensive German, named Schaeffer, than whom a more peaceable man could nowhere be found.

Each tooth is divided into the crown, body, and root. The crown is the grinding surface; the body--the part projecting from the jaw--is the seat of sensation and nutrition; the root is that portion of the tooth which is inserted in the alveolus. The teeth are composed of dentine (ivory) and enamel. The ivory...", "...not only without opposition but with the consent and approval of the inhabitants.

The proposal only received <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> votes for it, twenty-three against it, and seventeen delegates refrained from voting. Therefore the resolution was lost, since it could not obtain a decisive majority. This procedure of the Basle Congress was calculated to embitter both parties. Open rupture could not be long delayed.

She was commanded by Nicholas Biddle, a man combining all the distinguishing qualifications of a great naval commander. After having been at sea a few days, a defect in his masts, and a disposition to mutiny discovered in his crew, induced him to...", "...heavy.

There was powerful reason for this rivalry; the letting of mail contracts hinged on the speed of this special delivery. Dan Gordon claimed he carried the message <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> miles in two hours and twenty minutes, changing teams three times. Dan Noble professed to have driven from Wheeling to Hagerstown, one hundred and eighty-five miles, in fifteen hours and a half.

The poor little woman, if she, instead of having passed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> springs, had not passed more than thirty-one--the difference according to her arithmetic was very great--would have thrown back the prize which Destiny offered her, and preferred to wait for another more in conformity with her tastes.

By October it had expended more than L100,000 in organizing <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> field ambulances. Its total outlay during the war exceeded half a million sterling, and in its various field, town, and village ambulances no fewer than 110,000 men were succoured and nursed.

MISCELLANEOUS ANECDOTES OF THE SAINT. Before we pass on to St. Bonaventure's elevation to the Cardinalate it will be worth while to gather under one heading such scattered memories of him as have been preserved, and which shed additional light on his life and character. These are associated chiefly with the French King St. Louis IX., and St. Thomas Aquinas. As the sainted Franciscan General lived almost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years at the University of Paris, it was but natural he should come into close relationship with the equally sainted King of France. King Louis died 25 August, 1270, and at the second chapter of Pisa, held in 1272, St. Bonaventure introduced into the Order the solemn annual celebration of the day of his death. Mindful of his old-time friendship, our Saint secured this favour from Gregory X, as the first act of grace on the occasion of his coronation.

The naming of the intermediate subdivisions making up the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> points or rhumbs of the compass card is probably due to Flemish navigators; but they were recognized even in the time of Chaucer, who in 1391 wrote, \"Now is thin Orisonte departed in xxiiii partiez by thi azymutz, in significacion of xxiiii partiez of the world: al be it so that ship men rikne thilke partiez in xxxii\" (_Treatise on the Astrolabe_, ed.

By rapid movements, and bold and most brilliant fighting, both the bridge at Columbus and that at West Point were captured.

This was twice attacked by direct assault, and carried the second time. The captures were 3 guns, 500 stands of small arms, 19 locomotive engines, and 240 cars loaded with army supplies, but the greatest importance of securing a crossing at West Point was that it opened a way direct to Macon, which could be used for the entire cavalry corps in case the attack at Columbus should fail.

It was, however, necessary to recognize that in each system there are certain forms which are only partially symmetrical, and these were described as hemihedral and tetartohedral forms (i.e. [Greek: hemi-], half-faced, and [Greek: tetartos], quarter-faced forms).

Thus we see that the whole distance from Detroit to Boston is seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> miles, or one hundred and forty-eight _less_ than from Detroit to Portland. As regards shipments from Detroit to Boston, via the Grand Trunk, the matter is worse, for we have to add one hundred and three miles from Portland to Boston, making the old route two hundred and fifty-three miles shorter to that point than by the newly opened road.

In 734 or 733 Pekah is said to have been slain and to have been succeeded by Hoshea. Now, according to the Old Testament, Menahem reigned ten years; his son, Pekahiah, two years, and Pekah twenty years, a total of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years. Even if we assume that the tribute was paid by Menahem during his last year--which is not at all likely--there would remain twenty-two years to be provided for between 738 and 734 or 733.

Mooween the bear crept nearer; he was crouching now like a cat, stealing along in the soft mud behind Chigwooltz so as to surprise him.

At some time back, then, this creature detached itself as the terminal one of many little saucer-like bodies, which had been for some time previously forming by the gradual constriction of a thick fleshy stem. Before the constriction began to be visible, this stem was the body of a white Hydraform polype, affixed by its base, and furnished at its free extremity with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> tentacles. It had lived several years in this form, developing many Hydroid polypes, just like itself, by successive gemmations. Before it took this shape, which it assumed gradually, its tentacles being developed in geometrical progression, 32 from 16, from 8, from 4,--it was a soft ovoid planule clothed with vibratile cilia, which swam freely in the sea, like an _Infusorium_.

A still more highly developed example of this art is found in the last sonata of all, opus 111; but these are too difficult for our present use.

Milton had been intended for the church; but he felt that he could not subscribe to its intolerance, and that he had another mission to perform. His father accordingly provided sufficient funds for maintaining him for over five years at Horton in a life of studious leisure. The poet's greatest biographer, David Masson, says \"Until Milton was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years of age, if even then, he did not earn a penny for himself.\" Such a course would ruin ninety-nine out of every hundred talented young men; but it was the making of Milton.

It was not until events diminishing the foreign growth of cotton, and enlarging the demand for its fabrics, had been extensively developed, that the older cotton-growing States became willing to allow slavery extension in the Southwest; and, even then, their assent was reluctantly given--the markets for cotton, doubtless, being considered sufficiently limited for the territory under cultivation.

He was angry with Spitzhase for treating him as if he were a fool. \"I tell you what you are,\" he said; \"you are a great boaster. Leave me; I shall get home by myself.\" And he dismissed Spitzhase angrily. The next morning his first word was to ask the waiter for the papers. His eyes eagerly sought the exchange column, and there, just as Spitzhase had prophesied, silver currency had dropped two per cent. Bondavara stood at thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> florins, and what is written is gospel truth. \"Not one shall I sell!\" cried Csanta, clapping his hands. And then he got up and dressed himself. Here was a stroke of luck. It was like a fairy-tale; a man had only to leave the window open at night and next morning his pockets are full of gold.

It had already become famous by the capture of a Federal brigade there in August, by General N. B. Forrest, and was destined to become the theatre of one of the greatest battles of the war. In the Federal army a great change had taken place. General Buell had been relieved from command, and General W. Rosecrans, the hero of the battle of Corinth, appointed in his place. This general assembled his army at Nashville. Thus the two great armies were only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> miles apart, with their outposts almost touching. Bragg, believing that it would be impossible for Rosecrans to advance before spring, established his army in winter quarters, and the soldiers looked forward to two or three months of comparative quiet.

We were a most puissant man-of-war, no doubt, with our five hundred men, Commodore and Captain, backed by our long batteries of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> and twenty-four pounders; yet, for all that, there we lay rocking, helpless as an infant in the cradle. Had it only been a gale instead of a calm, gladly would we have charged upon it with our gallant bowsprit, as with a stout lance in rest; but, as with man-kind, this serene, passive foe--unresisting and irresistible--lived it out, unconquered to the last.

But first, in what direction? The careful search of a huge chart and some knowledge of the Northern and Eastern seaboard led me to mark out a course along the shore of Massachusetts and among the beautiful islands which stud the coast of Maine. The cruise was at that time a novel one, and many were the doubts expressed as to the seaworthiness of my boat. She was twenty-two feet long, nine inches high, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> wide,--canvas-covered, except about four feet of the middle section, with sufficient space to stow two days' food and water, and to carry all the baggage necessary for a week's voyage. The oars were made especially strong for the occasion, of spruce, ten feet three inches in length, and nicely balanced. In addition to provision and clothes, a gun, a couple of hundred feet of stout line, and a boat-hook were stowed in the bottom. The day fixed for departure rose clear.

Tupelo takes glue, paint, or varnish well, and absorbs very little of the material. In this respect it is equal to yellow poplar and superior to cottonwood.

The former varies in color from a dull gray to a dull brown; the latter is whitish or light yellow like that of poplar. The wood is of medium weight, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pounds per cubic foot when dry, or nearly that of red gum and loblolly pine. After seasoning it is difficult to distinguish the better grades of sapwood from poplar. Owing to the prejudice against tupelo gum, it was until recently marketed under such names as bay poplar, swamp poplar, nyssa, cotton gum, circassian walnut, and hazel pine.

All the first or milk teeth should have come through by the time a child is two and a half years old, but wide variations occur both in the time and order of appearance and should occasion no uneasiness if the child seems well. Unusual conditions of any sort...", "...but the fate of the submerged ninety-nine is hidden from their eyes. Our people emigrate without a knowledge of skilled labour; they have to take the lowest occupations and bring up their children in vile surroundings: they are lost in shoals. Had the youth of this country the writer's experience: did they see hundreds of their countrymen sleeping in the parks of Sydney, without the shelter of a roof and without knowing where to turn in the morning for a bit: could they hear the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> accents of Ireland in the low streets of dens where souls and bodies rot, they would try their hands at a dozen means of winning honest bread before turning their faces towards the emigrant ship. Could we but take the twenty-two thousand Irish-born convicts out of the jails of one city--New York--with their clanking fetters and arrow-branded jackets, and march them through the length and breadth of Ireland, and show the youth, that, if some wear bangles, others wear...", "...little waifs reached the sum of 170,107 francs. The payments to the peasants to induce them to educate the foundlings amounted to 85,458 francs for the same year; the savings of the children, put in official savings-boxes, amounted to 394,076 francs, while 15,936 francs were given out as prizes. The moral effects have been encouraging. In 1869, out of the 9,000 _eleves_ from thirteen to twenty-eight years, only thirty-two had appeared before Courts of Justice for trifling offenses; <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> had shown symptoms of insubordination, and nearly the same number had been imprisoned. It should be remembered that this bureau has charge of the whole class of juvenile paupers, or Almshouse children, in Paris, as well as foundlings, whom it treats by placing out in country homes. In 1869, it thus provided for and protected 25,486 children, of whom 16,845 were from one day to twelve years, and 9,001 from twelve to twenty-one years.

The weights were adjusted for successive intervals of 5 deg. F., but for degrees intermediate between these no additional correction was applied.

In such circumstances one must see without regarding these insults of meanness, and, by a contrivance of distraction, escape from vile affronts. The object of my expedition being explained, the Governor found on his register that poor Hathelin, aged <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> to thirty-four years, was an engraver by profession. The lieutenant-general of police had arrested him long ago for a comic or satirical engraving on the subject of M. le Marquis de Montespan and the King.

It was thus shown that the insects could distinguish green, red, yellow, and blue. These experiments also brought out the further fact that both bees and wasps exhibit a marked preference for some colours over others. Thus, in a series of black, white, yellow, orange, green, blue, and red slips, two or three bees paid twenty-one visits to the orange and yellow, and only four to all the other slips. The slips were then moved, after which, out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> visits, twenty-two were to the orange and yellow. Another colour to which a similar preference is shown is blue. As regards scent, Sir John found that on putting a few drops of eau de Cologne at the entrance of a beehive, 'immediately a number (about 15) came out to see what was the matter.' Other scents had a similar effect; but on repetition several times the bees became accustomed to the scent, and no longer came out.

Thus in a city of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> thousand inhabitants, the largest city in the country, the government of the United States, the body which had just completed a treaty browbeating England and France, was ignominiously turned out-of-doors by a handful of drunken mutineers.

These are intended to be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pounders, which is now the common calibre of the navy of the United States. The vessels are built of live oak, from North Carolina; the timbers are salted in order to prevent the dry-rot. The three ships of the line, Franklin, Washington, and Ohio, were in ordinary; they are called seventy-fours, but the two first are each calculated for eighty-six and the latter for one hundred and six guns. I saw likewise the renowned steam-frigate Fulton the First, of which many fables...", "...in April, 1883, a Bill to establish elective County Councils, which was introduced by the Irish Party, was thrown out in the House of Commons by 231 votes to 58. In his famous speech at Newport in 1885, when the Tories were, as all the world thought, coquetting with Home Rule, Lord Salisbury declared that of the two, popular local government would be even more dangerous than Home Rule. He based his view partly on the difficulty of finding thirty or forty suitable persons in each of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> counties to sit on local bodies, which would be greater than that of finding three or four suitable M.P.s for the same divisions of the country; but, even more than this, he insisted on the fact that a local body has more opportunity for inflicting injustice on minorities than has an authority deriving its sanction and extending its jurisdiction over a wider area, where, as he declared, \"the wisdom of the several parts of the country will correct the folly or mistakes of...", "...large nails, and put on very dark clothes. Thus accoutred he went prowling about the Lion gate of the palace. Before the zenana [28] could be got at, four doors, including the Lion gate, had to be passed; and each of these doors had a guard of sixteen stalwart men. The same men, however, did not remain all night at their post. As the king had an infinite number of soldiers at his command, the guards at the doors were relieved every hour; so that once every hour at each door there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> men present, consisting of the relieving party and of the relieved. The young thief chose that particular moment of time for entering each of the four doors. At the time of relief when he saw the Lion gate crowded with thirty-two men, he joined the crowd without being taken notice of; he then spent the hour preceding the next relief in the large open space and garden between two doors; and he could not be taken notice of, as the night as well as his clothes was pitch dark....", "...others had the same idea and that, Joe knew now, was one of the reasons why the Oregon Trail was several miles wide in some places. However, though sometimes grass was hard to find, it could always be found and that was a minor problem. A major one was that they were far behind the schedule Joe had hoped to keep. It was just short of 700 miles between Independence and Laramie, and Joe had counted on making the trip in thirty-five days at the very most. However, they were already out <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> days and certainly they had a long way to go. Joe didn't know just how far, for his calculations had been completely upset. Even for the first two weeks out of Laramie, Joe had not been able to cover his hoped-for thirty miles a day. They'd been delayed by the necessity of finding grass for the stock. Then had come near disaster. Joe had awakened one morning and turned over for another few minutes' sleep, for by the look of things it couldn't possibly be time to get up....", "...down again, and hubble-bubbled for a space at the _hookah_ which was an integral part of all his impersonations. \"Yea! those were times,\" he mumbled half to himself. \"Even Pidar Narayan--may Heaven protect him--could not say 'please God' to every mouthful, as he does now--as we all do now, and rightly, seeing that we have grown old.\" Once more the piety smacked of pity, and the old man, finding a listener, went on with a certain gusto. \"Look you! he had to walk like the tongue among <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> teeth in those days, with Bun-avatar-_sahib_, my master, like two peas in one pod with the Nawah. Except for women. Pidar Narayan took his way there--mostly!\" The interrupting gurgle of the _hookah_ gave time for an elaborate wink of a wicked old eye. Possibly this was due to the smoke, for the old voice went on as before almost dolorously. \"He had the money-bags, you see, and looked after the rents. But my master, Bun-avatar--lo! thou shouldst have seen him when he...", "...the likeness. What else he transmitted to his son, in addition to physique, by way of temperament and inbred capacity and inclination, was to suffer more than a sea-change; but he is recalled as a stern man on deck, of few words, showing doubtless the early aging of those days under the influence of active responsibility, danger, and the habit of command, and, like all these shipmasters--for they were men of some education--he took books to sea with him. He died at Surinam in 1808, when <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years old. He had married Elizabeth Clarke Manning, herself a descendant in the fifth generation of Richard Manning, of St. Petrox Parish, Dartmouth, whose widow emigrated to New England with her children in 1679.

The pope and the people of Rome made him emperor; and thus Rome began to have an emperor of the west. And whereas the popes used to be established by the emperors, the latter now began to have need of the popes at their elections; the empire continued to lose its powers, while the church acquired them; and, by these means, she constantly extended her authority over temporal princes. The Lombards, having now been two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years in the country, were strangers only in name, and Charles, wishing to reorganize the states of Italy, consented that they should occupy the places in which they had been brought up, and call the province after their own name, Lombardy. That they might be led to respect the Roman name, he ordered all that part of Italy adjoining to them, which had been under the exarchate of Ravenna, to be called Romagna. Besides this, he created his son Pepin, king of Italy, whose...", "...an editorial for the _Philadelphia North American_, says: \"And when, after Pollyanna has gone away, you get her letter saying she is going to take 'eight steps' to-morrow--well, I don't know just what you may do, but I know of one person who buried his face in his hands and shook with the gladdest sort of sadness and got down on his knees and thanked the Giver of all gladness for Pollyanna.\" POLLYANNA: The GLAD Book.

There was no other craft outboard, even the captain's gig having been stowed preparatory to going to sea.

As soon as the anchors were tripped the bows of the great ship swung seaward. She began to forge ahead. The _Kennebunk_ was a huge craft, indeed, being of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> thousand tons' displacement. She carried twelve 12 and 14-inch guns in her turrets on the center line, while her torpedo battery of 5 and 6-inch guns numbered twenty. The \"all-big-gun\" feature of our big battleships began with the construction of the dreadnaught _Delaware_, in 1906. The _Kennebunk_ was heavily armored on the waterline and barbettes. She likewise had 5 to 8-inch armor along in wake of the berth-deck and armored broadside gun positions. She had two steel...", "...Nelson was appointed commander in chief of a powerful squadron, employed between Orfordness and Beachy-Head: together with the entire flotilla of gun-brigs, fire-ships, bomb-ketches, and vessels of every other description; and all the sea-fencibles embodied within the same district, with all the boats, vessels, and other floating defences, on board of which they might be required to act.

He was the son of Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, and was born in London, December 21, 1688. At sixteen he was admitted a student at Oxford, but did not finish his studies, as the military profession had more charms for him than literary pursuits. He was first commissioned as an ensign. After the death of Queen Anne, he entered into the service of Prince Eugene. When he attained the age of twenty-four years, he entered Parliament, for Haslemere, where he continued <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years. In November, 1732, Oglethorpe, with one hundred and sixteen settlers, embarked for Georgia, and landed at Charleston, S. C., January 13, 1733. They shortly afterwards proceeded to Georgia, where Oglethorpe laid out a town, and called it Savannah. He very happily secured the good will of the Indians. In 1743, he left Georgia for England, to answer charges brought against him by Lieutenant-colonel Cook. A court martial declared the charges groundless and malicious, and...", "...tell whether they are on water or land.

I must repeat, that neither the nature of the soil, nor height of the land, nor the climate, nor the general character of the associated beings, and therefore their action one on another, can differ much in the different islands. If there be any sensible difference in their climates, it must be between the Windward group (namely, Charles and Chatham Islands), and that to leeward; but there seems to be no corresponding difference in the productions of these two...", "...Osbeck, who was here in 1750-51, as chaplain of the Prince Charles, a Swedish East Indiaman, relates, that there were at that season, eighteen European ships in port: one Danish, two Swedish, two French, four Dutch, and nine English.

He was a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> or three, full of the red-blooded life that made Henri like him at once. If this had not been the case, the first few days in the cabin might have been unpleasant, for Henri was in bad humor. He told Weyman about it their first night, as they were smoking pipes alongside the redly glowing box stove. \"It is damn strange,\" said Henri. \"I have lost seven lynx in the traps, torn to pieces like they were no more than rabbits that the foxes had killed.

The lamps went out, and the rescue-men retired. To work in such conditions was to risk being blown up at every moment. But the raps of the entombed miners were still heard, the men were still alive and appealed for help, and several miners volunteered to work at any risk; and as they went down the mine, their wives had only silent tears to...", "...his body; yet he afterwards took up a large stone, and died in the action of throwing it against his enemy. This man fell close to our boats, so that the Indians who remained unhurt did not dare to attempt the carrying off his body, which gave us an opportunity to examine it; but they carried off the rest of their dead, and made the best of their way back to their companions at the inlet. Our boats then returned, and brought off the two canoes, which they had pursued. One of them was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> feet long, and the other somewhat less, but they were both of a very curious construction, and must have cost those who made them infinite labour. They consisted of planks exceedingly well wrought, and in many places adorned with carving; these planks were sewed together, and over every seam there was a stripe of tortoise-shell, very artificially fastened, to keep out the weather: Their bottoms were as sharp as a wedge, and they were very narrow; and therefore two of them...", "...them.

Seven years later, 19th December 1853, he received the red hat from Pius IX. Meanwhile, and throughout his long episcopate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years, he foreshadowed the zeal and the enlightened policy later to be displayed in the prolonged period of his pontificate, building and restoring many churches, striving to elevate the intellectual as well as the spiritual tone of his clergy, and showing in his pastoral letters an unusual regard for learning and for social reform. His position in Italy was similar to that of Bishop Dupanloup in France; and, as but a moderate supporter of the policy enunciated in the...", "...and if you have any wind left, it's better to die with a round cheek than a hollow one.

The Danish fleet effectually prevented the junction of Thijssen with the Swedes, and for a time he found himself blockaded in a narrow passage called the Listerdiep.

To conform with the provisions of the law, it became necessary to confine the expenditure of this sum to the most indispensable parts of the system, and adopt a less expensive and less permanent repair; abandoning the plan of finishing the mountain division with limestone throughout, and to a width of twenty feet; confining the metal on the more expensive parts of these divisions to a width of from twelve to fifteen...", "...\"I see that this case not only contains the syringe, but also some small phials filled with tablets.

During the Middle Ages there had been developed various theological doctrines regarding the human body; these were based upon arguments showing what the body OUGHT TO BE, and naturally, when anatomical science showed what it IS, these doctrines fell.

So, too, in Vesalius's time another doctrine of this sort was dominant: it had long been held that Eve, having been made by the Almighty from a rib taken out of Adam's side, there must be one rib fewer on one side of every man than on the other. This creation of Eve was a favourite subject with sculptors and painters, from Giotto, who carved it upon his beautiful Campanile at Florence, to the illuminators of missals, and even to...", "...the next day I was calm as usual among my comrades. I thought of my personal position; the events of the two last days made the review extremely simple. I had lost everything.

Four of these were private homes, and the fifth was the \"Third State House.\" They were all set up as a result of the Act of 1662 calling for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> brick (row) dwellings, arranged in a square or other form which the Governor should decide. Each dwelling was to be twenty feet by forty on the inside, eighteen feet from floor to eaves, fifteen feet from eaves to ridge measured vertically, and to have a slate or tile roof.

He next read at the academy at Bourdeaux, a \"Life of the Duke of Berwick,\" and an \"Essay on the Policy of the Romans in Religion,\" which was the basis of the immortal work which he afterwards composed on the rise and fall of that extraordinary people. These desultory essays gave no indication of the first considerable work which he published, which was the famous _Lettres Persanes_. They appeared in 1721, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years of age. Their success was immediate and prodigious; a certain indication in matters of thought, that they were not destined to durable fame. They fell in with the ideas and passions of the time; they were not before it; thence their early popularity and ultimate oblivion.

The new Golden Age he imparted to the Edinburgh Review, and his first and most important, if not best, Parliamentary speeches in the grand crisis of the first Reform Bill, achieved for him, years before he had reached the middle point of life, what may justly be termed an immense distinction. For a century and more, perhaps no man in this country, with the exceptions of Mr. Pitt and of Lord Byron, had attained at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> the fame of Macaulay.

The excavations in the Parvis-Notre-Dame in 1847 discovered a section of the Roman wall twenty-six metres in length, as well as the substructure of the porch and the front portion of the nave of the original basilica, constructed by Childebert and dedicated to the Virgin. These latter foundations, some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> metres in front of the present cathedral, demonstrate by their position, and by the probable width of the primitive edifice in proportion to its length, that they were constructed to the west and inside of the enclosing wall of the city, a portion of which had been found under the choir of the cathedral.

The story is told in 1 Kings xx., according to which Ben-Hadad entered into an alliance with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> other kings, who, with their armies, horses, and chariots, besieged Samaria. Too full of confidence, he sent to Ahab of Israel, who was in the besieged city, demanding his surrender, the second time with terms more than usually humiliating.

He had wisely refused the Pope's offer of the crown of Sicily; but at this time, the death of Friedrich II., and of his son Conrad, leaving vacant the imperial crown, he was so far allured by it, that he set off to offer himself as a candidate, carrying with him <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> wagons, each drawn by eight horses, and laden with a hogshead of gold.

Then she glanced at Austen and bit her lip-and laughed. Her laughter was contagious. \"I suppose I shall have to confess that you have inspired my curiosity, Mr. Vane,\" she said. Austen's face was sunburned, but it flushed a more vivid red under the tan.

He presented an awkward figure. At that time he was tall and slender, with long limbs, narrow shoulders, and red hair tied in a queue behind.

Their works are original compositions, founded on experience, and not on Grecian models, like so many other Latin productions.

So let fate decide who is destined to become my husband. I ask you to build a hall, a high hall with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> circles, and above those circles a window. I will sit at that window and do you order all kinds of people, tsars, kings, tsarovitchi, korolevitchi, brave warriors, and handsome fellows, to come.

Seventy persons were condemned to death on these so awful yet so ridiculous confessions. Twenty-three of them were burned together, in one fire, in the village of Mohra, in the presence of thousands of delighted spectators. On the following day fifteen children were murdered in the same manner; offered up in sacrifice to the bloody Moloch of superstition. The remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> were executed at the neighbouring town of Fahluna. Besides these, fifty-six children were found guilty of witchcraft in a minor degree, and sentenced to various punishments, such as running the gauntlet, imprisonment, and public whipping once a week for a twelvemonth.

On the 3rd he captured forty-nine, while Wing, co-operating with him, took twenty more. Among these was General Erasmus, who had helped, or failed to help, General Lucas Meyer at Talana Hill. On the 10th Colonel Wing's column, which was part of Hamilton's force, struck out again and took forty-two prisoners, including the two Wolmarans. Only two days later Hamilton returned to the same spot, and was rewarded with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> more captures. On the 18th he took twenty-seven, on the 24th twelve, and on the 26th no fewer than ninety. So severe were these blows, and so difficult was it for the Boers to know how to get away from an antagonist who was ready to ride thirty miles in a night in order to fall upon their laager, that the enemy became much scattered and too demoralised for offensive operations. Finding that they had grown too shy in this much shot over district, Hamilton moved farther south,...", "...the reality of that which we deny. The belief of the identity of self, then, as the one permanent subject of the transient feelings remembered by us, arises from a _law of thought_, which is essential to the very constitution of the mind. It has accordingly all the qualities, which I can imagine to be required by the most rigid scrutinizer of our principles of intuitive assent. It is universal, and immediate, and irresistible. I do not believe, with more confidence, that the half of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> is equal to the square of four, than I believe, that I, who computed the square of four, am the same with that mind, which computes the half of thirty-two, and asserts the equality of the two numbers.

They sold farms to 6,057 tenants, and the government loaned the purchasers a total of L1,674,841 which was issued by the commissioners of public works. \"In 1870, the following year, what is known as the Landlord and Tenant Act was passed by Parliament, under which the commissioners were authorized to advance two-thirds of the purchase money agreed upon instead of one-fourth, to be repaid in thirty-five years with 5 per cent interest, and...", "...with children in the happy days of _Tata Giovanni_. It was only fitting that his last exhortation should be all in their interest and for their happiness. All, in expressing his gratitude for the prayers that were offered in his behalf, he asked was that they should be continued, hoping always \"that He who had commenced a good work would not fail to bring it to a successful termination.\" But it is not given to man to complete or perfect anything in this life; and that pontificate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years, which was still more astonishing by its acts and labors than by its long duration, was destined to leave its good work incomplete.

In the place called Tetramphodos, or Four-ways-end, stood a marble statue of Venus, on a marble altar, which was in great reputation for giving oracles to young women about the choice of husbands. As the two bishops, with the procession of the Christians, and the cross borne before them, passed through that square, this idol fell down of itself, and was broken to pieces; whereupon <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> men and seven women were converted. Ten days after, arrived Cynegius, having with him a duke, or general, with a strong guard of soldiers, and the civil magistrates of the country. He assembled the citizens, and read to them the emperor's edict, commanding their idols and temples to be destroyed. This was accordingly done, and no less than eight public temples in the city were burnt; viz., those of the Sun, Venus, Apollo, Proserpine, Hecate, the Hierion, the temple of...", "...many of the better sort came down to us with much respect, and sent for cocoas and other fruits, which they distributed to the boat's crew.

According to Professor Hitchcock, the footprints of no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> species of bipeds, and twelve of quadrupeds, have been already detected in these rocks. Thirty of these are believed to be those of birds, four of lizards, two of chelonians, and six of batrachians.

There we learn that, until long past the middle of the eighteenth century, little or nothing was known of the potato in Scotland, although in after years it brought about the most prodigious effects on the population. The Celts of Ireland first began to use it as an adjunct, and then as a main article of food.

The citizens of Coventry took an active part in the Civil War in favour of the Parliamentary army, and when Charles II came to the throne he ordered these defences to be demolished.

It showed, for the first time for several centuries, that the Germans were really a great people, and were a match for the French, hitherto deemed invincible. Early in the spring of 1758, Frederic was ready for a new campaign, which was soon signalized by a great victory over the Russians, at Zorndorff. It was as brilliant and decisive as the battles of Rossbach and Leuthen. A force of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> thousand men defeated an army of fifty-two thousand. Twenty-two thousand Russians lay dead on the field. This victory placed Frederic at the zenith of military fame. In less than a year, he had defeated three great armies; in less than a year, and when nearly driven to despair,--when his cause seemed hopeless, and his enemies were rejoicing in their strength,--he successively triumphed over the French, the Austrians, and the Russians; the three most powerful nations on the...", "...by the process of partial melting and regelation, holding the ice-globules together, just as the loose materials of the pudding-stone are held together by the cement which unites them. Within this mass, air is intercepted and held inclosed between the particles of ice.

It is the result of a partial thawing, under a temperature maintained very nearly at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> degrees, falling sometimes a little below, and then rising a little above the freezing-point, and thus producing constant alternations of freezing and thawing in the same mass of snow. This process amounts to a kind of kneading of the snow, and when combined with the cohesion among the particles more closely held together in one snow-flake, it produces granular ice. Of course, the change takes place gradually, and is unequal in its progress at different depths in the same...", "...the wealthiest in Christendom.

The Office of the Blessed Virgin she repeated daily at the appointed hours, and almost always on her knees; the Rosary also, and a great number of psalms besides, as well as various devotions for the holy souls in purgatory. As to mental prayer, her whole life was one continued orison; ever in communion with God, she never lost the sense of His presence. From this time forward (she was now <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years old), her life grew more and more supernatural. The mystical wonders that have manifested themselves in so many saints were displayed in her to an eminent degree.

This is where it differs most perhaps from the crooked landings and unexpected levels of the old English inns, even when they call themselves hotels.

There are <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> points in the compass of the prairies, as well as in that which guides the ocean wanderer; and, therefore, in any expedition going in search of a war-party of Comanches, there would be thirty-two chances to one against its taking the right track.

In consequence of this order, an hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> inhabitants of Nantes, arrested on the usual pretexts of foederalism, or as suspected, or being Muscadins, were, some months after, conducted to Paris. Forty of the number died through the hardships and ill treatment they encountered on the way, the rest remained in prison until after the death of Robespierre. The evidence produced on their trial, which lately took place, has revealed but too circumstantially all the horrors of the revolutionary system.

The general is a large man; weighs two hundred and twenty pounds, and is not tall. We had no siege guns except six <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> pounders, and there were none at the West to draw from. Admiral Porter, however, supplied us with a battery of navy-guns of large calibre, and with these, and the field artillery used in the campaign, the siege began.

Recent drafts had apparently told heavily upon the Venetian sources of enlistment, and it is stated that many of the complements were made up of rustics swept in haste from the Euganean hills.

My brother John had always been treated with great friendliness by Lord Holland, and in her will Lady Holland, who had not seen him for years, left him as a memento a copy, in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> volumes, of the English essayists, which had belonged to her husband. Almost immediately after this transient renewal of my intercourse with Mrs. Norton, I left England for Italy, and did not see her again for several years.

The entrenchments around each of these batteries were from twelve to fourteen feet wide at the top, and about ten feet deep. Some of the batteries were designed for six guns and some for sixteen. They were nearly all completed at this time, and the work upon them had been done exclusively by negro slaves. In most cases they were mounted with their full complement of guns, varying in caliber, from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> to sixty-four pounds. The land around Richmond consists of hills and valleys, and the batteries were planted on the most elevated and commanding points. The heaviest of these commanded the turnpikes and railroads which formed the approaches from Manassas and Fredericksburg.

The country is much covered with woods, and is sandy, with very little water. I did not consider that the troops were marched judiciously; they were halted too long at a time, and not often enough. The baggage was carried on country carts pressed into the service. We bivouacked in the woods near a very pretty house, belonging to a planter called Colonel Robinson. These immense woods make admirable bivouacs.

They reached Kingston, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> miles north, where a stop had to be made, but by claiming their train was a powder train hastening to Beauregard's army, they were allowed to pass on; so the flight continued until Dalton and the tunnel north of it were passed. The conductor, Fuller, started from Big Shanty with a small party on foot, then procured a hand-car and at Dalton a locomotive. His pursuit was both energetic and intelligent. At Dalton he succeeded in getting a telegram through to Chattanooga...", "...hurting myself,\" replied Ned with a smile. A second plate and a cup of water were brought to him.

This man was young, not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> or three, rather tall, fairer than most of his race, and with a singularly open and attractive face. His dress was that of a colonel, and the boy knew at once that he was commander of the troop. He smiled down at Ned, and Ned, despite himself, smiled back. \"I know you,\" said he, speaking perfect English. \"You are Edward Fulton, the lad who was held in the prison with Stephen Austin, the Texan, the lad who starved himself that he might slip between the bars of his window....", "...4,717,422; added together, the product is 27, or 2 and 7 are 9, and so always. 4335. _Technical terms relative to Books, Engravings, etc:_ 4336.

The first stage of the peace movement is the general recognition of the principle of arbitration between states. That first period has, we may take it, been already realised. The second stage is the recognition of compulsory arbitration. When, in 1907, the second Hague Conference was held, this principle was supported by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> different states, representing more than a thousand million human beings. Something like three or four hundred millions remained not yet prepared to admit the principle in its entirety. I may remark in passing that the verbal acceptance of a general principle is one thing, the application, as we have lately had much reason to discover, is quite another. We may recognise, however, that this second stage of the pacifist programme has, undoubtedly, made large advances.

He visited Holland and England in 1707, preached before Queen Anne, and, it is said, was invited to become one of her chaplains. He was the author of many works, chiefly on church history. In search of materials he visited Helmstadt in 1712, and Leipzig in 1715 and 1725. He died at Berlin on the 7th of August 1728.

Beyond this all the skill of the pump-maker could not get it to rise.

Galileo, however, did not solve the problem. It was taken up by his pupil Torricelli, to whom, after due pondering, the thought occurred, that the water might be forced into the tube by a pressure applied to the surface of the liquid outside. But where, under the actual circumstances, was such a pressure to be found? After much reflection, it flashed upon Torricelli that the atmosphere might possibly exert this pressure; that the impalpable air might possess...", "...dreaded to know, namely, that the nobles had connived at this insurrection of the peasantry to frighten him with the consequences of his own acts.

As there were only twenty-five copies of this first American edition, it is extremely rare and will undoubtedly be sought after by collectors. But for one who is interested to trace the growth of Brooke's power, the steadying of his poetic orbit and the mounting flame of his...", "...and at noon our expectations were realized: we also saw her in a more favourable point for pursuit, she being a little under our lee. Finding that she could not escape us, she put a good face on the matter, and continued to stand towards us. Between one and two o'clock we sent a boat's-crew on board to examine her. She proved to be the Emprendadora, a Spanish brigantine from the Havannah, well armed, mounting one long eighteen-pounder on a swivel, and four 12 lb. carronades, and having <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> persons on board. Her outfit and general appearance were extremely suspicious, for she had not only a slave-deck, with irons, &c., but also two slaves, secreted in the forehold, from whom we learnt that they had been stolen from Po-Po, near Wydah. She had also a quantity of merchandise on board, without having any Custom-house certificate of clearance from the Havannah, or indeed any other account of it, which circumstances led us to believe that it had been plundered from...", "...secretion of saliva and gastric juice, thus promoting and accelerating digestion. The only exception to this is in the case of a dilated stomach, when it is wholly contra-indicated. With regard to mastication, Sir Andrew Clark's rule is a very good one, and is more easily followed than the ideal theory laid down by Horace Fletcher, according to whom any food is digestible if properly treated while still in the mouth. Clark's rule is that as the mouth normally contains thirty-two teeth, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> bites should be given before the food is swallowed. This, of course, is a practical doctor's concession to human weakness. Mr Fletcher would train every one to \"chew\" till the contents of the mouth were swallowed by reflex action without deliberate act; and he applies this theory of mastication and salivation also to drinks (except water).

Towards midnight he was half frozen, as fidgety as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> devils caught in a stole, and was about to give up his happiness, when a feeble light passed by the cracks of the window and came down towards the little door. \"Ah, it is she!\" said he. And this hope warned him once more. Then he got close to the door, and heard a little voice-- \"Are you there?\" said the dyer's wife to him. \"Yes.\" \"Cough, that I may see.\" The hunchback began to cough. \"It is not you.\" Then the hunchback said aloud-- \"How do you mean,...", "...without.

For this purpose he had constructed <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> great barges, each sixty-two feet in length, and twelve in breadth. These were moored in pairs with massive chains and anchors, the distance between each pair being twenty-two feet. All were bound together with chains and timbers and a roadway protected by a parapet of massive beams was formed across it. Each boat was turned into a fortress by the erection of solid wooden redoubts at each end, mounting heavy guns, and was manned by thirty-two soldiers and four sailors.

The empire of India is an expensive plaything, which the people of Great Britain support for the amusement of the Queen and the pride of the nation. The seventy thousand soldiers distributed over that widespread territory are hardly able to keep the natives in subjection.

It was brought to a close in December, 1804, soon after the appointment of Lord Melville, in succession to Earl St. Vincent, as First Lord of the Admiralty. By him Lord Cochrane was transferred from the _Arab_ to the _Pallas_, a new and smart frigate of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> guns, and allowed to use her in a famous cruise of prize-taking among the Azores and off the coast of Portugal. This was followed in 1806 by farther work in the same frigate, the closing portion of which was especially memorable.

An old man showed us the spot where Captain Cook was killed, on the 14th of February, 1779, with the cocoa-nut trees pierced by the balls from the boats which the unfortunate navigator commanded. This old man, whether it were feigned or real sensibility, seemed extremely affected and even shed tears, in showing us these objects. As for me, I could not help finding it a little singular to be thus, by mere chance, upon this spot, on the 14th of February, 1811; that is to say, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years after, on the anniversary of the catastrophe which has rendered it for ever celebrated. I drew no sinister augury from the coincidence, however, and returned to the ship with my companions as gay as I left it.

As Shamash was ultimately developed as the god of justice and righteousness, it would appear that his ascendancy occurred during the period when well-governed communities systematized their religious beliefs to reflect social conditions. The first great monarch of the Isin dynasty was Ishbi-Urra, who reigned for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years. Like his successors, he called himself \"King of Sumer and Akkad\", and it appears that his sway extended to the city of Sippar, where solar worship prevailed. Traces of him have also been found at Eridu, Ur, Erech, and Nippur, so that he must have given recognition to Ea, Sin, Anu, and Enlil. In this period the early national pantheon may have taken shape, Bel Enlil being the chief deity. Enlil was afterwards displaced by Merodach of Babylon.

He drafted a paper, in which he offered an interpretation of the will of Smithson, mapped out a plan which would meet the demands of science, and submitted it to the suffrage of the republic of scientific scholars.

With faith and sturdy perseverance, he adhered to the plan and steadily resisted all attempts to overthrow it.

Moore's hymns, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> in number, first appeared in his volume of \"Sacred Songs,\" published in 1816. Most of these hymns were written to popular airs of various nations. They have attained greater popularity in America than in Great Britain.

It turns on rollers that run on a circular track; the revolving mechanism is driven by electricity. If a scene is set on the quarter circle presented to the audience--perhaps a closed room of considerable depth--something similar can be arranged on the opposite side of the platform which opens to the rear of the stage, as well as on the other quarters, so that four different scenes are set on the stage at the same time.

The defeats suffered in the ten years previous to the peace of Amiens in 1803, stripped France of no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> ships of the line captured, and eleven destroyed; and her allies, Holland, Spain, and Denmark, of twenty-six of the line, with five hundred and nineteen smaller ships of war taken or destroyed, besides eight hundred and seven French privateers also taken or destroyed. The French had become builders for the English. Of their ships of the line fifty were added to the English navy. On the recommencement of the war in 1804, the British fleet numbered nearly double that of the...", "...soil, and now thou art far from the land of thy birth.\" He had accomplished the object which he had set before himself in the days of his young ambition, when he came a stranger and alone to subdue a kingdom: he had brought the Arabs and Berbers into subjection, and restored order and peace in the land; but he had done it all at the expense of his subjects' hearts. The handsome youth who had come like \"the young chevalier\" to win the homage and devotion of the Spanish Arabs, after <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years went down to his grave a detested tyrant, upheld in his blood-stained throne only by the swords of mercenaries whose loyalty was purchased by gold. He had inaugurated the sway of the sword in Spain, and his successors would have to maintain the principle. As the great historian of the Moors has observed, it is not easy to see by what other means the turbulent factions of Arabs and Berbers were to be kept in order, or how anarchy was to be averted without severe...", "...our men were sent at this, and three times, despite a fine display of courage, they were flung back with loss. The bravest soldier cannot--without wings--surmount a bank which rises eighteen feet sheer from the bottom of a broad ditch. This was seen next day. The attack ceased at nightfall. During the dark hours the redoubt's defenders yelled defiance, but next morning they surrendered, and, marching out, a hundred and eighty-three laid down their arms. Our loss was one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> killed and wounded; the Maori loss was fifty killed, wounded unknown. By January, General Cameron had passed beyond Ngaruawahia, the village which had been the Maori King's head-quarters, and which stood at the fine river-junction where the brown, sluggish Waipa loses its name and waters in the light-green volume of the swifter Waikato. Twice the English beat the enemy in the triangle between the rivers. A third encounter was signalised by the most heroic incident in the...", "...at it. And so would his family.\" Barrington rather liked the sword; but he said classy swords were frightfully expensive, and he doubted whether we should run to it. Then the committee broke up, to meet again when we found how the subscriptions came in. Unfortunately, this department of the testimonial was very slow. Mitchell, with great trouble, wrote out a list of the whole school, and was allowed to put it on the notice-board. Class by class he wrote it--one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> boys he wrote--with money columns and a line leading from each boy to the money column. On it, in large ornamental letters, Nicholson, who was a dab at printing, put the words-- TESTIMONIAL FUND TO LIEUTENANT HUTCHINGS, FROM MERIVALE SCHOOL. Then we all waited breathlessly for the result in the money column. There was some delay, because everybody, of course, wrote home on the subject and mentioned it in the next Sunday's letters; and we pointed out to the kids that a...", "...them and weep on them. There's millions of people down there on earth that are promising themselves the same thing. As many as sixty thousand people arrive here every single day, that want to run straight to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and hug them and weep on them.

If they were a mind to allow it, they wouldn't ever have anything to do, year in and year out, but stand up and be hugged and wept on <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> hours in the twenty-four.

This time he did better than ever, and Billy paced off the distance. \"About <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> feet,\" he announced. \"That'll do for to-day.\" \"Huh?\" said Pete. \"That's enough for this time.

GENERAL OR UNIVERSAL INDEX. \"When Baillet, the learned author of the _Jugemens des Savans_, was appointed by M. de Lamoignon keeper of the exquisite library collected by that nobleman, he set to work to compile an index of the contents of all the books contained in it, and this he is said to have completed in August, 1682. After this date, however, the Index continued to grow, and it extended to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> folio volumes, all written by Baillet's own hand.\" [Illustration: A]s knowledge increases and books and magazines gather in number, the need for many indexes becomes daily more evident. We often are certain that something has been written on a subject in which we are interested, but in vain we seek for a clue to it. We want a key to all this ever-increasing literature. As long ago as 1842 the late Thomas Watts, of the British Museum, one of the most learned and...", "...TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE Among the historic phenomena of what may be called \"modern antiquity,\" there is none comparable to that which was witnessed on the first day of the year 1000, together with its second or adjourned catastrophe thirty-two years later.

We reached Bangalore upon the 12th of April; and, as I continued still very poorly, the doctor told the commanding officer, that it was in vain to keep me in India, in the hopes of regaining my health; for that was a thing not in the least to be expected, so I was ordered to be invalided. I accordingly passed the Board upon the 20th of August, along with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> more; but only eighteen of these were ordered for Europe. I now, according to promise, resume my story of the little girl that went to Serjeant Brown at Trichinopoly, when we took home the orphan, to whom my wife had been godmother.

The principal exercises in leaping are:--1. The high leap without a run. 2. The high leap with a run. 3. The long leap without a run. 4. And the long leap with a run. In the first of these the legs and feet are closed, the knees are bent till the calves nearly touch the thighs, and the arms are thrown in the direction of the leap, which increases the impulse. This leap may be practised at the following progressive heights,--eighteen inches, twenty-four inches, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> inches, forty-eight inches, which last is perhaps what few lads would attain. _The high leap with a run._--The run should never exceed twelve paces, the distance between the point of springing and the obstacle to leap over to be about three-fifths the height of the obstacle from the ground; and in making it the leaper should go fairly and straightly over without veering to the side, and descend on the ball of the foot just beyond the toes. The heights that may be cleared...", "...acts are represented as especially meritorious. Read the nineteenth chapter of Genesis and the nineteenth chapter of Judges; dwell upon the eighth verse of the former and the twenty-fourth verse of the latter; and then, if you can indorse the spirit of these narratives, you are unfit to be the parent of a daughter. The Mosaic law authorizes a father to sell his daughter for a concubine or mistress (euphemistically translated \"maid servant\"). God's instructions respecting the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> thousand captive Midianite maidens impliedly sanction concubinage and prostitution. These Bible teachings have been the cause of countless outrages against the chastity of woman.

Verily, violent death has here his peculiar realm. It is difficult to believe what the historian Filippini tells us, that, in thirty years of his own time, 28,000 Corsicans had been murdered out of revenge. According to the calculation of another Corsican historian, I find that in the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> years previous to 1715, 28,715 murders had been committed in Corsica. The same historian calculates that, according to this proportion, the number of the victims of the Vendetta, from 1359 to 1729, was 333,000. An equal number, he is of opinion, must be allowed for the wounded. We have, therefore, within the time specified, 666,000 Corsicans struck by the hand of the assassin.

Eight of these columns, over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> feet in height, are monoliths of _giallo antico_--a yellow kind of marble beautifully veined, and belonging to the most valuable materials used by ancient architects. Six other columns are made of a kind of marble known as _pavonazzetto_; by an ingenious mode of coloring these columns are made to harmonize with those consisting of the rarer material. Above the first lies a second lower story, the architectural arrangements of which may be recognized from Adler's ingenious...", "...but which now became dimly terrible. The circumstance to which I allude is the early age at which all the Comtes of my line had met their end.

Upon my twenty-first birthday, the aged Pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son, and continued by each possessor.

He went to see one farmer in my county and found that he had absolutely nothing growing, and that his livestock consisted of three hunters and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> couples of hounds. The agricultural expert was scandalized. He told the farmer he ought to begin at once to raise hogs.

That box contained his accumulated savings. With a large portion of the money he had thought to buy new clothing for himself.

After some delay, both regiments sailed on May 1st under the convoy of the Flora, of thirty-two guns, and a fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> ships, the Royal Highlanders being commanded by Colonel Thomas Stirling of Ardoch. Four days after they had sailed, the transports separated in a gale of wind.

When the President is impeached, the Constitution provides that his trial shall take place before the Senate, sitting as a court. The trial occupied <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> days, lasting until May 26th, with Chief Justice Chase presiding, on which day a vote was taken on the eleventh article of impeachment. Thirty-five senators voted for acquittal and nineteen for conviction. One more vote--making the necessary two-thirds--would have convicted.

In this genus (of which two species were observed) the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> radial spines are disposed in such a regular manner that they lie in four meridian planes, and that their distal ends fall into five parallel zones.

The report was adopted by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-two</span> to twenty-one.
