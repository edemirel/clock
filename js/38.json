The structure of the book plainly shows that it has been displaced in the interests of P, and from the express reference to the \"ten times\" that Israel tempted Jehovah, xiv. 22, we may safely infer that much has been lost. But what has been preserved is of great religious, and some historical value. Of course, it is not history in the ordinary sense: a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years is covered in less than ten chapters (x. II-xix.). But much of the material, at least in the prophetic history JE, rests on a tradition which may well have preserved some of the historical facts, especially as they were often embalmed in poetry.

It cites a difficult fragment and refers it to the book of the wars of Jehovah, xxi. 14, it confirms the victory over Sihon...", "...farm fifty-one years past come April nineteen,\" Mun said proudly. \"Where did he come from?\" \"He never did say,\" Mun admitted. \"Didn't nobody ask?\" \"'Twas thought best not to ask,\" Mun said. \"Blast it, Harky!

The arrangements of his _Concerti Grossi_, which J. S. Bach made, date from the time when Bach was at Weimar, that is between 1708 and 1714. [415] Locatelli and Vivaldi came under the influence of the Italian Opera. Vivaldi himself wrote <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> operas. One of the _Concerti_ of Locatalli (Op. 7, 1741) was named _Il pianto d'Arianna_. In the _Cimento dell'Armonia_ of Vivaldi four Concertos describe the four seasons, a fifth paints _La Tempesta_, a sixth _Il Piacere_ (Pleasure). In Vivaldi's Op. 10 a Concerto represents _La Notte_ (Night), another _Il Cardellino_ (The Goldfinch). And Arnold Schering notices Vivaldi's influence in Germany on a Granpuer at Darmstadt, and on Jos. Gregorius Werner in Bohemia.

It came from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> springs, all issuing from the same rock, some hot and some cold.

Sir Edward Turner opened the case, alleging that Hulet was on the scaffold, in disguise, on the occasion of the execution, and suggesting that it was he who actually beheaded the King; a fact which he proposed to prove chiefly by Hulet's own admissions. _Gittens_ was the first witness. He stated that he and Hulet were both serjeants in the same regiment at the time of the execution. A day or two before the King came to the scaffold about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> of them were sworn to secrecy by Colonel Hewson, and they were all asked whether they would behead the King for a hundred pounds, and a promise of preferment in the army.

Zavala's rule, 1626-1664.--Hostile Indians troubled the border, and the intrusions of English, French, and Dutch colonies into the Lesser Antilles awakened fears for the safety of the western Gulf shores. In 1625 Nuevo Leon, therefore, was again entrusted to a _conquistador_, when a contract similar to that of Carabajal in 1579 was made with Martin de Zavala. At the same time the Florida missions 'were extended west to the Apalache district. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years Zavala controlled and governed the frontier with exemplary zeal, subduing Indians, granting _encomiendas_, operating mines, founding new towns, and opening highways to Panuco and the interior.

They meant it, too, for there was a lot of bitter feeling against us, and I realised that we were in for a real battle, though there could only be one end, of course.

The Bourbons. France in 1610. The kingdom was now issuing from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of civil war. Its inhabitants had grown unaccustomed to work; its finances were ruined by dishonesty, disorder, and a very heavy foreign debt. The most characteristic symptom of this distress was the brigandage carried on incessantly from 1598 to 1610. Side by side with this temporary disorder there was a more serious administrative disorganization, a habit of no longer obeying the king. The harassed population, the municipalities which under cover of civil war had...", "...\"It's a mighty strange happening. You might tell us the full particulars,\" said Knowles.

This division is certainly not original, but it is convenient for purposes of reference. Canon 1 is prefatory; it contains a brief confession of faith in the Trinity, and especially in the Word, the Son of God; and it speaks of the expulsion of heretics from the Church. Canons 2-5 give regulations for the selection and ordination of bishops, presbyters and deacons.

At the pinnacle of this reputation and this victory, at <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of age, he had voluntarily shut the door against the intoxications and pride of success; he had mutilated his life, buried his genius in penitence, obeying simply the calls of his conscience, and, with singular moderation in the very midst of exaggeration, becoming a father of a family and remaining a courtier, at the same time that he gave up the stage and glory.

This amount is more than equal to the entire revenue of the International Harvester Company, in the five years of its existence. Roughly speaking, the time needed to handle an acre of wheat has been reduced from sixty-one hours to three, by the use of machinery. Hay now requires four hours, instead of twenty-one; oats seven hours, instead of sixty-six; and potatoes <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> hours, instead of one hundred and nine. It is machinery that has so vastly increased the size of the average American farm. In India, where a farmer's whole outfit can be bought for ten dollars, the average farm is half an acre or less. In France and Germany it is five acres. In England it is nine. But in the United States--the home of farm machinery, it is one hundred and fifty acres. Very little has been written about this stupendous prosperity of American farmers....", "...with it some rain and a fair wind.

Of the troops that received their splendid assaults, Steedman's and Brannan's commands lost respectively forty-nine and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> per cent. in less than four hours. The loss of single regiments showed a much heavier percentage.

An army of fifty thousand men, English regulars and colonial militia, was gathered, and it was resolved that a three-headed campaign should be instituted at once, one against Louisburg, another against Ticonderoga and a third against Fort Duquesne. The first blow was struck early in June, 1758, when the English appeared before Louisburg with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> ships of war and an army of fourteen thousand men. There was a vigorous attack, and something of a siege, and late in July the place capitulated, and this fall also included the capture of the islands of Prince Edward and Cape Breton.

In the first system of Ehrenberg (1847, _loc. cit._, pp. 53, 54), four families belonging to the MONOPYLEA were enumerated, the Halicalyptrina, Lithochytrina, Eucyrtidina, and Spyridina. He united the three former under the name \"Polycystina solitaria,\" which he afterwards changed into NASSELLARIA (1875, Abhandl. d. k. Akad. d. Wiss. Berlin, p. 157). In my Monograph of the Radiolaria (1862, pp. 265-345) forty-four genera of NASSELLARIA were enumerated (six Acanthodesmida and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> Cyrtida), whilst the total number of genera in the whole class of Radiolaria at that time amounted to one hundred and thirteen. But owing to the astonishing number of new and interesting forms of this legion which I afterwards detected in the collection of the Challenger, in 1881 I distinguished in my Prodromus not less than three hundred and seventeen genera. These were disposed in five large main groups, retained in the present Report, with twenty-six families, viz., (1)...", "...she became separated by the batteries of Vicksburg from the upper squadron, and is less identified with its history.

At that time he reported to the Secretary that there were three wooden gunboats in commission, nine ironclads and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> mortar-boats building. The mortar-boats were rafts or blocks of solid timber, carrying one XIII-inch mortar.

Balaam had made his escape to Egypt after the death of Zepho, and he was received there with great demonstrations of honor by the king and all the nobles, and Pharaoh appointed him to be royal counsellor, for he had heard much about his exceeding great wisdom. In the Edomite kingdom, Samlah was succeeded by Saul of Pethor, a youth of surpassing beauty, whose reign lasted forty years. His successor upon the throne was Baal Hamon, king for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, during which period the Moabites rose up against the Edomites, to whom they had been paying tribute since the time of Hadad, and they succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the stranger. The times were troubled everywhere. Agnias, the king of Africa, died, and also the death of Janus occurred, the king of Kittim. The successors to these two rulers, Asdrubal, the son of Agnias, and Latinus, the king of Kittim, then entered upon a long drawn out war of many years....", "...ready his instruments and bandages, his splints and antiseptics.

This speech, though not pitched in a very exalted key, was so subtile and telling, that it threw the convention into applause. Collier recalled Fillmore's fidelity to his party; his satisfactory record in Congress, especially during the passage of the tariff act of 1842; his splendid, if unsuccessful canvass, as a candidate for governor in 1844, and his recent majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> thousand for comptroller, the largest ever given any candidate in the State. At the time, it looked as if a unanimous response might be made; but the friends of Lawrence rallied, and at the close of the ballot Fillmore had won by only six votes. For Collier, however, it was a great triumph, giving him a reputation as a speaker that later efforts did not sustain. To anti-slavery delegates, the Philadelphia convention was a disappointment.

Then, as every detail of the track was plainly revealed, thousands drew a deep breath and shuddered. The track was banked at an angle of approximately <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> degrees, with three laps to the mile. It seemed impossible to many that anything on wheels could cling to the precipitous slope, that appeared to offer insecure footing even for a fly. Near the bottom, a white band was painted around the entire circumference, marking the actual one-third of a mile. At the bottom of the track there was a level stretch, perhaps four feet wide, and beyond that the smooth turf, bordered at a little distance by a dense mass of spectators...", "...Her reply was: \"Oh, for heaven's sake, do not put it into his head to take to religion, for if he does, he will instantly begin by building a cathedral.\" She is supposed to have caricatured him in the projector who hoped to make a fortune by manuring his estate with old wigs.

This council was attended by three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> bishops of Europe and Anatolia, but not by those of the Western Church, African Church, or that of Palestine. It was, in fact, an assembly of those prelates who were weak enough to assist, fearing condemnation and exile if they did not submit, ambitious enough to follow the caprice of the reigning emperor, in hopes of emolument, and also of those who heartily concurred with his semi-Arianism. After a serious deliberation of six months, the prelates subscribed such a decree...", "...and have never worked harder.

By one, the Clinton athletes had arrived; shortly afterward, the Hopevale team put in an appearance; and by half-past one the grandstand and the bleachers were filled, and the boys were beginning to limber up on the track. Dave Ellis, with the blue \"H\" of Hopevale on his chest, seemed in nowise embarrassed at thus revisiting his old quarters, but came out to practise with the rest, and put the shot well over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> feet in a preliminary try. Shortly afterward, Dick had his first glimpse of Johnson, the mainstay of the Clinton team. He was a good-looking, pleasant-faced boy, who went about his \"warming-up\" so quietly and unobtrusively that one would scarcely have selected him, at first, for an athlete of prominence. Yet Dick, watching the play of his long, smooth muscles, and noting how easily and springily he moved up and down the track, knew that he was looking at a first-class...", "...three principal sources of immigration for every decade between 1820 and 1930, one finds that Germany and Ireland were among the leaders for sixty years; Italy for forty; Russia only thirty; the great Scandinavian movement to the middle west lasted a single decade; but Great Britain was one of the chief sources of immigration for seventy years, and probably was the principal source for thirty years more--from 1790 until 1820--during which time no official figures were kept. Out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> million arrivals in this country, about twelve spoke the dominant tongue, and most of them were aware of the tradition of Anglo-Saxon self-government; some had suffered from British domination, more had enjoyed the fruits of liberty; but all knew what liberty and respect for law meant. Many of these millions fled from poverty; but most were not refugees from religious or political persecution. Many millions came to relatives and friends already established; and began...", "...there's the shearing; if this interests you, I wonder what you'll think of that?\" speculated Rigden, exactly as though they had no quarrel. \"It's the thing to see,\" he continued, with deliberate enthusiasm: \"it means mustering the whole run, that does, and travelling mob after mob to the shed; and then the drafting; that's another thing for you to see, though it's nothing to the scene in the shed.

I liked it well enough, and have beseeched them to let it pass for a phansie; but I could never get the rogues in a good humour to do it: for they say that _Sampson's foxes_ have been so very long and so very often tied together, that it is high time to part them.

In either event, Philip had already determined to consult Mr. Abingdon. He had now in his pocket about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> pounds. Half an hour later he was wearing a new tweed suit, new hat and new boots; he had acquired a stock of linen and underclothing, an umbrella and an overcoat. Some of these articles, together with his discarded clothes, were packed in two new, leather portmanteaux, on which his initials would be painted by noon, when he would call for them. He paid twenty-six pounds for the lot, and the man who waited on him tried in vain to tempt him to spend more. Philip knew...", "...some of the most profligate sinecurists and pensioners, male and female, in which I included a sufficient sprinkling of ladies and gentlemen belonging to both the great factions of Whigs and Tories, taking as nearly as I could an equal number from each of them.

Amongst the number of lady pensioners I noticed Lady Auckland, Lady Louisa Paget, Mrs. Hunn, the mother of Mr. Canning, &c. &c.

Constantine, desiring to abolish the abuse, which he regarded as idolatry, by a solemn decision of the church declared, in 753, his intention to convoke for this object a general council; and in order that the question at issue should be thoroughly sifted, he enjoined all the bishops of the empire to assemble local synods, and to examine the subject, previously to its being debated by the general council. This council, composed of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> bishops, met at Constantinople in 754, and, after having deliberated for six months, decided that, _conformably to Holy Writ and the testimony of the fathers, all images were to be removed from the churches, and whoever would dare to make an image, in order to place it in a church, to worship it, or to keep it concealed in his house, was, if a clerk, to be deposed, if a layman, to be anathematised_. The council added, that those who adhered to the images were to be punished...", "...hours before the published time, a grand opportunity of hooting the more unpopular justices of the peace was lost, and the \"makings of a shindy\" evaporated in some sporadic groaning.

Second Resolution--That the landowners, having hitherto shown...", "...you in the Rue de la Victoire. You must stay there till Roland gets back; he will then find you suitable lodgings.

Thus the total of the heavy-armed soldiery was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> thousand seven hundred. To these were added the light-armed force of thirty-five thousand helots and thirty-four thousand five hundred attendants on the Laconians and other Greeks; the whole amounting to one hundred and eight thousand two hundred men, besides one thousand eight hundred Thespians, who, perhaps, on account of the destruction of their city by the Persian army, were without the heavy arms of their confederates.

It was my hope to find in these archives some notice, however slight, of the circumstances under which the early fathers set up the standard of the cross in this Indian town, but the first book has no preamble or introduction of any kind, commencing abruptly with the entry of a marriage. This entry bears date in 1588, but forty or fifty years after the Spaniards established themselves in Merida. This is <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years anterior to the date on the stone before referred to, but it is reasonable to suppose that the convent was not built until some time after the beginning of the archives.

David's magnanimity appears in that he made special search, asking \"Is there any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him the kindness of God for Jonathan's sake?\" The memory of the triumphant conqueror was still tender and loyal to the covenant of friendship he had made in youth, with the son of the man who for long years had pursued him with the hate of a lifetime. David was at this time <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of age, in the prime of his manhood, and his dearest wish was now accomplished; for on the burial of Ishbosheth \"came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron,\" formally reminded him of his early anointing to succeed Saul, and tendered their allegiance.

They had passed us as we came down, for we had sailed inside some islands of the coast, getting shelter and better passage, and the fleet had, no doubt, passed outside.

Thus I cannot but think that the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> are hoist with their own petard.

'In 1800,' so ran the argument of this economist, 'the annual addition to the gold of Christendom was barely two and a half millions. In 1848 it amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> millions. In 1858 the total was a hundred and ninety millions.

And as one of his principles was that his hero must be a national hero, it was of course upon the Arthurian cycle that his aspiration fixed. When he did so, he no doubt believed at least the historical existence of Arthur. As soon, however, as he came to understand the fabulous basis of the Arthurian legend, it became unfitted for his use. In the Trinity College MS. of 1641, Arthur has already disappeared from the list of possible subjects, a list which contains <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> suggestions of names from British or Saxon history, such as Vortigern, Edward the Confessor, Harold, Macbeth, &c. While he demanded the basis of reality for his personages, he at the same time, with a true instinct, rejected all that fell within the period of well-ascertained history. He made the Conquest the lower limit of his choice. In this negative decision against historical romance we recognise Milton's judgment, and his correct estimate of his own powers. Those who...", "...but the chigres, locusts, scorpions, and bush-spiders were ever ready to come half-way to meet them; likewise serpents and alligators proffered them the freedom of the forests, and exhibited a hospitality almost excessive.

The squadron crossed the line on the 14th of May, \"being the eighth time we have done so,\" says Rogers, \"in our course round the world.\" This was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> days after leaving the Cape, giving a mean speed of rather more than three miles an hour.

In that case we might calculate that a third of Rubini's force would fall at the first volley; there they would be in the forest, without a guide, in the dark, surrounded by twice their number of men well acquainted with the place, and accustomed to traversing it at night.

Behind his back other people attributed it to beer, some even going to far as to nickname him the 'tank'.

Round it were five porches or doorways, and in these lay a great many poor sick men. There was something wonderful about the pool. At times in the year the water bubbled up--the Jews said an angel made it do so. The first person who stepped into the pool as it bubbled was cured at once. So many sick men waited for the chance. One man was there who had been crippled for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years. The Lord Jesus walked down one day to this pool, and when He saw the poor man and heard how long he had been thus, He said to him, \"Will you be made well?\" The helpless man thought Our Lord meant, \"Will you not go into the pool,\" for he answered, \"Sir, I have no man who will put me in when the pool is bubbling, and while I try to get to it another man steps down before me.\" It was, as you know, only the first who stepped in after the water was troubled that was...", "...be quite impossible to take it with the small force we had got with us; but, as I said, our captain wasn't a man to trouble his head about impossibilities. \"The place was two miles long and half a mile wide, and protected by no less than ten sea-batteries and two strong forts--one called Belgica, and the other Nassau.

The relation of the book of Deuteronomy to the earlier portions of the law deserves a careful consideration. And, first, in regard to _time_. All that portion of the law which precedes the sixteenth chapter of the book of Numbers was given in the first and second years after the exodus; consequently <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years before the composition of the book of Deuteronomy. The four chapters of Numbers that follow, chaps. 16-19, are generally dated about twenty years later--that is, about eighteen years before the composition of Deuteronomy.

It is the despotism of the papacy that lent its darkest character to the Middle Ages; it meant death to all freedom of mental life, decay to all science, corruption to all morality. From the noble height to which the life of the human mind had attained in classical antiquity, in the centuries before Christ and the first century after Christ, it soon sank, under the rule of the papacy, to a level which, in respect of...", "...a week, and sometimes even better, an undertaker sat on the council!

An Irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> and a half out of every hundred policemen were Irish, either by birth or parentage!

Here is a fairly typical case from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A woman of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years had undergone thirteen pregnancies in seventeen years.

When the canon went to board with Mademoiselle Gamard he knew exactly how to judge of his landlady's character.

She was then about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years old, and still retained a few pretensions, which, in well-behaved persons of her condition, change, rather later, into strong personal self-esteem.

To compass this result, he allowed no points of contact between himself and her except those that politeness demanded, and those which necessarily exist between two...", "...due representation in the Cabinet.

Patients are not able to remain by themselves for even the shortest length of time. This morbid dread of being alone is sometimes so great that even the presence of an infant is an alleviation.

The Post Office opposed the change to the last, even though a Parliamentary Committee had recommended it, and an address in its favour had been presented to the Prince Regent.

But in order to facilitate communication between England and Ireland a good deal more was required than to set up an additional coach or to send an existing coach by another and shorter route.

At that time we could not have purchased them under $1 50 the couple. The cost of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> chickens till ready to kill was $4 37. We always knew exactly the expense attending the poultry, because we had a separate book from the miller, in which every article was entered as it came into the house; and as the chickens were kept distinct from the other fowls, I could tell the exact sum they had cost us when they made their appearance at table.

She had also iron with which to build a sawmill, a wagon, grindstones, nails and glass, and a plow. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> passengers, eighteen heads of families and twenty children. The Captain himself reported the voyage to the American Colonization Society in this laconic letter: Thirty-eight in number went out with me, their expenses were estimated at one hundred dollars per head, but were there a large number they could be carried out for sixty dollars.

Weak, frail, delicate boys, with inherited tendencies to disease, who should, by all means, never use tobacco, or anything injurious, are often as obstinately bent upon learning to smoke, in spite of medical advice, as those in whom a moderate use would be far less objectionable. A recent observer, in examining into the cases of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> boys who had formed the habit of using tobacco, found that twenty-seven of them had also a fondness for alcoholic stimulants. A large proportion of the Franklin Home inmates attribute their habit of drinking to the effects of company; many commenced in the army, and many were induced to drink at first by invitation. If smoking was a solitary habit, it would be less likely to lead to drinking; but the same companionship, and habits of treating prevail, as in the saloon, and...", "...of attack was formed. It is said that the level-headed Longstreet opposed the plan, and if so it was but in keeping with his remarkable generalship.

At half-past one the report of the first gun rang out on the still, summer air, followed a minute later by the second, and then came the roar and flash of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> rebel cannon. Almost immediately one hundred Federal guns responded and the battle had begun. Shot and shell tore through the air, crashing through batteries, tearing men and horses to pieces; the very earth seemed to shake and the hills to reel as the terrible thunders re-echoed amongst them.

In 1739 Euler reckoned the vibrations of the great eight-foot C to be one hundred and eighteen to the second. In 1776, Marpurg, for the same tone, gives one hundred and twenty-five vibrations. Chladni, in the year 1802, calculated its vibrations as a hundred and twenty-eight, twenty years later as a hundred and thirty-six to a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> to the second. And since then we have, no doubt, gone noticeably higher! We find, then, that the tone has risen most emphatically since the appearance of the Romanticists; in the days of the Classical School it remained the same for the greatest length of time. The latter was the period of the most moderate artistic expression. At present, on the contrary, we thirst for shriller and shriller tones, higher and higher singing.

One of these was a very severe action (February, 1799) between the American frigate Constellation, of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> guns, commanded by Commodore Truxton, and the French frigate l'Insurgente, of forty guns, which terminated in the capture of the latter.

The first collection, entitled 'Fugitive Pieces', was printed in quarto by S. and J. Ridge of Newark. Two of the poems, \"The Tear\" and the \"Reply to Some Verses of J. M. B.

The whole of this issue, with the exception of two or three copies, was destroyed. An imperfect copy, lacking pp. 17-20 and pp. 58-66, is preserved at Newstead. A perfect copy, which had been retained by the Rev. J. T.

It is true that a German Diet, which met in the old coronation city of Frankfort, had been created to discuss matters of \"common policy and importance.\" But in this Diet, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> delegates represented thirty-eight different interests and as no decision could be taken without a unanimous vote (a parliamentary rule which had in previous centuries ruined the mighty kingdom of Poland), the famous German Confederation became very soon the laughing stock of Europe and the politics of the old Empire began to resemble those of our Central American neighbours in the forties and the fifties of the last century.

Reports of the kind were not to be treated lightly. Indian faith was uncertain along the frontier, and white men were often shot down in the wilderness for plunder or revenge.

In 1793 the granting of patents was given exclusively to the Secretary of State. In 1821 the clerk of the State Department who examined applications for patents received the title of Superintendent of the Patent Office, and on July 4, 1836, the Patent Office was created as a separate bureau and a Commissioner of Patents created. About 24,000 patents are issued annually.

Stepping forward, she took hold of it gingerly and managed to draw it forth--a heavy, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> Colt, the barrel rust-pitted in a few places, but otherwise in excellent condition. She had no idea how to load it, but presently discovered by peering into the magazine that the shells seemed to be already in place.

That, however, was not to be, for Kenly, although outplayed during most of the game, enjoyed one flash of desperate, heroic and successful endeavor. Getting possession of the ball on Alton's <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> yards, she made two forward-passes good and landed on the twelve. From there, in spite of the home team's savage defense, she smashed her way to the seven in three attacks and then threw over the line for a score.

Allan Pinkerton began life as a cooper, and was doing a thriving business at Dundee, some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> miles north-west of Chicago, about 1847. The times were primitive; barter took the place of cash payments in the absence of a currency.

This was over six dollars a pound for flour, or twelve hundred dollars for a barrel! On April twenty-ninth, 1865, potatoes were worth forty to fifty cents a pound in gold. At an average price of forty-five cents a pound, a bushel (seventy pounds) cost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> dollars in greenbacks. On May sixth we read: \"Potatoes. Several large loads have arrived, . . . causing a decline of five cents a pound.\" So potatoes dropped off in price, in one day, four dollars in greenbacks per bushel. \"On May thirteenth,\" comments Mr. Langford further, regarding this interesting commercial situation, \"we note that the principal restaurant, 'in consequence of the recent fall in flour,' reduced day board to twenty dollars per week for gold.

The rulers of Japan to-day, if they were interrogated on the subject, would probably reply that the record of Japan for over <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years past is the practical interpretation of the Emperor's cryptic utterance. Be that as it may, the ink was hardly dry on the Imperial edict before Japan laid herself out with earnestness, not to say enthusiasm, to carry into effect the principles enunciated in the edict.

Its superiority over the Mt. Cenis drill consists in its lightness, automatic feed, and smaller size. The Mt.

An important feature of his church government was the appointment on the 20th of March 1654 of the \"Triers,\" <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> clerical and lay commissioners, who decided upon the qualifications of candidates for livings, and without whose recommendation none could be appointed; while an ordinance of August 1654 provided for the removal of the unfit, the latter class including besides immoral persons those holding \"popish\" or blasphemous opinions, those publicly using the English Prayer Book, and the disaffected to the government.

This was a great comfort to us, as, for several days we had been obliged to live upon our dried fish.

The government of Chile actually sent as a special student to Austria and Germany a woman, Ernestina Perez, who has since taken high rank as a physician. The advance in the status of women in Chile was doubtless largely due to the influence of Mercedes Marin del Solar, whose writings first extorted from Spanish masculinity a reluctant confession that a woman...", "...in Eber's house of learning, he had devoted the nights to study.

December 23,1806. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE TO 'HOURS OF IDLENESS AND OTHER EARLY POEMS'. There were four distinct issues of Byron's Juvenilia. The first collection, entitled 'Fugitive Pieces', was printed in quarto by S. and J. Ridge of Newark. Two of the poems, \"The Tear\" and the \"Reply to Some Verses of J. M. B. Pigot, Esq.,\" were signed \"BYRON;\" but the volume itself, which is without a title-page, was anonymous. It numbers sixty-six pages, and consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> distinct pieces. The last piece, \"Imitated from Catullus. To Anna,\" is dated November 16, 1806. The whole of this issue, with the exception of two or three copies, was destroyed. An imperfect copy, lacking pp. 17-20 and pp. 58-66, is preserved at Newstead. A perfect copy, which had been retained by the Rev. J. T.

As everything was alive in 1798, the Crisis was ready to sail in three days after I joined her. We hauled into the North river, as became the dignity of our voyage, and got our crew on board. On the whole, we mustered a pretty good body of men, ten of them being green; fellows who had never seen the ocean, but who were young, healthy and athletic, and who promised to be useful before a great while. Including those aft, we counted <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> souls on board. The ship was got ready in hopes of being able to sail of a Thursday, for Captain Williams was a thoughtful man, and was anxious to get the ship fairly at sea, with the first work done, previously to the next Sabbath. Some small matters, however, could not be got through with in time; and, as for sailing of a Friday, that was out of the question. No one did that in 1798, who could help it. This gave us a holiday, and I got leave to pass the afternoon and...", "...A fine breeze from the northward enabled the ships to be well out round Saint Helen's, when hauling their tacks aboard they stood down channel under all sail. In the centre were the heavy line-of-battle ships, exhibiting a dense mass of shining canvas; while scattered around on either side were the lighter frigates, like skirmishers on the field of battle feeling the way for the main body of the army. Among the fastest, the finest, and most dashing of the latter craft, was the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> gun frigate \"Thisbe.\" She had only lately been put in commission, and her captain, officers, and crew, were mostly strangers to each other. Captain Courtney, who commanded her, had the reputation of being brave and enterprising, but his present crew had yet to learn what he was made of. The day was closing; the fleet had made good progress down channel, and the \"Thisbe\" was one of the southernmost look-out frigates; the crew were enjoying a short relaxation from...", "...1654 to capture New Amsterdam (New York) from the Dutch was abandoned on the conclusion of peace, and the fleet turned to attack the French colonies; Major Robert Sedgwick taking with a handful of men the fort of St John's, Port Royal or Annapolis, and the French fort on the river Penobscot, the whole territory from this river to the mouth of the St Lawrence remaining British territory till its cession in 1667.

That is to say, the attractive force of the highly developed Prussian State practically unified Germany for purposes of trade and commerce, and that, too, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years before political union was achieved. This, be it observed, was on condition of internal Free Trade, but of moderate duties being levied on foreign products.

But these summaries occupy <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> pages in the reports.

As near as can be ascertained, the annual taxes on timber vary from one cent per thousand feet to fifty cents per thousand feet, with an average tax of somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen cents per thousand feet. Interest charges are probably about twenty-three cents, making a total annual cost of something like <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> cents per thousand feet. In ten years time the tax on each thousand feet of standing timber will amount to $1.50, which compounded with interest makes a total of $2.37.

Next in time came the Restless, built in 1614 or 1615 at New York, by Adrian Blok, a Dutch captain whose ships had been burned while lying at Manhattan Island. This vessel, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> feet long and of eleven feet beam, was employed for several years in exploring the Atlantic coast. With the advent of the nineteenth century a new ideal in naval architecture arose, that of the ship moved by steam-power instead of wind-power, and fitted to combat with the seas alike in storm and calm, with little heed as to whether the wind was fair or foul. The steamship appeared, and grew in size and power until such giants of the wave as the Titanic and Olympic were...", "...in the _melee_ which ensued, and the steadiness which enabled the square to be re-formed under circumstances which rendered disaster possible, were worthy of the finest traditions of the British Army.

This duty is prohibitive of course.

Some of the states that had been securely counted upon by the Republicans, went over to the Democrats; but, when the final returns were given on the second day of November, 1880, it was found that Garfield had carried twenty of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> states, receiving two hundred and fourteen of the electoral votes, while Hancock had but one hundred and fifty-five. One of Garfield's old pupils, upon hearing the news, wrote to a friend in New York as follows:-- \"We of 'old Portage County,' where his ability was first recognized, and from which no delegate to any convention where his name has been presented ever voted against him, knowing him well and trusting him fully, rejoice with exceeding joy in the results of...", "...earth, and rendered with a marvellous breadth of style and penetrating sympathy; 184, end wall, and 185, R. of entrance, Grape Harvest in Burgundy, and Spring, are by Daubigny.

In 1855 Courbet, finding his works badly hung in the International Exhibition at Paris, erected a wooden shed near the entrance, where he exhibited <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> of his large pictures, and defiantly painted outside in big letters--REALISM: G. COURBET. Strong of body and coarse in habit, this _peintre-animal_, as he was called, delighted to _epater le bourgeois_, and painted his studies of the nude with a brutal reality that stripped the female form of all the beauty and grace with which the superior ideality of man has invested it.

A more honorable or effective committee could scarcely have been appointed. It embraced some of the first men in England; among them <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> noblemen, the chancellor of the exchequer, the master of rolls, Admiral Vernon and Field Marshal Wade. They entered upon their labors with zeal and diligence, and not only made inquiries, through the Fleet prison, but also into the Marshalsea, the prison of the king's bench, and the jail for the county of Surrey. The philanthropy of Oglethorpe, whose feelings were easily enlisted in the cause of misery, rested not with the discharge of his Parliamentary duty, nor yet in...", "...packed with thought, in an age that used endless circumlocutions. The first ten essays, published in 1597, were brief notebook jottings of Bacon's observations. Their success astonished the author, but not till fifteen years later were they republished and enlarged. Their charm grew upon Bacon himself, and during his retirement he gave more thought to the wonderful language which he had at first despised as much as Aristotle's philosophy. In 1612 appeared a second edition containing <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> essays, and in 1625, the year before his death, he republished the _Essays_ in their present form, polishing and enlarging the original ten to fifty-eight, covering a wide variety of subjects suggested by the life of men around him.

It is necessary for the planters who reside between towns so far asunder, to have some more particular address, than the indefinite one arising from their vicinity to one or other of these towns.

Hence they do not mention the healing of the man who had been ill for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years (John v. 5-9), nor of the man born blind (John ix.), nor, for the same reason, the raising of Lazarus, all these miracles having occurred in Judea.

Her many gifts of grace, if not her learning, impressed contemporaries, who wrote to her for enlightenment upon points of doctrine and biblical interpretation; they would wait patiently until she should be enabled to answer, since her answers were not in the power of her own reflection, but had to be seen or heard. For instance, a monk named Guibert, who afterwards became the saint's amanuensis and biographer, propounded <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> questions of biblical interpretation on behalf of the monks of the monastery of Villars. In the course of time Hildegard replies: \"In visione animae meae, haec verba vidi et audivi,\" and thereupon she gives a text from Canticles with an exposition of it, which neither she nor the monks regarded quite as hers, but as divinely revealed.

Under orders inspired by the urgency, he had been pushing on at all speed to seize the crossing; in spite of the heat and the dust, he had led the column at the furious pace of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> miles, perhaps forty, in twenty-six hours; but Gooding had already found the Confederates in strong possession, and now it seemed clear that the passage must be forced. At nine o'clock Emory and Cameron closed on Birge and halted, and at three in the morning A. J. Smith came up.

This affair aroused the Slave Power to a frenzy of excitement, and they immediately demanded an investigation, and strong attempts were made to fix the conspiracy on members of the Republican Party, but it signally failed. Three days after John Brown's execution, the Thirty-sixth Congress assembled. In the Senate there were <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> Democrats, twenty-five Republicans, and two Americans; the Republicans had gained five Senators. In the House there were one hundred and nine Republicans, eighty-eight administration Democrats, thirteen anti-Lecompton Democrats, and twenty-seven Americans, all of the latter, except four, from the South. The contest for the Speakership developed the deep animosity felt by the South, and threats of disunion and personal violence abounded throughout the session.

She should wear, for a thin sleeve, black lace to the wrist, with bands of velvet running down, to diminish the size of the arm. All those lace sleeves to the elbow, with drops of gold, or steel trimming, or jets, are very unbecoming; no one but the slight should wear them. Tight lacing is also very unbecoming to those who usually adopt it--women of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> or forty who are growing a little stout. In thus trussing themselves up they simply get an unbecoming redness of the face, and are not the handsome, comfortable-looking creatures which Heaven intended they should be.

When it was believed that the excitement was allayed another outbreak occurred at Lucknow. Lawrence's energetic measures maintained order in Oude. The mutiny was only scattered, however. Within a week Meerut, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> miles northeast of Delhi, and the largest cantonment in India, was in a blaze. The story of the greased cartridges had been capped by that of the bone dust. Some eighty-five of a regiment of Sepoy cavalry refused to take the cartridges and were marched off to the guard-house.

Victor Hughes,[75] on taking possession of the fort, ordered the monument that had been erected over General Dundas, to be destroyed, and his remains thrown into the river Galion; a conduct as mean and brutal, as it was undeserved.

Brother Gorenflot was about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of age and five feet high. However, what he wanted in height, he made up in breadth, measuring nearly three feet in diameter from shoulder to shoulder, which, as everyone knows, is equal to nine feet of circumference. Between these Herculean shoulders rose a neck of which the muscles stood out like cords. Unluckily this neck partook of the same proportions; it was short and thick, which at any great emotion might render Brother Gorenflot liable to apoplexy. But...", "...Troy. The whole period of the monarchy lies within the mythical age. Tradition makes Codrus the last king, who was slain during an invasion of the Dorians, B.C. 1045. Resolving to have no future king, the Athenians substituted the office of archon, or ruler, and made his son, Medus, the superior magistrate. This office remained hereditary in the family of Codrus for thirteen generations. In B.C. 752, the duration of the office was fixed for ten years. It remained in the family of Codrus <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years longer, when it was left open for all the nobles. In 683 B.C. nine archons were annually elected from the nobles, the first having superior dignity. (M378) The first of these archons, of whom any thing of importance is recorded, was Draco, who governed Athens in the year 624 B.C., who promulgated written laws, exceedingly severe, inflicting capital punishment for slight offenses. The people grew weary of him and his laws, and he was banished to AEgina, where he...", "...he knew from his personal experience this was not a delusion; moreover, an image of Mary at Sozopolis, in Posidia, distilled balsam, as was well attested. In short, party spirit ran high, and at last a great champion of images arose, named John of Damascus. Leo waged war against images for twelve years, until his death. His son Constantine was as zealous an iconoclast as his father; but great disturbances were caused by his proceedings. In 754 he convoked a council of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> bishops, who agreed with the Emperor. They denounced the wretched painters who with profane hands attempted to depict the sacred feelings of the heart, and laid down the rule of faith to be, that there was only one true image or symbol, which was the bread and wine used in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Painting was described as a Pagan, godless art, which degraded the Divine Majesty; and whoever in future should manufacture an image to worship it either in church or...", "...a half from where Hodgen's mill now is.

In 1813 the family removed to a more comfortable home on Knob Creek, six miles from Hodgensville, where Thomas Lincoln bought a better farm of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> acres for one hundred and eighteen pounds and gave his note in payment. This was Abraham Lincoln's second home, and there he lived for four years. We know little about his childhood, except that it was of continual privation in a cheerless home, for Thomas Lincoln evidently found it difficult to supply his family with food and clothing. Mr. Lincoln seldom talked freely of those days, even to his most intimate friends, although from remarks which he dropped from time to...", "...or rather with a tendency to expand outwards. The building is round, and has been surrounded with an outer-wall, of which hardly the slightest vestiges now remain.

The diameter of the interior at the base is nineteen feet six inches; at the top twenty-one feet; the curve in the inside being the reverse of the outside, or nearly so. The thickness of the walls at the base seventeen feet; at the top eight feet six inches. The height outside forty-two feet; the inside thirty-four feet.

The equestrian statue at the end of the Long Walk is a conspicuous object.

They with their tiny savings are the world's bankers. In the United Kingdom, the rural population has decreased from twenty-eight per cent. to twenty-three per cent. of the total population. How about Canada? In 1891 thirty-two per cent. of Canada's people lived in towns and cities. By 1901 <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> per cent. were town dwellers. By 1914 the proportion in towns and cities is almost fifty per cent. The entire movement of population from country to city is reflected in the astounding growth of the cities.

Those routes were turned over to him. Gentlemen, it was not done in secret.

In very desperate straits many new inventions were sought after by deep-thinking and resolute slaves, determined to be free at any cost. But it must here be admitted, that, in looking carefully over the more perilous methods resorted to, Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, stands second to none, with regard to deeds of bold daring. This hero escaped from Martinsburg, Va., in 1856. He was a man of medium size, mulatto, about <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of age, could read and write, and was naturally sharp-witted. He had formerly been owned by Col.

Furthermore, he also alleged, that his \"mistress was cruel to all the slaves,\" declaring that \"they (the slaves), could not live with her,\" that \"she had to hire servants,\" etc. In order to effect his escape, Robert was obliged to swim the Potomac river on horseback, on...", "...rising \"star\" in the political firmament.

His face was tanned, his hair, just turning grey at the temples, was neatly smoothed down. The eyes were a little too small, almost pig-like, in fact; nevertheless his pleasant smile counteracted the unfavourable impression which his eyes would otherwise have made. \"Have a cigar, Edward?\" were his opening words to me.

A range of heights from five feet to six feet would be served equally well by a similar height of equipment. This makes it possible to lay down the rule that sinks should be designed and plumbers should provide for piping them at a height of thirty-five inches from the bottom of the sink to the floor. Ranges should be thirty-four inches in height to the working top, and both washing machines and tubs should be <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> inches to their rims. This enables all work to be done with straight unstrained back. Where the forearm muscle is involved, however, it becomes a far more delicate question. The distance between work-table top and elbow must be the control on designing. For that reason it is not possible to establish a constant and ideal height for kitchen cabinets and working table surfaces, although in general most of these have been from one to two inches too low. \"Adjustable in...", "...1877); _Le Canarien_ in P.

Of course, it is not history in the ordinary sense: a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years is covered in less than ten chapters (x. II-xix.).

The charge for corrections and alterations is one which, from the difficulty of measuring them, gives rise to the greatest inconvenience, and is as disagreeable to the publisher (if he be the agent between the author and the printer), and to the master printer or his foreman, as it is to the author himself. If the author study economy, he should make...", "...ingenio esset hominum cum quadam effectum elegantia, id prope divinum dicebat,\" says the anonymous biographer.

Not a tradesman nor a bagman, and not a farmer, though he looked like an open-air man; nor could I form a guess from his speech and manner as to his native place. A robust man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> or forty, with blue eyes and a Saxon face, he looked a thorough Englishman, and yet he struck me as most un-English in his lively, almost eager manner, his freedom with a stranger, and something, too, in his speech.

The last name in Eratosthenes nearly corresponds to the name of the king, in Manetho, under whom the invasion of the Hyksos took place. If, therefore, we assume that the list of Eratosthenes was intended to enumerate the kings who ruled over Egypt to this date, we find <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> kings who must have reigned through 1076 years; and, as parallel to these, we find in Manetho fourteen dynasties with at least 241 kings, occupying a period of 3,084 years. Scarcely less striking are the contradictions in the monuments themselves. In the temple of Ammon at Karnak, which was extended on a magnificent scale by Tuthmosis III.

Just twenty-one of these churches do unite, the majority for Thanksgiving Day services and in fewer instances, for Chautauqua, Baccalaureate, Memorial Day, and summer evening services.

Therefore, one may infer that a considerable part of the flight was derived from regions to the south of the station.

In eleven of the hours of observation no birds at all were seen.

The Indians, learning the inconsiderable numbers that had attacked them, rallied in their turn, and hung upon the rear of the English.

In this manner, they suffered the loss of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> men, though the Indians paid dearly for it by the loss of more than a hundred of their warriors on the way.

On the western slope, which was ten thousand six hundred and fifty feet in length, the maximum grade was two hundred and eighty feet per mile, and the ruling radius of curvature three hundred feet.

The average wage seems to be three farthings an hour, but one hears of children who are paid one shilling and sixpence for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> hours of toil.\"[36] In New South Wales boys are permitted to trade on the streets at the age of ten years, and up to fourteen years may engage in such work between the hours of 7 A.M. and 7 P.M. except while the schools are in session; after they are fourteen years old they may trade between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M. Such children are licensed, and during the six months ending March 31, 1910, 714 licenses were issued, 72 per cent of them being to children under fourteen years...", "...looms large, sir,\" was the answer. The information was notified to the Captain, who was on deck in an instant. Whether the stranger was friend or foe was the next question to be ascertained. Doubts were expressed as to that point both fore and aft. She was a frigate, that was very certain; still, without trying her with the private signal, Captain Brine did not like to haul his wind and make sail away from her. The nearer she drew, the more French she looked. Eighteen guns to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> or forty, which probably the stranger carried, was a greater disproportion than even the gallant Brine was inclined to encounter. All hands stood ready to make sail at an instant's notice. At length the two ships drew almost near enough to exchange signals. \"That ship is French, depend on it, sir!\" exclaimed the first lieutenant to the Captain. \"I am not quite so certain of that, Digby,\" answered Captain Brine. \"But if she is not an enemy, she is the _Diamond_...", "...miner, and that she too had an idea, and a hope, that Owen was working in the mine.

To me the Madeleine has always a spurious air: nothing in it seems quite true. Externally, its Roman proportions carry no hint of the Christian religion; within, there is a noticeable lack of reverence. Every one walks about, and the Suisses are of the world peculiarly and offensively worldly. Standing before the altar with its representation of the Magdalen, who gives the church its name, being carried to Heaven, it is difficult to realise that only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years ago this very spot was running red with the blood of massacred Communards. I remember the Madeleine most naturally as I saw it once at Mi-Careme, from an upper window at Durand's, after lunch. It was a dull day and the Madeleine frowned on the human sea beneath it; for the Place before it and the Rue Royale were black with people. The portico is always impressive, but I had never before had so much time or such excellent opportunity to study it and its relief of...", "...Soames could see from where he sat. He looked at his catalogue: \"No. 32 'The Future Town'--Paul Post.\" 'I suppose that's satiric too,' he thought. 'What a thing!' But his second impulse was more cautious. It did not do to condemn hurriedly. There had been those stripey, streaky creations of Monet's, which had turned out such trumps; and then the stippled school; and Gauguin. Why, even since the Post-Impressionists there had been one or two painters not to be sneezed at. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of his connoisseur's life, indeed, he had marked so many \"movements,\" seen the tides of taste and technique so ebb and flow, that there was really no telling anything except that there was money to be made out of every change of fashion.

The force with which he was to revenge himself on the Spanish monarch, numbered seventy-three men and boys, all told. In the Indies he was joined by Captain Rowse, of an Isle of Wight bark, with <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> men on board. Let us see how they sped. It was known that there was great treasure at Nombre de Dios, and thither the little squadron shaped its course. The town was unwalled, and they entered without difficulty, but the Spaniards received them in the market-place with a volley of shot.

The 1st Imperial Light Horse, under Colonel Briggs, acting independently from Bethlehem after the departure of General Dartnell for Zululand, came in for some thrilling experiences. This excellent force was well suited for exploits of a daring kind and long-distance raids such as had to be undertaken. On the 28th they made a circuitous night march of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> miles from Bethlehem, and dawn found them surrounding the town of Reitz. It was a brilliantly conceived and brilliantly carried out affair, and the prize of twenty-one prisoners (including Landdrost Piet de Villiers), nine Cape carts, two waggons, twenty-four horses, 250 cattle, and some ammunition, was well deserved. The Boers, on Colonel Briggs' way back, made many night attempts at reprisals, but the Imperial Light Horse was not to be caught napping. The troops in the...", "...something of the man and his teachings. The aim of this volume is to give a brief and clear account of his philosophical ideas, and to inspire the reader to study for himself Eucken's great works. Professor Rudolf Eucken was born in 1846, at Aurich in Frisia. He attended school in his native town, and then proceeded to study at the Universities of Goettingen and Berlin. In 1874 he was invited to the Professorship of Philosophy at the University of Jena, and here he has laboured for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years; during this period he has been listened to and admired by many of the more advanced students of philosophy of all countries and continents. His earliest writings were historical in character, and consisted mainly of learned essays upon the classical and German philosophers. Following upon these appeared valuable studies in the history of philosophy, which brought out, too, to some extent, Eucken's own philosophical ideas. His latest works have been more...", "...eight days--_splendida bilis_. Then a dead sleep in the morning, and when the awakening comes, a strong feeling how well I could dispense with it for once and for ever. This passes away, however, as better and more dutiful thoughts arise in my mind. I know not if my imagination has flagged; probably it has; but at least my powers of labour have not diminished during the last melancholy week. On Monday and Tuesday my exertions were suspended. Since Wednesday inclusive I have written <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> of my close manuscript pages, of which seventy make a volume of the usual Novel size.

I am not so fond of honouring these anomalies. Usage is here as unsettled, as it is arbitrary; and, if the expression of plurality is to be limited to either form exclusively, the regular plural ought certainly to be preferred. But, _for fish taken in bulk_, the singular form seems more appropriate; as, \"These vessels take from <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> to forty-five quintals of _cod_ and _pollock_, and six thousand barrels of _mackerel_, yearly.\"--_Balbi's Geog._, p. 28.

She is simply a city of transportation, and is no better than her rails and boats, though by her rails and boats she lives in every Western state and territory. The same is true now of St. Louis and the vast Southwest. One railroad recently planned for a Western extension, and laid out along its lines the sites of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> new towns, each of which was located and named before the question of inhabitants for the towns was ever taken up. Another railway in the Southwest has named fifty cities that are yet to build; and still others have scores of communities that in time are to be the battle-grounds of human lives, the stages of the human tragedy or comedy. The railways have not only reached but created provinces; they have not only nourished but conceived communities.

Two years later, or in 1738, owing to their church treatment, a company consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> families, settled the new town of Pelham, thirty miles west of Worcester. The scandalous destruction of their property in Worcester, in 1740, caused a further exodus which resulted in the establishing the towns of Warren and Blandford, both being incorporated in 1741.

Muniments of war they had in abundance: Comorn, with its vast arsenal and impregnable walls, opened its arms to receive them. When Georgey capitulated, he had one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> guns, besides those in the hands of Kossuth and Bem. Fully half the military stores of Austria fell into the hands of the Hungarians, the moment the insurrection broke out. Yet, with all these advantages, they were overcome.

Criticism, whether \"higher\" or otherwise, defended on the one side, was unsparingly denounced on the other.

As Calcutta is eighteen feet above the level of the Bay of Bengal, this shows that the Megna (which has no perceptible current) is at the level of the sea, and that either the Soormah is upwards of thirty feet above that level, or that the atmospheric pressure there, and at this season, is less than at Calcutta, which, as I have hinted at chapter xxvii, is probably the case.] On the 14th we passed the...", "...Bay, in #D#, is, according to Buchan, the old name of the mouth of the river Ugie.

Of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> children examined in one factory, thirty-six were deformed. One of the Governors of Kirman forbade the employment of children under twelve in the factories, but the order did not last beyond his governorship.

With this powerful weapon I expected to shoot a quarter of a mile; but with all its dreadful strength, its cast was slow and cumbersome. The arrow that came with it, a miniature javelin <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> inches long, could only be projected one hundred and ten yards.

These vessels mount from twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> guns, and are esteemed excellent _cruisers_.\" The name was derived from _fregata_, a Mediterranean vessel propelled both by sails and by oars. It is said the British navy was the first to adopt frigates for use in war, but the French, and afterwards the Americans, were generally successful in building the finest vessels of this class. These ships were full-rigged, with three masts, and carried all their principal guns in one battery on the main deck.

The Chinese boast of having noticed and recorded a series of eclipses extending over a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> hundred and fifty-eight years; and it is probable that they anticipated the Greeks two thousand years in the discovery of the Metonic cycle,--or the cycle of nineteen years, at the end of which time the new moons fall on the same days of the year.

After the court-martial had completed its work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities, a great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale slaughter of the beloved red man.

The president, after consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the execution of only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> of the most flagrant cases, and accordingly directed them to be hung on the 26th of December, 1862. * * * * * Previous to their execution the condemned prisoners were interviewed by Rev.

This Saxon Visitation was the model for similar ones made in almost every evangelical principality, and its reports serve to show what need there was for inquiry and reorganisation. The lands of Electoral Saxony were divided into four \"circles,\" and a commission of theologians and lawyers was appointed to undertake the duties in each circle. The Visitation of the one \"circle\" of Wittenberg, with its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> parishes, may be taken as an example of how the work was done, and what kinds of alterations were suggested. The commissioners or Visitors were Martin Luther and Justus Jonas, theologians, with Hans Metzsch, Benedict Pauli, and Johann v. Taubenheim, jurists. They began in October 1528, and spent two months over their task. It was a strictly business proceeding. There is no account of either Luther or Jonas preaching while on tour.

In 1886, when a chair of philosophy was established at Cornell, President White, who had once met the brilliant young Canadian, called him to that position. Two years later, Dr. Schurman became dean of the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell; and, in 1892, when the president's chair became vacant, he was placed at the head of the great university. At that time he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of age.

The river transport service not only did this, but also provided, as a by-work, carriage for many men joining their corps and for sick sent down to the rear.

After some three weeks of this life, Powhatan sent this guileless youth down to decoy the English into his hands, promising to freight a ship with corn if they would visit him. Spelman took the message and brought back the English reply, whereupon Powhatan laid the plot which resulted in the killing of Captain Ratcliffe and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> men, only two of his company escaping to Jamestown. Spelman gives two versions of this incident. During the massacre Spelman says that Powhatan sent him and Savage to a town some sixteen miles away.

He accordingly drew off in good order, having lost six killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> wounded; besides twenty-five missing, probably prisoners. The casualties of the British, by their official reports, were eighteen killed and seventy-three wounded.

Upon this the delegates of the cotton States--Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Arkansas--withdrew from the convention.

The assumption of QMt and QLk, going back to two different translations, from different copies of the Aramaic original, and undergoing the process of alteration and accretion in different surroundings before falling into the hands of Matthew and Luke, best accounts for the agreements, the divergences, and the peculiar but strongly similar material.

These goats keep along the line between the forest and snow, some of the most difficult ground in the hills. The horns are a much-prized trophy. THE TAHR The tahr of the Himalayas is a very different-looking animal from the true goats, from which, among other characters, it is distinguished by the form and small size of the horns. The horns, which are black, spring in a high backward arch, but the creature has no beard. A buck stands sometimes as much as <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> inches high at the shoulder. It has a long, rough coat, mainly dark stone-color in tint. These animals live in the forest districts of the Middle Himalayas, where they are found on very high and difficult ground.

Thus <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years had passed of such tranquillity as it was ever in those times the lot of Christians to obtain. The mother of one emperor had been Origen's disciple, and the emperor actually reigning was a Christian, however unworthy of such a profession.

The amount which all the colleges and universities in this country received in tuition fees in 1911 was only $20,000,000; and the entire income received both from fees and productive funds was only about $34,000,000. In other words, when one takes into account the depreciation of the battleship or armored cruiser, the entire cost of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> battleships for a single year is greater than the administration of the entire American system of higher education.

He waved gayly to the little company in the veranda and came up the steps at two bounds, though he was a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> and just the least bit weazened. \"Well,\" he said, with his greetings scarcely off his lips, \"I came to tell you I've sold the colt!\" The chorus repeated his announcement as a question. \"Yes, sold the colt,\" solemnly responded Morty. And then added, \"Father just wouldn't!

In the preceding sessions bills had passed the commons to disfranchise the borough of Stafford; but none of them had passed both houses. A new bill was passed by the commons, and sent up to the lords in the beginning of April. The second reading of the bill, however, in the house of lords was negatived by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> against twenty-two. On the 11th of June Mr. Hume moved in the house of commons, that the issuing of the writ for the borough of Stafford should be suspended till ten days after the next meeting of parliament. This motion was carried by a great majority. Another question touching parliamentary purity attracted still greater attention. In May, 1835, the election of Colonel Bruen and Mr. Cavanagh for the county of Carlow had been declared void by a committee. Messrs....", "...war. The \"charge of the Light Brigade\" at Balaklava has been made famous in song and history, yet there were thirty Union regiments that each lost ten per cent. more men at Chickamauga, and many Confederate regiments whose mortality exceeded this.

From Mendoza the line runs across the Andes by the Uspallata Valley route, the only transcontinental line in South America. What the Suez Canal and the Trans-Siberian Railway have done for the Far Eastern trade, the Transandine Railway is achieving for transcontinental traffic in South America by giving rapid communication between the two South American Republics--reducing the journey between Buenos Aires and Valparaiso from thirteen and a half days to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> hours--and thereby cementing closer commercial relations and developing trade with the Far East. This has only been made possible by the summit tunnel of the Transandine Railway, which was opened for public traffic in May, 1910, so that the distance between Buenos Aires and Valparaiso has been reduced to 888 miles. It is probably of interest to state that this tunnel is one of the longest of its kind in the world, being 10,384 feet long, including two artificial ends...", "...found there. On the whole, there seems to be less difference between the floras of Arctic and temperate latitudes in Upper Cretaceous than in Miocene times. In the same locality in Greenland (70deg 33' N. Lat. and 52deg W.

Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> ferns, fifteen belong to the genus Gleichenia now almost entirely tropical. There are four genera of cycads, and three extinct genera of conifers, besides Glyptostrobus and Torreya now found only in China and California, six species of true pines, and five of the genus Sequoia, one of which occurs also in Spitzbergen. The European deposits of the same age closely agree with these in their general character, conifers, cycads, and ferns forming the mass of the vegetation,...", "...from the apex of each minor arch of the window tracery of the spandrils, and are conclusive evidence that the date is considerably later. The stalls and misericords below are of two periods. In the earlier set of twenty-four the seats are polygonal; the armour depicted is that of the last half of the fourteenth century, and there are arms of donors who died respectively in 1380, 1400 and 1428; so that we may assign the approximate date of 1390 to this set of misericords. The remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> misericords have seats curved on plan, and, according to Mr Harrod, are not later than the middle of the fifteenth century. Now the canopies extend above both sets of misericords; the probability therefore is that they were put up together with the second set of misericords.

Many claimed that they had reached the utmost limit of sacrifice. Some said that the church ought to be fully satisfied if they could buy seats for the first services. Others strongly declared that after all the asking of God and man for aid to build the Temple they could not expect either God or man to help them to buy an unnecessary organ. Through <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years the church has never had any quarrel to settle in all its history, and that division of opinion did not assume an angry or excited phase. It was simply a feeling in some of the people that the Lord had done wonders and that, now that the church was out of the wilderness, it was full time to let the people and God's providence rest. When the question arose whether the church should venture to purchase a suitable church organ it was decided by a large majority that it...", "...owners in this manner, amounted to one hundred and nine thousand dollars.[54] [Sidenote: 1823.] This amount of money was duly appropriated by Congress. So far as we are informed, no member of the House of Representatives, or of the Senate, appears to have entertained doubts as to the propriety of this governmental slave-dealing. The whole negotiation and arrangement had been conducted and managed by Southern men, and Northern statesmen quietly submitted. Thus, after a struggle of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, the Slaveholders of Georgia, by the aid of our Federal Government, obtained compensation for the loss of their fugitive bondmen. After the distribution of the amount found due to the claimants, there yet remained in the hands of the President one hundred and forty-one thousand dollars, being the remainder of the two hundred and fifty thousand appropriated by the treaty to secure the payment of these claims. This money apparently belonged to the Indians. The...", "...Frances had never declared herself to be a Republican or a disbeliever, much less a rebel,--as, indeed, had neither Lord Hampstead. In the presence of her stepmother she was generally silent on matters of political or religious interest. But she was supposed to sympathise with her brother, and was known to be far from properly alive to aristocratic interests. There was never quarrelling between the two, but there was a lack of that friendship which may subsist between a stepmother of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> and a stepdaughter of twenty-one. Lady Frances was tall and slender, with quiet speaking features, dark in colour, with blue eyes, and hair nearly black. In appearance she was the very opposite of her stepmother, moving quickly and achieving grace as she did so, without a thought, by the natural beauty of her motions. The dignity was there, but without a thought given to it. Not even did the little lords, her brothers, chuck their books and toys about with less idea of...", "...county, Maryland, was the locality. At that time I had no premonition of my future life in a rebel prison, and if anyone had told me of the fourteen months which were to be spent mostly in such a manner I should have paid no attention whatever.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, until her recent death, on April 13, 1894, our life was as much of a honeymoon as it is possible for a well-mated couple to make it. I had learned the trade of a tailor, but other employment offered more inducements, and, on August 8, 1862, my occupation was that of postmaster at Blakesburg, Iowa, keeping a small general store in connection with the postoffice. On this date I enlisted with others, and we were sworn in at our place.

The largest continental force under arms, in any one year of the war, did not greatly exceed forty thousand men, and the largest British force, as late as 1781, including all arrivals, numbered, all told, but forty-two thousand and seventy-five men. The annual British average, including provincials, ranged from thirty-three to <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> thousand men. The physical agencies which Great Britain employed were;, therefore, far beneath the prestige of her accredited position among the nations; and the disparity between the contending forces was mainly in discipline and equipment, with the advantage to Great Britain in naval strength, until that was supplanted by that of France.

In December, 1863, joint resolutions for this great end had been introduced in the House by Hon. James M. Ashley of Ohio, and in the Senate by Hon. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts and Hon. J.B. Henderson of Missouri. Senator Trumbull of the Judiciary Committee, to whom the Senate resolutions were referred, reported a substitute for the amendment, which, in April, 1864, passed the Senate by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> to six; but reaching the House, June 15, it failed to get the necessary two-thirds vote and was defeated. At the next session of Congress the resolutions were again presented to the House, and after a protracted debate were passed (January 13, 1865) by a vote of one hundred and nineteen to fifty-six. Illinois was the first State to ratify the amendment; and others promptly followed. Lincoln was grateful and delighted. He remarked, \"This ends the job\"; adding, \"I feel proud...", "...half the crew down in their berths, doctorin' each other the best they might.

Another command on the Olympia's as the second stake boat was neared and the Olympia's crew was holding it at forty, a slip to tell, and the boats rounded the second stake-boat bows even.

By H.W. Henshaw, Chief of the Biological Survey. The main purpose of this circular is to direct the attention of cotton growers and others in the cotton growing states to the importance of birds in the boll weevil war, to emphasize the need of protection for them, and to suggest means to increase the numbers and extend the range of certain of the more important kinds. Investigations by the Biological Survey show that <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> species of birds eat boll weevils. While some eat them only sparingly others eat them freely, and no fewer than forty-seven adult weevils have been found in the stomach of a single cliff swallow. Of the birds known at the present time to feed on the weevil, among the most important are the orioles, nighthawks, and, foremost of all, the swallows (including the purple martin).

It must be observed, however, that the state of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere is very variable; that there is not the same quantity by night as by day, in moist weather as in dry; and that the higher strata of the atmosphere contain more of it than the lower, which may arise from a rapid absorption by the earth. \"Against the...", "...the people would not assemble till their arrival was announced, and said they 'were going out at this time, thinking they might meet me there.'

In this space, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> ice islands, great and small, were seen, besides loose ice in abundance, so that we were obliged to luff for one piece, and bear up for another, and as we continued to advance to the south, it increased in such a manner, that at three quarters past six o'clock, being then in the latitude of 67 deg. 15' S., we could proceed no farther; the ice being entirely closed to the south, in the whole extent from E. to W.S.W., without the least appearance of any opening.

Fourteen societies, represented by sixty-two delegates, were in attendance. President Edward Riley presided. The motion made at a previous meeting to invite Dr. Croke, Archbishop of Cashel, to lecture, in preference to having a street parade, was adopted by a vote of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> to six, and the convention adjoined, subject to the call of officers.

He is a good carpenter, a good cooper, a coarse shoemaker, a good hand at almost everything that is useful to us farmers.\"[47] Among the free negroes on the seaboard there was a special...", "...6 we had the machine on but eight different days, testing a number of changes which we had made since 1904....

Meanwhile, so much as remained of the Invincible Armada was buffeted to and fro by the resistless gale, like a shuttlecock between two invisible players. The monster left its bones on the iron-bound shore of Norway and on the granite cliffs of the Hebrides. Its course could be traced by its wrecks. Day followed day, and still God's wrath endured. On the 5th of August Admiral Oguendo, in his flag-ship, together with one of the great galliasses and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> other vessels, were driven by the fury of the tempest upon the rocks and reefs of Ireland, and nearly every soul on board perished. Of one hundred and thirty-four vessels which, gay with gold and amid triumphal shouts and loud music, had sailed from Corunna July 12th, only fifty-three battered and useless hulks returned to the ports of Spain. 86.

Leaving three men to keep the boat, the rest fell to killing birds, of which there were a prodigious quantity in the island.

Here then there was a pause. Though the zodiac continued to be swept by many observers, a period of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years went by before the fifth asteroid was found. The cycle of these discoveries strikingly illustrates the general movement of scientific progress. First there is a new departure; then a lull, and then a resumption of exploration and a finding more fertile than ever. It was on the night of the eighth of December, 1845, that the German astronomer Hencke discovered the fifth asteroid and named it Astraea. After a year and a half, namely, on the night of the first of July,...", "...were made almost immediately by William Cruickshank, in England, who discovered in experimenting with it that he could by its power electrolyze or chemically decompose the salts of certain metals in solution.

This observation was the first step in the process of electroplating, which is electrotyping when applied to the art of typography. In 1837, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years after Volta's discovery, Mr. Thomas Spencer of Liverpool, England, accidentally stumbled upon the first realization of the electrotyping process.

One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> naval officers of flag rank addressed to the prime minister a public protest against the Declaration. In the debate in the House of Lords the main objections to the Declaration were (1) that it made food stuffs conditional contraband instead of placing them on the free list, (2) that the clause permitting the seizure of conditional contraband bound for a fortified place or \"other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy\" would render all English ports...", "...The same on glass for the east window of the same church, 36 feet by 28.

In the summer of 1209 a great army of crusaders assembled at Lyons, and Southern France was invaded by a horde composed partly of religious fanatics, of men who were anxious to gain the indulgences awarded to crusaders without the danger of a journey overseas, and of men who were simply bent on plunder. The last stage in the development of the crusade movement was thereby reached: originally begun to recover [78] the...", "...I blame you for buying the one thing we want more than another, and then I take it from you and use it myself!

The greatest disappointment was in the Tartar bow which was brought expressly from Shansi, China, by my brother, Col. B. H. Pope. With this powerful weapon I expected to shoot a quarter of a mile; but with all its dreadful strength, its cast was slow and cumbersome. The arrow that came with it, a miniature javelin <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> inches long, could only be projected one hundred and ten yards. In making these shots both hands and feet were used to draw the bow. A special flight arrow thirty-six inches long was used in the test, but with hardly any increase of distance gained.

It was well known, at this time, that all the provinces of Spain had shaken off their allegiance to the mother country, and declared themselves independent. Carthagena, the...", "...of Candax, their fortress and colony, has been extended to the whole island, under the corrupt and modern appellation of _Candia_. The hundred cities of the age of Minos were diminished to thirty; and of these, only one, most probably Cydonia, had courage to retain the substance of freedom and the profession of Christianity. The Saracens of Crete soon repaired the loss of their navy; and the timbers of Mount Ida were launched into the main. During a hostile period of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, the princes of Constantinople attacked these licentious corsairs with fruitless curses and ineffectual arms. The loss of Sicily was occasioned by an act of superstitious rigor. An amorous youth, who had stolen a nun from her cloister, was sentenced by the emperor to the amputation of his tongue. Euphemius appealed to the reason and policy of the Saracens of Africa; and soon returned with the Imperial purple, a fleet of one hundred ships, and an army of seven...", "...succeeding Tirard Ministry was able to pass a law preventing simultaneous multiple candidacies, and impeached Boulanger, with some of his followers, before the Senate as High Court of Justice. Instead of facing trial, Boulanger and his satellites Dillon and Henri Rochefort fled from France. In August they were condemned in absence to imprisonment. Boulanger never returned to France, and with diminishing subsidies his following waned. The elections of 1889 resulted in the return of only <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> Boulangists and, when in September, 1891, Boulanger committed suicide in Brussels at the grave of his mistress, most Frenchmen merely gave a sigh of relief at the memory of the dangers they had experienced not so long before.

Returning to the cabin, he poured out the contents of one of the bags on the table, and proceeded to count the gold. It was a long job, and there was more money than the steward had ever before seen together. On a piece of paper he noted each hundred dollars with a tally-mark. His last pile contained but fifty dollars. Counting up his marks, he made thirty-eight of them; and the whole sum, according to his reckoning, was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> hundred and fifty dollars. The old man had lost four thousand dollars, and the steward, concluding he had made a mistake, performed the agreeable task of counting the gold a second time, but with the same result as before. After making the allowance for the fifty dollars found in the captain's state-room, the amount was one hundred dollars short. Mr. Ebenier had the impudence to ask himself if this could be the miser's money, since it did not hold out in the sum he had...", "...system on the Monongahela and Muskingum Rivers exerted a powerful influence in its favor, and for many years its adoption on the Ohio was urged patiently though unsuccessfully. At last the important matter was advocated with success, and in 1885 the first of a series of locks and movable dams was erected at Davis Island, four and one-half miles below Pittsburg. The work now is rapidly being completed, the plan being to give a minimum depth of six feet of water in the Ohio by means of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> dams and locks between Pittsburg and the mouth of the Great Miami, below Cincinnati. This form of improvement will of course be extended in time to the mouth of the Ohio.

From the reform of Hospital Nursing she turned, in conjunction with the late Mr. William Rathbone, to the reform of workhouse nursing.

In a biography the scale must be proportionate not to the number of the years, but to their richness in characteristic significance. After 1872, the year in which (as Miss Nightingale put it) she went \"out of office,\" her life was less full than theretofore in new activities. The germinant seeds had all been sown.

At the head of his crew he entered the embrasures, killing twenty-six out of its <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> defenders. Planting his colours on the wall, the men shouted \"_Vive le Roi!_\" with such unanimity and fierceness that at the very sound the whole garrison of the neighbouring fort at once surrendered, and forty-two men instantly laid down their arms. These successes were obtained with only forty-seven men--a mere handful being able to keep up in the rapid and headlong charge. Grammont, rallying his men, then placed garrisons in the forts, razed the embrasures, spiked the...", "...two men were despatched to the village of Sutranja, farther on the road, to see that no one was coming in the opposite direction, while another picket remained behind to prevent interruption from the rear.

One of the girls was a very handsome young woman, and Pancham, a Jemadar, wished to preserve her as a wife for his son. But when she saw her father and mother strangled she screamed and beat her head against the ground and tried to kill herself.

They first tried, however, to live cheaply in an old chateau on the lake of Arx, which they hired at a guinea a month; but the discomfort and difficulties were too great, and even the customary resources of reading and writing failed to induce them to remain in these circumstances.

He tramped on raw blisters; yet even this was easier than the fearful bruising his feet received on the water-rounded rocks of the Dyea Flats, across which the trail led for two miles. These two miles represented <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> miles of travelling. He washed his face once a day. His nails, torn and broken and afflicted with hangnails, were never cleaned. His shoulders and chest, galled by the pack-straps, made him think, and for the first time with understanding, of the horses he had seen on city streets.

The maximum height of the men was found to be 163.6 cm.; minimum 142.3 cm.; with an average of 154.7 cm. The cephalic indices showed 87.8 cm. as the maximum; 74 cm. the minimum; and 80.4 cm. the average. The greatest length-height index was 78.6 cm.; the minimum 62.4 cm. and the average 69.7 cm. From these measurements it appears that the Bila-an are somewhat shorter than the Bagobo; are more short headed, the...", "...stepped back into the cellar, where Mr. Marquand was turning over the treasure in an effort to find out if the pile extended all the way to the bottom of the chest. In the meantime Kris Kringle unbarred the door and threw it part way open. He did it cautiously, as if half expecting trouble. He threw the door to with a bang, springing to one side, and dropping the bar back into place. The reason for his sudden change of plans was that no sooner had the door opened than several <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> calibre bullets were fired from the sage brush outside. Kris Kringle waited to learn whether those in the cellar had heard the shots. But they had not. They were some distance below ground, and their minds were wholly taken up with the great treasure before them. After a few moments the guide once more removed the bar, first having drawn his revolver in case of sudden surprise. Then he cautiously opened the door an inch or so. At first nothing happened. The moonlit...", "...sat down, was not limpid. He understood naught of it. More than twenty years had passed since they had first met--he and a wistful little creature--at a historic town-hall dance. He could still see the wistful little creature in those placid and pure features, in that buxom body; but now there was a formidable, capable and experienced woman there too. Impossible to credit that the wistful little creature was thirty-seven! But she was! Indeed, it was very doubtful if she would ever see <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> again.

She was just neutral, polite, cheerful, and apparently conscious of perfection.

At thirty-eight by-elections contested by the Unionists since December, 1910, the Liberals have suffered a net loss of eight seats; and one of the contests lost was that in Midlothian, long the constituency represented by Gladstone, which returned, in September, 1912, a Conservative member for the first time in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years. There is a tradition that when a Liberal government is defeated in Midlothian the end of that government is not far distant. Prophecy in such matters, however, is futile. Meanwhile the Unionists continue to be divided upon the tariff, but in the main they are united in opposition to the overturning of the ancient constitutional system, although they no longer generally oppose a moderate reform of the House of Lords.

Here the sick were brought by their friends that they might, when they saw the waters bubble up, step in and be cured. They believed then an angel came down and made the moving of the waters, but it was probably one of the kind called intermittent springs. There is one at Jerusalem now called the \"Fountain of the Virgin\" which rises at certain times. Jesus saw the poor friendless man who had waited for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years for the chance of stepping into the waters when they were moving, and had been disappointed for others stepped in before him. Looking at him, He said, \"Wilt thou be made whole?\" The man explained why he could not be cured, for there was no man to help him. Then Jesus said, \"Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.\" He rose at once, and walked, carrying the mat on which he lay. The Jews were angry when they heard of it for the man had been cured on the Sabbath,...", "...yielding himself to the charm of mediaeval history and legend, Hawthorne drifted into a strange mode of life, virtually disappearing from the world for a dozen years and living in actual solitude. \"I have made a captive of myself,\" he wrote to Longfellow, \"and put me into a dungeon; and now I cannot find the key to let myself out.\" But the key was found. The appreciation of Elizabeth and Sophia Peabody and the deep affection for the latter acted as a spur to get him into active life. At <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> he married Sophia Peabody and took up courageously enough a life of poverty and hard literary work at Concord in the Old Manse, which had formerly been Emerson's home. There he came to know and value the friendship of Emerson, who we may well believe was the inspiration of the allegory of the Great Stone Face. In curious contradiction with his natural love for solitude, Hawthorne became interested in the experiment of communal life and spent the year before his marriage...", "...customs service, that marvellous organisation which is more impartially open to all the world than any other service in the world. As an example, I note that among the Commissioners of Customs at the ports of the River Yangtse alone, at the time of my voyage the Commissioner at Shanghai was an Austrian, at Kiukiang a Frenchman, at Hankow an Englishman, at Ichang a Scandinavian, and at Chungking a German. The Australian had been ten months at Chungking. His up-river journey occupied <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> days, and was attended with one moving incident. In the Hsintan rapid the towline parted, and his junk was smashed to pieces by the rocks, and all that he possessed destroyed. It was in this rapid that my boat narrowly escaped disaster, but there was this difference in our experiences, that at the time of his accident the river was sixty feet higher than on the occasion of mine.

At present all the Federal projects under way, though they involve 2,000,000 acres and $70,000,000 of expenditure, are in the Far West and on the Pacific Slope. The fundamental fact that the South is mainly agricultural is brought out by the statistics of occupations in 1900. The greater part of the population of both white and black races is on the soil. By the census of 1900, in sixteen states counted Southern, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> per cent of the population were bread-winners. Out of the total population of 23,000,000 there were 8,100,000 persons engaged in gainful occupations, of whom 814,000 were in large cities and the remaining 7,300,000 in small cities and the country. The rapid growth of towns and small cities is due to the prosperity of the open country; and hence the large city is less important and less likely to absorb the rural population than is the case in the North.

To this add the number of women infected, which, at thirty-eight daily, would amount to nearly thirteen thousand in the year, and a total of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> thousand will be presented, or nearly double the number assumed as a basis for remark. It is needless to advance farther reasons in support of the soundness of that opinion. Next in order will be the consideration of the amount of money prostitution costs the public.

But this he did in 1849, by settling in Weimar as conductor of the court theatre, his age then being <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years. V. Liszt closed his career as a virtuoso, and accepted a permanent engagement at Weimar, with the distinct purpose of becoming identified with the new school of music which was beginning to express itself so remarkably through Richard Wagner.

The Bienfaisant had the metal on her lower deck reduced.

After some time the crew were put on trial before Chief Justice Trott, and the attorney-general read to the court and jury a list of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> ships that Bonnet and Teach had captured in the last six months. The prisoners had no lawyers to defend them, but two very able lawyers to attack them, and the Chief Justice and the other judges, as well as the jury, were convinced that the crew of the _Royal James_ had beyond question been guilty of piracy.

A careful comparison of this kind, showing that in an entire month the average of the first week had been but one hundred and three drops, while the average of the last had been one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> drops, and that in the fifth week a frantic effort to abstain wholly for three days had obliged him to use on the fourth more than double the quantity to which of late he had been accustomed, would have prevented the incautious conclusion, suggested by his table, that De Quincey made use of laudanum but on two occasions after the expiration of the fourth week.

The Silurian rocks, lower and upper, which in these islands have their chief development in Wales, and which are nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> thousand feet thick; and the Devonian or Old Red sandstone beds, which in the Fans of Brecon and Carmarthenshire attain a thickness of ten thousand feet, must be passed through in an upward direction before we reach the bottom of that Carboniferous Limestone of which I spoke in my last paper. We thus find on the Cambrian rocks forty- five thousand feet at least of newer rocks, in several cases lying unconformably on each other, showing thereby that the lower beds...", "...conditions with unexpected flexibility.

After a player has passed, that is, won, on the same color two or three times consecutively, the croupier, to prevent any possible dispute, asks whether he wishes to risk the whole of the money down; if he intends to do so he employs the above cabalistic formula. Roulette is a very much more complicated affair; for this, a table is required with a basin in the centre, containing a spiral tube with an orifice at the top, through which the ball passes, and falls into one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> holes in the basin, which are respectively marked with figures, and alternately painted red and black. There are four projecting pieces of iron, one of which the croupier twirls, crying, \"Faites votre jeu, messieurs;\" when he says, \"Le jeu est fait, rien n'va plus,\" no more money can be put down.

It was a long and heavy work, for railway surveying was then a new art, and the appliances were all fresh and experimental; but in the end, Stephenson brought it to a happy conclusion, and struck at once the death-blow of the old road-travelling system. The line was opened successfully in 1825, and the engine started off on the inaugural ceremony with a magnificent train of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> vehicles. \"Such was its velocity,\" says a newspaper of the day, \"that in some parts the speed was frequently twelve miles an hour.\" The success of the Stockton and Darlington railway was so immense and unexpected, the number of passengers who went by it was so great, and the quantity of coal carried for shipment so far beyond anything the projectors themselves could have anticipated, that a desire soon began to be felt for similar works in other places.

It is barely fifty years since England refused the gift of the pictures that now constitute the Dulwich Gallery. So rapidly, however, did public opinion and taste become enlightened, that twenty-five years afterwards Parliament voted seventy-three thousand pounds for the purchase of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> pictures collected by Mr. Angerstein.

The story, thus explained, carries in it a greater appearance of truth, than what we read in Herodotus.

In the first place the difference in the gravitational pull on Mars being <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> one-hundredths to that of your Earth, obviates the necessity of supplying as much fuel to the human body as your physical make-up demands. In the second place the Martians partake of food to keep the body alive, and not for the vulgar pleasure afforded by the consumption of victuals.

Moreover the phrase \"this law\" is so ambiguous as to raise a much greater difficulty than that caused by the Greek mistranslation of the Hebrew word for \"copy.\" How much does \"this law\" include?

Some years after, this minister was called to another field of service.

In six months, there were sixty-nine conversions, and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> of them were business men of the town.

The captain of one of these boats, plying between Pittsburg and St. Louis, told Mr. Stevenson that \"under ordinary circumstances his safety valves were loaded with a pressure equal to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> pounds per square inch, but that the steam was occasionally raised as high as one hundred and fifty pounds to enable the vessel to pass parts of the river in which there is a strong current;\" and he added, by way of consolation, that \"this pressure was never exceeded except on _extraordinary occasions_!\" The dimensions and power of the Mississippi steamers may be collected from those of the St. Louis, a boat which was plying on that river in 1837. That vessel measured...", "...correspondent, for it is to her that Miss Evans mainly turns now for intellectual sympathy; to Mrs. Bray when she is in pain or trouble, and wants affectionate companionship; with Mr. Bray she quarrels, and the humorous side of her nature is brought out.

With all three it is a beautiful and consistent friendship, running like a thread through the woof of the coming <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years. For the next twelve years, as will be seen, it is quite the most important thread; and although later it naturally became very much less important, it was never dropped except for a moment, in 1854, owing to a brief misunderstanding of letters, which will appear in its due place. The following letters to Miss Sara Hennell show what was passing from 30th August, 1842, to April, 1843: [Sidenote: Letter to Miss Sara Hennell, 30th...", "...\"You hear a lot of that sort of stuff, Gilbert, and it's always about the other fellow!\" \"Well, that's what Dave Larned says, anyway.

Trow, tackle on that side, was boxed twice in succession; Roberts, right end, was bowled over and two rushes gained first down on the twenty-five-yard line. Coach Robey sped Holt in for Roberts and Holt managed to upset the next play for a yard gain.

The General Election of 1906 showed a notable increase in the number of three-cornered fights over previous general elections, and the bye-elections during the four years 1906--1909 were marked by a still further increase. The Report submitted by the Executive Committee of the Labour Party to the Portsmouth Conference in January 1909 foreshadowed a very large addition to the number of Labour candidates. Some <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> candidates, in addition to the then existing Labour members in Parliament, had been formally approved by the Executive Committee of the Labour Party after due election by the Labour organizations to which the candidates belonged, and although constituencies were not found for all of these new candidates, the number of three-cornered contests in the election of Jan. 1910, in which Liberal, Unionist, Labour (or Socialist) took part, was no less than forty-one, and this...", "...and the fetters of education are strong. The fact that the death--law is rendered almost inoperative by its very severity does not alter my belief in its righteousness. The fact that in England the proportion of executions to condemnations is one to sixteen, and in this country only one to twenty-two, and in France only one to thirty-eight, does not shake my steadfast confidence in the propriety of retaining the death-penalty. It is better to hang one murderer in sixteen, twenty-two, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> than not to hang any at all. Feeling as I do, I am not sorry that Ruloff is to be hanged, but I am sincerely sorry that he himself has made it necessary that his vast capabilities for usefulness should be lost to the world.

For it is plain that in the person of Ruloff one of the most marvelous of intellects that any age has produced is about to be sacrificed, and that, too, while half the mystery of its strange powers is...", "...convent. Such is the simple and genuine narrative of the fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of Justinian. That he was deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to beg his bread, \"Give a penny to Belisarius the general!\" is a fiction of later times, which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as a strange example of the vicissitudes of fortune. If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he enjoyed the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period of a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, and a life of eighty-three years. It would be difficult to trace the character of a prince who is not the most conspicuous object of his own times: but the confessions of an enemy may be received as the safest evidence of his virtues. The resemblance of Justinian to the bust of Domitian, is maliciously urged; with the acknowledgment, however, of a well-proportioned figure, a ruddy complexion, and a pleasing countenance. The emperor was easy of access, patient of...", "...being considerably increased by the contribution of some streams near this place, we descended very swiftly. Six miles below Pine Island, there is a strong but not a dangerous rapid; and about fifteen miles farther is Fort Simpson, the principal depot of the Hudson Bay Company for this department, at which we arrived by eight P.M., and thus escaped a very wet, comfortless night.

Just watch me!\" So, when the great beast of a French vessel came lumbering by, Wright played with her like a cat with a mouse; sailed around her in circles; shot guns at her rigging--just to aggravate the men from the sunny land--and then dipped his ensign and went careening away as if nothing had happened....", "...fetus; an ovum of about four weeks and of perfect formation was found adherent near the fundus.

She was tall and handsome, of a somewhat commanding presence, with a face which was capable, in repose, of looking a little stern; but when that same face was lit up by a smile, the heart of every girl in the school went out to her, and they thought no one else like her.

The impatient zeal of the Emperor Justinian in 526 led him to forcibly expel the remnant of the old philosophers from the ancient groves and porches of Athens. Seven followers of Proclus were obliged to find a retreat in Persia; but the Magi there were still more intolerant than the Christians. Philosophy found no resting-place; it found itself supplanted by a new faith, which now domineered over the human mind. Justinian governed the Roman Empire for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years (527-565), and great and curious events occurred in his time. The Empress Theodora was daughter of an official called the Master of the Bears, and took to the stage in her youth. Her forte was not to sing or dance or play on the flute, but to act in pantomime and buffoonery, her eyes being bright, and her agile and elegant form drawing down endless applause. She captivated the nephew of the Emperor Justin, young Justinian, whom she married, and she maintained an...", "...arches, porticoes, basilicae, but especially their thermae, or bathing-places.

His agent told me the Mormons had agreed to take two hundred and forty sets of his complete works in <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> volumes, the gross amount of which (not the net amount) would be about $40,000, if he would publish a certain kind of history of Utah. Since Bancroft is a millionaire, the Mormon offer was not very tempting.\" But H. H. Bancroft flatly denies that any such offer was made him, and the statement must clearly be pronounced untrue. And yet the person who made the published statement was one of the leading Christian men of Utah, desirous of disseminating nothing but the truth....", "...novel and interesting experiment has lately been successfully made by Mr A. Palmer, of Cheam, Surrey:--In July, 1842, he put one grain of wheat in a common garden-pot. In August the same was divided into four plants, which in three weeks were again divided into twelve plants. In September these twelve plants were divided into thirty-two, which in November were divided into fifty plants, and then placed in open ground. In July, 1843, twelve of the plants failed, but the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> were healthy. On the 19th August they were cut down, and counted 1,972 stems, with an average of fifty grains to a stem, giving an increase of 98,600. Now, if this be a practicable measure of planting wheat, it follows that most of the grain now used for seed may be saved, and will infinitely more than cover the extra expense of sowing, as the wheat plants can be raised by the labourer in his garden, his wife and children being employed in dividing and transplanting them....", "...enough, the only emotions they could call up were some vague, visionary sorrowings over his fallen and degraded condition. \"By Jove!\" said Dempsey, in a whisper to Darcy, \"the lieutenant has more sympathy for my grandfather than I have myself,--I 'll be hanged if he is n't wiping his eyes!

Of course (as the Canon points out with irrefragably literal accuracy in logic and law) the marriage being declared null _ab initio_ (for the cause most likely to suggest itself, though alleged after extraordinary delay), Diane and Honore were not sister- and brother-in-law at all, and no \"divorce\" or even...", "...is n't it?

P. 100. 25. _Since first this subject_: Milton, as has been seen, had meditated, as early as 1638, an epic poem to be based on legendary British history, with King Arthur for its hero, a subject which it appears he abandoned in the course of two or three years. While still undecided, he jotted down ninety-nine different subjects, sixty-one Scriptural, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> from British history. Among the former, 'Paradise Lost' appears first of all. These jottings occupy seven pages of the Cambridge MSS. It is evident that by 1640, Milton was quite decided as to the subject of 'Paradise Lost,' but not as to the form of his work. It was first as a tragedy that he conceived it, on the model of the Grecian drama with choruses.

THE NONNE PREESTES TALE. This is the best specimen of our author's humour. An early version of the Tale occurs in a short fable by Marie de France, afterwards amplified in the old French Roman du Renart. The fable by Marie de France consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> short lines, and is printed in Dr. Furnivall's Originals and Analogues (Chaucer Society), p. 116, from MS.

The corresponding portion of Le Roman de Renart, as edited by Meon in 1826, vol. i. p. 49, is also printed in the same, p. 117; it comprises 454 lines (ll. 1267-1720), and contains the account of the cock's dream about a strange beast, and other particulars of which Chaucer makes some use.

The same fate awaited a motion made by Mr. Hobhouse, for the repeal of the window-tax; and likewise a motion for the repeal of the duties on soap and candles. A more than ordinary share of the time of the members was occupied this year in the consideration of private bills. So great was the passion for joint-stock companies, and so abundant the capital ready to seek employment in schemes of local improvement, &c, that four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> petitions for private bills were presented, and two hundred and eight-six private acts were passed. PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT. Parliament was prorogued on the 6th of July by commission.

The Directors have satisfied themselves of this very important fact, by personally attending an experiment (accompanied by several gentlemen, among whom was a very eminent practical mechanic), on which occasion the 'North Star' took a train of carriages, calculated for 166 passengers, and loaded to 43 tons, to and from Maidenhead, at a mean average speed of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> miles per hour, the maximum being forty-five miles per hour, consuming only 0.95, or less than 1 lb. of coke per net ton per mile, instead of 2.76, say 2-3/4 lbs., as previously shown.

Here he found Merrick, a big, pleasant man of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> or so. He was very glad to see Hewitt, but was a great deal puzzled as to the results of the morning's work on the wreck.

CHAPTER VII. THE ROUGH RIDER When Roosevelt returned to Washington in March, 1897, to take up his duties as a subordinate officer in the National Government, he was <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years old; a man in the prime of life, with the strength of an ox, but quick in movement, and tough in endurance. A rapid thinker, his intellect seemed as impervious to fatigue as was his energy.

His career thus far had prepared him for the highest service.

Of his master, the great emperor, it is not for me to speak since to this day his works speak for him. The <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years of his reign are the most brilliant period of the later Roman empire, and if the military triumphs he conceived were the work of Belisarius and Narses we must attribute to him alone the magnificent conception, the tireless energy, and the heroic purpose which established the great pillars of the _Corpus Juris Civilis_ which is the legal foundation of mediaeval and of modern Europe, the basis of all Canon Law and of all Civil Law in every civilised country.

Although the audiencia was subsequently abolished for a few years, it was re-established in 1598 and these articles were again utilized. It is therefore worth while to notice the most important provisions of the law of establishment, which was to serve as a foundation for the audiencia during a period of approximately three hundred years. The first <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> sections were devoted to the creation of the tribunal, to a definition of its jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases, and to a determination of the proper method of procedure in them. The audiencia was to have authority to try cases of appeal from gobernadores, alcaldes mayores, and other magistrates of the provinces; it also had jurisdiction over civil cases appealed from the alcaldes ordinarios of the city and original jurisdiction over all criminal cases arising...", "...you in the Rue de la Victoire.

Thereupon he returned to the forest, and told the thieves he had made sure of the house, and had made a plan such that at last he was certain he could not mistake it. And first he ordered them to divide into small parties, and go into the neighboring towns and villages and buy nineteen mules and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> large leather jars to carry oil, one of which must be full, and all the others empty. In the course of two or three days the thieves returned, and the Captain made one of his men enter each jar, armed as he thought necessary. Then he closed the jars as if each were full of oil, leaving, however, a small slit open to admit air. Things being thus disposed, the mules were laden with the thirty-seven thieves, each concealed in a jar, and the jar that was filled with oil;...", "...INVASION.

(called from the place of his death Nial of Callan), reigned thirteen years; Malachy I. succeeded (A.D. 845), and reigned fifteen years; Hugh VII. succeeded and reigned sixteen years (dying A.D. 877); Flan (surnamed Flan of the Shannon) succeeded at the latter date, and reigned for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, far into the tenth century. Of these six kings, whose reigns average twenty years each, we may remark that not one died by violence, if we except perhaps Nial of Callan, drowned in the river of that name in a generous effort to save the life of one of his own servants. Though no former princes had ever encountered dangers equal to these--yet in no previous century was the person of the ruler so religiously respected.

On the 6th of March, 1889, a band of men, some of whom were militia from Chiengmai, came and occupied Tahwepon, the chief ferry on the Salween in Mawkmai territory, and hoisted the elephant flag of Siam, claiming the whole of the borderland lying east of the river for the King of Siam. The position of Eastern Karenni has been explained in the chapter concerning events in that country. The people are numerous and all Karen. In the <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> villages in which they live there are neither Shans nor Laos. The territory had been for many years in the hands of the Karenni chief, and was colonized by his people, just as the two districts north of it had been colonized by Mawkmai. It formed the most profitable portion of the Karenni State, by reason of its extensive and valuable teak forests. The capital required to work the timber was found by British subjects from Moulmein, the Karennis furnishing the labour.

This theory set no limits to the age of love, so we struck out, in all good faith, into a boundless sea.

Whereupon, as if released on either side from some kind of vague fear, our confidences came thick and fast, when we found that we were in the same confraternity of love. It was which of us should overtop the other in sentiment. One of us had traveled six hundred miles to see his mistress for an hour. The other, at the risk of being shot for a wolf, had prowled about her park to meet her one night.

Of the neighbouring ladies Tatyana Borissovna sees very little; they do not care about going to see her, and she does not know how to amuse them; the sound of their chatter sends her to sleep; she starts, tries to keep her eyes open, and drops off again. Tatyana Borissovna is not fond of women as a rule. One of her friends, a good, harmless young man, had a sister, an old maid of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> and a half, a good-natured creature, but exaggerated, affected, and enthusiastic. Her brother had often talked to her of their neighbour. One fine morning our old maid has her horse saddled, and, without a word to any one, sallies off to Tatyana Borissovna's. In her long habit, a hat on her head, a green veil and floating curls, she went into the hall, and passing by the panic-stricken Vasya, who took her for a wood-witch, ran into the drawing-room.

The central window (by Kempe) is to the memory of Benjamin Thomas Moore, for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years churchwarden, who died in 1896. Though detail of a most elaborate kind fills the window, yet in appearance it is rather thin, a quality which the clear, strong light that shines upon it as a rule somewhat accentuates. In the central light is St. Faith, to whom this chapel is often ascribed, with St. Agnes on the left and St. Cecilia on the right. There are two other windows, one of four lights and the other of three. By standing at the entrance to this chapel the...", "...with bread. The captain of the temple was on duty with his guards.

Here he met his outfit, <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> Indian guides, all of them experts in camp life and cunning in the secrets of stream and wood. In the care of these high priests of sport, he left civilization, in the shape of the launch, behind him, and in a canoe fished down stream until the lovely reaches of Split-rock were attained; here, on the banks of the stream, amid the thick ranks of spruce, the camp was pitched.

In two minutes he was surrounded by <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> monkeys, which leaped and capered around like so many dogs as he held the sugar cake up in the air before them. It was a novel sight. These monkeys are fed regularly at the expense of the Jains, and none of God's creatures is too insignificant or irritating to escape their comprehensive benevolence. One of the temples of the Jains, the Swamee Narayan, as they call it, on the outskirts of the city, is considered the noblest modern sacred building in all India. It is a...", "...the recension of Q used by Matthew as containing about two hundred and sixty-seven verses, or parts of verses. Of these ninety-eight are so closely parallel to Luke as to be marked simply Q. Eighty-nine, paralleled in Luke, but with divergences such as to indicate a different wording in the source that lay before Matthew and Luke and eighty without any parallels in Luke, are assigned to QMt. The recension of Q used by Luke, according to our analysis, contained about two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> verses or parts of verses. Of these, ninety-four are closely enough paralleled in Matthew to be assigned simply to Q; eighty-one are paralleled in Matthew, but with such differences as to suggest different wording in the source; and sixty-three are peculiar to Luke. It is not to be assumed that all of Q is reproduced in either Matthew or Luke. But from the treatment accorded to Mark by Matthew and Luke, respectively, it is to be expected that Matthew would omit less of...", "...a good vintage becomes a rare old wine. \"About thirty-five years.\" \"By the Lord!\" cried Campbell. \"It never fails--a strong man knows his liquor like a book! You're almost right. Add three years and you have it! Thirty-eight years in sunshine and shadow!\" He leaned back and gazed dreamily up to the ceiling. \"Think of it,\" he went on in a reverent murmur. \"Men have been born and grown strong and then started toward the shady side of life since this wine was put in the bottle. For <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years it has been gathering and saving its perfume--draw a breath of it now, lad!--and when I uncork the bottle, all the odor blows out to me at once.\" \"True,\" said Harrigan, nodding sagely. \"I've thought the same thing, but never found the words for it, chief.\" \"Have you?\" asked Campbell eagerly. \"Sit down, lad; sit down! Well, well! Good wine was put on earth for a blessing, but men have misused it, Harrigan--but hear me preaching when I ought to be praying!\"...", "...the good life of her bishops and priests is essential for the good of society in general; that the perfect orthodoxy of her creed is the dearest possession, the pillar and safeguard, of his own government. Heresy and schism are, in his sight, the greatest crimes against the State, as they are the greatest sins against the Church and against God. In the course of the two hundred years from Constantine to Justinian the Roman State, as understood by the Illyrian peasant who ruled it for <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> years, had intertwined itself as closely with the Catholic Church as ever it had with Cicero's \"immortal gods\" in the time of Augustus, or Trajan, or Decius. It was the special pride and glory of Justinian to maintain intact this alliance as the palladium of the empire. And, therefore, his legislation touched every part of the ecclesiastical government, every dogma of the Church's creed, and only on account of this alliance did the Church acquiesce in such a legislation. I...", "...the weather being thick, and it raining very hard, I brought-to. Our latitude was now 51 deg.S. and longitude 63 deg. 22' W. On Monday the 14th, the weather having cleared up, and the wind shifted to the S.S.W. we steered along the short S.E. by E. four miles, and saw a low flat island full of high tufts of grass, resembling bushes, bearing south, at the distance of two or three leagues, the northernmost land at the same time bearing west, distant about six leagues: We had here <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> fathom, with rocky ground. We continued our course along the shore six leagues farther, and then saw a low rocky island hearing S.E. by E. distant about five miles: Here we brought-to, and having sounded, we had forty fathom water, with a bottom of white sand. This island is about three leagues distant from the land we were coasting, which here forms a very deep bay, and beats E. by N. of the other island on which we had seen the long tufts of grass: We saw the sea break...", "...in North Africa,--by Gelasius[605], bp. of Rome (492),--by Cassiodorus[606] in Southern Italy,--by Gregory the Great[607], and by other Fathers of the Western Church. To this it is idle to object that the authors cited all wrote in Latin. For the purpose in hand their evidence is every bit as conclusive as if they had written in Greek,--from which language no one doubts that they derived their knowledge, through a translation. But in fact we are not left to Latin authorities. [Out of <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> copies of the Bohairic version the _pericope de adultera_ is read in fifteen, but in three forms which will be printed in the Oxford edition. In the remaining twenty-three, it is left out.] How is it intelligible that this passage is thus found in nearly half the copies--except on the hypothesis that they formed an integral part of the Memphitic version? They might have been easily omitted: but how could they have been inserted? Once more. The Ethiopic version (fifth...", "...name brand electric razors as well. The trade name company does nothing except market the product. Its budget, by the way, calls for an expenditure of six dollars on every razor for national advertising.\" \"Well, what are you getting at?\" Tracy said impatiently. Frederic Flowers had reached his punch line. \"All right, we've traced the razor all the way back to the manufacturing complex which made it. Mr. Tracy, that razor you bought at a discount bargain for twenty-five dollars cost <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> cents to produce.\" Tracy pretended to be dumfounded. \"I don't believe it.\" \"It can be proven.\" Frank Tracy thought about it for a while. \"Well, even if true, so what?\" \"It's a crime, that's so-what,\" Flowers blurted indignantly. \"And that's where Freer Enterprises comes in. Very shortly, we're going to enter the market with an electric razor retailing for exactly one dollar. No name brand, no advertising, no nothing except a razor just as good as though selling...", "...character of the commissioners, their notaries and the familiars and, soon after this, in 1706, the Suprema asserted that, in Castile, there was not one fourth of the number permitted by the Concordia of 1553, which it attributed partly to the War of Succession then raging and partly to the molestation to which they were exposed.[796] Unquestionably the number declined rapidly during the eighteenth century, as will be seen by the table in the Appendix where, although Saragossa still has <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> and Barcelona twenty-eight, the other tribunals report only from two to seven, except the Canaries, where the scattered group of islands necessarily demanded a considerable number. This diminution may be explained by the growing habit of appointing temporary commissioners in any place where work was to be done. Moreover the increasing facilities of communication favored local centralization in the tribunal, even as general centralization was stimulated in the Suprema....", "...immediately adjoined the palace and rudimentary alleys and avenues stretched off towards the wood. Although designed by Boyceau, this work was actually executed by his nephew, Jacques de Menours, who, with difficulty, collected his pay. His books of account showed that in five years, from 1631 to 1636, he had drawn but once a year a sum varying from fifteen hundred to four thousand _livres_ while in the same period the king had spent on the rest of the work at Versailles two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">thirty-eight</span> thousand _livres_, thirty-two _sols_, six _deniers_, nearly one million one hundred thousand francs of the money of to-day. The first of the outdoor embellishments of the palace at Versailles is the great Cour Royale, or the Cour d'Honneur, which opens out behind the long range of iron gates facing upon the Place d'Armes. At the foot of this entrance court is an extension called the Cour de Marbre. This Cour de Marbre, on January 5, 1757, was the scene of the infamous..."]
