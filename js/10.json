All of these letters were written during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years of his life. Many of them were to long-time friends, a Carmelite sister and a sister at a nearby convent. One or both of these friends were from his native village, perhaps relatives. The first letter was probably written to the prioress of one of these convents. The second letter was written to Brother Lawrence's own spiritual adviser. Note that the fourth letter is written in the third person where Brother Lawrence describes his own experience. The letters follow the...", "...esteemed among the sages and bards of Israel, that they often use them in their literary and poetical compositions. The Machzorim, or the Jewish Liturgies for the festivals, are full of compositions where the first letters of the sentences follow the order of either the \"Atbash\" or \"Tashrak.\" The latter is simply a reversed order of the alphabet. THE REAL KABBALAH The \"Real Kabbalah\" consists of theoretical and practical mysteries. 1. The theoretical mysteries treat about the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> spheres, the four worlds, the essence and various names of God and of angels, also of the celestial hierarchy and its influences and effects on this lower world, of the mysteries of creation, of the mystical chariot described by the Prophet Ezekiel, of the different orders and offices of angels and demons, also of a great many other deep subjects, too deep for comprehension. 2. The practical Kabbalah is a branch of the theoretical, and treats of the practical use of the...", "...was quick and snatchy, as if every inspiration and expiration pained the lungs.

His next active service, still under Trenck, was in the Silesian mountains in 1745, in which campaign he greatly distinguished himself as a leader of light troops. He was present also at Soor. He retired shortly afterwards, owing to his distaste for the lawless habits of his comrades in the irregulars, and after long waiting in poverty for a regular commission he was at last made a captain in one of the frontier regiments, spending the next <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years in half-military, half-administrative work in the Carlstadt district. At Bunich, where he was stationed, he built a church and planted an oak forest now called by his name.

He was in grievous agonies of spirit; his former sins stared him in the face, and made him tremble. The poison of God's arrows did even drink up his spirits; the sense of sin and of wrath were so great that he knew not what to do.

In 1762 Johann Christian Bach, the eleventh son of Sebastian, came to London, and the friendship between him and Abel led, in 1764 or 1765, to the establishment of the famous concerts subsequently known as the Bach and Abel concerts. For <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years these were organized by Mrs Comelys, whose enterprises were then the height of fashion. In 1775 the concerts became independent of her, and were continued by Abel unsuccessfully for a year after Bach's death in 1782. At them the works of Haydn were first produced in England. After the failure of his concert undertakings Abel still remained in great request as a player on various instruments new and old, but he took to drink and thereby hastened his death.

From the foregoing statement is will be evident, that the future increase in the stock will be still more prodigious, and still more considerably outstrip the advance of population.

Of what will be their probable value in ten years more, it may enable us to form no very inaccurate estimate, by referring to what it was <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years back. In 1808, a cow and calf were sold by public auction for L105, and the price of middling cattle was from L80 to L100. A breeding mare was at the same period worth from 150 to 200 guineas, and ewes from L10 to L20. These immense prices, however, were the result of monopoly, and consequently in a great measure fictitious; for in 1810, two years after this, a herd of fine cattle were sold for L13 per head.

I give these distances as they would be measured on earth. We decided to start at once. We took nothing with us. The journey would be a short one, and we could easily return at some future time for what we had left behind. We needed no food for so short a trip, and plenty of water was at hand. Only one thing Miela would not part with--the...", "...of that valley.

You may remember that Joliet made report of such a possibility there.

At several points, streams of water were tumbling more than a thousand feet from crag to crag, and falling into the river in broken sheets.

We rowed nearly under it, when one of our men took his rifle and fired, and down came the eagle, striking the water not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet from the boat. A wing had been broken, and we dispatched him with our oars; he measured over seven feet from tip to tip of the wings. Round this point the water is sometimes very rough.

If not, however, I only regret the circumstances, and must abide the consequences.\" When fighting men use fighting language they invite a challenge. Hamilton's excessively polite regret that \"he must abide the consequences\" simply meant fight, as his language had for a space of five years. A challenge was sent by the hand of Pendleton. Hamilton accepted. Being the challenged man (for duelists are always polite), he was given the choice of weapons. He chose pistols at <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> paces. At seven o'clock on the morning of July Eleventh, Eighteen Hundred Four, the participants met on the heights of Weehawken, overlooking New York Bay. On a toss Hamilton won the choice of position and his second also won the right of giving the word to fire. Each man removed his coat and cravat; the pistols were loaded in their presence. As Pendleton handed his pistol to Hamilton he asked, \"Shall I set the hair-trigger?\" \"Not this time,\" replied Hamilton. With pistols...", "...the king--the life of the royal family--the rights of the people--the purity of the Revolution--it was at once firm and calm, efficacious and legitimate.

In the examination of the witnesses he showed great tact, and successfully kept from the jury facts which would have left them no excuse for a verdict of acquittal. But it was in his address that his great powers made themselves manifest. The opening was impassioned and powerful. Scarcely had he spoken <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes before the Bench, the Bar, the jury, and the audience were in tears, and, during the entire speech, so entirely did he control the feelings of every one who heard him, that the sobs from every part of the courtroom were audible above the sounds of his voice.

Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> new cardinals then created, _nine_ were Frenchmen, and in all his acts the new pope manifested himself the obedient slave of the French monarch.

The census of 1905 showed over twelve billion dollars invested in factories and nearly five and one half million wage earners employed.

At the close of the Civil War about 3000 tons of Bessemer steel were produced annually, but within twenty years over two million tons were put out every twelve months. The building of railways more than kept pace with the growth of the population and the increase in manufacturing.

The natives, who had wrested Ahii from its former owners, had followed up their success in driving off the invaders by paying a return visit to Ni Atong.

Accordingly <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> large canoes set out on an expedition to raid the white men's dwelling. Arriving within sight of the peak of the island, they kept in the offing till night, then with torches blazing aloft they found the passage into the lagoon, and, paddling rapidly, landed on the beach below the settlement. Thereupon three hundred powerful savages, armed with club, bow, spear, and knife, and bearing torches, began the ascent of the path that led to the three terraces.

He had had <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> pounds from Pryer only a day or two before he was apprehended, of which between seven and eight were in his purse when he entered the prison. This money was restored to him on leaving. He had always paid cash for whatever he bought, so that there was nothing to be deducted for debts. Besides this, he had his clothes, books and furniture. He could, as I have said, have had 100 pounds from his father if he had chosen to emigrate, but this both Ernest and I (for he brought me...", "...names and intertwined lettering, arabesque masterpieces of penknife-ingenuity, with a general preponderance of feminine appellatives, bold incisures, at times, of some worthy professor in profile,--the whole besmutched with ink, and dotted with countless punctures, the result of the sharp spike with which every student's ink-horn is armed, that he may steady it upon the slanting board.

After retiring to the drawing-room she looked anxiously for the arrival of the gentlemen. Her father and Mr Ripley entered together.

The movement attracted a good deal of interest in the State. The College was in control of the Unitarians exclusively, and it was far from prosperous. The final change of the Board of Overseers gave a popular character to the institution, and it was one of the elements of its recent prosperity. For the moment the managers of the College were very hostile to me, but in the course of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years all feeling had disappeared, and I enjoyed the friendship of Presidents Sparks, Felton, and Walker. The College conferred upon me the degree of LL.D. in 1851. That honor had no significance as it was given to every person who was elected Governor and that without regard to his learning, attainments, or services.* Subsequently, however, I was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences by the votes of those who were controlling the College.

Finding that the enemy was in pursuit of him at all points, Wilder next moved to Tantalon and Anderson with detachments of his command, but was compelled to retire, as these points were strongly guarded by heavy forces of the enemy's infantry.

The rigour of the old regime was apparently modified by giving the young lady a chance to refuse.

But all babies do not know how to play with them. They find out for themselves a good many ways of playing with them but here are some of the ways that a baby I used to know got amusement out of his. The very first was the play called \"Ta-ra-chese\" (Ta-rar-cheese). It is a Dutch word and there was a little song about it all in Dutch. This is the way the baby I knew would play it when he was a tiny little fellow. His Mamma...", "...But the performances of Dr. Tanner, the forty-day faster, and the writings of Dr. Dewey and others on the fasting cure, together with the experiments of numberless people who have fasted from forty to sixty days, have shown that man's ability to live without food is vastly greater than had been supposed. Any person, properly educated, can fast from twenty to forty days with little loss in weight, and often with no apparent loss of strength at all. The people who starved to death in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days or less did so because they believed that death was inevitable; an erroneous physiology had given them a wrong thought about themselves. When a man is deprived of food he will die in from ten to fifty days, according to the way he has been taught; or, in other words, according to the way he thinks about it. So you see that an erroneous physiology can work very mischievous results. No Science of Being Well can be founded on current physiology; it is not sufficiently exact in...", "...to look,--and there they were still; and he had his arm round her, and her head was on his shoulder, and----\" \"Oh, Nolly!\" says Dorothy, hastily. \"Well, it wasn't my fault, was it? _I_ had nothing to do with it.

I gave 'em <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes; quite sufficient law, I think. If they couldn't get it over in that time, they must have forgotten their native tongue. Besides, I wanted to get down; the forked seat in the laurel was not all my fancy had painted it in the beginning, and how was I to know when they were gone unless I looked?

They would be ready to set off in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days from the time of his writing, to pay their visits in Hampshire and Berkshire, and he would prefer coming to Chawton first.

These marks along the line of the route may easily be missed in fog, if they are not close enough together; and if one thus gets out of the line, there is a danger of not picking it up again. According to this new arrangement we therefore marked this depot in 80\u00b0 S. with high bamboo poles carrying black flags. We used twenty of these -- <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> on each side of the depot. Between each two flags there was a distance of 984 yards (900 metres), so that the distance marked on each side of the depot was five and a half miles (nine kilometres). Each bamboo was marked with a number, so that we should always be able to tell from this number on which side the depot lay, and how far off.

There had long been established between Sasha and her uncle a tacit compact, to take turns in sitting with the patient.

Baker, secretary of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, to whom we are indebted for the specimen presented here, captured this bird at Micco, Brevard Co., Florida, in April, 1889. He says he found a peculiar parasite in the brain of the Anhinga. The Anhingas consist of but one species, which has a representative in the warmer parts of each of the great divisions of the earth. The number seen together varies from eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> to several hundred. The hair-like feathers on the neck form a sort of loose mane. When asleep the bird stands with its body almost erect. In rainy weather it often spends the greater part of the day in an erect attitude, with its neck and head stretched upward, remaining perfectly motionless, so that the water may glide off its plumage. The fluted tail is very thick and beautiful and serves as a propeller as well as a rudder in swimming.

At this banquet the King and Queen attend the first year after their coronation; it is given at the expense of the City, and it generally costs from eight to <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand pounds; but when the City entertained the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV., and the allied Sovereigns in 1814, it cost twenty thousand pounds. On all other Lord Mayor's days the expense is borne by the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs, the former paying half, and the latter one-fourth each; the Mayor's half generally averaging from twelve to fourteen hundred pounds. \"The next morning the new Lord Mayor enters upon the duties of his office.

After my release it was necessary for me to do something at once to get money. It never entered my mind to borrow. It will be interesting to the reader to know what I did, after my prison days were past, to make a \"quick raise.\" Sixteen months of imprisonment slipped away. I regained my liberty on Monday. I received my five dollars and immediately started for my home, in Atchison. On my arrival, Monday night, I had four dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> cents. On Tuesday morning I went to the proprietor of the Opera House, in Atchison, and inquired how much money was necessary to secure the use of the building for the next evening. \"Fifty dollars,\" was his reply. I gave him all the money I had, and persuaded him to trust me for the rest. I informed him that I was going to deliver a lecture on my prison life. He asked if I thought anybody would come to hear a convict talk. In answer, I told him that was the most important question...", "...with all her charming qualifications; for they only made her own daughters appear more hateful.

The poor girl slept in the garret, upon a wretched straw mattress, whilst the bed-chambers of her sisters were furnished with every luxury and elegance, and provided with mirrors, in which they could survey themselves from head to foot.

The eyes of Apleon flashed with a curious pride as he saw the great white flag break in the air, while a smile, diabolical as Hell itself, curled his lips.

Madame Minoret-Levrault, who kept an eye on the upholsterer and architect as if her own property was concerned, found out, through the indiscretion of a young man sent to arrange the books, that the doctor was taking care of a little orphan named Ursula. The news flew like wild-fire through the town. At last, however, towards the middle of the month of January, 1815, the old man actually arrived, installing himself quietly, almost slyly, with a little girl about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> months old, and a nurse. \"The child can't be his daughter,\" said the terrified heirs; \"he is seventy-one years old.\" \"Whoever she is,\" remarked Madame Massin, \"she'll give us plenty of tintouin\" (a word peculiar to Nemours, meaning uneasiness, anxiety, or more literally, tingling in the ears).

The next day was Sunday, sacred to a halt; but there was no fodder for the animals, and we were obliged to march to Dras, following, where possible, the course of the river of that name, which passes among highly-coloured and snow-slashed mountains, except in places where it suddenly finds itself pent between walls of flame- coloured or black rock, not <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet apart, through which it boils and rages, forming gigantic pot-holes. With every mile the surroundings became more markedly of the Central Asian type. All day long a white, scintillating sun blazes out of a deep blue, rainless, cloudless sky. The air is exhilarating.

He said, 'Pennant has greater variety of inquiry than almost any man, and has told us more than perhaps one in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand could have done, in the time that he took. He has not said what he was to tell; so you cannot find fault with him, for what he has not told. If a man comes to look for fishes, you cannot blame him if he does not attend to fowls.'

I thought the matter ended, when I was told in reply that my niece would stay till the end of May and that Hulsen would undertake to announce the opera six times during the first month.

We called it \"scroof.\" About <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> o'clock the preparations for the big dinner began. We had meat once a week. At least it was the plan to have it so often. Of course there were times when the plan didn't work, but when it did Sunday was meat day. The word \"meat\" was never used. It was \"kitchen\" or \"beef.\" Both words meant the same thing, and bacon might be meant by either of them.

In 1873, Congress made gold the exclusive money standard. Silver depreciated some <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> per cent., and the \"hard money\" people opposed the measures that were set on foot to remonetize silver; that is, to bring it into circulation again. Such a bill was passed, then vetoed by the President, promptly repassed over his veto, and it was ordered that the coinage of silver should proceed at a rate not to exceed $2,000,000 a month. About this time (December 18, 1878), gold and paper money for the first time in seventeen years was of equal value.

In this dilemma, Xenophon, the historian of the expedition, was raised to a principal command; and by admirable skill he led back the army by a different route to the Black Sea, on the coast of which he knew that there were Grecian colonies: and from one of these he obtained shipping, in which he coasted along (when he did not march by land) to the mouth of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. This was the famous retreat of the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand; and it shows how much defect of literary skill there was in those days amongst Grecian authors, that the title of the book, _The Going Up_, does not apply to the latter and more interesting seven-eighths of the account. The Going Up is but the preparation or preface to the Going Down, the _Anabasis_ to the _Katabasis_, in which latter part it is that Xenophon plays any conspicuous part.

When reckoned upon the numbers on hand in 1796 when the plantation with 470 slaves was operating with very little outside help, these losses, which must be replaced by new purchases if the scale of output was to be maintained, amounted to about L900.

The whole thing did not occupy more than <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes.\" More than thirty per cent. of the battalion was put out of action. Finally, to show what a serious imposition this constant cloud gas attack was upon the German Army, we will quote from the Special Correspondent of the _Vossiches Zeitung_. He said: \"I devote a special chapter to this plague of our Somme warriors. It is not only when systematic gas attacks are made that they have to struggle with this devilish and intangible foe.\" He refers to the use of gas shell,...", "...said Jane despondently, \"because, of course, places like that are never to be got.\" Then they stepped out on to the platform of Selsdon Bois Station, where a man was busily pasting up a bill.

Two of the three whom the Admiral was bringing back, swam ashore at night. \"The Admiral cared for this but little, thinking that he should have enough interpreters among those whom he had left in the island, and whom he hoped to find there again.\" It seems certain that one Indian remained faithful to the Spaniards; he was named Diego Colon, after the Admiral's...", "...much to their fertility, that no less than five generations succeed each other in the interval.

I was both surprised and provoked at the fellow's obstinate persistence, for we made abrupt ascents and descents over ground of a very break-neck character, and traversed the edge of precipices, where a slip of the horse's feet would have consigned the rider to certain death.

By persuasion and by promise of reward, the \"Colbert of New France\" interested the prominent citizens of Quebec in modest industrial enterprises of every sort. But the outcome soon belied the intendant's airy hopes. It was easy enough to make a brave start in these things, especially with the aid of an initial subsidy from the treasury; but to keep the wheels of industry moving year after year without a subvention was an altogether different thing. A colony numbering less than <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand souls did not furnish an adequate market for the products of varied industries, and the high cost of transportation made it difficult to export manufactured wares to France or to the West Indies with any hope of profit. A change of tone, moreover, soon became noticeable in Colbert's dispatches with reference to industrial development.

In fact, they were all too much afraid of him to relish the idea of having him for an enemy. They therefore told him that he had done right in defending his house against the mob, and that if they had been in his place they would have shot a dozen instead of one. With the four hundred dollars in his pocket, Ben was feeling in such good humor that he bought <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> gallons of whiskey and ten boxes of cigars, all of which he distributed among the crowd. Of course they swore that he was the best fellow alive, after that. Any man would be the best fellow alive who would furnish the gang ten gallons of whiskey and ten boxes of cigars.

There are many pointed examples of the direct method, and we will glance at the case of salicylic acid.

In 1903 the United States possessed five manufacturers of this product. In <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years' time three of these had failed, and one of the survivors was a mere branch of a German house. During this fatal ten years, the product was being sold in that country at a price twenty-five per cent. lower than in Germany.

Helen May remained by the post, but she got up and stood on a rock that protruded six inches or so above the sand. Of course she could not see over the ridge--she could not have done that if she had climbed a telegraph pole; only there was no pole to climb--but she felt a little closer to seeing. That dust did not look like stage dust! You would be surprised to know how much Helen May had learned about dust clouds. She could tell an automobile <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> miles away, just by the swift gathering of the gray cloud. She could tell where bands of sheep or herds of cattle were being driven across the plain. She even knew when a saddle horse was coming, or a freight team or--the stage. She suddenly owned to herself that she was disappointed and rather worried. For behind this cloud that troubled her there was no second one building up over the skyline and growing more dense as the disturber approached. She could not imagine what had...", "...sized as ostrich eggs. That being the Hoard, he went forth and brought with him ten camels, each bearing two large sacks, and returning to the treasure-room, he filled all of these bags with gems and loaded them upon the beasts. Presently he entered to the Sultan with his string of ten camels and, causing them to kneel in the court-yard of the Divan, cried to him, \"Come down, O King of the Age, and take the dowry of thy daughter.\" So the Sultan turned towards him and, looking at the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> camels, exclaimed, \"By Allah, this youth is Jinn-mad; yet will I go down to see him.\" Accordingly he descended the staircase to the place where the camels had been made to kneel, and when the sacks had been unloaded and as the King came amongst them, the bags were opened and were found full of jewels greater and more glorious than the one was with him. Hereupon the Sultan was perplext and his wits were bewildered, and he cried to the Wazir, \"Walla-hi! I think that all the Kings...", "...and with all my body and mind and soul I resolved to strengthen my soul against her. \"Some day,\" I said to myself, letting the tears dry on my cheeks as I listened to a spirit of prophecy, \"some day there'll be a battle for life or death between our characters, Di's and mine, and I'll save myself up to win _then_.\" It seemed weak, as if I were a whipped child, to creep off to bed, yet I couldn't force myself to read, or do anything to turn my thoughts from the great injustice. At <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes to eleven I was making up my mind that, after all, sleep would be the best consolation, when our lodging-house landlady knocked. We had the \"drawing-room floor,\" up one flight of stairs from the street. Luckily I was still in the draw-dining-room--a fantastic apartment crowded with nouveau-art furniture all out of drawing, like daddy longlegs--when the woman tapped and peeped in.

Then, after a solemn hour spent in prayer, I lay down on my hard bench and slept peacefully as a child. I had no means of telling the time, but the jailer apparently wakened me earlier than usual, and I was led into a room where, instead of the usual bread and water, a proper breakfast was laid. The apartment was filled with soldiers; and when I had finished, two of them, stepping forward, pinioned my arms tightly behind my back. It was, as near as I could judge, about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> o'clock when the governor entered, and, after a brief talk with one of the officers, ordered the procession to be formed. The air was keen, though the sun shone brightly overhead, as we proceeded slowly to the courtyard, where the soldiers halted. Two other detachments now joined us, and in the midst of each a prisoner walked bareheaded. They were both officers in Bern's army of Transylvania, so I did not know them, but we exchanged glances of pity and goodwill. One was...", "...Dennis groaned.

XXXVIII. Of the lavers of the Temple. Besides this molten sea, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> lavers in the temple; five of which were put on the right side, and five also on the left (2 Chron 4:6). 1. Of their fashion and their furniture, you may see (1 Kings 7:38). These lavers, as the molten sea, were vessels which contained water; but they were not of the same use with it. True, they were both to wash in; the sea to wash the worshippers, but the lavers to wash the sacrifice. 'He made the ten lavers to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt-offering,...", "...and busy about the house. How funny!\" and she laughed again. \"Oh! no, father, I couldn't do it. I had better remain always your little Muriel, weak and small, who liked to creep close to you, and go to sleep in this way.\" She ceased talking--very soon she was sound asleep. But--the father! Muriel faded, though slowly. Sometimes she was so well for an hour or two that the Hand seemed drawn back into the clouds, till of a sudden again we discerned it there. One Sunday--it was <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days or so after Maud's birth, and the weather had been so bitterly cold that the mother had herself forbidden our bringing Muriel to the other side of the house where she and the baby lay--Mrs. Tod was laying the dinner, and John stood at the window playing with his three boys. He turned abruptly, and saw all the chairs placed round the table--all save one. \"Where is Muriel's chair, Mrs. Tod?\" \"Sir, she says she feels so tired like, she'd rather not come down to-day,\"...", "...of one railroad often have to go past the city upon the other roads, these \"floats\" are used to transport them around our island, so that goods from Boston or Sag Harbor, for instance, can be sent around New York to the tracks of the roads that will carry them to San Francisco without unloading or reloading. The floats that carry these cars are merely boxes, the shape of great dominoes, with railroad tracks laid upon them. Some carry six freight-cars, some carry eight, and some carry <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> cars. Tiny little propellers that we call \"tug-boats\" are warped or hitched alongside of these clumsy floating boxes, where they look as a little kitten would appear beside a big St. Bernard dog, or as a locomotive would look beside a house. But our queer, snorting, fussy little tug-boats march away with every floating thing to which they are hitched--even dragging huge Atlantic steamships at their sides--because they reach deep down into the water, where their big screws, driven...", "...and Cromwell Biron gazed at her with sidelong admiration, while Cecily watched them both fiercely from her pew. She knew that Cromwell Biron had come home, wooing his old love. \"But he sha'n't get her,\" Cecily whispered into her hymnbook. Somehow it was a comfort to articulate the words, \"She promised.\" On the church steps Cromwell offered his arm to Lucy Ellen with a flourish. She took it shyly, and they started down the road in the crisp Autumn moonlight. For the first time in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years Cecily walked home from prayer-meeting alone. She went up-stairs and flung herself on her bed, reckless for once, of her second best hat and gown. Lucy Ellen did not venture to ask Cromwell in. She was too much in awe of Cecily for that. But she loitered with him at the gate until the grandfather's clock in the hall struck eleven. Then Cromwell went away, whistling gaily, with Lucy Ellen's chrysanthemum in his buttonhole, and Lucy Ellen went in and cried half the night....", "...Probably the trimming of the lamps became his next duty; and then, as time went on, he developed into a \"gasman,\" that most indispensable attendant of the modern theatre. Thackeray, in his novel of \"The Virginians,\" has some very apposite remarks upon the limited state of illumination in which our ancestors were content to dwell. \"In speaking of the past,\" he writes, \"I think the night-life of society a hundred years since was rather a _dark_ life. There was not one wax-candle for <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> which we now see in a ladies' drawing-room: let alone gas and the wondrous new illuminations of clubs. Horrible guttering tallow smoked and stunk in passages. The candle-snuffer was a notorious officer in the theatre. See Hogarth's pictures: how dark they are, and how his feasts are, as it were, begrimed with tallow!

Mr. Gregg had noticed this in the morning and had told Fred to see that the root was cut off close to the line on both sides and pulled out altogether. \"If it isn't cut off, it will grow larger, lift up the cement flags, and perhaps break them.\" Fred saw the force of this, so had the root cut off and taken out. The operation would not kill the tree, though it might do it some injury. Now came the process of taking out the big stones, and a lever, <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or twelve feet long, was brought from the barn, in the shape of a red cedar pole, five or six inches in diameter at the larger end. Nick took an axe and chopped the big end a little flat on two sides, so that it could be shoved under the stone. A flat plank was next laid behind the stone on the ground, on which a fulcrum was to be placed, in order to get what is termed by workmen a \"purchase.\" On the side of the stone next to the river, three planks taken from the floor of the barn...", "...slipped over one eye and his tow-beard fell off, revealing the rugged features of Acting Chief Officer Preston. For about thirty seconds the two men struggled furiously, yet the keenest observer could detect no trace of bad temper. The adversaries were sportsmen both, who knew how to keep themselves under control. With the sweat pouring in streams down their faces they continued swaying and heaving. Both were of about the same weight and build. Preston had the handicap of about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years, but he was as fit as a fiddle and hard as nails. Amphitrite had discreetly retired from the arena, while the bears, unwilling to take an unfair advantage of their intended prey, stood in a semicircle, impartially encouraging both adversaries. Even Captain Bullock, who through long usage had become bored stiff with the \"crossing of the Line revels\", was on his feet shouting excitedly at the novel spectacle of Neptune being bearded in his den. Suddenly the unexpected...", "...Mr. Benson calls.\" Mr. Benson was the village constable. \"What will he want wi' t' lad?\" inquired Mrs. Bolland tartly. \"Martin is t' main witness i' this case o' Pickerin's.

An evil which attacks the theatre of the present day is the horrible mantle of respectability which has settled on the profession.

It is impossible for a non-worker to comprehend the life of a...", "...Brotherton couldn't know anything about it in Italy, and if George must go, Mary might surely be left there for the event. The Marchioness declared that she could die happy if she might see another Popenjoy born in the purple of Manor Cross. \"When am I to go?\" asked Mary. She was sitting now close to him, and the question was asked with full delight. \"I do not know whether you can be ready to-morrow.\" \"Of course I can be ready to-morrow.

Having lost Cicely, she would turn her back upon Dora, and what would be worse, she would undoubtedly turn Ralph's back in that direction.

When Miriam began to like Dora,--and this must happen, for in Miss Panney's opinion the Bannister girl was in every way <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> times more charming than Cicely Drane,--then, cautiously, but with quick vigor, Miss Panney would deliver the blow which would send the Dranes not only from Cobhurst, but back to their old home. In the capacity of an elderly and experienced woman who knew what everybody said and thought, and who was able to make her words go to the very spinal marrow of a sensitive person, she was sure she could do this. And when she had done it, it would cheer her to think that she had not only...", "...until, away down in the Second Form, it was confidently asserted that Oaks had called Mr. Grice a \"little tin monkey,\" and that Allingford had boxed the master's ears; which enormities would most certainly result in the expulsion of the two offenders.

The first thing the doctor did on receiving Mr. Grice's complaint was to compare that gentleman's watch with his own. \"Hum'\" he said shortly, \"I suppose you're aware that you _are_ <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes fast?\" A few moments later Mr. Grice withdrew, looking rather crestfallen. As may be imagined, the result of his interview with the head-master was never made public, and in the meantime Ronleians old and young were expressing their high approval of the conduct of their captain and his lieutenant.

Of the 151,000 farms before the war hardly 50,000 remained.

This force encountered the head of Van Dorn's retreating column just as it was crossing the Hatchie by a bridge some <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> miles out from Corinth. The bottom land here was swampy and bad for the operations of troops, making a good place to get an enemy into. Ord attacked the troops that had crossed the bridge and drove them back in a panic.

He was too weak in numbers to assault, but he held the bridge and compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another bridge...", "...She reigned jointly with her husband, and their reign is spoken of as that of Ferdinand and Isabella.

There are some dark spots which mar the brilliancy of this woman's record; one is the establishment of the Inquisition. We find that when a certain cardinal of the Roman Church presented his plan of the \"Spanish Inquisition\" to the King and Queen, that while Ferdinand approved, Isabella hesitated for a time; it may be that her woman's heart made her hesitate to condemn all who did not agree with her in religious matters....", "...thou asking me how I like the enemy of my house?

In winter it never left its cradle, and I told it stories and sang to it. The other boys all went to Cheder. Mother was always busy, she had at least <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> Parnossehs.

When she slept, instead of dull dreams, she had splendid visions.

But although it is quite true that the cultivation of a rubbio of land costs 80 scudi, it is false that the earth only yields sevenfold on the seed sown. According to the admission of the farmers themselves--and they are notoriously not in the habit of exaggerating their profits--it yields thirteen-fold on the seed sown. Thirteen measures of corn are worth thirteen times <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> scudi, or 130 scudi. Deduct 80, the cost of cultivation, and 50 remain. Multiply by 100, the result is 5,000 scudi (about L1,070), which will be the net income arising from the 100 rubbia cultivated in corn. The same extent of land under pasturage will produce L160 or L180. Consider, moreover, that it is not the net, but the gross income, which constitutes the wealth of a country. The cultivation of 100 rubbia, before it puts 5,000 scudi into the farmer's pockets, has put some...", "...45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's. 45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. 45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. 45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt.

Away she swept through the white crests, as the wind murmured and the sea roared, and the anxious countenance of the mate, still guiding the craft with a steady hand, seemed masked in watchfulness.

The sea, every moment threatening to engulph the little craft, to sweep its freight of human beings into eternity, and to seal for ever all traces of their fate, was now the lesser enemy.

If he could sink his putt and Small should miss his, the match would be square again. The old man examined every blade of grass between his ball and the hole.

When he finally hit the ball it was a weak, fluttering stroke, and though the ball rolled true enough, it stopped four...", "...prone are mankind to attribute effects to wrong causes.

We first repeated, \"Au nom du Pere, du Fils, et du Saint Esprit--Ainsi soit il.\" (In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost--Amen.) We then kneeled and kissed the floor; then, still on our knees, we said a very long prayer, beginning: Divin Jesus, Sauveur de mon ame, (Divine Jesus, Saviour of my soul). Then came the Lord's prayer, three Hail Marys, four creeds, and five confessions (confesse a Dieu). Next we repeated the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> commandments. Then we repeated the Acts of Faith, and a prayer to the Virgin in Latin, (which, like every thing else in Latin, I never understood a word of.) Next we said the litanies of the holy name of Jesus, in Latin, which was afterward to be repeated several times in the course of the day.

The night came on; the sun disappeared, and the comet--the dread of heaven and earth--shone out on the sky. By the aid of its demoniacal glitter Bajazet could see the opponent's army. He was not frightened, either by the star or by Timur's victory, and motionless he stood with his <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand men on the spot where half a million men had already perished. Then Timur raised his hand to heaven, as though he would grasp the flaming club, and with it strike his enemy. \"Well, so be it,\" he said, and with this he gave the signal to start his troops of mailed men, the Dzsagata horsemen and the rows of fighting elephants, against Bajazet's Janesars.

The State Carriage in which the Empress mother sat by the side of the Empress, was covered with gilding and richly inlaid with precious stones.

Nine of them were closed by concretions of the bone, indicating that the wounds by which those contusions or fractures had been made had been healed while life continued. The tenth fracture remained in a condition which showed that that had been the mortal wound. The bones of Arthur's wife were found near those of her husband.

Of 150 \"hoboes\" tested under the direction of the writer by Mr. Knollin, at least 15 per cent belonged to the moron grade of mental deficiency, and almost as many more were border-line cases. To be sure, a large proportion were found perfectly normal, and a few even decidedly superior in mental ability, but the ratio of mental deficiency was <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or fifteen times as high as that holding for the general population. Several had as low as 9- or 10-year intelligence, and one had a mental level of 7 years.

Once more did Jack bend all his energies to figuring out what the smoke could mean; he disliked telling her it did not offer any real hope, for he could see that it was the end of a forest fire, such as may have been tailing up the long ravine for many days, and feeding on all manner of trash falling from the scraggy pinon trees that managed to cling to the otherwise bare walls.

For Talbot I laid aside as his share of our entire product of four hundred and eighty-six ounces a total of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> ounces. This included the half of my own share, as agreed.

Our hopes of escape from this unpleasant and perilous situation now depended upon the arrival of the rear train, and when we saw that the Indians were going to besiege us instead of renewing their attacks, we felt rather confident of receiving timely assistance.

At last, about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> o'clock, we began to hear in the distance the loud and sharp reports of the big bull-whips, which were handled with great dexterity by the teamsters, and cracked like rifle shots. These were as welcome sounds to us as were the notes of the bag-pipes to the beseiged garrison at Lucknow, when the reinforcements were coming up and the pipers were heard playing, \"The Campbells are Coming.\" In a few moments we saw the lead or head wagon coming slowly over the ridge, which had concealed...", "...of regular officers.

Without the schools men have often reached the pinnacles of success, through their own individual earnestness and energy. Schools make wise men wiser, but they may make fools greater fools than ever.

Many a man has been the better for being too poor to attend school, like Franklin, Lincoln, Peter Cooper, and <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand other Americans. Their thirst for what books had to give them forced them to work harder and to deny themselves all the enjoyments that so vulgarize yet so charm the cheaper brood.

The women, to induce us to comply with his request, told us that some of the opposite party had said they would kill Car-ru-ey. Some other guns making their appearance, the strangers were alarmed and uneasy, until assured that they were intended merely for our own security. The time for this business was just after <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> in the forenoon. We found Car-ru-ey and Cole-be seated at one end of the Yoo-lahng, each armed with a spear and throwing-stick, and provided with a shield. Here they were obliged to sit until some one of their opponents got up; they also then arose and put themselves _en garde_. Some of the spears which were thrown at them they picked up and threw back; and others they returned with extraordinary violence. The affair was over before two o'clock; and, what was remarkable, we did...", "...way back through the throng which was hourly growing denser. It was distressing to catch the fragments of conversation that came to them as they fought their way back. Tens of thousands of people were being robbed of their means of making a living.

But his return was scarcely hailed with triumph by his subjects, when the example of Spain was followed in an insurrection demanding a new constitution. The king, wearied of political disturbance, and being without offspring, now determined to follow the example of his predecessor, and gave up the crown to his brother, Charles Felix, appointing, as provisional regent, Prince Charles Albert of Savoy Carignano, a descendant of Victor Amadeus I. After a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years, undistinguished by either vices or virtues, but employed in the harmless occupations of making roads and building schools, the king died in 1831, and was succeeded by the Prince of Carignano.

When Lady Henley heard that Jonah was looking well, that Frank had seen him <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days before, had dined with him in his hut, she could not make enough of the messenger of good tidings. He must stay to luncheon; he must come to dinner: he must see the girls. The luncheon bell rang double-loud in Frank's honour, and Frank was ushered in; Norah and Bell bounced in almost immediately; an extra plate was set for Frank.

Of these stone records, nine more were erected in the reign of king John, along the coast of Africa, as far as the cape of Good Hope. The fortress in the isle of Arguin was finished, and it was found necessary to build another at S. Georgio de la Mina, a few degrees north of the line, to secure the trade of gold dust, which was chiefly carried on at that place. For this purpose a fleet was fitted out, of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> large and three smaller vessels, freighted with materials for building the fort, and with provisions and ammunition for six hundred men, of whom one hundred were workmen and labourers. Father Lafitau relates, in very particular terms, that these ships carried hewn stones, bricks, and timber, for the fort, so that nothing remained but barely to erect it. He does not seem to consider how small a fort could be made out of the lading often ships.

Mrs. Weston was alone, her daughters being out walking, and Lily spent the greater part of the visit in silence, though her mind was made up in the first <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes, as she told Emily on leaving the house, 'that Miss Weston's tastes were in complete accordance with her own.'

At the same moment the doors in the background opened and a man entered. He was old; his shoulders stooped under the burden of public offices; his back had shrunk under the weight of communal commissions; the long continuance in damp offices, committee-rooms and safe deposits had warped his neck; there was a suggestion of the pensioner in his calm footsteps, as he walked up the cocoa-nut matting towards the...", "...Court,\" I said, \"can do what seems good to it.\" After Lawrence had brought him a bed he told him that the Court allowed him ten sous a day, and then locked us up together. Overwhelmed by this disaster, I glanced at the fellow, whom his every feature proclaimed rogue. I was about to speak to him when he began by thanking me for having got him a bed. Wishing to gain him over, I invited him to take his meals with me. He kissed my hand, and asked me if he would still be able to claim the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> sous which the Court had allowed him.

When the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade, and Mr Nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for, a circumstance of distress occurred to Jones, which will appear very ridiculous to many of my readers. This was how to procure a shilling; but if such readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from the want of a thousand pounds, or, perhaps, of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or twenty, to execute a favourite scheme, they will have a perfect idea of what Mr Jones felt on this occasion.

It was necessary to force the gates, and this was done under the mouths of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> pieces of artillery, loaded with grapeshot. In none of his battles did Napoleon ever imagine himself to be in so much danger as at the entrance into Grenoble.

There is, of course, in this townling, of not six thousand souls, a theatre, which is greatly resorted to.

As these ideas passed through Mrs. Orme's mind she did not perhaps remember that Sir Peregrine, who was more than <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years Mr. Furnival's senior, had been engaged to marry the same lady. But then she herself loved Sir Peregrine dearly, and she had no such feeling with reference to Mr. Furnival.

I very much doubt if one shot in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> reached the rampart at all, and the fortunate exceptions that struck the stone building at which they were aimed, rebounded from its sides as innocuous as tennis balls. The fact is the distance had been miscalculated, and we were attempting to breach a wall at a distance that it was scarcely possible to hit it. The enemy knew their distance better, and managed to pitch shot and shell among us in a way that was anything but pleasant.

He was impatient when I tried to remove the thought of imminent death from his mind. A few moments later the time for another advance came, and the interview with Colonel Ebright closed. In less than <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes, while he was riding near me he fell dead from his horse, pierced in the breast by a rifle ball. His apprehension of death was not prompted by fear. He had been through the slaughters of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor; had fought his regiment in the _dead angle_ of Spotsylvania, and led it at Monocacy.

Tsunayoshi was then the shogun in Yedo. He showed great consideration for the interests of the Imperial Court. Thus, he increased his Majesty's allowance by <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand koku of rice annually, and he granted an income of three thousand koku to the ex-Emperor. Moreover, all the Court ceremonies, which had been interrupted for want of funds, were resumed, and steps were taken to repair or rebuild the sepulchres of the sovereigns throughout the empire.

He felt more sentimental than he cared to show, and the topsy-turvydom of the room made him fidgety. Scraps of his daily life lay scattered all over chairs and chests of drawers; his black portmanteau yawned wide-open like a coffin; his white linen was carefully laid on the top of his black suit, which showed slight traces of wear and tear at the knees and elbows.

But soon that scratch began to prove troublesome, for the flowing blood covered the haft of the knife and made it slippery. This came near proving fatal for the American youth. Again the blades clashed, and, with a twisting movement, the Mexican wrenched Merry's knife from his grasp. The weapon rattled on the rocks <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet away. \"Now you die, gringo!\" snarled Frank's enemy, with a wolfish laugh. He launched himself at the defenseless youth with frightful fury, but Frank managed to clutch the wrist of his foe and check the stroke that would have been fatal. With a surge he flung the Mexican aside, at the same time springing toward the spot where Red Ben's hunting knife lay. The moonlight revealed it plainly, and Merry had it in a twinkling. Del Norte had followed him up, and was at him with...", "...but before long the brilliance of the light was already greater than that of the midday sun on earth. The heat, too, was intense, but Maskull welcomed it--it relieved his pain and diminished his sense of crushing weight. The wind had dropped with the rising of the sun.

The mists had no more than partially dissolved, and all that he could distinguish was a narrow circle of red sand dotted with <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or twenty bushes.

Looking up over his shoulder quickly, he was astounded to see a woman standing beside him. She was clothed in a single flowing, pale green garment, rather classically draped. According to earth standards she was not beautiful, for, although her face was otherwise human, she was endowed--or afflicted--with the additional...", "...Havre and Cherbourg, announced that the Channel Tunnel had fallen in, fortunately without the loss of a single life.

The destruction of the Channel Tunnel, <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years of effort wasted, millions of pounds swallowed up: this was evidently a calamity! But how much more dreadful was the sinister wording of the second telegram! Veules! Pourville! Dieppe! That was the coast which they would have to make for!

The intense and perverted individualism of the so-called socialist is shown in another way. Whatever liberties a State may permit to its citizens, it is certain that no nation can be in a healthy condition unless the government keeps in its own hands the keys of birth and of death. The State has the right of the farmer to decide how many cows should be allowed to graze upon <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> acres of grass; the right of the forester to decide how many square feet are required for each tree in a wood. It has also the right and the duty of the gardener to pull up noxious weeds in his flower-beds. But the socialist vehemently repudiates both these rights.

From <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> to twelve he received sick people, peasants from the village, or any visitors that needed his advice or his company. At twelve he ate a frugal meal. From one o'clock until three he enjoyed a siesta. At three he resumed his studies, which continued without interruption until six when he partook of a second meal.

Gyp missed their greeting; but the installation of Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be the nursery, absorbed all her first energies. Light was just beginning to fail when, still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and crossed the garden, to see how all had fared during her <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> weeks' absence. What a wintry garden! How different from that languorous, warm, moonlit night when Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow of the dark trees. How bare and sharp the boughs against the grey, darkening sky--and not a song of any bird, not a flower! She glanced back at the house. Cold and white it looked, but there were lights in her room and in the nursery, and someone just drawing the curtains. Now that the leaves were off, one could see the other houses...", "...each of much smaller diameter than the Armstrong-Whitworth, but operated by a 10-1/2 tons pressure to the square inch. It handles ingots of over 120 tons weight for armour-plating. In 1895 Mr. William Corey, of Pittsburg, took out a patent for toughening nickel steel plates by subjecting them, while heated to a temperature of 2,000 deg. F., to great compression, which elongates them only slightly, though reducing their thickness considerably. The heating of a large plate takes from <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> to twenty hours; it is then ready to be placed between the jaws of the big press, which are about a foot wide. The plate is moved forward between the jaws after each stroke until the entire surface has been treated. At one stroke a 17-inch plate is reduced to 16 inches, and subsequent squeezings give it a final thickness of 14 inches. Its length has meanwhile increased from 16 to 18-1/2 feet, or in that proportion, while its breadth has remained practically unaltered. A simple sum...", "...I communicated to them my apprehensions; but had no sooner mentioned the word plague, than they called me to order, asking me if I was ignorant that the Almighty had for ever excluded that disorder from the holy territory of the Hedjaz? Such an argument admits of no reply among Moslims; I therefore walked out, in search of some Greek Christians, several of whom I had seen the day before, in the street, and from them I received a full confirmation of my fears. The plague had broken out <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days ago: it had been raging at Cairo with the greatest fury for several months; and at Suez a large part of the population had died: from that port two ships laden with cotton stuffs had carried it to Djidda, and from thence it was communicated to Yembo. No instance of the plague had ever before been witnessed in the Hedjaz, at least none within the memory of man; and the inhabitants could with difficulty persuade themselves that such an event had occurred, especially at a time...", "...American antiquities as in those of nearly the whole world. Mounds are found throughout the Mississippi region as before bounded, and beyond its limits in many directions they merge into the small stone heaps which are known to have been thrown up by the Indians at road-crossings and over graves.

As I have said, the number in Ohio alone is estimated at more than <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand. They are almost always found in connection with embankments and other works of the different classes described, but they are also very numerous in regions where enclosures rarely or never occur, as in Wisconsin and in the gulf states.

But politically its character as slave or free was of the utmost consequence to the South, where the resolution gradually arose either to secure it for the peculiar institution or else prevent its organization even as a Territory. A motion for such organization had been unsuccessfully made about 1843, and it was repeated, equally without effect, each session for <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years. None of these motions had contained any hint that slavery could possibly find place in the proposed Territory. The bill of December 15, 1853, like its predecessors, had as first drawn no reference whatever to slavery, but when it returned from the committee on Territories, of which Douglas was chairman, the report, not explicitly, indeed, made the assumption, unheard of before, that Kansas-Nebraska stood in the same relation to slavery in which Utah and New Mexico had stood...", "...the request of the \"setter up,\" avoiding the searching glance of the sub-editor, who forthwith to meet the demands of the paging, called at random one of the reporters and passed on the order to him. \"Some lines of special type; eight lines.

Apache Kid looked up. \"Well, we might trade,\" said he. \"How much you want for them two, this and that?\" \"Heap cheap,\" said the Indian. \"Ten dollah.\" \"For two?\" \"No, <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> dollah for one, ten dollah for one.\" \"It's a trade then,\" said Apache Kid. \"Will you lend me twenty dollars, Francis?\" I glanced at George and saw him looking dazed, uncomprehending. I think the Indian was surprised there was no attempt to beat down the price and regretted he had not asked more. When Apache Kid paid for the horses he gave me the halters to hold, stood absently a moment with puckered brows and biting lips, then drew a long breath and stepped into the house...", "...subjects illustrative of the miracles; designed as a memorial of Agneta, widow of Chancellor Sparke.

This is a frame in the form of a truncated pyramid, about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet square at the bottom, and five at the top, having one of its four posts pierced with rounds to answer the purpose of a ladder, by means of which the workmen can ascend and descend. This derrick is from twenty to thirty feet in height, and has at its summit a pulley, by means of which the boring implements are drawn from the well. A pit is then sunk through the earth within the derrick, about six feet square, until the work is interrupted by water. The remaining distance to the...", "...was not to his taste. In their system of religion the two races were most widely contrasted. The Gauls were a priest-ridden race. Their Druids were a dominant caste, presiding even over civil affairs, while in religious matters their authority was despotic. What were the principles of their wild Theology will never be thoroughly ascertained, but we know too much of its sanguinary rites. The imagination shudders to penetrate those shaggy forests, ringing with the death-shrieks of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand human victims, and with the hideous hymns chanted by smoke-and-blood-stained priests to the savage gods whom they served. The German, in his simplicity, had raised himself to a purer belief than that of the sensuous Roman or the superstitious Gaul. He believed in a single, supreme, almighty God, All-Vater or All-father. This Divinity was too sublime to be incarnated or imaged, too infinite to be enclosed in temples built with hands. Such is the Roman's testimony to the...", "...for the prize. Twice the great strength of the outlaw had Aylward nearly down, and twice with his greater youth and skill the archer restored his grip and his balance. Then at last his turn came. He slipped his leg behind the other's knee, and, giving a mighty wrench, tore him across it. With a hoarse shout the outlaw toppled backward and had hardly reached the ground before Aylward had his knee upon his chest and his short sword deep in his beard and pointed to his throat. \"By these <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> finger-bones!\" he gasped, \"one more struggle and it is your last!\" The man lay still enough, for he was half-stunned by the crashing fall. Aylward looked round him, but the woman had disappeared. At the first blow struck she had vanished into the forest. He began to have fears for his master, thinking that he perhaps had been lured into some deathtrap; but his forebodings were soon at rest, for Nigel himself came hastening down the road, which he had struck some distance from the...", "...but Miss Tag-rag, he nevertheless alighted, and stayed for nearly ten minutes, behaving precisely in the manner of an accepted suitor, aware that he might do so with impunity since there was no witness present; a little matter which had been suggested to him by Mr. Gammon.

When her excellent parents heard of what had that day occurred between Mr. Titmouse and their daughter, they also looked upon the thing as quite settled, and were eager in their expressions of gratitude to Providence. In the mean while, the stream of prosperity flowed steadily in upon Mr. Tag-rag, his shop continuing crowded; his shopmen doubled in number:--in fact, he at length actually received, instead...", "...stolen goods.\" Finding that Carton was in earnest Jasper finally, but with great reluctance, drew out a dollar and handed it to his companion. \"There, I hope that will satisfy you,\" he said spitefully. \"It will--for the present.\" \"I wish he'd get run over or something,\" thought Jasper. \"He seems to expect me to support him, and that on seven dollars a week.\" Fortunately for Jasper, Philip Carton obtained employment the next day which lasted for some time, and as he was paid <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> dollars a week he was not under the necessity of troubling his old confederate for loans. Now and then Jasper and Rodney met, but there were no cordial relations between them. Jasper could not forgive Rodney for refusing to lend him money, and Rodney was not likely to forget the anonymous letter by which Jasper had tried to injure him. So three months passed. One day Mr. Sargent arrived at home before it was time for Rodney to leave. \"I am glad to see you, Rodney,\" said his...", "...medicine and give me aconite--two-drop doses of the tincture every two hours--until the fever was gone; then to alternate bryonia, and thus according to directions given in the book with the box.

She smiled to herself as she pictured Jerry's face when she heard the news. \"Just because I am in a hurry to tell Jerry she will probably go to dinner off the campus and come marching in about nine o'clock,\" was her half-vexed rumination. To her satisfaction Jerry walked into the room at <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes to six. She and Helen had taken a ride in the latter's car. Jerry was full of mirth over the fact that they had met Elizabeth Walbert's car at the side of the road with a blown-out tire.

Yes, _a spider's web_! but such a web as I venture to say very few men save myself have ever seen. It hung suspended from a branch quite <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet above the ground, it was tightly strained between the trunks of two trees at least eight feet apart, and it reached right down to the ground, where it was strongly interwoven with the long grass.

The occupants of the fort retired to rest that night, as usual, at the early hour of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> o'clock; and, thoroughly fagged out with the day's labour, soon sank to sleep. Nobody felt in the least degree anxious about the skipper, because, when Gaunt and Henderson took a last look at the weather before turning in, there was nothing particularly alarming in its aspect; they agreed that there was going to be a change, and that it would probably occur before morning; but Blyth, they considered, was not the man to be caught napping; moreover, he had already been absent long...", "...and were brilliant reciters, but Henry, blushing, stammering, confused, and hopelessly miserable, stuck fast on some sand-bank of what is required or forbidden by this or that commandment, his mouth choking up with the long words which he hopelessly miscalled, was sure to be accused of idleness or inattention, and to be solemnly talked to, which made him look more stolid and miserable than ever, but appeared to have no effect in quickening his dormant faculties.\" At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> he was a well-grown, stout, stocky boy, strong and hearty, trained to hard work, and to patient obedience of his elders.

He was placed at the school of the Rev.

It was a great change after eleven years of Europe, during <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> of which I had \"homed,\" as gypsies say, in England. The houses and the roads were old-new to me; there was something familiar-foreign in the voices and ways of those who had been my earliest friends; the very air as it blew hummed tunes which had lost tones in them that made me marvel. Yet even here I soon found traces of something which is the same all the world over, which goes ever on \"as of ever,\" and that was the wanderer of the road.

Your personal comfort and safety are so perfectly assured that you might well mistake yourself for one of very few people instead of so many. London is like nature in its vastness, simplicity, and deliberation, and if it hurried or worried, it would be like the precession of the equinoxes getting a move on, and would shake the earth. The street events are few. In my nine or <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> weeks' sojourn, so largely spent in the streets, I saw the body of only one accident worse than a cab-horse falling; but that was early in my stay when I expected to see many more. We were going to the old church of St. Bartholomew, and were walking by the hospital of the same name just as a cab drove up to its gate bearing the body of the accident. It was a young man whose bleeding face hung upon his breast and whose limp arm another young man of the same station in life held...", "...It appears that Bennett, the murdered man, had lived at Temen-green, a place about four miles distant from Hertford, for a great number of years, and he had a pension of one shilling and tenpence halfpenny per day, which he was in the habit of going to Hertford to receive quarterly. He went to Hertford for that purpose on the day of the murder, and called upon Mr. Duncan, the superintendant of the Hertford police, who accompanied him to receive his pension, which amounted to nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> pounds; and Mr. Duncan observed that at this time he had more money about him. He left Hertford about four o'clock in the afternoon, perfectly sober and collected. Nothing more was seen of him until about half-past four o'clock, when a boy named Bolton met him about a quarter of a mile from his own house, and he also observed four men in the wood by the road side, who were evidently watching the unfortunate man.

He groped, near the bottom, and struck the entrance; got his head through, and his body, and wriggled on--perhaps to stick fast inside and drown! No! As he had wildly hoped, the house was of two stories and big enough for him. The second floor was high and dry, for the beavers to lie upon; and the hole up through it was wide enough so that he could support his shoulders...", "...we must judge of the art of painting in all its departments. In plain words, Ruskin taught the English public that they must look at nature with their own eyes, and judge of art by the help of nature. Up to the publication of that book England, at least, had been falling into the way of regarding art as a sort of polite school to which it was our duty to endeavor to make nature conform. Conventionality and apathy had sunk apparently into the very souls of men and women. Hardly one in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand ever really saw a landscape, a wave, a ray of the sun as it is. Nobody used his own eyes. Every one was content to think that he saw what the painters told him he saw. Ruskin himself tells us somewhere about a test question which used to be put to young landscape painters by one who was supposed to be a master of the craft: \"Where do you put your brown tree?\" The question illustrates the whole theory and school of conventionality.

It's likely to cost you a small fortune.\" Doctor Haverford insisted that he could manage that.

But it was not so with their religious opinions, and as long as Antioch and its emperor undertook to govern the Egyptian church there was little peace in the province.

The St. John at Faenza is also denied to be by Donatello; one of the critics who is quite certain on the point believes the bust to be made of wood! These problems cannot be settled by spending <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> _lire_ on photographs. The bust at Faenza,[156] though a faithful portrait, is one of the most romantic specimens of childhood depicted by Donatello. Admirably modelled, and with a surface like ivory, it gives the intimate characteristics of the model.

During the twenty years following, the indispensable nature of some of the plant foods was ascertained; and it is only within the last <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or fifteen years that the superiority of arid districts over humid ones, for the purpose of supporting man, has been demonstrated. Even today it is a new light which has not been fully received.

July 5th. In Damascus we met Count Zichy, who had arrived there with his servants a few days before ourselves, and intended continuing his journey to Balbeck to-day. Count Zichy's original intention had been to make an excursion from this place to the celebrated town of Palmyra, an undertaking which would have occupied <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days. He therefore applied to the pacha for a sufficient escort for his excursion. This request was, however, refused; the pacha observing, that he had ceased for some time to allow travellers to undertake this dangerous journey, as until now all strangers had been plundered by the wandering Arabs, and in some instances men had even been murdered. The pacha added, that it was not in his power to furnish so large an escort as would be required to render this journey safe, by...", "...about her convent, her friends, and the Mother Superior, Sainte Lucie, whom she was much attached to; and she spoke about everything in a confident tone of familiarity, which showed me that she had often talked of me, and had been used to think of me as an absent brother.

Our own object would not be achieved until we saw Ireland beneath us; and it could not be achieved unless we kept our every faculty concentrated on it all the time. There was therefore no mental reaction during our long period of wakeful flying over the ocean. We began to think about sunrise and the new day.

Everard had no mean rival, if Charley was one. But he was not. He loved Isabel, it is true, with all the warmth of his ardent nature, but he loved her as he might a beautiful sister. He thought her worthy of Harley--his Harley--the pride of his boyhood, who in his eyes could do no wrong, until one day when he told him that he was going to India. Charley's grief was excessive, but his indignation arose when he learned the cause. Harley Elliott was <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years his brother's senior. He was the favorite clerk in the firm of Leicester & Co. Had Isabel to be met anywhere, and her father was unable to go, Harley was invariably sent; he was constantly at the house for one thing or another. As Isabel grew up he was frequently called upon to escort her and her young friends to places of amusement. As might be supposed, he became deeply in love with her, until at last life was almost a burden, for Harley was sensitive and high-minded to a...", "...biographers and memorialists.[16] Furthermore, he employs footnotes skillfully.

He made few substantial changes in the second edition, but the third edition contains important revisions. Courtenay added <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> lines and five footnotes in the final version, and lightened some of the scorn in the first portion by substituting weaker phrases for stronger ones. He also enclosed lines seven through twenty in quotation marks to make it appear that the sentiment expressed therein was not his own, but a judgment he had heard elsewhere. But the most significant revisions are concerned with organization. By transferring segments of certain verse paragraphs to others, he achieves a more unified...", "...and his sister Mary. The earliest written expression of this attachment occurs in a sonnet \"To my Sister,\" composed by Charles in a lucid interval, when he was confined in the asylum at Hoxton for the six weeks of his single attack of insanity.

Mary was <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years older than Charles, and, as is shown well in Talfourd's \"Final Memorials,\" loved him with an affection combining a mother's care, a sister's tenderness, and a friend's fervent sympathy. Nor did he, in return, fall short in any respect. He appreciated her devotion, pitied her sorrow, responded to her feelings, revered her worth, and ministered to her wants with a loving gentleness, a patient self-sacrifice, and an heroic fortitude, which, as we gaze on his image, make the halo...", "...witness said that many Spaniards remained in Manila, for ships came from Castilla every year bringing many people, all of whom remained; and that they had built a very large fort containing forty pieces of artillery.

During twenty years, broken by five or six imprisonments, he persisted in the effort to diffuse Unitarian teachings, and even to organize services for Unitarian worship. His writings and personal influence were so widely recognized that it became a fashion later to speak of Unitarians as 'Bidellians.' Cromwell was evidently troubled about him, feeling repugnance to his doctrine yet averse to ill-treat a man of unblemished character. In 1655, <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years after Bidle's first imprisonment, the Protector sent him to the Scilly Islands, obviously to spare him a worse fate, and allowed him a yearly sum for maintenance. A few months before Cromwell's death, he was brought back to London, and on being set at liberty at once renewed his efforts.

Government succeeded government, only to fall a prey to its own lack of a sufficient majority, and the unprincipled use by its various opponents of casual combinations and {301} alliances. Apart from a little group of Radicals, British and French, who advocated reforms with an absence of moderation which made them impossible as ministers of state, there were not sufficient differences to...", "...of the hypothesis has to be estimated from other data. As a preliminary to closer consideration, let us ask what may be inferred from the rate of discovery of the planetoids, and from the sizes of those most recently discovered. In 1878, Prof. Newcomb, arguing that \"the preponderance of evidence is on the side of the number and magnitude being limited\", says that \"the newly discovered ones\" \"do not seem, on the average, to be materially smaller than those which were discovered <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years ago\"; and further that \"the new ones will probably be found to grow decidedly rare before another hundred are discovered\". Now, inspection of the tables contained in the just-published fourth edition of Chambers' _Descriptive Astronomy_ (vol. I) shows that whereas the planetoids discovered in 1868 (the year Prof. Newcomb singles out for comparison) have an average magnitude of 11.56 those discovered last year (1888) have an average magnitude of 12.43.

He was a courtier, and passed for a good Arabic poet and one of the best rhetorical writers of his time. The famous Wazir Ibn Mukla counted him among \"the <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> most eloquent men.\" He must consequently have striven to suit his rendering of the book of Persian kings to the taste of his contemporaries.

The boat started anew at <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> o'clock and rounded the point of Carbet. The volcano was shrouded in smoke and ashes. For three miles the coast was in flames. Seventeen vessels in the roadstead, two of which were American steamers, burned at anchor.

He crept back to his bunk, slipped the screwdriver between the blankets, and standing by the door listened for <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> seconds; then a faint gurgling breath told him that Black slept. Making a hiding canopy of his blanket, he lighted his candle, unfolded the paper, and read: \"Two planks, north end, fastened with screws. Below is tunnel that leads to the mine. Will meet you there. Come soon. Important.\" There was no name signed, but Carney knew it was Jeanette's writing. He blew out the candle and stepping softly to the other end of the pen knelt down, and with his fingertips searched the...", "...it was equally as easy for him to strike east as to strike west. He decided at last to strike west, realizing that no captain, much less fiery old Bluecher, without an absolute forfeiture of his reputation as a soldier could afford to leave his van unsupported, but that the Prussian Field Marshal must advance to its support. If the Emperor's plans worked out, he could destroy that van, and then turn back and mete out the same fate to the main body coming to its rescue. Just about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> miles away to the westward, on the main road to Paris by way of La Ferte-sous-Jouarre, lay the village of Montmirail. As many miles beyond Montmirail, on the same Paris road, Sacken, with twenty thousand men, had been advancing. From Montmirail a road led northward to Chateau Thierry and the crossing of the Marne, behind which Macdonald had been driven by Yorck, with perhaps fifteen thousand more. The Emperor decided to seize Montmirail, throw out a corps to hold back Yorck on...", "...the mouldering tombstones, are picturesquely intermingled all over the uneven surface of the ground, save in one remote corner, where the graves are few and the grass grows rank and high. Here, the eye is abruptly attracted by the stern of a boat, painted white, and fixed upright in the earth. This strange memorial, little suited though it be to the old monuments around, has a significance of its own which gives it a peculiar claim to consideration. Inscribed on it, appear the names of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> fishermen of the parish who went out to sea to pursue their calling, on one wintry night in 1846. It was unusually cold on land--on the sea, the frosty bitter wind cut through to the bones. The men were badly provided against the weather; and hardy as they were, the weather killed them that night. In the morning, the boat drifted on shore, manned like a spectre bark, by the ghastly figures of the dead--freighted horribly with the corpses of ten men all frozen to death.

In 1848 some Australians started sheep-running in New Zealand; and by 1860 the sheep in these islands had increased to 2,400,000. In 1865 the number there had grown to 5,700,000; in 1870, to 9,500,000; and in 1894, to 19,000,000. In 1886 the pastoral wealth of the whole of the Australian colonies consisted of 84,222,272 sheep. At only <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> shillings per head, this represents a capital of over forty-two millions sterling, without counting the value of the land. The number of sheep in 1894 was over 99,000,000. But now as to the yield of the flocks. The value of the wool for 1884 was L20,532,429. The total importations of wool into England in 1885-86 were 1,819,182 bales, of which no fewer than 1,139,842 bales, or nearly three-fourths of the whole, came from Australasia.

The first is their enormous size. They are by far the largest of all the animals which live upon land. \"Jumbo,\" for instance, the famous African elephant that we in the United States saw in the last century, was nearly twelve feet in height, and weighed more than six tons. A height of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet is quite common. Next, there is their wonderful docility. When wild, no doubt, they are often very fierce and savage. Yet they are easily tamed; and it is a strange sight to see one of these giant creatures walking about with a load of children upon its back, and meekly obeying the lightest word of a man whom it could crush to death in a moment by simply placing its foot upon him. And then, once more, there is that marvelous trunk, so strong that it can tear down great...", "...dearly loved was made two years before her death. \"More than ever today,\" she wrote, \"when the world is facing such a crisis of bewilderment and unrest, must we stand firm in Faith seeking that which binds together instead of tearing asunder.

That's what I mean by stealthily.\" \"What was your errand?\" asked Scofield of Estelle. \"Nothing. I didn't go,\" she replied, coolly. \"She tells an untruth,\" said Gray, calmly. \"She did go, just as I have described. But it was doubtless on an innocent errand.

The O-G. shapes of these pieces fit into each other when they are screwed together. When the glue is sufficiently dry, the next thing is to make the veneer smooth and fit for varnishing. We have what is called a sand paper wheel, made of pine plank, its edge formed in an O-G. shape, and sand-paper glued to it. When this wheel is revolving rapidly, the pieces are passed over it and in this way smoothed very fast. They are then ready to varnish, and it usually takes about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> days to put on the several coats of varnish, and polish them ready for mitering, which completes the pieces ready for glueing in shape of the case. The sides of the case are made much cheaper. I used to have the stuff for ten thousand of these cases in the works at one time.

The rebels commenced an indiscriminate slaughter, sparing neither age nor sex, white or black, soldier or civilian.

Thus Hurreekee is at least eighteen miles from Durrumkote, although we had been told it was only five. The country near Loodianah, and, perhaps as far as Durrumkote, is occasionally very sandy, but beyond that it is easily traversed by hackeries.

His library contained a number of rare Oriental manuscripts, which he obtained through the instrumentality of Mr. Thomas Davis, a merchant at Aleppo.

But there are ladyships and ladyships, and the Doctor had been fortunate in the example which chance had thrown in his way. For instance, if he had known Lady Eleanor Griffin, who lived about <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> miles from Wenderholme, and came there occasionally to spend the day, the Doctor would have formed quite a different opinion of ladyships in general, so much do our impressions of whole classes depend upon the individual members of them who are personally known to us.

My mother knew and greeted me just as if I had left home that morning on an errand, and had now returned.

The younger members of the family gathered from their homes to meet \"Texas\" Anthony, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> continuous days I did nothing but answer questions, running from the color of the baby's eyes to why we did not drive the fifteen thousand cattle in one herd, or how big a section of country would one thousand certificates of land scrip cover.

At the War and Interior departments I made many friends. I understood cattle so thoroughly...", "...with villages and church spires, and on the other hand wide sloping beech woods, which were just now delicately green with their young spring leaves.

In other respects, however, the comparison fails; for he kept the untidiest place in town, and his stock was fearfully jumbled together, necessitating an indefinite search for every article demanded. The store was a little low room in an adobe building about twenty feet long and <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> feet wide, with another room in the rear where Yarrow cooked and slept. He was also a mysterious person, and nobody ever saw the inside of this room. His clothes were of the commonest material; he was polite and apparently well-bred; yet he never went anywhere for social intercourse, nor did he wish anyone to call upon him except for trade. Aside from the barest necessities, he was never known to spend any money, and so he came to be regarded as a miser. One morning he was found...", "...cried with a cheerful countenance, which made him look more than ten years younger; \"you shall come into partnership with me: your strength will save us two horses, and we always fear the horse work.

But people were coming. One Richard Henderson, at a treaty in the hill towns of the Cherokees, had just paid <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand pounds for the privilege of settling Kentucky. Boone left before the treaty was signed and a kindly old Cherokee chieftain took him by the hand in farewell. \"Brother,\" he said, \"we have given you a fine land, but I believe you will have much trouble in settling it.\" They were at hand.

What they cut trees down for is for the food that they know is growing on the tree. They want to get at the tender bark of the branches for their food, and that's what they cut the trees for. All the same, it's mighty wonderful sometimes to see what big trees they will cut down, and how smart they are about cutting them. They will gnaw a deep gouge below and then gnaw another cut eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> inches above, and pull the chip out; a chip just about as big as an axman would cut out with an ax.

No further runs were made by either side, and the first game of the Western invasion went into the Giants' column by a score of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> to two.

The same writer urges the need of a tax on sinecures and pensions, and finally begs Pitt for a place for life, devolving on his son.[449] The Chancellor of the Exchequer therefore had the choice of the direct attack on the purse or the increase of atmospheric pressure. For the present he chose the latter method, enhancing the duties on tea, wines, sugar, spirits, game licences, glass, tobacco, and snuff, besides raising the \"Assessed Taxes\" by <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> per cent. The produce of some of these imposts is curious. Hair-powder yielded L197,000; the extra tea and wine duties L186,000 and L923,000, severally; those on tobacco and snuff only L40,000. Pitt's procedure in December 1796 was very cautious. He carefully watched the yield of the new taxes, in order to see whether the increase of price checked consumption. Finding that this did not happen in the case of tea and spirits, he further raised the duties on those commodities; but, on...", "...was not worth it, seen that a woman who could give herself so soon, so easily, was one to whom he could not sacrifice his life.

This modern imperialism, which compels subject peoples to work at extractive industries at the behest of the swarming millions of the industrial nations, which excites, stimulates, urges, pushes, forces coloured peoples to raise bananas and cotton and buy shirts, gew-gaws, and whiskey, is at bottom a movement compelled by the economic expansion and necessity of the older countries. It is an...", "...of his stake. The stakes are made afresh, and the game proceeds. If the banker has been the winner, he deals again. If otherwise, the cards are passed to the player next in order, who thereupon becomes banker in his turn. We will now take the case that neither party turns up his cards; this is tantamount to an admission that neither has eight or nine. In such case the banker is bound to offer a third card. If the point of the punter is baccarat (_i.e._ cards together amounting to <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or twenty, = 0), one, two, three, or four, he accepts as a matter of course, replying, \"Yes,\" or \"Card.\" A third card is then given to {7} him, face upwards. If his point is already six or seven, he will, equally as a matter of course, _refuse_ the offered card. To accept a card with six or seven, or refuse with baccarat, one, two, three, or four (known in either case as a \"false draw\"), is a breach of the established procedure of the game, and brings down upon the head of the...", "...Will you drink lager beer with me? She writes about her poodle dog; But never thinks to say, \"Oh, do come home, my honey dear, I'm pining all away.\" I'll write her half a letter, Then give the ink a tip. If that don't bring her to her milk I'll coolly let her rip. They wish to know if I can cook And what I have to eat, And tell me should I take a cold Be sure and soak my feet. But when they talk of cooking I'm mighty hard to beat, I've made <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> thousand loaves of bread The devil couldn't eat. I like a lazy partner So I can take my ease, Lay down and talk of golden home, As happy as you please; Without a thing to eat or drink, Away from care and grief,-- I'm fat and sassy, ragged, too, And tough as Spanish beef. No matter whether rich or poor, I'm happy as a clam. I wish my friends at home could look And see me as I am. With woolen shirt and rubber boots, In mud up to my knees,...", "...their concurrence, and that Holland would be evacuated as soon as the terms of the Treaty of Amiens were complied with. Another proposal was that Malta should be transferred to Russia--the very step which was proposed at Amiens and was rejected by the Czar: on that account Lord Whitworth now refused it as being merely a device to gain time. The sending of his passports having been delayed, he received one more despatch from Downing Street, which allowed that our retention of Malta for <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years should form a secret article--a device which would spare the First Consul's susceptibilities on the point of honour. Even so, however, Napoleon refused to consider a longer tenure than two or three years. And in this he was undoubtedly encouraged by the recent despatch from St. Petersburg, wherein the Czar promised his mediation in a sense favourable to France. This unfortunate occurrence completed the discomfiture of the peace party at the Consular Court, and in a long and...", "...question of time. But I think I may say we never regarded it as a pressing question--such as the reform of the House of Lords, for instance. The general impression (I call it no more) was that we should all be temperate sooner or later; possibly as the next step after espousing our Deceased Wife's Sister. Well, our Vicar laid his copy of the 1894 almanack on the reading-room table at 11.30 a.m., or thereabouts, looked over the local papers for a few minutes, and left the building at <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> minutes to noon. I get this information from Matthias James, our respected pilot, who happened to be in the room, reading the _Shipping Gazette_. It is confirmed by Mr. Hansombody and four or five other members. At noon precisely, Mr. Rabling (our gasman and an earnest Methodist) came in. His eye, as it wandered round in search of an unoccupied newspaper, was arrested by the scarlet and green binding of Whitaker. He picked the book up, opened it casually, and read: The...", "...the house, and to holy reading; to everything, in fact, which best could prepare him for death. When we saw him, no disorder, nothing lugubrious, no trace of suffering, politeness, tranquillity, conversation but little animated, indifference to what was passing in the world, speaking of it little and with difficulty; little or no morality, still less talk of his state; and this uniformity, so courageous and so peaceful, was sustained full four months until the end; but during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> or twelve days he would see neither brothers-in-law nor nephews, and as for his wife, promptly dismissed her. He received all the sacraments very edifyingly, and preserved his senses to the last moment: The morning of the day during the night of which he died, he sent for Biron, said he had done for him all that Madame de Lauzun had wished; that by his testament he gave him all his wealth, except a trifling legacy to the son of his other sister, and some recompenses to his...", "...sort of life I was going to lead. I have made a captive of myself, and put me into a dungeon, and now I cannot find the key to let myself out,--and if the door were open, I should be almost afraid to come out. You tell me that you have met with troubles and changes. I know not what these may have been, but I can assure you that trouble is the next best thing to enjoyment, and that there is no fate in this world so horrible as to have no share in either its joys or sorrows. For the last <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years, I have not lived, but only dreamed of living. It may be true that there have been some unsubstantial pleasures here in the shade, which I might have missed in the sunshine, but you cannot conceive how utterly devoid of satisfaction all my retrospects are. I have laid up no treasure of pleasant remembrances against old age; but there is some comfort in thinking that future years can hardly fail to be more varied and therefore more tolerable than the past. \"You give me more...", "...of many books has come to be a difficulty; everything has grown smaller of late; this is not an age of giants; men have shrunk, everything about them shrinks, and house-room into the bargain. Great mansions and great suites of rooms will be abolished sooner or later in Paris, for no one will afford to live in the great houses built by our forefathers. What a disgrace for our age if none of its books should last! Dutch paper--that is, paper made from flax--will be quite unobtainable in <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years' time. Well, your brother told me of this idea of your father's, this plan for using vegetable fibre in paper-making, so you see that if I succeed, you have a right to----\" Lucien came up at that moment and interrupted David's generous assertion. \"I do not know whether you have found the evening pleasant,\" said he; \"it has been a cruel time for me.\" \"Poor Lucien! what can have happened?\" cried Eve, as she saw her brother's excited face. The poet told the history of...", "...By dint of making a horrible noise so that the whole house shakes, changing his voice, bellowing and shrieking, ventriloquising, groaning, moaning, and whining, beating on drums, bursting forth into diabolical shrieks of laughter, and all sorts of other tricks, he persuades his companions that he is visited by the various spirits he personates, and that it is they who make the disturbance. In order to become an angekok a long apprenticeship is naturally required, frequently as much as <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years. The neophyte must often and for long periods go into solitary retirement,[145] and rub a stone round upon another stone, following the sun, for several days on end, whereupon a spirit comes forth from the mountain. Then he must die of fright, but afterwards come to life again; and thus he gradually obtains the mastery of his tornat. He must not reveal that he is going through this probation until it is completed, but then he must make public announcement of the fact.

What a miserable prospect has England before its eyes! * Put of the inscription on an English guinea.--_Author_. Before the war of 1755 there were no bank notes lower than twenty pounds. During that war, bank notes of fifteen pounds and of <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> pounds were coined; and now, since the commencement of the present war, they are coined as low as five pounds. These five-pound notes will circulate chiefly among little shop-keepers, butchers, bakers, market-people, renters of small houses, lodgers, &c. All the high departments of commerce and the affluent stations of life were already _overstocked_, as Smith expresses it, with the bank notes. No place remained open wherein to crowd an additional quantity of bank notes but among...", "...stirred in Micky's heart; here, at least, was some one even more fed-up with life than he himself, and with a sudden impulse he turned from the window, and, snatching up a hat and coat which he had thrown down when he came in an hour earlier, made for the stairs. He was half-way down when an apologetic cough at his elbow arrested him; he stopped and turned. \"Well, what is it?\" \"If you please, sir, Mr. Ashton has just sent round to ask if you could make it convenient to be in at <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> o'clock this evening, as he wants to see you particularly.\" Micky looked surprised; Ashton had been very particularly engaged for that evening, he knew. Evidently something had happened to upset his plans as well. \"Ten o'clock? All right; I dare say I shall be in.\" He went on down the stairs. Out on the path he paused and looked up and down the street. The impulse that had sent him out had died away; it was beastly cold, and much more comfortable by the fire. He...", "...in the same sweeping line of light, but it never occurred to them that he mistook them for the ladies of his party until he came up and gave Harriott an affectionate squeeze on her ankle, repeating his remark: \"_N'est ce pas_, Comtesse--it gives a very _chic_ illumination to-night, the lighthouse?\" Mrs. Kesteven gave a very _chic_ gasp, and almost leaped from the wall into the sea below. And Val, realising what had happened, hastily leaned forward and in her bad French, always <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> times worse when she was excited, cried: \"_Mais--vous faisez une erreur, monsieur._\" The poor man, horrified as Mrs. Kesteven herself, blurted out a throaty: \"_Parr-don! Je vous demands parr-don, mesdames,_\" and fled. Val said her French did it--that wonderful phrase \"_faisez une erreur_,\" quite unknown to the French grammar. But Harriott declared her suspicion that the quality of her woollen stockings was the cause of the poor man's panic. \"I imagine the French...", "...work and private tuition. He died on the 10th of February 1861. He is remembered as a pioneer of philology in England, and as a great scholar in his day, though much of his work is now obsolete. The _New Cratylus_ (1839), the book on which his fame mainly rests, was an attempt to apply to the Greek language the principles of comparative philology. It was founded mainly on the comparative grammar of Bopp, but a large part of it was original, Bopp's grammar not being completed till <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years after the first edition of the _Cratylus_. In the _Varronianus_ (1844) the same method was applied to Latin, Umbrian and Oscan. His _Jashar_ (1854), written in Latin as an appeal to the learned world, and especially to German theologians, was an attempt to reconstitute the lost biblical book of Jashar from the remains of old songs and historical records, which, according to the author, are incorporated in the existing text of the Old Testament. His bold views on the nature...", "...rules of the Council. As for the Philippines, I infer that the Bula ceased there as soon as the Spanish sovereignty ended.\" An Augustinian father who has recently come to Villanova from the Philippines states that in those islands they have dispensations for fasts and abstinence, the same as before the revolution; but he could not state the precise date of those dispensations.--Rev. T. C. Middleton, O.S.A. A decree of Leo XIII, April 22, 1899, grants the Cuban bishops authority for <span class=\"clocktext\">ten</span> years to grant dispensations from fasting and abstinence.
