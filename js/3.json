It is made up of a chorus (\"How excellent Thy Name, O Lord\"), which is a stirring tribute of praise; an aria (\"An Infant raised by Thy Command\"), describing the meeting of David and Goliah; a trio, in which the Giant is pictured as the \"monster atheist,\" striding along to the vigorous and expressive music; and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> closing choruses (\"The Youth inspired by Thee,\" \"How excellent Thy Name,\" and a jubilant \"Hallelujah\"), ending in plain but massive harmony. The second scene is in Saul's tent. Two bars of recitative prelude an aria by Michal, Saul's daughter, who reveals her love for David (\"O godlike Youth!\").

The crown lawyers acted prudently in not requiring sureties.

Then came \"the question extraordinaire.\" Into the mouth of the victim was placed a horn holding <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> pints of water. In this way thirty pints of water were forced into the body of the sufferer. The pain was beyond description, and yet Jean Calas remained firm. He was then carried to the scaffold in a tumbril.

Almonte, young, brilliant and generous, had made him almost feel as if he were a guest and not a prisoner.

Shortly afterward they sailed away in two small vessels that had been built at Fort Caroline. After their departure, the orderly element that remained behind restored Laudonniere to his command, and things went on smoothly for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four months. Then, one day, a Spanish brigantine was seen hovering off the mouth of the river. It was ascertained that she was manned by the mutineers, now anxious to return to the fort. Laudonniere sent down a trusty officer in a small vessel that he had built, with thirty soldiers hidden in the hold. The buccaneers let her come alongside without suspicion and began to parley. Suddenly the soldiers came on deck, boarded, and overpowered them, before they could seize...", "...but as he could not learn the name or rank of his rival, his wounded pride had not the usual alleviation of meditated revenge. On his return to Damascus, he found that during his absence a division of the Empire had been determined upon; that his younger brother had been made Sultan of Egypt, while to himself was committed the sovereignty of Syria and Palestine.

This sight made me feel very anxious, for though we might very likely outdistance the canoes if we could hoist our sail in a fair breeze, we were no match for them in the sheltered lagoon, our vessel being, I think, heavier than theirs, and having only two paddles to their dozen at least.

Close, sharp, continuous musketry, whole lines belching fire on the Rebels as the leaden storm swept the fields over which they attempted to advance, were too much for Rebel discipline, though the bodies left scattered over the fields, even on Monday evening, bore ghastly testimony to the daring with which they had been precipitated toward our lines.

That there will be suffering I have no doubt. But I regard suffering rather as reformatory than punitive. Take the example of Saul, to whom we have just referred.

Certainly, the intensest suffering accompanied his conversion. In the light of such facts as these we can see how possible, and how reasonable it is to expect the most wonderful transformation in the next life.

Possibly his case is the most notable that has occurred. And yet, who can say?

Born at Styche, near Market Drayton, in Shropshire, he had been sent, when <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years old, to be cared for and educated at Manchester, by a gentleman who had married his mother's sister, Mr. Bayley of Hope Hall. The reason for this arrangement, at an age so tender, is not known. One seeks for it in vain in the conduct and character of his parents; for although his father is described as irascible and violent, his mother was remarkable for her good sense and sweet temper. To her, Clive was wont to say, he owed more than to all his schools. But he could have...", "...amid these groves might arise at last a new school of philosophy or poetry.

The first is a very tall and slender-culmed grass, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> to seven feet high, with four or five purple finger-like spikes raying upward from the top. The second is also quite slender, growing in tufts two feet high by one wide, with culms often somewhat curving, which, as the spikes go out of bloom, have a whitish fuzzy look. These two are prevailing grasses at this season on dry and sandy fields and hill-sides. The culms of both, not to mention their pretty flowers, reflect a purple tinge, and help to declare the ripeness of the year....", "...he had learned to cut out figures--dogs and landscapes--in colored paper, which he had taken to the bazaars and stationers' shops, and there disposed of--for a mere trifle truly. \"For this kind of thing is not fashionable, mother, though I think the Queen likes them,\" he said; \"and of course, if not fashionable, I could not get very much for them.\" So he contented himself, and consoled her, for the small payment of sixpence or a shilling, which perhaps was all he could earn by <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four days' work.

The temple itself was within this; and before that temple was the altar, upon which we offer our sacrifices and burnt-offerings to God. Into none of these <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> did king Herod enter, [24] for he was forbidden, because he was not a priest. However, he took care of the cloisters and the outer enclosures, and these he built in eight years. 6. But the temple itself was built by the priests in a year and six months; upon which all the people were full of joy; and presently they returned thanks, in the first place, to God; and in the next place, for the alacrity the king had showed. They feasted and celebrated this rebuilding of the temple:...", "...poor devil standing on the tip-top stone, as unconcerned as an old cormorant on a rock, flapping his wings for a flight. At length, by his motions we saw that he was preparing to be off in earnest. The men held their breath hard, and the women began to tremble and cry; and then, all of a sudden, he made a jump off the battlement, and sailed away 'most illigant.' A wild shout of delight arose from the people, but before it had ceased the glory of poor Felix was 'done up.' After two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> flutters, his wings fell flat to his sides, his heels went up, and down he came tumbling like a wild-goose with a shot through his gizzard, plump to the ground! Every body thought that it was all over with him; but when we ran to pick him up, we found him lying on his back, not dead, but groaning most pitifully. We took him up as tenderly as we could, and carried him home, and laid him on his bed. When the doctor came he found that both his legs were smashed.

Perhaps he hated the Dissenters most, because they came nearer in contact with him than the...", "...the boiler, and all the water that was in the glass remains there. You may have stopped work with an ordinary gauge of water, and as water expands when heated, it also contracts when it becomes cool. Water will also simmer away, if there is any fire left in the fire box, especially if there should be any vent or leak in the boiler, and the water may by morning have dropped to as much as an inch below the crown sheet. You approach the engine and on looking at the glass, see two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> inches of water. Should you start a fire without investigating any further, you will have done the damage, while if you try the gauge cocks first you will discover that some one has tampered with the engine.

With an effort she moved her head a little, and then she saw the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> kneeling forms, the clergyman with bowed head, and the two dwarfs with shining upturned faces: she thought she was dead and they were kneeling about her corpse. Her head dropped with a weary sigh of relief, she lay passive, and heard the dwarf's prayer. Then she knew that she was not dead, and the disappointment was bitter. But she thought of Leopold, and was consoled. After a few minutes of quiet, they helped her into the house, and laid her on a sofa in the parlour. \"Don't...", "...the venerable Juez, who sat at the table.

For several minutes this low note would be repeated, and all the birds stare at nothing, till I began to feel almost uncomfortable, as I have done at similar staring at nothing on the part of animals.

On one occasion, when the male uttered this note, the female was just about to eat; she stood as if petrified, with head halfway down to the food, for two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> minutes. What I have called talk was a very low twitter in a conversational tone, on one note, not at all in a singing tone, like the usual warble or call. I have also heard it from wild bluebirds, when I could get near enough. From the first, as said above, the male did most of the talking, and the habit grew upon him, till he became a regular babbler, standing on the top perch, and keeping it up persistently all day long. I think it arose from the fact that the greater number...", "...you take the trouble of coming to see it?\" Larcher handed him his card. \"You're very kind,\" replied Turl, glancing at the address. \"If you're sure it won't be putting you to trouble.

So it was settled that he should call about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> o'clock, an appointment which Mr. Kenby, whose opinion of Larcher had not changed since their first meeting, viewed with decided lack of interest. When Larcher left, a few minutes later, he was so far under the spell of the newcomer's amiability that he felt as if their acquaintance were considerably older than three-quarters of an hour. Nevertheless, he kept ransacking his memory for the circumstances in which he had before heard the name of Turl. To be sure, this Turl...", "...fretting to burst over the border.

Apparently, Rhodes's agents were seconding their efforts--in fact wearing out the telegraph wires trying to hold him back. Rhodes was himself the only man who could have effectively postponed Jameson, but that would have been a disadvantage to his scheme; indeed, it could spoil his whole two years' work. Jameson endured postponement <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days, then resolved to wait no longer. Without any orders--excepting Mr. Rhodes's significant silence--he cut the telegraph wires on the 29th, and made his plunge that night, to go to the rescue of the women and children, by urgent request of a letter now nine days old--as per date,--a couple of months old, in fact. He read the letter to his men, and it affected them. It did not affect all of them alike.

Such a bargain disgusted the capital, and raised the legions in the provinces to revolt. Each of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> principal armies set up their own candidate, but L. Septimius Severus, who commanded in Illyricum, was the fortunate one, and was confirmed by the Senate. Didius Julianus was murdered after a brief reign of sixty-six days, and the praetorians who had created the scandal were disbanded. The reign of this general was able and fortunate, although he was cruel and superstitious. His vigor prevented the separation of the empire for a century; but he had powerful rivals in Clodius...", "...agreed with Norah. Still, the act was so like the ordinary conduct of Indians, that it was not surprising the rest of the party should believe him to be ungrateful. \"We must wait patiently, at all events, till the mystery is elucidated,\" observed my father; \"and now, as you hunters are hungry, we will go to dinner.\" We had just finished our meal when Tim hurried in with the announcement that a number of our black labourers were collecting outside in a state of great commotion, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four of them having brought in the doctor's servant, Gab, as a prisoner. Tim informed us that, having suspicions as to his conduct, they had followed him for several miles into the mountains, when they found that he had gone to meet some Spaniards. On hearing this the doctor seized a thick stick, and was on the point of rushing out, to break it, as he said, on Gab's head,--or rather on his shins, for his head was not likely to be much the worse for it. \"Sit down, my good...", "...boat known as the inner pilot-boat.

In this way all the beats are constantly patrolled in an efficient and economical way.

A Charter obtained in 1376, two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years before he began business, was probably the real foundation of Whittington's fortune. For it forbade foreign merchants to sell by retail. This meant that a foreign ship bringing wine to the port of London could only dispose of her merchandise to the wholesale vintners: or one bringing silk could only sell it to wholesale mercers. The merchants, no doubt, intended to use this Charter for the furtherance of their own shipping interests. This important Charter, presented by...", "...so the broth is started now.\" She waved her hand toward the corner of the room where the low-turned flame of a gas plate was causing a soft simmering in a large saucepan. \"You put the chicken in cold water, didn't you, to draw the goodness out?\" \"Yes, indeed.

Three hours after the convoy started the dragoons left behind overtook them. When within <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> miles of the town, they were met by a small party of the enemy's Spanish militia; but these were at once scattered by a charge of the dragoons, and the convoy proceeded without further molestation until just at noon it entered the gates of Valencia, where the astonishment and delight of the inhabitants at its appearance were unbounded.

The coral being thus checked in its upward growth, extends laterally, and hence most of the masses, especially those a little further inwards, had broad flat dead summits.

So, grieved though I was to take any steps likely to discredit a regiment with such admirable traditions, I decided to change the order of the march by bringing one company of the 72nd Highlanders and the 5th Gurkhas to the front, and I warned Lieutenant-Colonel Brownlow, in command of the 72nd, to keep a watch over the Pathans with his <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> remaining companies, for I felt that our enterprise had already been sufficiently imperilled by the Pathans, and that hesitation would be culpable; for, unless we could reach the kotal while our approach was still concealed by the darkness, the turning movement would in all probability end in disaster. On the Gurkhas coming up, I told Major Fitz-Hugh, who commanded them, that the moment he reached the foot of the kotal, he must front form company, fix bayonets, and charge up...", "...her!

White Caroline was exceedingly pleased! But Black Caroline, who was on the winding stairs, came down and half opened the door because she wanted to see also. But, as soon as the musician saw the face of Black Caroline, he ceased to play, and the three little dogs hid their heads under a sack because Black Caroline was so ugly--but she was also very good.

When I left, I remember, they were just beginning, as a high novelty, advertisement-writing. Later, I myself took this class, though only for a few weeks. Even then, I think, the Holborn place was condemned to come down. A second-hand book shop occupied the ground floor; and above the book shop window three columns, each of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bow windows, one for each floor, formed the frontage. The three bow windows of the top floor were ours. Inside, the place was small and inconvenient in the extreme. It had been a dwelling-house once, and the old fixtures still remained--dark cauliflower wallpapers, heavy ornamental gas-brackets, and little porcelain fittings by the fireplaces that still rang, in the second of the two rooms that had been knocked into one to form a lecture-room, a row of bells that resembled a...", "...forming a precise notion of its degrees: And secondly by showing, that though the capacity of the mind be not infinite, yet we can at once form a notion of all possible degrees of quantity and quality, in such a manner at least, as, however imperfect, may serve all the purposes of reflection and conversation. To begin with the first proposition, THAT THE MIND CANNOT FORM ANY NOTION OF QUANTITY OR QUALITY WITHOUT FORMING A PRECISE NOTION OF DEGREES OF EACH; we may prove this by the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> following arguments. First, We have observed, that whatever objects are different are distinguishable, and that whatever objects are distinguishable are separable by the thought and imagination.

For how is it possible we can separate what is not distinguishable, or...", "...to clear the ramparts as far westward as the Lahore gate, and Nicholson expected that Major Reid's column would by this time have entered the city there. Nothing daunted by Reid's failure, Nicholson determined to push forward without this support. Between the Kabul and the Lahore gates was the Burn bastion, the strongest part of the defences, whence a galling fire was being kept up both on the cavalry drawn up outside and on the infantry in the narrow streets within. A narrow lane, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred yards long, and varying from ten feet to three in width, ran between the Kabul gate and the bastion, lined with mud huts on one side and on the other by the ramparts. The rebels, taking heart at the one success they had achieved in the repulse of the fourth column and the havoc wrought by the Burn bastion, had come crowding back into the lane, the further end of which they defended with two brass guns posted behind a bullet-proof screen. Nicholson knew that his task...", "...for a Holy War. In the year 1187 he marched from Damascus to Kerak, where he laid close siege to Renaud. At the same time a large body of cavalry was sent on towards Nazareth under his son El-Afdhal. They were met by 730 Knights Hospitallers and Templars, aided by a few hundred foot-soldiers. Inspired by the heroic Jacques de Maille, marshal of the Temple, they defied the large Saracen army. In the conflict which ensued, the Crusaders immortalised themselves by fighting until only <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of their number were left alive, who, after the conflict was over, managed to escape. Soon after this, Saladin himself approached with a great army of eighty thousand men, and the Christians with all their forces hastened to meet him upon the shores of Lake Tiberias. The result of this battle proved to be the most disastrous defeat which the Christians had yet suffered. They were weakened by thirst, and on the second day of the conflict a part of their troops fled.

I reached the bog, and was about to venture upon its black surface, and to pick my way amongst its innumerable holes, yawning horribly, and half filled with water black as soot, when it suddenly occurred to me that there was a road to the south, by following which I might find a more convenient route to the object of my wishes. The event justified my expectations, for, after following the road for some <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> miles, seemingly in the direction of the Devil's Mountain, I suddenly beheld the castle on my left. I diverged from the road, and, crossing two or three fields, came to a small grassy plain, in the midst of which stood the castle. About a gun- shot to the south was a small village, which had, probably, in ancient days, sprung up beneath its protection. A kind of awe came over me as I approached the old building. The sun no longer shone upon it, and it looked so grim, so...", "...party, but presently Forrester, after a look around, cried:-- \"Where are the Chinkies, Mac?\" \"Aren't they here?\" Mackenzie asked in return. \"You ought to know--you were contemplating their backs,\" Jackson remarked. There was no sign of them. Forrester called up their Naga carriers, and Sher Jang questioned them. The men could give no information. Once or twice they had lost sight of the Chinamen as the scrub hid them from view. They had thought nothing of that. The <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> white men looked at each other. CHAPTER V THE EYE Forrester was the first to break the silence. \"They've gone a little out of the way,\" he suggested. \"By the time we've got the tent up, they'll be here.\" But minutes passed, and the men did not appear. \"We had better go and look for them,\" said Jackson. \"It's a good riddance,\" Mackenzie replied. \"But we can't leave them in the lurch,\" said...", "...a more direct passage. Towards the middle of August, 1590, they arrived upon the coast, at Cape Hatteras, and went to search upon Roanoke for the people; but found, by letters on the trees, that they were removed to Croatan, one of the islands forming the sound, and southward of Roanoke about twenty leagues, but no sign of distress. Thither they designed to sail to them in their ships; but a storm arising in the meanwhile, lay so hard upon them that their cables broke; they lost <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of their anchors, were forced to sea, and so returned home, without ever going near those poor people again for sixteen years following. And it is supposed that the Indians, seeing them forsaken by their country, and unfurnished of their expected supplies, cut them off, for to this day they were never more heard of. Thus, after all this vast expense and trouble, and the hazard and loss of so many lives, Sir Walter Raleigh, the great projector and furtherer of these discoveries...", "...armonia degl' idiomi_, in which he printed a Tagalog Ave Maria as written in 1593, with the note: \"The Ave Maria in the Tagalog of 1593 is to be read in the Tagalog-Spanish Doctrina Christiana which was printed in Tagalog and roman characters by the Dominican fathers in their printing-house at Manila in the year 1593.\" [27] In 1787 he finished his twenty-first volume, _Saggio pratico_, [28] which was another philological study, including the Pater Noster in over <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred languages and dialects, among them Tagalog, again from the 1593 Doctrina. Here, then, is ample proof that a copy of this book was known to Hervas in 1785, and the only information which his loose transcription of the title failed to give was that the volume was \"corrected by members of the orders,\" that it was printed with license, and that it was printed at San Gabriel. At the beginning of the following century two German scholars, familiar with Hervas' writings, noted...", "...body. I hadn't the heart to say no; but I went with him and kept at the door.

He never spoke again, but lay just as I have said. Of course I took every precaution. Prisoner's room had two doors, one opening on the landing, and the other into the room where I stopped. I locked up the outer-door and put <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four screws into it from the outside. The window was too high to break out at, but our men used to keep an eye upon it from the street. At night I used to lock the door of my room and stick open the door between the two.

They were involved in the common evils of Oriental despotism: their enmity to Rome could not always atone for their attachment to the gospel: and a colony of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred thousand Jacobites, the captives of Apamea and Antioch, was permitted to erect a hostile altar in the face of the _catholic_, and in the sunshine of the court.

The first physician came, one day, to see Madame he was talking of madmen and madness. The King was present, and everything relating to disease of any kind interested him. The first physician said that he could distinguish the symptoms of approaching madness six months beforehand. \"Are there any persons about the Court likely to become mad?\" said the King.--\"I know one who will be imbecile in less than <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> months,\" replied he. The King pressed him to tell the name. He excused himself for some time. At last he said, \"It is M. de Sechelles, the Controller-General.\"--\"You have a spite against him,\" said Madame, \"because he would not grant what you asked\"--\"That is true,\" said he, \"but though that might possibly incline me to tell a disagreeable truth, it would not make me invent one.

But the most curious class of mottoes are the EMBLEMATICAL, some of which allude to the charges in the arms, and others to the surname, involving a pun. Of those allusive to the arms or crest, the following are examples: That of the Earl of Cholmondeley is \"Cassis tutissima virtus,\" Virtue the safest helmet; alluding to the helmets in his arms: and that of the Egertons, \"Leoni, non sagittis fido,\" I trust to the lion, not to my arrows; the arms being a lion between <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> pheons or arrow-heads. The crest of the Martins of Dorsetshire was an ape, and their motto, HE . WHO . LOOKS . AT . MARTIN'S . APE, MARTIN'S . APE . SHALL . LOOK . AT . HIM! Much wit, and, occasionally, much absurdity are found in punning mottoes. That the soundness of a sentiment is not necessarily injured, however, by the introduction of a pun, is proved by such mottoes as these:-- ADDERLEY of Staffordshire. _Addere Le_-gi Justitiam Decus.

There is, therefore, actual reduction in the electromotive force of the cell, as well as an increase in internal resistance.

The means by which polarization of cells is prevented or reduced in practice may be divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> general classes: First--_mechanical means_. If the hydrogen bubbles be simply brushed away from the surface of the electrode the resistance and the counter polarity which they cause will be diminished.

The ticking was now low; but as I listened intently, it gradually grew louder and louder, until, to my horror, the colossal frame swayed violently backwards and forwards. Unable to stand the sight of it any longer, and fearful of what I might see next, I retreated into my room, and, carefully locking the door, lit the gas, and got into bed. At <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> o'clock the ticking once again became normal. The following night the same thing occurred, and I discovered that certain other members of the household had also heard it. My friend rapidly grew worse, and the irregularities of the clock became more and more pronounced, more and more disturbing. Then there came a morning, when, between two and three o'clock, unable to lie in bed and listen to the ticking any longer, I got up. An irresistible attraction dragged me to the door.

On that occasion our battery had been severely handled, losing many men and horses. Having <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> guns disabled, we were ordered to withdraw, and while moving back we passed General Lee and several of his staff, grouped on a little knoll near the road. Having no definite orders where to go, our captain, seeing the commanding general, halted us and rode over to get some instructions. Some others and myself went along to see and hear. General Lee was dismounted with some of his staff around him, a courier holding his horse. Captain Poague, commanding our battery, the Rockbridge...", "...of the impression.

By that time the stone was half-way to the top of the doorway, leaving a space over <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> feet high, and was still rising. I stood on one side and Harry on the other, not caring to expose ourselves immediately in front. Suddenly he left his post and ran to one of the stone seats and began prying at the blocks of granite.

These terms must not be confounded with the term \"sound wave\" or \"vibrations\" so often used in discussions on the theory of sound. However, we think the student is thoroughly familiar with these terms. The rate of vibration of two tones not in a favorable ratio, may produce the phenomenon known as \"beats, waves, or pulsations.\"...", "...carefully bound over her forehead. \"She must be taken to the block-house at once.

That absurd fear made them hesitate for a moment; but, as if ashamed of their weakness at such a time, they sprang forward and made amends by sustaining her entire weight themselves. \"Run ahead, Jenkins, and notify the commander of this,\" said Mansfield, \"and see that no crowd is in our way.\" Jenkins darted away, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> moved carefully through the wood toward the clearing. An occasional moan from their burden was the only sign of life she gave. Not a word was spoken by the three, as they made their way forward. The rangers hardly dared to look down upon the form their arms sustained, but gazed anxiously toward the block-house, evidently in fear of a curious multitude of people.

The question cannot be answered as satisfactorily as one could wish, for the simple reason that such children are rarely permitted to do what they can. What they do accomplish is as follows: Of 54 children (of the 1000 unselected cases) falling in this group, 121/2 per cent were advanced in the grades two years, approximately 54 per cent were advanced one year, 28 per cent were in the grade where they belonged by chronological age, and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> children, or 51/2 per cent, were actually retarded one year. But wherever located, such children rarely get anything but the highest marks, and the evidence goes to show that most of them could easily be prepared for high school by the age of 12 years.

A central mechanism of inhibition, such as Exner mentions, might condition a central anaesthesia during movement, although the functioning of the retina should remain unaltered.

Born June 20, 1694, at Randrup, Denmark, he early came under the influence of the great spiritual awakening which was then sweeping through the Lutheran Church. Brorson's father was a Lutheran pastor, and all of his <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> sons, including the hymn-writer, entered the service of the Church. Brorson's first pastorate was in his native city of Randrup, a place he dearly loved and to which he often returned in later life when he found himself oppressed by manifold cares. It was during his ministry in Randrup that Brorson began to write his first hymns. He speaks of the eight years spent at this place as the happiest in his life.

I shall now describe a method in which this was possible.

In the experiments on the color vision of the dancer which have thus far been described only the first of these three methods has been employed. Its advantages are that it enables the...", "...this, he was for two years turnkey under sheriff Beebe, and then established himself in a brick yard of his own on the west side of the river.

Down this staircase, damp, gloomy, and intricate as it was, we descended, and a guide preceded us with a candle, which, however, scarcely gave us light enough to see our way down the dark and slippery descent. It was constructed, according to the instruction of our cicerone, in the year 800, by one of the Moorish kings, who had it built for the purpose of supplying his palace with water. At the foot of it we came to a sort of window, which going through, we stepped out...", "...Vallington. \"We can at least prepare for possibilities.\" \"They can take the boats from us,\" answered Bob Hale, \"and leave us here to be starved into submission.\" \"It would be awkward to be obliged to return to the academy like whipped puppies; but I suppose we could be starved into it.\" \"We will look out for that,\" I added. \"How can you help it?\" \"Leave that to me,\" I replied, as I hastened down to the landing-place, where I summoned my boatmen for service.

The next <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> months passed very pleasantly to Malchus. In the day he hunted the boar, the bear, and the wolf among the mountains with Allobrigius; of an evening he sat by the fire and listened to the songs of the harpers or to the tales of the wars and wanderings of the Gaulish tribes, or himself told the story of Carthage and Tyre and the wars of the former with the Romans, described the life and manners of the great city, or the hunting of the lion in the Libyan deserts.

The scheme suggested by the gentleman from Massachusetts, of not taxing the notes at present in circulation, would excuse bank notes from all tax, as, according to his own account, only about one-fifth of the notes issued came in in the course of a year, so that it would be five years before a new tax could operate upon all their notes, and it was probable the bill might not pass for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four. That gentleman supposed that bankers' notes ought not to be charged more than others; if this were the case, they might be reckoned to run for four or five years, while those of individuals were at six and twelve months. The note of an individual, for fifty dollars, was to pay ten cents; he calculated a bank note, therefore, for a like sum, which he supposed, upon an average, to run four years, thirty cents.

But it is not always the most accurate expression that is fittest to survive.] [Footnote 4: The abuse of coincidence is a legacy to modern drama from the Latin comedy, which, again, was founded on the Greek New Comedy.

Similarly, when I grew to have fags of my own, and by morning and by evening one of them solemnly entered to me bearing a plate on which those <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> traditional pieces of toast were solemnly propped one against another, I cared not at all whether the toast were good or bad, having no relish for it at best, but could have eaten with gusto toast made by my own hand, not at all understanding why that member should be accounted too august for such employment.

The pathway thus formed was only a few inches in width and precarious. The gangway ran out from one bank to the stores, thence on to the opposite bank, so that it was possible for the men to pass to the shop and to dry land in single file. If one were at the extreme end of the queue one might confidently expect to wait from two to <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hours before reaching the shop, only then to be disappointed because it had been cleared out of everything edible. When the water was up, the German _frau_, acting as shopkeeper, would perch herself on a box or barrel with the murky fluid swishing and snarling around her, because her stores always suffered inundation at such times. Walking the plank to make a purchase was highly exciting and mildly diverting.

The Jews of Alsace remained exposed to attack, as before. The Jewish representatives of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bishoprics of Alsace and Lorraine lost patience, seeing that their equalization was being constantly deferred. They therefore strove to obtain a hearing for themselves. Introduced by the deputies of Lorraine to the National Assembly (October 14), Berr, the indefatigable advocate of his co-religionists, delivered a speech, in which he portrayed the sufferings of a thousand years, and implored humane treatment for them.

A nameless presentiment had again drawn me thither, after leaving Eliot's pulpit. I showed my companions where I had found the handkerchief, and pointed to two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> footsteps, impressed into the clayey margin, and tending towards the water. Beneath its shallow verge, among the water-weeds, there were further traces, as yet unobliterated by the sluggish current, which was there almost at a standstill.

Behind these counters stood an army of waiters; before them, all the evening long, an eager crowd. As soon as one had obtained his supply, there were two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> others ready to take his place. In one of the rooms there were provided wines, meats of all kinds, and a most luxurious variety of substantial viands.

BY SYDNEY DAYRE. \"What do you say to Ned's taking a ride up to Miss Pamela's to-morrow?\" said Mr. Weatherby to his wife. \"How? All by himself? A ride of twenty miles?\" \"On horseback. Yes. Yes. Does that answer your <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> questions satisfactorily? Now _I'll_ ask one. Why not?\" \"Oh, I suppose there is no objection, only he has never taken such a long ride alone.\" \"Why, mother! I, a great fellow of fourteen! Of course I can go--that is, please let me.

In Folk-Lore, Vol. X., a fully illustrated description of the Mumming Play, as performed at Newbold, a village near Rugby, is given.[22] Here the characters are Father Christmas, Saint George, a Turkish Knight, Doctor, Moll Finney (mother of the Knight), Humpty Jack, Beelzebub, and 'Big-Head-and-Little-Wit.' These last <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> have no share in the action proper, but appear in a kind of Epilogue, accompanying a collection made by Beelzebub. The Play is always performed at Christmas time, consequently Father Christmas appears as stage-manager, and introduces the characters. The action consists in a general challenge issued by Saint George, and accepted by the Turkish Knight. A combat follows, in which the Turk is slain. His mother rushes in, weeps over the body, and demands the services of a Doctor,...", "...of houses in that quarter were usually held at; this we found was fifteen years' purchase at the most, and, proportionably to this, the value of each lease was easily determined in a scheme, referring to a map. These rates, which we resolved not to stir from, were offered to each; and, to cut off much debate, which it may be imagined everyone would abound in, they were assured that we went by one uniform method, which could not be receded. We found two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> reasonable men, who agreed to these terms; immediately we paid them, and took down their houses; others, who stood out at first, finding themselves in dust and rubbish, and that ready money was better, as the case stood, than to continue paying rent, repairs, and parish duties, easily came in. The whole ground at last was cleared, and all concerned were satisfied, and their writings given in....

The Abbot Seanach Garbh appears to have been the successor of St. Fintan, but beyond the record of his death, which the _Ulster Annals_ give A.D. 620, we know nothing. St. Colman, son of Comgall, is mentioned by the scholiast of AEngus as the next of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> 'kings' who ruled the abbey in succession to Brendan, but of him in like manner we know nothing more. The next Abbot-Bishop of Clonfert was the celebrated Cummian Fada, or Cummian the Tall, perhaps the most distinguished scholar of his time in Ireland. Before, however, we give an account of his life and writings, it is necessary to refer briefly to another famous disciple of St. Brendan, that is, the celebrated St. Fursey. After Brendan himself, St. Fursey is the most...", "...he solely enjoyed an animal life in common with brutes.

The new dedication was suggested by, and intended to perpetuate the memory of, the convent of that name in Bermondsey (founded by Alwin Child, a London citizen, in 1082), which shared the fate of its companions at the Dissolution. Soon after the amalgamation, St. Margaret's Church was secularized, and divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> portions for use respectively as a Sessions' Court, a Court of Admiralty, and a prison. It stood on the ground where the old Southwark Town Hall was afterwards built, itself a perpetuation of the secular uses to which the deconsecrated church was put before it was destroyed. A relic of St. Margaret's survives in the shape of a monumental slab to Aleyn Ferthing, five times Member for Southwark, about the middle of the fourteenth century. The stone was discovered in 1833 during...", "...Times: 1066-1100 William came from Normandy, France, to conquer England. He claimed that the former King, Edward, the Confessor, had promised the throne to him when they were growing up together in Normandy, if Edward became King of England and had no children. The Conquerer's men and horses came in boats powered by oars and sails. The conquest did not take long because of the superiority of his military expertise to that of the English. He organized his army into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> groups: archers with bows and arrows, horsemen with swords and stirrups, and footmen with hand weapons. Each group played a specific role in a strategy planned in advance. The English army was only composed of footmen with hand weapons such as spears and shields. They fought in a line holding up their shields to overlap each other and form a shieldwall. The defeat of the English was thought to have been presaged by a comet.

Another example of his versatility in language and of its usefulness to him as well, is shown in a trilingual letter written by Rizal in Dapitan when the censorship of his correspondence had become annoying through ignorant exceptions to perfectly harmless matters. No Spaniard available spoke more than one language besides his own and it was necessary to send the letter to <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> different persons to find out its contents.

It is always, however, a spirited step, and the music is undoubtedly pretty. The dancing-masters describe the step of a polka as being a \"hop, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> glides, and a rest,\" and the music is two-four time. In order to apply the step to the music one must make it in four-eight time, counting four to each measure of the music, each measure taking about a second of time by the watch. The polka redowa and the polka mazourka are modifications of this step to different times. The galop is another fashionable dance this winter. It is very easy, and is danced to very quick music; it is inspiriting at the end of a ball.

THE THIRD BASEMAN. This position is the most difficult one, to play skilfully, of any of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bases, as the throwing to first base from this position requires a stronger arm than that from short-stop or second base, while the third baseman has the most difficult catches to make on foul balls of any in-fielder except the catcher.

The greensward ran smoothly away to a shingle bank that rose, long- backed and brown, some <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred yards away. The bank crossed the horizon like a low breast-work, sweeping away eastward in long roan curve. On the right it ran into a little blunt hill, green-brown and bare. Beyond the bank the sea leapt to the eye. The Parson was walking reverently. There was about him something of the subdued air of the schoolboy going to interview a respected master. \"Step quietly,\" he murmured. \"We are going into the presence of a saint.\" In front of the cottage, about two...", "...occupation combined. I do not think that any one may apprehend that the market will ever be overstocked, for as the dog becomes known, the desire for possession among all classes will be correspondingly increased, and as he is strictly an American product, no importation from Europe can possibly supply winners, or specially good dogs, as is the case with almost all other breeds. And the fact is demonstrated that dogs of A 1 quality can be produced on American soil. There are two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> subjects that demand the most careful consideration at the hands of the breeder, and to which I am afraid in many cases not particular enough attention is given. I refer in the first place to the question of inbreeding, an admitted necessity in the early history of the dog, but in the writer's estimation very harmful and much to be discouraged at the present time.

Since that time the diocese of Rochester has included West Kent and part of Surrey, and has comprised <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> archdeaconries: Rochester, Kingston, and Southwark.

An average Londoner would have a shop, a storeroom, a hall, a kitchen, and a buttery on the first floor, and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bedrooms on the second floor. Artisans and shopkeepers of more modest means lived in rows of dwellings, each with a shop and small storage room on the first floor, and a combination parlor-bedroom on the second floor. The humblest residents crowded their shop and family into one 6 by 10 foot room for rent of a few shillings a year. All except the last would also have a small garden. The best gardens had a fruit tree, herbs, flowers, a well, and a latrine area.

The same action is repeated, with some variation, in two sketches in pen and ink on a third sheet, in the Accademia at Venice, Pl.

We are not, it is true, in a position to declare with any certainty which of these <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> dissimilar sketches may have been the nearest to the group finally adopted in executing the cartoon. With regard, however, to one of the groups of horsemen it is possible to determine with perfect certainty not only which arrangement was preferred, but the position it occupied in the composition. The group of horsemen on Pl.

After regarding them fixedly for full thirty seconds, he said, \"Wait!\" and left them in the doorway. Kirsteen was washing breakfast things which had a leadless glaze, and Tryst's three children, extremely tidy, stood motionless at the edge of the little scullery, watching.

Washington detached a division from the army under General John Sullivan to lay waste that country. The instructions were obeyed, and Sullivan did not cease until he found no more to lay waste. The only resistance he met with that was of any moment was on August 29, 1779, when the enemy hoping to ambuscade the army of Sullivan, brought on the battle of Chemung, near the present site of Elmira. There were about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred royalists under Colonel John Butler and Captain Alexander McDonald, assisting Joseph Brant who commanded the Indians. The defeat was so overwhelming that the royalists and Indians, in a demoralized condition sought shelter under the walls of Fort Niagara. The lower Mohawk Valley having experienced the calamities of border wars was yet to feel the full measures of suffering. On Sunday, May 21, 1780, Sir John Johnson with some British troops, a detachment of Royal...", "...and in much sorrow at the prospect of my shortly impending journey, which must now take me far from Saalfeld and Halle.[88] Thus I did not return very soon, and went straight to her room.

The feelings of all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> were similar and showed themselves perceptibly in our eyes, a kind of joyful solemnity ensued, and we all three returned thanks to God.

Thus Mohammed crowns the work which Arius attempted <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred years before. After the restless heresies in which the Greek mind had fluctuated during these three centuries, the greatest enemy to the Greek empire and faith was set up on that very negation of the godhead of Christ with which those heresies had begun.

In Pollard _v._ Hagan,[245] the Court held that the original States had reserved to themselves the ownership of the shores of navigable waters and the soils under them, and that under the principle of equality the title to the soils of navigable waters passes to a new State upon admission. After refusing to extend the inland-water rule of this case to the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> mile marginal belt under the ocean along the coast,[246] the Court applied the principle of the Pollard Case in reverse in United States _v._ Texas.[247] Since the original States had been found not to own the soil under the three mile belt, Texas, which concededly did own this soil before its annexation to the United States, was held to have surrendered its dominion and sovereignty over it, upon entering the Union on terms of equality with the existing States.

His house was in Alabama, his post-office in Tennessee, and he was engaged in coal-mining enterprises in the mountains of Georgia, the locality being where these <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> States meet in a point. No sooner was the coming conflict in the air than the stalwart mountaineers of the mining district became wild with eagerness to fight for the Confederacy, and Gordon, in whom the war spirit burned as hotly as in any of them, needed but a word to gather about him a company of volunteers.

To him, her pastor, Mrs. Hutchinson was deeply attached. And when the minister fled to New England in order to escape from the tyranny of the bishops, the Hutchinsons also decided to come to America, and presently the whole family did so. Mrs. Hutchinson's daughter, who had married the Reverend John Wright Wheelwright--another Lincolnshire minister who had suffered at the hands of Archbishop Laud--came with her mother. Besides the daughter, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> grown sons in the family at the time Mrs. Hutchinson landed in the Boston she was afterward to rend with religious dissension. So it was no young, sentimental, unbalanced girl, but a middle-aged, matured, and experienced woman of the world who, in the autumn of 1634, took sail for New England. During the voyage it was learned that Mrs. Hutchinson came primed for religious controversy. With some Puritan ministers who were on the same vessel she discussed eagerly abstruse...", "...meat has been in pickle and soak it accordingly.

Then the bailiff was satisfied, for he, too, was a covetous fellow. Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-servant was still in bed. Then one of them called to him, \"Get up, it is time; we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us.\" \"Ah,\" said he quite roughly and surlily, \"you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you.\" Then the others went to the bailiff, and told...", "...but little good, but they will be blest far beyond what you may expect.

Deck had no idea where the road he was taking led to, but he imagined that it would take him into the forest some distance beyond, and the shelter of this heavy growth of timber would be far more acceptable than would be a pursuit in the open. Fortunately, the three horses were used to travelling together, so there was no hitch here, and the speed made by all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> was very good. When the corn-crib was passed, Deck found himself passing through a stubble field, but this was less than two hundred yards in length. But, short as was the distance, it was not yet fully covered, when Messinger appeared at the doorway of the farmhouse and gave the alarm.

In a still later publication, [3:1] Bishop Lightfoot controverts the views of Dr. Cureton, and makes a vigorous effort to uphold the credit of the seven letters quoted by Eusebius and supported by Pearson.

After that he stretched and painted the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> scalps and lay down by the fire to sleep. In the morning he took what provision he could carry and traveled in a great circle until he found the road by which he and his warriors had come. He found fresh tracks and followed them until he saw smoke ahead. He listened until he heard men speaking Seneca, and knew that it was his party.

Louis Antoine de Bougainville was born at Paris, on the 13th of November, 1729. The son of a notary, he was destined for the bar, and was already an advocate. But having no taste for his father's profession, he devoted himself to the sciences, and published a Treatise on the Integral Calculus, whilst he obtained a commission in the Black Musqueteers. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> careers he thus entered upon, he entirely abandoned the two first, slightly neglected the third, for the sake of a fourth--diplomacy, and finally left it entirely for a fifth--the naval service.

Torches had been provided, and lanterns, and as <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of Hugh's men carried them the broad landing was lighted up. Sir Richard Fulke first turned to the door of Maria's room, but there Rupert and two followers stood with drawn swords. \"Cut them down! Cut them down!\" he shouted; but the rush of Hugh, Joe Sedley, and the rest swept him back, and he fought now to defend his life.

And yet without Connie's <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred a year, where would the household be! Mrs. Hooper was painfully, one might have said, guiltily aware of that side of the business.

It may seem odd to talk of my first buffalo hunt, as the question would naturally be asked, how could a prisoner participate in a hunt; the sequel will explain. The chiefs had halted, and the rear coming up, we were soon clustered in a group on this rising ground. Directly in front of us, at the distance of about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> miles, I should judge, was an immense herd of buffaloes. The plain was positively black, so numerous were they. All unconscious of their foes, they were quietly grazing, while here and there a watchful old bull seemed to have stationed himself as an outpost, being in readiness, if needs were, to instantly communicate the signal of danger to the herd. It was a glorious sight; even the horses shared in the excitement, and evinced as great a desire to participate in the hunt as did...", "...town of some importance about two miles from Oldham in Lancashire, and about four miles from Rochdale in the same county. Laneside is a small estate with some houses and a little cotton-mill upon it, which belonged to my maternal grandfather. The house is of stone, with a roof of stone slate such as is usual in those parts, and it faces the road, from which it is separated by a little enclosure, that may be called a garden if you will. When I was a child, there were two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> poplar trees in that enclosure before the house; but trees do not prosper there, and now there is probably not one on the whole estate. One end of the house (which is rather long for its height and depth) abuts against the hill, and close behind it is the cotton-mill which my grandfather worked, with no great profit to himself or advantage to his descendants. I have mentioned a road that passes the house; it is steep, narrow, and inconvenient. It leads up to an elevated tract of...", "...but looked as though he already half guessed what was coming, if the eager and expectant gleam in his eyes signified anything. \"I explained to you,\" the lieutenant continued steadily, \"that the big bomber was equipped for a trip to Berlin and back; and went so far as to say the flight could be _repeated without making a landing_, if there was any need of such a thing.

Since 1961, when the substantial support of the Soviet Union was lost in the wake of the political schism within the Communist world engendered by the Sino-Soviet dispute, Albania has been able to obtain assistance only from the People's Republic of China (Communist China). The readjustment necessitated by the abrupt withdrawal of all Soviet aid and technical advisers was said by Albanian leaders to have retarded economic development by <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years. The extent of aid received in the form of long-term loans, some of which became grants through debt cancellations, is only partially known. The amount of total loan commitments by the Soviet Union in United States dollar equivalents for the period of 1945 through 1961 was estimated by one Western source at US$246 million. Another Western source reported the amount of loans promised by the Soviet Union and the East European Communist states for the 1961-65 period to have...", "...the other as having no right to smile, and that her so doing was an act of presumption and impertinence.

Soon, how ever, they returned and informed us that they would be compelled to take us to the County Jail, to await further orders from the Military Commander of the District. While they were talking together, I took a hasty inventory of what valuables we had on hand. I found in the crowd four silver watches, about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred dollars in Confederate money, and possibly, about one hundred dollars in greenbacks. Before their return, I told the boys to be sure not to refuse any request I should make. Said I: \"'Gentlemen, we have here four silver watches and several hundred dollars in Confederate money and greenbacks, all of which we now offer you, if you will but allow us to proceed on our journey, we taking our own chances in the future.'\" This proposition, to my great surprise, was...", "...reported a weak Confederate force.

If a writer will do so he will charm his readers, though his readers will probably not know how they have been charmed. In writing a novel the author soon becomes aware that a burden of many pages is before him. Circumstances require that he should cover a certain and generally not a very confined space. Short novels are not popular with readers generally. Critics often complain of the ordinary length of novels,--of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> volumes to which they are subjected; but few novels which have attained great success in England have been told in fewer pages. The novel-writer who sticks to novel-writing as his profession will certainly find that this burden of length is incumbent on him. How shall he carry his burden to the end? How shall he cover his space?

I will narrate all that has come to my knowledge relating to this business; the most minute particulars will prove how little reason the Queen had to apprehend the blow by which she was threatened, and which must be attributed to a fatality that human prudence could not have foreseen, but from which, to say the truth, she might have extricated herself with more skill. I have already said that in 1774 the Queen purchased jewels of Boehmer to the value of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred and sixty thousand franca, that she paid for them herself out of her own private funds, and that it required several years to enable her to complete the payment. The King afterwards presented her with a set of rubies and diamonds of a fine water, and subsequently with a pair of bracelets worth two hundred thousand francs. The Queen, after having her diamonds reset in new patterns, told Boehmer that she found her jewel case rich enough, and was not desirous of making any...", "...was not a little taken notice of.

But upon her husband's death she made up all quarrels; so that Lord Lauderdale and she lived so much together that his Lady was offended at it and went to Paris, where she died about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years after.\" This was in 1672, and soon afterwards Lady Dysart and Lord Lauderdale were married.

She might be young and fair; she might be an _olomatua_ (an old woman), dried up and skinny. But that was none of their business. All that he and Melanie had to do was to entertain her well and make much of her. 'True,' said the placid-minded Melanie; 'and even if she be as ugly as an _aitu_ (devil), yet will that fat-faced pig Lepeka die with envy to see a white lady a guest in my house.

The one has an out-door, the other an in-door existence; and by the duties of the mother, the position of the slighter sex is distinctly pointed out. It would appear as if the comparative merit of the sexes were influenced by the effect of climate; the Salique-law still prevailing in several of the most civilized countries of Europe, in spite of the glorious reigns of Elizabeth and Anne in England, and Catherine in Russia; and the living example of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> female sovereigns on the throne.

The letter written almost immediately after George's marriage, contained a full description of his wife--such a description as a man could only write within three weeks of a love match--a description in which every feature was minutely catalogued, every grace of form or beauty of expression fondly dwelt upon, every charm of manner lovingly depicted. Robert Audley read the letter <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> times before he laid it down. \"If George could have known for what a purpose this description would serve when he wrote it,\" thought the young barrister, \"surely his hand would have fallen paralyzed by horror, and powerless to shape one syllable of these tender words.\" CHAPTER XXV.

On March 4, 1539, the great transept, built fifty years previous, fell down; but was soon restored.

Events had not favoured the patriots on the western side of the Andes, and a number of the most prominent men had fled eastwards to Argentina, O'Higgins and many others establishing themselves at the town of Mendoza for the time being. There, unfortunately, a certain amount of jealousy had broken out between the Chilean leaders, for the existence of much of which there is no doubt that the Carrera family was largely responsible. The <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> brothers Carrera were very notable personalities in the war of independence in Chile. In 1811 Don Juan Jose Carrera, who had attained to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of Hussars in Europe, returned to his native country to take part in its defence. He appointed himself Colonel of the National Guards, made his eldest brother, Jose Miguel, a Colonel of the Grenadiers, and his younger brother, Don Luis, Colonel and Commander of the Artillery.

Ought I not to bestow the Princess on one who values her at such a price?\" The Vizier, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold her for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> months, in the course of which he hoped his son would contrive to make him a richer present. The Sultan granted this, and told Aladdin's mother that, though he consented to the marriage, she must not appear before him again for three months.

It dawned upon him that the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> shots fired in front of him had been a signal, and in alarm he turned toward the gate, but a voice near at hand called loudly, \"Oscar!\" and repeated the name several times. Behind the Servian the little soldier answered sharply in English: \"All steady, sir!\" The use of a strange tongue added to the Servian's bewilderment, and he fled toward the gate, with Oscar hard after him.

Like me, he had seen it all in a moment, and as one of the gang laid a hand upon him, he dashed it off, cried to me to help him, and the next moment there was a sharp struggle going on--one which roused me to fight; for it was such a struggle as any man would engage in for his liberty in those good old times, when a sailor was not safe if he walked the streets of a seafaring town. \"Harry was a strong fellow, and fought hard; one man went heavily down, then <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> went down together.

The Shahaptan family of Scouler comprised <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> tribes--the Shahaptan or Nez Perces, the Kliketat, a scion of the Shahaptan, dwelling near Mount Ranier, and the Okanagan, inhabiting the upper part of Fraser River and its tributaries; \"these tribes were asserted to speak dialects of the same language.\" Of the above tribes the Okinagan are now known to be Salishan. The vocabularies given by Scouler were collected by Tolmie. The term \"Sahaptin\" appears on Gallatin's map of 1836, where it doubtless refers only to the Nez Perce...", "...I could hear of no case of capsizing. The Levee Board of a district appoints levee-masters, whose duty it is to look after the condition of the work, and on the islands I visited there were gangs of Chinamen engaged in repairing and heightening the embankments. You land at a wharf, and, standing on top of the levee, you see before you usually the house and other farm buildings, set up on piles, for security against a break and overflow; and beyond a great track of level land, two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or five feet below the level of the levee, and, if it has but lately been reclaimed, covered with the remnants of tules and of grass sods. When the levee is completed, and the land has had opportunity to drain a little, the first operation is to burn it over. This requires time and some care, for it is possible to burn too deep; and in some parts the fire burns deep holes if it is not checked. If the land is covered with dry tules, the fire is set so easily that a single match...", "...to meet John Ashforth. \"Mr. Ashforth, I declare!

He expressed a friendly gratification in appropriate words. Dora began to breathe again; everything was passing off well. Suddenly she glanced from John to Mary. Mary stood alone, about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> yards from the table, gazing at Charlie. Charlie sat as though paralyzed. He would ruin everything. \"Mr. Ellerton,\" she called sharply. Charlie started up, but before he could reach Dora's side, the latter had turned to Mary and was holding out a friendly hand. Mary responded with alacrity. \"Miss Bellairs, isn't it? We ought to know one another. I'm so glad to meet you.\" Charlie was by them now. \"And how do you do, Mr. Ellerton?\" went on Mary, rivalling Dora in...", "...disease for (such it may be termed) is peculiarly English and American. Men, in their race for gain, appear, like horses that have run away, to have been blinded by the rapidity of their own motion. It almost amounts to an epidemic, and is infectious--the wise and the foolish being equally liable to the disease. We had ample evidence of this in the bubble manias which took place in England in the years 1825 and 1826. A mania of this kind had infected the people of America for two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years previous to the crash: it was that of speculating in land; and to show the extent to which it had been carried on, we may take the following examples:-- The city of New York, which is built upon a narrow island about ten miles in length, at present covers about three miles of that distance, and has a population of three hundred thousand inhabitants. Building lots were marked out for the other seven miles; and, by calculation, these lots when built upon, would contain an...", "...Dave slyly stuck out his foot, and when Freddy tripped over it and started to fall headlong, Dave grabbed him quickly. \"See?\" Dave chided, as he helped Freddy to keep his balance. \"Just as I thought!

Evidently these scions brought the disease into this region, for the grafts have all been killed by the blight and every tree in the orchard is killed or infected by disease. On adjoining tracts over 5,400 infected trees have been cut, and there are a number of others in process of removal, radiating in all directions from the orchard as a center to a distance of three miles. Another infection of 143 trees was found in Elk County. It is thought that <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> trees at the centre of infection were diseased in 1909, although it is possible that one of these trees was already infected in 1908. In 1910, 27 additional trees were infected; in 1911, 50 additional trees, and in 1912, 228 additional trees. The disease spread in all directions from the center of infection to a distance of 700 feet. These infections are interesting in showing the rate at which the blight may travel in healthy timber. These infections have all been removed...", "...she did.\" Q. __ \"Are you certain?\" A.--\"I am very positive that she named shooting irons on both occasions. Not so positive as to the first as I am about the last.\" Here comes in the plea of \"reasonable doubt.\" If the witness himself is not absolutely positive as to what occurred, and as to the conversation that took place, how can the jury assume to act upon it as they would upon a matter personally concerning themselves?

About two and a half miles from the well, across the sand-downs and commons, is the little church-town of Cubert. It stands high, overlooking the sand-wastes of Holywell and Perran Bays, and its church serves the purpose of a landmark in this somewhat trackless district. It is Early English in character, with later additions, such as the Decorated woodwork about its roof; the graceful tower has an octagonal upper stage and low spire, with <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bells in the belfry. The church was struck by lightning in 1848, and restored under the care of G. E. Street, R.A. The font, of Norman design, was preserved from mutilation in Puritan times by veiling its beauties beneath a covering of plaster. During the restoration a granite monumental stone was unearthed, of Romano-British character; it has been placed in the wall outside the tower, and its inscription reads _Conectoci fili Tegerno Mali_.

Then they opened the box and took out the fireworks. \"Guess we'll send up a few bombs first, just to wake everybody up,\" said Tom. A minute later a large-sized bomb went whistling upward in the air. It flew high over the college building, to burst with a deafening report. \"Hello, what's that?\" yelled several. \"Who fired that shot?\" \"Did a cannon go off?\" \"It was an aerial...", "...his mind quite a bit. Unless the boy was curiously weak-minded and frightened at the face of a stranger it was the only explanation he could find, yet the boys of Herrara had always struck him as rather bright. In fact Conrad had promoted Juanito to the position of special messenger; he could ride like the wind and never forget a word. The shadows lengthened as he circled the little canon of the Ojo Verde and noted the water dripping from the full tanks, ideal for the colt range for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> months. He took note that Herrara was not neglecting anything, despite that collection of bottles. There was no wastage and the pipes connecting the tanks were in good condition. He rode back, care free and content, through the fragrant valley.

These, together with the work published by the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg under the title of 'Popol Vuh,' must form the starting-point of all critical inquiries into the antiquities of the American people. The first point which has to be determined with regard to books of this kind is whether they are genuine or not: whether they are what they pretend to be--compositions about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> centuries old, founded on the oral traditions and the pictographic documents of the ancient inhabitants of America, and written in the dialects as spoken at the time of Columbus, Cortez, and Pizarro. What the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg has to say on this point amounts to this:--The manuscript was first discovered by Father Francisco Ximenes towards the end of the seventeenth century.

The public buildings do not deserve much notice; the Eagle Theatre, a joint-stock concern, being the only building of much interest. There are, however, several spacious hotels, and two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> banks, that boast some architectural merit, although much, I believe, cannot be said as to their stability. The lateral streets are rather obscure, and, not being regularly built upon, give the city an unfinished look.

You may look for the same herd of antelope, feeding near the same place, about the same hour each day; the same lion stumping the same beat, as regular as a...", "...might sleep,\" confessed De Verne. \"When you have been longer in the trenches, Captain, you will be glad to sleep whenever the chance comes your way.\" \"But that will not be until I have learned more of the ways of your trench life than I know yet,\" Dick rejoined. \"At present I would rather sleep during the daylight, for it appears to be at night that the real things happen.\" De Verne accompanied him back to the fire trench, where Dick was glad to find Captain Ribaut with the other <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> American officers, that party having returned from a trip down the line. De Verne soon after took his leave, hastening rearward to begin his rest. Bang! sounded a field-piece back of the German line. Between the French first-line and second-line trenches the shell exploded. On the heels of the explosion came a furious burst of discharging artillery. \"This must be what you have been expecting, Major,\" shouted Ribaut over the racket. \"A barrage!\" Down the line ran...", "...he had killed a large snake, which crept from under the house; and I supposed that incident had prompted his unusual kindness. The next morning the old cart was loaded with shingles for town. I put Ellen into it, and sent her to her grandmother. Mr. Flint said I ought to have asked his permission. I told him the child was sick, and required attention which I had no time to give. He let it pass; for he was aware that I had accomplished much work in a little time. I had been <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> weeks on the plantation, when I planned a visit home. It must be at night, after every body was in bed. I was six miles from town, and the road was very dreary. I was to go with a young man, who, I knew, often stole to town to see his mother. One night, when all was quiet, we started. Fear gave speed to our steps, and we were not long in performing the journey. I arrived at my grandmother's. Her bed room was on the first floor, and the window was open, the weather being warm. I...", "...before. Another woman was Mary, the wife of Clopas; and another was named Salome, who may have been the mother of the disciples James and John, and the wife of Zebedee the fisherman. These women noticed carefully the place where the body of Jesus was buried. On the next morning, which was the Jewish Sabbath day, the chief priests and leading men among the Jews came to Pilate and said to him: \"We remember, sir, that while this man who deceived the people was alive, he said, 'After <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days in the tomb I will arise again.' Now, then, give orders that the tomb where he is buried be kept under guard for three days. For if it be not watched, his disciples may come and steal his body out of the tomb and hide it; then they will tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead,' and the last false report will do more harm than the first, that he was the King of Israel.\" \"Take a guard of soldiers,\" said Pilate, \"and make it just as sure as you can.\" So they went and...", "...cheers of a vast throng. Mortlake looked round, startled. Out of the distance two tiny dots, momentarily growing larger, like homing birds, had come into view. Hark! What was that the crowd were shouting? Those with field glasses threw the cry out first, and then came a mighty roar, as it was caught up by hundreds of throats. \"The Nameless! The Nameless wins!\" Mortlake paled, and caught at a post erected to hold up a telephone line. He gazed at the oncoming aeroplanes. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of them now, but one was far behind, laboring slowly. But the first was unquestionably the _Golden Butterfly_. He could catch the yellow glint of her wings. And that second craft--its silvery sheen betrayed it--was the Mortlake _Cobweb_, as Roy had called it. \"Come on! Come on!\" shouted Mortlake, uselessly as he knew, \"what's the matter with you?\" But alas, the _Cobweb_ didn't \"come on.\" Some three or four minutes after the _Golden Butterfly_ had alighted and been swallowed...", "...their folly, and to befool themselves, for turning their backs upon the Lord Jesus Christ.

The latter, adopted with great enthusiasm by many generous minds, has exercised a deep influence on modern thought. Manufactures, according to Quesnay, do no more than pay the wages and expenses of the workmen engaged in them. But agriculture not only pays wages and expenses, but produces a surplus, which is the revenue of the land. He divides the nation into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> classes: (1) the productive, which cultivates the soil; (2) the proprietary, which includes the sovereign, the land-owners, and those who live by tithes, in other words the nobility and the clergy; and (3) the sterile, which embraces all men who labor otherwise than in agriculture, and whose expenses are paid by the productive and proprietary classes. Therefore he argues that taxes should be based directly on the net product of real estate, and not on wages nor on chattels. In...", "...another morning, wondering, eager. But on the following morning Sadie Haight, the maid through whom this odd correspondence was passing, had no letter to deliver. The news rather disappointed the daughter of Texas.

Letter number two was waiting; and as she read she gasped.

I am tempted to give you the news at once in one striking and terrible sentence. And I could...", "...animals have grown into women, and along with the development of a more intelligent love, I have seen manifestations of a coquettish mutinous spirit, upon the slightest evidence of partiality on my part, which they have thought to detect in me. I must tell you that Kondje-Gul, who is really a very intelligent girl, had begun to study with great ardour, and it naturally followed that she benefited more from her lessons than the others, who treated them rather as an amusement. In <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> months she learnt French tolerably well--she it was who translated the novels to them. Hence arose a superiority on her side, which must in any case have produced a good deal of envy among the others. On the top of this came her famous excursion to the chateau, concerning which the silly creature gave them marvellous accounts, in order to pose as favourite. I should add that Kondje-Gul, being of an extremely jealous nature, often gave way to violent fits of passion. Hadidje, for...", "...to 5-1/2d. per thousand; possible earnings, 5s. to 6s. per week.

It was not Irving who invested the Hudson with romance, but the Hudson that inspired Irving. When in 1786, Mrs. Josiah Quincy, then a young girl, sailed upon that river in a sloop, she wrote, \"Our captain had a legend for every scene, either supernatural or traditional or of actual occurrence during the war, and not a mountain reared its head unconnected with some marvellous story.\" Irving was then but <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years old, yet Ichabod Crane and Rip Van Winkle or their prototypes were already on the spot waiting for biographers; and it was much the same with Cooper, who was not born until three years later. What was needed was self-confidence and a strong literary desire to take the materials at hand. Irving, Cooper, Dana, had already done this; but Longfellow followed with more varied gifts, more thorough training; the \"Dial\" writers followed in their turn, and a distinctive American...", "...at the great island Sancta Cruz, as it had been named, the adelantado ordered Captain Don Lorenzo, his brother-in-law, to go with the frigate in search of the almiranta, of which I have no favorable conjectures, and which had disappeared on the night that we sighted the island. It was sought on this and on two other occasions, but nothing except the shoals above-mentioned were found.

If one were to leave out of sight the three million slaves, one sixth part of the population, the problem might be regarded as very happily solved. As the consequences of this, in no country is there more talent, or so much awake and active. In the South this unity is attained by sacrificing all the rights of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> million slaves, and almost all the rights of the other colored population. In despotic countries this unity is brought about by the sacrifice of freedom, individual variety of action, in all except the despot and his favorites; so, much of the nation's energy is stifled in the chains of the State, while here it is friendly to institutions which are friendly to it, goes to its work, and approves itself in the vast increase of wealth and comfort throughout the North, where there is...", "...\"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,\" etc. It would have been too pitiable if Burns had left a son who could not feel the spirit of that verse.

She is a lady of fifty or thereabouts, and not very remarkable anyway, nor particularly lady-like. However, she was just come off a rapid journey, having travelled from Naples, with <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> small children, without taking rest, since my letter reached her. A son (this proved to be her new husband) of about twenty had come with her to the Consulate. She was, of course, infinitely grieved about the young man's insanity, and had two or three bursts of tears while we talked the matter over. She said he was the hope of her life,--the best, purest, most innocent child that ever was, and wholly free from every kind of vice. But it appears that he had a previous attack of...", "...in the lower temperature, for Eryx is a peak and a city of fog, often a little world by itself far above the earth, unseen by and unseeing city and plain below, looking down only on the tufted white of rolling mists.

When they had departed, I set off on my round of calls.

It was now <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years since I had seen Sonetchka, and my love for her had long become a thing of the past, yet there still lingered in my heart a sort of clear, touching recollection of our bygone childish affection.

So 'e'll be awright.' And Kiddo stuffed his handkerchief into his trousers pocket, pulled his cap tight, and bent to his barrow-handles. Dicky turned idly to the left, and slouched to the corner of Meakin Street. There he loafed for a little while, and then went as aimlessly up the turning. Meakin Street was much as ever. There were still the chandlers' shops, where tea and sugar were sold by the farthingsworth, and the barber's where hair was fashionably cut for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> half-pence: though Jago hair was commonly cut in another place and received little more attention. There was still Walker's cook-shop, foggy with steam, its windows all a-trickle, and there was the Original Slap-up Tog Emporium, with its kicksies and its benjamins cut saucy as ever, and its double fakements still artful. At the 'dispensary' there was another young student, but his advice and medicine were sixpence, just as his remote predecessor's had been for little Looey, long...", "...14 bays; length of nave, 250 feet: Peterborough, 11 bays; length of nave, 228 feet: Ely, 12 bays; length of nave, 208 feet.

The piers are of alternate design. In front of each an inner shaft runs up to the roof. The string-course above the main arcade has the billet moulding. All the attached shafts in all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> stages have cushion capitals. Under each of the large triforium arches are two smaller ones. Though it has been said that there is no trace of any change of style throughout the entire nave, yet it has been noticed that there is a certain roughness about the execution of the arches towards the east which is not seen further west.

As it is, should the two Ojibbeways be unsuccessful in hunting, they will be very hard pressed for food.\" I agreed in this with Alick, but I thought that Captain Grey would get well in the course of time, without a doctor. I hoped so, indeed, for there was but little prospect of our finding one. As soon as the weather cleared, Alick, Martin, and I set off on snow-shoes with our guns, but returned without having seen even the trace of an animal. For <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days in succession we went out, but came back as unsuccessful as at first. We accordingly, as we had determined, told Captain Grey of our proposal to start forthwith for Fort Ross. He appeared to be very unwilling to let us go. \"I don't wish to detain you on my own account, though I shall be sorry to lose your society,\" he said, \"but Robin will be very solitary without your companionship; and should death overtake me, I dread to think of the situation the poor boy will be...", "...induce Morales to be more considerate with his prisoners.\" Appleby told him about the officer. \"It was perhaps a blunder, but we can afford it just now,\" he said.

It is sometimes a trifle difficult to understand an American,\" he said. \"Now if we can find any peons they shall cut the cane back from the hacienda.

This was significant, because they were not addicted to unnecessary physical effort, but they had reasons for knowing it was advisable for the men who incurred the displeasure of Morales to take precautions, and the cane that rolled close up to the hacienda would in case of an assault afford convenient cover to...", "...girl, and she was drowned, and Manannan killed Fer Ferdiad in his anger. And one time Manannan's cows came up out of the sea at Baile Cronin, three of them, a red, and a white, and a black, and the people that were there saw them standing on the strand for a while, as if thinking, and then they all walked up together, side by side, from the strand. And at that time there were no roads in Ireland, and there was great wonder on the people when they saw a good wide road ready before the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> cows to walk on. And when they got about a mile from the sea they parted; the white cow went to the north-west, towards Luimnech, and the red cow went to the south-west, and on round the coast of Ireland, and the black cow went to the north-east, towards Lis Mor, in the district of Portlairge, and a road opened before each of them, that is to be seen to this day. And some say it was Manannan went to Finn and the Fianna in the form of the Gilla Decair, the Bad Servant, and...", "...for Marlborough. This time they had to go inside the coach, two gentlemen, who had previously secured the seats, kindly giving them up in favor of the wounded young officers, while Sam took his place on the roof, and amused his fellow-passengers with wonderful accounts of his adventures at the war.

Senores, the warships are at it again. With your permission, General.\" He hastily left the room and went off to the walls where he was soon afterwards joined by Jack, who had been hurriedly dismissed by the General. They looked seaward, and saw the performance of a most extraordinary drama. It was now about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> o'clock, and the ocean like a sheet of glass stretched in an inclined plane upward to the distant horizon. Owing to the elevation of the city walls they looked down, as from the heights of an amphitheatre. The ramparts were crowded with spectators, townsfolk and soldiers. Immediately below was the beach, the rebel camp--then the long pier shooting out into the blue, and beyond the flashing expanse of the sea. _The Iturbide_ was lying a quarter of a mile from the shore with her...", "...and pay'.* -- * `Pagar y apelar'. -- By this time the patience and long-suffering of the Governor were quite exhausted. He therefore sent to the Bishop to say a ship was ready to take him down the river, and at the same time reminded him of his promise at Yaguaron to obey the order of the Viceroy of Peru. He sent the message by the royal notary, Gomez de Coyeso, who accordingly repaired to the convent of San Francisco. At the door a priest appeared, armed with a javelin, who <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> times tried to wound the notary, on which the Governor stationed a band of fifty soldiers at the convent gate, in spite of the presence of the statues of the Blessed Virgin and San Blas. Then, having published an edict that the Bishop was deposed, he proceeded to elect another in his stead. One of the canons, Don Cristobal Sanchez, who had governed the diocese during the interregnum before the advent of Don Bernardino, still lived in retirement near the town. The Governor...", "...so greatly, both in its height and figure, that one might reasonably imagine he had never seen it. \"It is true, that if we measure its height by the three mountains you are obliged to ascend in going to it, there is not much abatement to be made of the 600 feet, which the map of M.

As we can only approach the cascade on one side, nor see it but in the profile, it is not easy to measure its height by instruments: experiments have been made to do it by a long cord, tied to a pole, and after having often attempted this manner, it was found...", "...she was put in the saddle again. Over and over during the night this was repeated until at dawn Rhoda was barely conscious that after being lifted to the ground she was not remounted but was covered carefully and left in peace. It was late in the afternoon again when Rhoda woke. She pushed aside her blankets and tried to get up but fell back with a groan. The stiffness of the previous days was nothing whatever to the misery that now held every muscle rigid. The overexertion of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> nights in the saddle which the massaging had so far mitigated had asserted itself and every muscle in the girl's body seemed acutely painful. To lift her hand to her hair, to draw a long breath, to turn her head, was almost impossible. Rhoda looked dismally about her. The camp this time was on the side of a mountain that lay in a series of mighty ranges, each separated from the other by a narrow strip of desert. White and gold gleamed the snow-capped peaks. Purple and...", "...never burns. A scholar who had come from Greece troubled the court by putting the question: To whom was paid the price with which we were bought according to I Cor. 6 : 20; 7 : 23. Charlemagne himself has other questions. He is troubled by finding that the hymn sung by Christ and his disciples after the Last Supper has not been recorded by any of the Gospels. I wonder if he really was satisfied by Alcuin's answer. After a very learned explanation of the term hymn, Alcuin gives, first, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> views of different interpreters: (1) That there was no special hymn, only a general praisegiving; (2) that they had sung the twenty-second Psalm; (3) that it was some Jewish prayer. Then he proceeds to establish his own solution: that it is, in fact, the prayer of Jesus, recorded in John 17, which was meant by the word hymn here. Incidentally, he makes some important remarks upon the harmony of the Gospels: \"Although we see in the Gospels some things told similarly, others in a...", "...race, notwithstanding the assertion of the author of Trivia to the contrary.[5] [5] \"On doors the sallow milk maid chalks her gains.

The following account respecting the three men that were left on the uninhabited island, is given in a note of the same work, and said to be extracted from a religious tract, No. 579, issued by the Society in Paternoster Row. 'On the 26th of December the boats left the island: this was, indeed, a trying moment to all: they separated with mutual prayers and good wishes, seventeen[45] venturing to sea with almost certain death before them, while <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> remained on a rocky isle, destitute of water, and affording hardly anything to support life. The prospects of these three poor men were gloomy: they again tried to dig a well, but without success, and all hope seemed at an end, when providentially they were relieved by a shower of rain. They were thus delivered from the immediate apprehension of perishing by thirst. Their next care was to procure food, and their difficulties herein were also very great; their principal resource...", "...into search doe runne To finde what mischiefe they haue lately done, Which so preferres them; say thou he doth rise, That maketh vertue his chiefe exercise.

These mutes had their virtues; thus some of them were very kind to each other, and especially to those from the outer forest world who came hither to bid farewell to that world, and others, renouncing marriage and all earthly joys, devoted their lives, which appeared to be long, to the worship of...", "...the last money I had in hand for missionary objects. As to this latter point, my heart had been especially longing to be able to send again help to home and foreign laborers, knowing how very great the need of many is. Thus I was situated with regard to means, when I received to-day one thousand pounds. Since March 5, 1834, I have received above forty-four thousand pounds altogether [up to May 26, 1850, only]; and so has the Lord enlarged the work and helped me that during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years I have had the privilege of paying away in his service, in connection with this work, about twenty-five thousand pounds; nor have I had during this period, in any one instance, to meet a payment without being previously provided by the Lord with means for it.

We were sitting on the steps with our pipes, shortly afterwards, when she said: \"Why don't you go into the house?\" \"It smells too strongly of paint,\" I answered. \"But you had better go in,\" said she, and shuffled off. When we entered, behold! there were three glasses of very good Marsala on the table. \"How do you sell your milk?\" I asked her. \"That kind is <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> skillings a dram,\" she answered. The secret probably was that she had no license to sell wine. I was reminded of an incident which occurred to me in Maine, during the prevalence of the prohibitory law. I was staying at an hotel in a certain town, and jestingly asked the landlord: \"Where is the Maine Law? I should like to see it.\" \"Why,\" said he, \"I have it here in the house;\"' and he unlocked a back room and astonished me with the sight of a private bar, studded with full...", "...hopefully. \"How could he?\" Dave wanted to know. \"Maybe he went last night.\" \"I doubt if he could get away, even last night, at the hour when we turned him adrift,\" Darrin contended. \"A man might have gone a quarter of a mile, but he couldn't go a whole mile.\" \"He hasn't been out to-day, at any rate,\" declared Dick. \"There isn't a trace of a track anywhere near the shack.\" \"Let's dig up to that window and look in,\" suggested Dave. This was done. A few minutes later the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> boys stood at the window, glancing in at all they could see of the small interior.

I do not know exactly how many rooms were opened on this occasion, but I should think there were fully a dozen.

The young coach was now in a position to lend Mrs. Moreen <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> louis, and he sent her a post-office order even for a larger amount. In return for this favour he received a frantic scribbled line from her: \"Implore you to come back instantly--Morgan dreadfully ill.\" They were on there rebound, once more in Paris--often as Pemberton had seen them depressed he had never seen them crushed--and communication was therefore rapid.

The hard and fast term of three months which prevails in Ireland for small loans is unsuited to the requirements of the agricultural industry--as for instance, when a man borrows money to sow a crop, and has to repay it before harvest. The society borrows at four or five per cent, and lends at five or six per cent. In some cases the Congested Districts Board or the Department of Agriculture have made loans to these banks at <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> per cent. This enables the societies to lend at the popular rate of one penny for the use of one pound for a month. The expenses of administration are very small. As the credit of these associations develops, they will become a depository for the savings of the community, to the great advantage of both lender and borrower. The latter generally makes an enormous profit out of these loans, which have accordingly gained the name of 'the lucky money,' and we find, in practice, that...", "...of this misunderstanding for a rupture and to make war upon us, we will do our best to wage war on him.

She had been used to <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> in the kitchen, and she should not be doing her duty by herself if she said she could do with less. Raban let them all go, with a couple of years' wages. For the present he only wanted to be left alone. He stayed on with a groom and a couple of countrywomen sent in by Mrs. Brand. They clattered about the great kitchen, and their red shock heads might be seen half a mile off.

Nevertheless he had persevered, groaning in spirit as he thought of the burden with which he was about to inflict himself. Then had come the release. Sir Thomas had explained to him that no money would be forthcoming; and the young lady had made to him a foolish proposition, which, as he thought, fully justified him in regarding the match as at an end. And then he had three days in which to make up his mind. It may be a question whether three days are ever much better than <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> minutes for such a purpose. A man's mind will very generally refuse to make itself up until it be driven and compelled by emergency. The three days are passed not in forming but in postponing judgment. In nothing is procrastination so tempting as in thought. So it came to pass, that through the Thursday, the Friday, and the Saturday, Frank Houston came to no conclusion, though he believed that every hour of the time was devoted to forming one. Then, as he ate his dinner on...", "...maintained his prerogative, and who had even extended it into some points esteemed doubtful, now made an imprudent concession, of which the consequences might have proved fatal to royal authority; he voluntarily offered, that the money voted should be paid to a committee of parliament, and should be issued by them, without being intrusted to his management.[**] The commons willingly accepted of this concession, so unusual in an English monarch: they voted him only three subsidies and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> fifteenths:[***] and they took no notice of the complaints which he made of his own wants and necessities. Advantage was also taken of the present good agreement between the king and parliament, in order to pass the bill against monopolies, which had formerly been encouraged by the king, but which had failed by the rupture between him and the last house of commons. This bill was conceived in such terms as to render it merely declaratory; and all monopolies were condemned, as...", "...was sufficient to pass the death-sentence upon a slave. The president of the court was the man's own master--Loftus Vaughan, Esquire, proprietor of Mount Welcome, and _custos rotulorum_ of the precinct. The substance of the crime charged against Chakra was \"practising the arts of Obi.\" The charge had no reference to the death of his former master. The proofs were not very clear; but were deemed sufficiently so by the court to warrant a conviction. Strange to say that of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> justices, the man's own master--the president of the court--appeared the most anxious to bring the trial to this termination. So anxious indeed, that he used every effort to overrule the opinions of the other two: his superior position as _custos_ giving him a certain power of controlling the decision. One of them had actually pronounced in favour of an acquittal; but after a whispering consultation with the custos, he retracted his former opinion, and gave his vote for the...", "...afterward she writes, \"My ever dear Sister, I think I have not written you since the death of our beloved Sarah, which is nearly eight months ago.

From this illness I am but just recovering. So you see, my beloved sister, my outward circumstances have been sufficient to prevent my writing. Nor is this all--for some time after little Sarah's departure, I was too much distressed to write; I felt assured that God had taken her away from us in love, and was also assured, that she is a happy angel in heaven; but oh the thought that we should see her no more on earth, filled me with _indescribable sorrow_.

The faint light showed him only a blurred and indistinct landscape; and in the crisp stillness the leather of his saddle creaked a monotonous accompaniment to the horse's hoofs, which struck the road with clean-cut staccato sharpness. Meanwhile, in the big best room on the ground floor of Donna Marcella's house, Porter...", "...Cochrane and myself, aided by Col.

At the last session of Congress, we succeeded in procuring an appropriation on account of this debt of $250,000 in money and $250,000 in bonds of the United States.

We could hear them from afar, for the great wagons were drawn by four or five span of travel-worn horses or mules, and above the hames of each poor beast was an arch hung with from <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> to five clear-toned bells, that jingled merrily as their carriers moved along, guided by a happy-go-lucky driver, usually singing or whistling a gleeful tune. Both man and beast looked longingly toward the town, which promised companionship and revelry to the one, and rest and fodder to the other. We overtook similar wagons, heavily laden with goods bound for Santa Fe. Most of the drivers were shrewd; all of them civil.

The hard coats enable the seeds to remain uninjured for a long time in the water, in case one or two cells of the papery pods are broken open; and after the tough pod has decayed and the seeds have sunken to the moist earth among the sticks and dead leaves, they can have all the time they need for the slow...", "...even if it's only as a coroner.

He had been shot through the back at the battle of Nalinnes, and was <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days on the battlefield before he was picked up. Now he lay dying in a little side room off the ward. The least movement caused him acute agony, even the pillow had to be moved an inch at a time before it could be turned, and it took half an hour to change his shirt.

But if he was alive the next morning he would be put in those horrible springless carts, and jolted, jolted down to the station, taken...", "...If several stories are intended in such erections, they do not fail to place beams to support the floors before they build higher. Of such buildings I never saw any consisting of more than three floors at most; generally they have but two. When the building is thus finished, it is left for some months to dry; then such as wish to make the building more solid and durable, give it a rough-cast coating on the outside with lime and sand.

The size of the sides would of course depend upon the age of the individual. A Female at birth would be about an inch long, while a tall adult Woman might extend to a foot. As to the Males of every class, it may be roughly said that the length of an adult's sides, when added together, is three feet or a little more. But the size of...", "...of two or three days.

When less than one, from five to twenty fields will be counted. A wound that retains a count of one bacillus to two fields or less for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> observations, is considered bacteriologically clean, and suitable for operation. If the wound is a compound fracture, it is advisable to close the wound, converting it into a simple fracture. If this can be done without exerting too great tension on the sutures. If the wound is a flesh wound, and can be drawn together without too great tension, its closure is indicated.

Coincident with this increase is a decrease in the bulk of the body, showing that fat is changed to muscle.

It supplied just the gaps in which she was deficient, and gave her an adequate grasp of her <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> toughest subjects.

Stated in other language these three truths are the mortal nature of man, the Christ of God and His Millennial Kingdom. Standing opposite to these Satan has placed three great untruths, human immortality, the Antichrist and a certain delusion which is best described as race hatred--in reality murder, the spirit of the very Devil.

The thought of this day had gone with her in the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years that had passed, like a radiant gleam, a glorious presence that brightened and idealized every experience of life, a rainbow that glorified every black cloud, and there had been some clouds in her life black enough to bring out the rainbows' colors too; as when her mother's serious illness had called her back from the city, where she was attending school.

This was met by Mr. Gladstone with a direct negative. The most remarkable speeches delivered were those of Sir Robert Peel and Mr. Cobden. Mr. Cobden combated the notion that if the corn-laws were repealed, the whole system of revenue must be cut down; and declared that the anti-corn-law league would persist in agitation until the attainment of their object. On a division, the motion was rejected by a majority of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred and eighty-one against one hundred and twenty-five. Another general debate on the same subject occupied the house on the 13th of June, when Lord John Russell again proposed the consideration of the corn-laws in a committee of the whole house; which, however, was negatived by a large majority. But, previous to this debate, a measure partially effecting the operation of the corn-laws had been proposed in the house of commons by Lord Stanley, the secretary for the colonies....", "...with the steamboat interest of the Mississippi.

The seventeenth century, in contrast to the idealistic sixteenth, witnessed the advent of modern realism in almost all departments of thought.

At nine, by an accidental breaking of the fog, we saw the high cape on the north shore that has been just mentioned, bearing east, at about a mile distance; but we had entirely lost sight of the Tamar. At half an hour after <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> in the morning, we suddenly perceived ourselves close to a high land on the south shore, upon which we wore, and brought to the northward. The gale still continued, if possible, with increasing violence, and the rain poured down in torrents, so that we were in a manner immersed in water, and expected every moment to be among the breakers. The long-wished-for day at length broke, but the weather was still so thick that no land was to be seen, though we knew it could not be far...", "...that he excited the wonder of his superiors. With a steadiness unshaken by the thunders of battle, he directed his guns with unerring skill, and no insignificant share of the glory was his as he steadfastly held the enemy at bay.

At Cold Harbor he engaged <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> batteries of the enemy with a single Napoleon, and throughout the entire day stubbornly held his position, dealing destruction and death to the enemy. Shortly after the battle of Cold Harbor Pelham's battery engaged a gunboat at the \"White House\" and compelled it to withdraw. By this time, Pelham had gained the reputation of a famous boy fighter, and his steadiness in battle would have done credit to a seasoned veteran. His battery became famous, was the subject of general...", "...before you look for people.

Although the paper was exclusively devoted to music, the _Censur_ apparently took <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four months to make up its mind whether the state was in danger or not from the immigration of a new musical periodical. The editor confesses that he did not find as much sympathy as he had expected in Vienna; yet the city--as he writes some years later at Duesseldorf--\"continues to attract one, as if the spirits of the departed great masters were still visible, and as if it were the real musical home of Germany.\" \"Eating and drinking here are incomparable.

The first, propelled by the slow-dipping blades of two Brazilian bushmen, seemed to be seeking something; for it nosed along with frequent pauses of the paddles, during which it drifted almost to a stop while its crew searched the solemn jungle depths reaching away from the right-hand shore. The second, carrying <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bronzed and bearded men of another continent, was only trailing the leader. It moved and paused like the first, but the recurrent scrutiny of the farther gloom by its paddlers was that of men who saw only a meaningless, monotonous bulk of buttresses and trunks and tangle of looping lianas. In this dimness and bewildering chaos the trio might as well have been blind. The eyes of the tiny fleet were in the first boat. The progress of the dugouts was almost stealthy.

In the team of the last sledge there were \"Barnet\" and \"Pan,\" who all the time had been mortal enemies.

The slaughter of an innocent baby sounds very shocking in modern ears, but it is just to remember that the Kamakura chief and his <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> younger brothers would all have been executed by Kiyomori had not their escape been contrived by special agencies. The Confucian doctrine, which had passed into the bushi's code, forbade a man to live under the same sky with his father's slayer. Deeds like the killing of Yoshitsune's son were the natural consequence of that doctrine. Meanwhile, Yoshitsune had been passing from one place of concealment to another in the three contiguous provinces of Izumi, Yamato, and Kii. He...", "...and rain-water will almost certainly answer every purpose, and the same proportions will probably be found to work well. _Rings for Bubbles._ These may be made of any kind of wire. I have used tinned iron about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter. The joint should be smoothly soldered without lumps. If soldering is a difficulty, then use the thinnest wire that is stiff enough to support the bubbles steadily, and make the joint by twisting the end of the wire round two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> times. Rings two inches in diameter are convenient. I have seen that dipping the rings in melted paraffin is recommended, but I have not found any advantage from this. The nicest material for the light rings is thin aluminium wire, about as thick as a fine pin (No. 26 to 30, B. W. G.), and as this cannot be soldered, the ends must be twisted. If this is not to be had, very fine wire, nearly as fine as a hair (No. 36, B. W. G.), of copper or of any other metal, will answer.

The first of these, in armour, is standing in an uncomfortable attitude awaiting his turn, and shows himself so eager to throw that he appears not to be feeling the discomfort; the other, raising his eyebrows, with his mouth and with his eyes wide open, is watching the dice, in suspicion, as it were, of fraud, and shows clearly to anyone who studies him the desire...", "...and Negroes, is only 10.7 per cent., while the lowest per cent. of illiteracy in any country in South America is 50 and the highest nearly 90.

In Abyssinia is the old Coptic Church which is without much real Christian life. _Pagan Africa_ comprises the greatest...", "...fashion, she was still the unquestioned sovereign. Throughout Europe, there was now no one who doubted the unadorned truth of the story concerning the Man in Black; for it seemed that no mortal agency could have kept any woman so perennially young. As the years passed, folk fell to speculating on how many drops of the precious rose-colored liquid might still remain in the phial. And, in scared voices, they repeated the prophecy of the man in black: \"~You shall see me once again <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days before your death.~\" Perhaps, now that you know Ninon better, you may laugh less contemptuously at the tale of the Man in Black; or, at the least, credit her with believing it. Throughout her life, she never changed the story in any way; nor could the shrewdest cross-examining lead her to contradict herself about any of its most minute details. A haunting fear of the Man in Black's promised return was always in her mind, even during her gayest days and nights. As late...", "...type. He is more complex, and, accordingly, more disturbing.

Many of these communications were from government and state officials in California and Oregon, and addressed to the Federal authorities at Washington, particularly to Senators and Representatives from these states and to authorities of the War Department.

Indeed, Arjuna and the other Pandava princes became so powerful that they slew in battle the great Sauvira who had performed a sacrifice extending over <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years, undaunted by the raids of the Gandharvas. And the king of the Yavanas himself whom the powerful Pandu even had failed to bring under subjection was brought by Arjuna under control. Then again Vipula, the king of the Sauviras, endued with great prowess, who had always shown a disregard for the Kurus, was made by the intelligent Arjuna to feel the edge of his power. And Arjuna also repressed by means of his arrows (the pride of) king Sumitra of Sauvira, also known by the name...", "...then, if anything, only a symptom which may or may not demand treatment. That hypertension leads to the production of sclerosis of the arteries has been repeatedly affirmed here. In certain cases it is good and should not be experimented with. In other cases it is bad and some treatment to reduce the tension must be tried. The main point is to regard hypertension as one regards a compensated heart lesion. Prof. T. Clifford Allbutt divides the causes of arteriosclerosis clinically into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> classes: (1) The toxic class--the results of poisons of the most part of extrinsic origin, chiefly those of certain infections. In some of these diseases, the blood pressures, as for example, in syphilis, are ordinarily unaffected; in others, as in lead poisoning, they are raised.

If ever a nation was ripe for the introduction of a foreign religion, that nation was Japan at that time. The national cult was silent, or almost so, in regard to the destiny of man and many other questions which religion is expected to answer.

Bishop Gore finds it in the two earliest of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> Creeds, 'in which Catholic consent is especially expressed;' and in a half apologetic manner he adds that this Catholic basis has been 'generally understood' to imply 'an unrealisable but not therefore unreal appeal to a General Council.'[36] No revision, therefore, of the Church's doctrinal formularies can be made except by the authority of a court which can never, by any possibility, be summoned!

But in this respect no comet would seem to have been comparable with that of 1528, of which Andrew Pare writes as follows: 'This comet was so horrible and dreadful, and engendered such terror in the minds of men, that they died, some from fear alone, others from illness engendered by fear. It was of immense length and blood-red colour; at its head was seen the figure of a curved arm, holding a large sword in the hand as if preparing to strike. At the point of this sword were <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> stars; and on either side a number of axes, knives, and swords covered with blood, amongst which were many hideous human faces with bristling beards and hair.' Such peculiarities of shape, and also those affecting the position and movements of comets, were held to be full of meaning. As Bayle pointed out in his 'Thoughts about the Comet of 1680,' these fancies are of great antiquity. Pliny tells us that in his time astrologers claimed to interpret the meaning of a comet's...", "...we had lengthy conversations. Mr. DULLES.

Even if only two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of these hit the public taste, the profitable speculations pay for the bad, and the publisher pays his way by grafting, as it were, one book upon another.

Let me point out the great principle expressed in this mysterious number. It has other more particular applications, but this one general principle underlies them all. It is an established maxim that every unity contains in itself a trinity, just as the individual man consists of body, soul, and spirit. If we would perfectly understand anything, we must be able to comprehend it in its threefold nature; therefore in symbolic numeration the multiplying of the unit by <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> implies the completeness of that for which the unit stands; and, again, the threefold repetition of a number represents its extension to infinity. Now mark what results if we apply these representative methods of numerical expression to the principles of Oneness and of separateness respectively. Oneness is Unity, and 1 x 3 = 3, which, intensified to its highest expression, is written as 333. Now apply the same method to the idea of separateness.

Thus the valley of the Rio Chico is about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> miles broad, whilst the river, at the time I am speaking of, rather swollen by recent rains, was only some two hundred yards in width. The valley of the Rio Gallegos is much broader even than that of the Rio Chico, while one can almost jump over the river itself in summer.

The following description was given of this condition: By seating land is meant that they build a house upon and keep a good stock of hogs and cattle, and servants to take care of them and to improve and plant the land.

Thus the Fulgosio tomb in the Santo, and the superaltar in the Eremitani at Padua (though much disfigured by paint), show that Giovanni da Pisa was influenced by Donatello to a remarkable degree. The composition of the altar consists of a broad relief of the Madonna with three saints on either side of her: below it is a _predella_ divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> panels; above, a frieze of dancing children similar to those on the pulpits of San Lorenzo. The composition is crowned by a tympanum and _putti_ suggested by Donatello's Annunciation.

As far as I can judge from Chaldean and Assyrian sculptures, wings were given to the lesser deities as our artists assign them to modern angels. The Babylonian Apollyon, by whatever name he went, was winged--but so were all the good gods. The Egyptians seem to have assigned wings only to the favourable divinities. The Jews had in their mythology a set of fiery flying serpents, but we must notice that their cherubim and seraphim were all winged, some with no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> pairs--much as Hindoo gods have four heads and six, or any other number of arms. Mr. Newton assumes that the dragon mentioned in Rev. xii. was a winged creature, but it is clear from the context, especially from verses 14 and 15, that he had no pinions, for he was unable to follow the woman to whom two aerial oars had been given. The dragon, as we know it, is, I believe, a mediaeval creation; such a creature is only spoken of in the Bible in the book of Revelation, and the...", "...1879), is designed primarily for college classes in Anglo-Saxon, rather than for independent investigators or for seekers after a restored or ideal text. The need of an American edition of \"Beowulf\" has long been felt, as, hitherto, students have had either to send to Germany for a text, or secure, with great trouble, one of the scarce and expensive English editions. Heyne's first edition came out in 1863, and was followed in 1867 and 1873 by a second and a third edition, all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> having essentially the same text. So many important contributions to the \"Beowulf\" literature were, however, made between 1873 and 1879 that Heyne found it necessary to put forth a new edition (1879). In this new, last edition, the text was subjected to a careful revision, and was fortified by the views, contributions, and criticisms of other zealous scholars. In it the collation of the unique \"Beowulf\" Ms. (Vitellius A. 15: Cottonian Mss. of the British Museum), as made by E....", "...now and then, as if to temper her brightness with a little shade. Her descriptions of scenery are specially vivid and delightful, and very often full of poetry.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> _voyageurs_ had many adventures to relate and much to say about the wild beauty of the upper Saguenay, its _portages_, waterfalls, tributary streams, and especially about the solitary beauty of the lonely Lake St. John.

Once or twice he went down Crane Alley, and lumbered up <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> pair of stairs to the garret where Kitts had his studio,--got him orders, in fact, for two portraits; and when that pale-eyed young man, in a fit of confidence, one night, with a very red face drew back the curtain from his grand \"Fall of Chapultepec,\" and watched him with a lean and hungry look, Knowles, who knew no more about painting than a gorilla, walked about, looking through his fist at it, saying, \"how fine the chiaroscuro was, and that it was a devilish good thing...", "...In defense of his course, Jack referred to the treatment which he had received while in servitude under his old master, in something like the following words: \"I served under my young master's father, thirty-five years, and from him received kind treatment.

Burnside, at his invitation, came to that part of the field, and after listening to the views of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> generals, either of whom was vastly his superior as a soldier, approved the plan and promised to give a written order for its execution. Franklin waited all night for the order, telegraphed twice, and finally sent a staff officer for it, but it never came. Indeed it was never issued but a different order directing him to seize the heights at Hamilton's House, nearly three miles from his right division, and to keep the whole of his command in readiness to move at once, was sent...", "...don't say that? You're to be married again in your own religion.\" The young wife repeated: \"I can never part with it.\" \"But, my dear!\" the wretched Berry wrung her hands, divided between compassion and a sense of injury. \"My dear!\" she kept expostulating like a mute. \"I know all that you would say, Mrs. Berry. I am very grieved to pain you. It is mine now, and must be mine. I cannot give it back.\" There she sat, suddenly developed to the most inflexible little heroine in the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> Kingdoms. From her first perception of the meaning of the young bride's words, Mrs. Berry, a shrewd physiognomist, knew that her case was hopeless, unless she treated her as she herself had been treated, and seized the ring by force of arms; and that she had not heart for. \"What!\" she gasped faintly, \"one's own lawful wedding-ring you wouldn't give back to a body?\" \"Because it is mine, Mrs. Berry.

In these straits, after struggling for some months against their wretched plight, the lads were obliged to leave Salamanca, and beg their way home, tramping barefoot through France and Italy, till they made their way back to Rome, where they found their father harsher and more unkind than ever. This happened in the early part of the reign of Clement VIII, famed for his justice. The <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> youths resolved to apply to him, to grant them an allowance out of their father's immense income. They consequently repaired to Frascati, where the pope was building the beautiful Aldobrandini Villa, and stated their case. The pope admitted the justice of their claims, and ordered Francesco, to allow each of them two thousand crowns a year. He endeavoured by every possible means to evade this decree, but the pope's orders were too stringent to be disobeyed. About this period he...", "...on poets and poetry. Latterly this neglect of him by public men preyed on the spirit of Burns, and was seldom absent from his thoughts. It added force, no doubt, to the rapture with which he, like all the younger poets of the time, hailed the French Revolution, and the fancied dawn of that day, which would place plebeian genius and worth in those high places, whence titled emptiness and landed incapacity would be at length thrust ignominiously down. Burns had not been more than <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> months in Dumfries, before he (p. 145) found an opportunity of testifying by deed his sympathy with the French Revolutionists. At that time the whole coast of the Solway swarmed with smuggling vessels, carrying on a contraband traffic, and manned by men of reckless character, like the Dirk Hatteraick of _Guy Mannering_. In 1792, a suspicious-looking brig appeared in the Solway, and Burns, with other excisemen, was set to watch her motions. She got into shallow water, when the...", "...appointed many of them to Buddhist temples under the pretext of their having to learn Siamese, but in reality to observe their procedure as the priests were neither suited for, nor willing to act as spies.

He was accompanied by <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> Siamese Ambassadors equally distinguished by birth and ability and who were in charge of some rich gifts for the King of France. The object of this mission was to demand that engineers should be sent to instruct the Siamese in the art of fortification and in the methods of attack and defence of positions. They were also empowered to request a body of troops to perfect the Siamese in military evolutions. The French officers and soldiers who remained in Siam abused the...", "...sumptuous library.

When Kedzie had saved two or three nations and kept the United States from war the millionaire would regret that she was, after all, only a boy and be overcome with rapture when she told him the truth.

Then rouse me.\" He put his head on her lap and fell asleep. While he slept, the princess took <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hairs from his head and hid them in her bosom. As soon as she had hidden the hairs, she saw the urfeist coming on the sea, great as an island, and throwing up water to the sky as he moved. She roused the stranger, who sprang up to defend her. The urfeist came upon shore, and was advancing on the princess with mouth open and wide as a bridge, when the stranger stood before him and said: \"This woman is mine, not yours!\" Then drawing his sword of light, he swept off the...", "...you will be too much for me, _bon ami_.\" The other accepted the hand after an instant of hesitation and was dragged to his feet.

After inquiry as to how this came about, Julia learnt that it was found necessary to give the workmen a holiday on the principal day. They got so drunk the night before, that most of them were unfit for work, and a few even had the hardihood to stop away entirely, so as to devote the whole day to getting drunk again. Under these circumstances, Mijnheer made a virtue of...", "...and I drove up in my little Neuhaus carriage to the Nuss-Baum Platz, and saw the well-known glass gallery; the pretty landlady, too, came to the door, but somewhat aged and altered. Neither the dreadful storms, nor the various discomforts I had endured, annoyed me half so much as not being able to remain at Interlaken, consequently for the first time since I left Vevay I was out of humour for half an hour, and obliged to [Music] sing Beethoven's adagio in A flat major, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four times over, before I could recover my equanimity. I learned here, for the first time, the damage the storm had already done, and may yet do, for the rain is still incessant. _Half-past Nine o'clock at Night._--The bridge at Zweiluetschenen is carried away; the _vetturini_ from Brienz, and Grindelwald, will not encounter the risk of driving home, from the fear of some rock falling on their heads.

You can't back a raft upstream, you can't hurry it downstream, you can't scatter out to one side when you haven't any room to speak of, you won't take to the perpendicular cliffs on the other shore when they appear to be blasting there, too. Your resources are limited, you see. There is simply nothing for it but to watch and pray. For some hours we had been making <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> and a half or four miles an hour and we were still making that. We had been dancing right along until those men began to shout; then for the next ten minutes it seemed to me that I had never seen a raft go so slowly. When the first blast went off we raised our sun-umbrellas and waited for the result. No harm done; none of the stones fell in the water. Another blast followed, and another and another. Some of the rubbish fell in the water just astern of us. We ran that whole...", "...Not an inch further.

This communication is rather a story of his artistic development than of the incidents of his life, but it is a fascinating piece of self-examination, and throws more light than anything else upon the motives which led to the composition of the most famous of Wagner's dramas. It was at this time that he entered upon the task of writing his long-cherished \"Death of Siegfried,\" which he had shaped into a drama in <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> acts and a prologue in the autumn of 1848. It was in June, 1849, that he wrote to Liszt that he would have the drama completed in half a year. In the spring of 1851 Liszt learned that there was to be a prefatory drama called \"Young Siegfried,\" and on June 29 Wagner wrote to him that the poem was finished. On Nov. 20 of the same year Wagner wrote a long letter, in which he set forth the development of the entire plan. He had found that his story was too long and complex to tell in...", "...as well as to the comfort of the people by whose authority and resources they have been effected, from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 of the annual income of the nation have, by laws enacted at the three most recent sessions of Congress, been applied, without intrenching upon the necessities of the Treasury, without adding a dollar to the taxes or debts of the community, without suspending even the steady and regular discharge of the debts contracted in former days, which within the same <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years have been diminished by the amount of nearly $16,000,000. The same observations are in a great degree applicable to the appropriations made for fortifications upon the coasts and harbors of the United States, for the maintenance of the Military Academy at West Point, and for the various objects under the superintendence of the Department of the Navy. The report from the Secretary of the Navy and those from the subordinate branches of both the military departments exhibit...", "...evidenced throughout 1913. The King and Queen attended in Berlin the wedding of the Kaiser's daughter, and the popular Press, in picture and paragraph, told the genial British public what a thoroughly delightful girl the Kaiser's daughter was. The Kaiser let off loud \"Hochs!\" of friendly pride, and the Press of the world responded with warm \"Hochs\" of admiration and tribute; and the Kaiser, glowing with generous warmth, celebrated the occasion by releasing and handsomely pardoning <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of those very British \"spies\" to whose incarceration in German fortresses (Sabre recalled) the intense Otway had attached such deep significance. This was a signal for more mutual \"Hochs.\" Later the Prince of Wales visited Germany and made there an extended stay of nine weeks; and in June the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Emperor William's accession was \"Hoch'd\" throughout the German Empire and admiringly \"Hoch'd\" back again from all quarters of the civilised globe.

For the third time the Congress of the United States are assembled to commemorate the life and the death of a president slain by the hand of an assassin. The attention of the future historian will be attracted to the features which reappear with startling sameness in all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of these awful crimes: the uselessness, the utter lack of consequence of the act; the obscurity, the insignificance of the criminal; the blamelessness--so far as in our sphere of existence the best of men may be held blameless--of the victim. Not one of our murdered presidents had an enemy in the world; they were all of such preeminent purity of life that no pretext could be given for the attack of passional crime; they were all men of democratic instincts, who could never have...", "...fourteen, quite naked, and with a skin as tough as that of an alligator, ordered her to the well with a large bucket.

As I could not make her understand what I wanted, I was obliged to drink the whisky with water almost tepid, and my horse being refreshed, I paid my fare and started. I rode for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hours more, and was confident of having performed twice the distance named by mine host of the morning, and yet the prairie still extended as far as the eye could reach, and I could not perceive the city of Caledonia. Happily, I discovered a man at a distance riding towards me: we soon met. \"How far,\" said I, \"to Caledonia city?\" \"Eighteen miles,\" answered the traveller. \"Is there no farm on the way?\" I rejoined, \"for my horse is tired.\" The horseman stared at me in...", "...before us. B. (an old hunter in the States) had grasped the situation, and thenceforward refused to undertake the heavy work tramping through these woods entailed, when it was practically labour wasted. In future he devoted his attention to fishing and duck shooting. It was possible to bag a few stray duck, but although at certain seasons of the year the fishing is unrivalled in Pend d'Oreille Lake, when we were there, it was not worth mentioning. We shifted camp, and for two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days I persevered unsuccessfully with the rifle. Once, selecting the bald summit of a ridge where there were plenty of deer-trails as our point of operations, Texas and I lay hidden and watched from late in the afternoon till dark, when we bivouacked on the ground.

As though to prove the truth of the statement, a tongue of water curled itself softly about the plants, sucked deep into the roots, and when it went its way, the cannaes went with it, and only a hollow was left in the great bed, and this was quickly filled with water. \"It has risen three feet since last evening,\" said Hester, who had been standing silent, estimating the distance. There were exclamations of wonder, surprise, and fear. To many, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> feet of a rise in water meant no more than a Greek syllable. They had not been reared near a river, and knew nothing of what might be expected in the way of floods. \"Three feet is nothing,\" said Hester with the air of one who knew all there was to know of such matters. \"Why, a June flood is generally seven feet at home. We do not think much about it. And September floods--we do not always have them, but we wouldn't think of calling it a flood unless the river rose at least five...", "...as he pleases.

The prince said: \"Good-bye, Genevieve, and be quite easy in your mind. I am there.\" He shut the gate, turned round and gave a slight start. Opposite him stood the man with the eye-glass, Baron Altenheim, with his head held well up, his broad shoulders, his powerful frame. They looked at each other for two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> seconds, in silence. The baron smiled. Then the baron said: \"I was waiting for you, Lupin.\" For all his self-mastery, Sernine felt a thrill pass over him. He had come to unmask his adversary; and his adversary had unmasked him at the first onset. And, at the same time, the adversary was accepting the contest boldly, brazenly, as though he felt sure of victory. It was a swaggering thing to do and gave evidence of no small amount of pluck.

But Frank had seen the move, and ducked, closing in as he did so, and the bullet sped harmlessly over his head, imbedding itself in the door. Frank...", "...supplied the crowning illustration. At Eton, in his time, the engrossment with classics was such as to keep out religious instruction! As not many contend that Latin and Greek make an education in themselves, we may not improperly call to mind what other things it has been found possible to include with them in the scope of the Arts' Degree. The Scotch Universities were always distinguished from the English in the breadth of their requirements: they have comprised, for many ages, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> other subjects; mathematics, natural philosophy, and mental philosophy (including logic and ethics). In exceptional instances, another science is added; in one case, natural history, in another, chemistry.

No force was allowed to be used to restore a fugitive slave to his master in any event; but if the master proved his loyalty, he was usually permitted to see his slave, and, if he could persuade him to return home, it was permitted. Cotton, also, was a fruitful subject of controversy. The Secretary of the Treasury; Mr. Chase, was extremely anxious at that particular time to promote the purchase of cotton, because each bale was worth, in gold, about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred dollars, and answered the purpose of coin in our foreign exchanges. He therefore encouraged the trade, so that hundreds of greedy speculators flocked down the Mississippi, and resorted to all sorts of measures to obtain cotton from the interior, often purchasing it from negroes who did not own it, but who knew where it was concealed. This whole business was taken from the jurisdiction of the military, and committed to Treasury agents appointed by Mr. Chase.

For a long time all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> continued to feast their eyes on all the glories of the starry firmament; but, strange to say, the part that seemed to possess the strangest and weirdest fascination for their wandering glances was the spot where the vast disc of the Moon showed like an enormous round hole, black and soundless, and apparently deep enough to permit a glance into the darkest mysteries of the infinite.

Across the lawn--the marshalled woods besieged it on <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> sides--stood an ancient house of lichened and weather-worn stone, with mullioned windows and roofs of rose-red tile. It was flanked by semi-circular walls, also rose-red, that closed the lawn on the fourth side, and at their feet a box hedge grew man-high. There were doves on the roof about the slim brick chimneys, and I caught a glimpse of an octagonal dove-house behind the screening wall.

It is true that with the majority of the deaf phonetic speech is not employed to any large extent; but there is at the same time a fair number who can, and do, use vocal language. This speech varies to a wide degree, in some approximating normal speech, and in others being harsh and understood with difficulty; and it depends in the main upon <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> conditions: 1. the age at which deafness occurred, this being the most important factor; 2. the extent to which the voice is cultivated; and 3. the remaining power of the ear (which is found but seldom).[8] Of the deaf persons enumerated in the census,[9] 21.5 per cent were reported able to speak well; 15.8 per cent imperfectly; and 62.7 per cent not at all. In other words, somewhat over a third of the deaf can speak more or less, one-fifth being able to speak well, and...", "...Sandy was alive then and he got up and said, 'If she for go let her for went.

Which of these conditions is most effective depends on the size of the job, or the nature of the job to be done. The important question is, not the number of men doing the planning, but the fact that every foreman, so far as is possible, is assigned to the special kind of work that he is best fitted to do with the greatest elimination of unnecessary waste. CHANGES IN THE FUNCTIONS OF THE FOREMAN.--A Foreman, under Scientific Management, must have <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> qualifications. He must be 1. a specialist at the work that he is to do. 2. a good observer, able to note minute variations of method, work, and efficiency. 3. a good teacher.

All the excitement of the previous evening had evaporated, the Texians sent out a flag of truce, and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred of them surrendered themselves unconditionally to this small Mexican force. On one point the European nations have been much deceived, which is as to the character of the Mexican soldier, who appears to be looked upon with a degree of contempt.

His closest friends were <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> brothers, Jacopo, Giovanni, and Agostino Ruffini. Jacopo, the eldest of the three, had perhaps more influence on Mazzini's life than any other man. They were born on the same day; and Jacopo's fine, sensitive, enthusiastic nature matched well with Mazzini's own. The tragic fate, that afterwards brought his life to an early close, only strengthened the influence; and the memory of one so dear, who gave his life for their common cause, remained a perennial inspiration to keep his...", "...was not the young man to see the logic of this reasoning, and before Mukoki could open his mouth again he was hurrying up the hill.

Wabi was hastening across the lake, attracted by the shots, and both reached the slain bull at about the same time. Rod quickly perceived that <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> shots had taken effect; one, which was undoubtedly Mukoki's carefully directed ball, in a vital spot behind the fore leg, and two through the body.

Though the new market halls have not been established long enough to provide a definite financial statement, the live-cattle market and slaughterhouses do afford an indication of the success of municipal administration in Munich. Last year the income was $416,500 and the expenditure $410,100, thus showing a profit of $6,400. The new produce halls are certainly the best equipped in the world, and the only element of doubt as to their success arises from the fact that <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> old-fashioned open markets are nearer the center of the city and for that reason are even now preferred by many retailers. This fact emphasises the importance of selecting a central position in establishing a municipal terminal market.

The fulness and variety of political and warlike events, to which the union of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> divisions of the Roman world under one master necessarily gave rise, were perhaps too great to admit of being clearly exhibited in one dramatic picture.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> o'clock, we were informed that the Indians had gathered, so we at once proceeded to meet them. The place we had chosen for the conference was on a granite plateau, and at one end our crews had erected a covering with boughs; a more suitable spot for the meeting could not be found.

But when they learned that there were hungry Yankees in the neighborhood, they immediately prepared and brought out to us an enormous supper of fresh pork and corn-bread. It was now nine o'clock on Tuesday night, and we had eaten nothing since <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> o'clock Sunday afternoon, save about three ounces of bread and four ounces of meat to the man. We had that to think of which made us forget the gnawings of hunger, though we suffered somewhat from a feeling of faintness. Now, in the barn, with the rain pattering on the roof, we devoured supper in an incredibly brief period, and begged the slave to go back with his basket and bring just as much more. About midnight the negro found time to pilot us through the dense darkness and...", "...when all _they_ desired was a council. This suggestion of a council was quickly assented to, but the Indians approached with such a rush and with such blood-curdling yells that the cannon were loaded and the soldiers stood ready to fire. During the council the Winnebagoes refused to move until one small band gave in to the entreaties of the agent and were taken up to Fort Snelling. This was an opening wedge, for when the steamboat returned 1700 were ready to move.

The gradual movement in this direction in the United States is seen in the partial extension of the franchise which has taken place during the past thirty-three years, or within one generation.

Since 1890 four States, by a majority vote of the electors, have enfranchised 200,000 women by incorporating the complete suffrage in their constitutions, from which it never can be removed except by a vote of women themselves.

In this view, the spring-months were March, April, and May, called, respectively, foreward Lent, midward Lent, and afterward Lent; see A Student's Pastime, p. 190. Hence the phrase in _middis of the Lent_ does not mean precisely in the middle of the spring, but refers to the month of April; indeed, the sun passed out of Aries into Taurus on the 11th of the month.

From him we might have hoped for better things. \"Death o' sense!\" is an exclamation.

Was his military necessity at that time so great--when he had only a badly crippled army to contend against, and when he had <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four men to its one--was his military extremity so great, history will ask, as to justify this enormous cruelty? General Sherman always contended that it was.

To-day, in this state, we find ninety-nine women out of every one hundred wearing flowers, and laces, and plush and satin on their hats, instead of the heads, bodies and feathers of wild birds that were the regular thing until <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years ago. The change has been a powerful commentary on the value of good laws for the protection of wild life. The Dutcher law has caused the plumage of wild birds _almost wholly to disappear from the State of New York_!

He carried everything before him, and had a most unprecedented success. His command of the instrument surpassed everything previously seen. After <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years as cembalist and conductor at the Italian opera in London, he set out upon a tour as virtuoso. In 1781 he appeared in Paris, and so on toward Munich, Strassburg, and at length Vienna, where he met Haydn, and where, at the instigation of the Emperor Joseph II, he had a sort of musical contest with the young Mozart.

Three more, 273, 274 and 276, are the numbers of the pages of Hamlet to which the cipher is applied most liberally. The remaining three, 306, 397 and 423, are the number of words on these <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> pages respectively; only those printed in Roman characters and not included within brackets being counted. In general, the system of counting adopted by Mr. Donnelly is followed.

Napoleon crossed the Apennines, by forced marches proceeded to Leghorn, and captured English goods to the amount of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> millions of dollars, notwithstanding a great number of English vessels escaped from the harbor but a few hours before the entrance of the French. England was mistress of the sea, and she respected no rights of private property upon her watery domain. Wherever her fleets encountered a merchant ship of the enemy, it was taken as fair plunder. Napoleon, who regarded the land as his domain, resolved that he would retaliate by the capture of English property wherever his army...", "...in Boethius.

CHAPTER TWO. BRAVO, BOY! The dim evening gave place to a dark night. The _Tonans_ had for some two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hours been stealing along very slowly not far from land, and that something important was on the way was evident from the captain's movements, and the sharp look-out that was being kept up, and still more so from the fact that no lights were shown. The gunboat's cutter had been swung out ready for lowering down at a moment's notice, the armed crew stood waiting, and one man was in the stern-sheets whose duty it was to look after the lantern, which was kept carefully shaded....", "...fresh. This can only be known, however, before opening, when the cans are of glass.

MENDANA OR MARQUESAS GROUP. These islands are entirely without reefs, as may be seen in Krusenstern's Atlas, making a remarkable contrast with the adjacent group of the Society Islands. Mr. F.D. Bennett has given some account of this group, in the seventh volume of the \"Geographical Journal\". He informs me that all the islands have the same general character, and that the water is very deep close to their shores. He visited <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of them, namely, DOMINICANA, CHRISTIANA, and ROAPOA; their beaches are strewed with rounded masses of coral, and although no regular reefs exist, yet the shore is in many places lined by coral-rock, so that a boat grounds on this formation. Hence these islands ought probably to come within the class of fringed islands and be coloured red; but as I am determined to err on the cautious side, I have left them uncoloured.

PALMERSTON Island is...", "...about as broad as a rainbow, and about twelve degrees high. \"It remained in its original brightness about five minutes, and then faded rapidly, and then remained almost stationary again, finally disappearing about eight minutes after I first saw it.\" In an intermediate existence, we quasi-persons have nothing to judge by because everything is its own opposite. If a hundred dollars a week be a standard of luxurious living to some persons, it is poverty to others. We have instances of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> objects that were seen in the sky in a space of three months, and this concurrence seems to me to be something to judge by. Science has been built upon concurrence: so have been most of the fallacies and fanaticisms.

A very similar principle, having analogous properties, but containing more nitrogen, exists in cocoa, (theobroma).

In manufactured tea leaves, theine constitutes from one to five percent. of their weight.

It was confidently hoped that, by means of this indirect fire, it would be possible to put the 14-inch guns of these forts out of action, without giving them a chance to reply.

But if the Turks could not reply to the fire of the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> battleships in the Gulf of Saros with their 14-inch guns, they could and did do effective work with smaller guns concealed on the heights of the peninsula overlooking the gulf, and the _Queen Elizabeth_ was hit three times.

Now, for the first time, she realized that human society is organized in <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> strata--high, mediocre, and low, and that when a mediocrity has climbed to the seats of the mighty, his fellows strive to drag him back, down to their own ignoble level--or lower.

To judge from its situation on the map, it could not be less than twenty-five or thirty miles from the place where we stood, though from the deception caused by its enormous length and height, and not uncommon in mountain scenery, it appeared accessible in a walk of two or three hours.

The plants were set in rows <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> and one-half feet apart, and eighteen inches apart in the rows.

Mile after mile he rode, stopping every little while to make inquiries, but without avail. He got dinner at a wayside hotel and then resumed his trip.

The fort of this latter island was carried after a brilliant assault. The admiral had divided his men into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> bodies; he commanded the first, the second marched under the orders of Viscount de Noailles, and Arthur Dillon, at the head of the Irish in the service of France, led the third.

But the Christ-child has not forgotten us,\" and he handed his mother the bottle of wine and the biscuit. \"Where in all the world did this come from?\" asked his astonished mother. Ernest now related how he had sold the Bible to the antiquary (whose unkind treatment he concealed from his mother lest it should disturb her) for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> florins, and how he had called on the apothecary, who had so hospitably received him, so kindly remembered his mother and little sister, and had promised not only a larger credit, but every kind of aid. His mother could not find words to praise and thank their benefactor. When Ernest wrapped up the biscuit again as his mother directed, he remarked upon the cover the hand-writing and name of the apothecary, and had the curiosity to open the whole paper. Who can describe his...", "...the probable remunerating price, I should say that, for the protection of the agricultural interest, as far as I can possibly form a judgment, if the price of wheat in this country, allowing for its natural oscillations, could be limited to some such amount as between 54s. and 58s., I do not believe that it is for the interest of the agriculturist that it should be higher. Take the average of the last ten years, excluding from some portion of the average the extreme prices of the last <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years, and 56s. would be found to be the average; and so far as I can form an idea of what would constitute a fair remunerating price, I, FOR ONE, SHOULD NEVER WISH TO SEE IT VARY MORE THAN I HAVE SAID. I cannot say, on the other hand, that I am able to see any great or permanent advantage to be derived from the diminution of the price of corn _beyond the lowest amount I have named_, if I look at the subject in connexion with the general position of the country, the existing...", "...next, to receive the continuation of your journal for _the fortnight past_.

Philadelphia, 7th January, 1794. When your letters are written with tolerable spirit and correctness, I read them two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> times before I perceive any fault in them, being wholly engaged with the pleasure they afford me; but, for your sake, it is necessary that I should also peruse them with an eye of criticism. The following are the only mispelled words. You write _acurate_ for _accurate_; _laudnam_ for _laudanum_; _intirely_ for _entirely_; this last word, indeed, is spelled both ways, but entirely is the most usual and the most proper.

In two or three minutes one of them returned with the bodies of two puff adders they had killed. These were dropped in among some rocks. \"You can go in now,\" Kreta said. \"There are no more of them.\" Ronald crawled in first, and helped Mary Armstrong in after him; the natives followed. Kreta came in last, carefully examining the bush before he did so, to see that no twig was broken or disarranged. He managed as he entered to place two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> rocks over the entrance. \"Good place,\" he said, looking round as he joined the others. It was indeed of ample size to contain the party, and was some four feet in height. Light came in in several places between the rocks on which the upper slab rested. \"It could not be better, Kreta, even if it had been made on purpose.

Some of their men and horses were killed in their eagerness to overhaul the General. It was perfectly evident that our thin line of battle was soon to be assaulted, as the enemy's skirmishers were advancing on our front and right flank and his cannon sweeping the position from our left. We were not long in suspense. Almost simultaneously we were raked by missiles from <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> directions. To have offered resistance would have been sheer folly. In fifteen minutes the few survivors of Pickett's immortal division had been run over and captured, together with the brigades which were posted on their left. Lieutenant Wise having failed to receive any other cannoneers to replace those previously captured, the guns, without firing a shot, were left standing unlimbered.

Guy could not help arranging with himself for his friend to fall in love with one of them; and since he at once allotted Monica to Michael, he knew that he himself preferred one of the others. But which? Oh, it was ridiculous to ask such questions after seeing three girls for <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> minutes of moonlight. Perhaps it really had been sorcery and in the morning, when he met them in Wychford High Street, they would appear dull and ordinary. They could not be so beautiful as he thought they were, he decided, since if they were he must have heard of their beauty. Nevertheless it was in a mood of almost elated self-congratulation that Guy found himself hurrying through the orchard toward the candlelight of his room.

We now found there were two islands, a smaller and a larger one, on our line of crossing, upon which we rested, and soon nothing remained save a twenty-foot stream between us and the farther bank.

When the Israelites who were in the towns of the lowland and across the Jordan saw that the Israelites had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they left their towns and fled, and the Philistines came and took them. On the next day, the Philistines came to rob the dead, and found that Saul and his <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> sons had fallen on Mount Gilboa. They cut off his head and stripped off his armor and sent messengers through all the land of the Philistines to bring the good news to their idols and to the people. And they put his armor in the temple of Ashtarte and fastened his body on the wall of Bethshan.

The mould is inserted in a specially designed press, and the cordite paste forced through a die with one or more holes. The paste is pressed out by hydraulic pressure, and the long cord is wound on a metal drum (Fig. 38), or cut into lengths; in either case the cordite is now sent to the drying houses, and dried at a temperature of about 100 deg. F. from <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> to fourteen days, the time varying with the size. This operation drives off the acetone, and any moisture the cordite may still contain, and its diameter decreases somewhat. In case of the finer cordite, such as the rifle cordite, the next operation is blending. This process consists in mounting ten of the metal drums on a reeling machine similar to those used for yarns, and winding the ten cords on to one drum. This operation is known as \"ten-stranding.\" Furthermore, six...", "...to sealing was published in the St. Louis \"Republic\" at the time of the sale. Quoting Mr. Philip B.

Once--early in those days--she had ventured to ask Philip what Sylvia was like. Philip had not warmed up at the question, and had given rather a dry catalogue of her features, hair, and height, but Hester, almost to her own surprise, persevered, and jerked out the final question. 'Is she pretty?' Philip's sallow cheek grew deeper by two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> shades; but he answered with a tone of indifference,-- 'I believe some folks think her so.' 'But do you?' persevered Hester, in spite of her being aware that he somehow disliked the question. 'There's no need for talking o' such things,' he answered, with abrupt displeasure. Hester silenced her curiosity from that time. But her heart was not quite at ease, and she kept on wondering whether Philip thought his little cousin pretty until she saw her and him together, on...", "...direction of those two objects of her affection, who, alive or dead, were still her all-in-all of this world; and there she stood, slightly inclined forward, but motionless, mute, and pale as a marble statue, with lips painfully compressed, and eyes, glazed and watery, intently fixed on the opposite shore of the lake to which she was looking for relief, at least from the terrible suspense under which she was suffering. By her side, a little back, stood the wife of the hunter, and two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> other women of the vicinity, who had more particularly interested themselves in her troubles,--some shedding sympathetic tears, and some offering an occasional word, which they hoped might in a slight degree divert her sorrows or console her in her anguish.

Raoul Yvard was indebted to a piece of forethought in Clinch for his life. But for the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> guns fired so opportunely from the Foudroyant, the execution could not have been stayed; and but for a prudent care on the part of the master's-mate, the guns would never have been fired. The explanation is this: when Cuffe was giving his subordinate instructions how to proceed, the possibility of detention struck the latter, and he bethought him of some expedient by which such an evil might be remedied. At his suggestion then, the signal of the guns was mentioned by the captain,...", "...at the entrance of a vast hall, whose walls were covered with long red draperies, gloomily enlightened by a bronze lamp and several chandeliers suspended from the ceiling, which shone in an uncertain manner upon the countenances of about a hundred men, who, with naked swords in their hands, fixed their eyes upon him through the black masks which concealed their faces. At the bottom of this hall was a table covered with a green cloth, at which were seated three men. Not only were those <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> men masked, but, as a further precaution, before each of them a lighted torch was planted on the table, the dazzling flame of which allowed them to be but vaguely seen. Against the wall was a crucifix, between two hourglasses surmounted by a death's-head with a poniard run through it. The General manifested no emotion at this imposing _mise en scene_. A smile of disdain curled his lip, and he stepped boldly forward. At this moment he felt a light touch on the shoulder, and, on...", "...at Chad,\" he said. \"I was about to ask if Brother Fabian was to be sent thither to instruct my sons.\" \"Ay, and to find out what germs of heresy yon false monk may not have implanted!\" cried Lord Mortimer, losing control of himself as he saw the calmness of his enemy, and felt that the prey he had so confidently looked to be his might even now slip from his grasp. \"It was those lads from Chad who strove to protect yon miserable hunchback who will be burned to ashes for his sins ere <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> more days have gone by. How explain you such conduct as that, Sir Oliver? Are you and your dame rearing up a heretic brood, to cumber the land in days to come?\" But the prior here interposed somewhat sternly.

BALADES AND TERNS. The usual form for a Balade was in three stanzas, with a refrain. This rule is partially observed, not only in Balades, but in other poems. Chaucer was fond of grouping his stanzas by threes; such a group has been called a Tern. For examples, see the latter part of the Complaint to Pit[`e], in three groups of three stanzas each; the five groups of three stanzas at the end of the Complaint of Mars; the three stanzas forming the Proem to Anelida; the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> groups of three stanzas each in Fortune; and the Triple Roundel.

Down the trellis they went and out on the campus, which was shrouded in darkness. They made their way to the foot of a statue of George Washington, which stood on a broad base in front of the school. There stood the Father of His Country, with outstretched arms, as if warning invaders away from the precincts of learning. \"They've been here!\" said Sam in a whisper. He pointed to some straggling...", "...to behave himself.\" Josh looked a little abashed at a rebuke that came from one of his own class, and which he must have felt, in secret, was merited.

The almost entire absence of ancient marks of sea-action at defined levels along considerable spaces of coast, as near Valparaiso and Concepcion, is highly instructive, for as it is improbable that the elevation at these places alone should have been continuous, we must attribute the absence of such marks to the nature and form of the coast-rocks.

When, however, we find eyeballs and eyebrows white, while the inner part of the eye is yellow, the blade of swords yellow, and horses' hoofs blue we seem to have proof that, sometimes at any rate, local color was intentionally neglected, the artist limiting himself to certain hues, and being therefore obliged to render some objects untruly. Thus we must not conclude front the colors of dresses and horse trappings on the bricks which are <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> only, yellow, blue and white--that the Assyrians used no other hues than those, even for the robes of their kings. It is far more probable that they employed a variety of tints in their apparel, but did not attempt to render that variety on the ordinary painted bricks.

To show that the intense heat of the sun might be thus generated, elaborate calculations have been made. It has been demonstrated that if the sun were a solid mass of anthracite coal, its combustion would maintain its heat at its present rate of emission only five thousand years, while the falling of the planet Jupiter into the sun would generate an equal amount of heat for thirty-five thousand years. A lump of coal falling from the earth to the sun would produce <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> thousand times more heat by the concussion than by its combustion. \"The nearest approach that has been made, of an exact and scientific kind, toward determining the constitution of the sun's surface has resulted from an examination of the _solar spectrum_.

She resolved immediately to set off and take the King with her. She had, besides myself, her usual small company of female attendants, together with Mesdames de Rais and de Sauves. She flew on the wings of maternal affection, and reached Tours in <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days and a half. A journey from Paris, made with such precipitation, was not unattended with accidents and some inconveniences, of a nature to occasion much mirth and laughter. The poor Cardinal de Bourbon, who never quitted her, and whose temper of mind, strength of body, and habits of life were ill suited to encounter privations and hardships, suffered greatly from this rapid journey. We found my brother Anjou at Plessis-les-Tours, with the principal officers of his army,...", "...frank, affectionate lips and a full, pleasant admission that it was natural Julia should have been startled; and he was the more impatient that, though he would not in the least have expected her to like finding a strange woman intimately installed with him, she had disliked it even more than would have seemed probable or natural. That was because, not having heard from him about the matter, the impression was for the moment irresistible with her that a trick had been played her. But <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> minutes with him alone would make the difference. They would indeed have a considerable difference to make, Nick reflected, as minutes much more numerous elapsed without bringing Mrs. Dallow home.

The winding road leading to it is the one described in \"Snow-Bound.\" A drive or a walk of one mile brings you to sweet Kenoza Lake, with the castellated stone residence of Dr. J. R.

Of eighty-six officers, only twenty-three remained unhurt; and of twelve hundred soldiers who crossed the Monongahela, more than seven hundred were killed and wounded. None suffered more severely than the Virginians, who had displayed throughout a degree of courage and steadiness which put the cowardice of the regulars to shame. The havoc among them was terrible, for of their whole number scarcely one-fifth left the field alive.[118] The slaughter lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hours; when, at length, the survivors, as if impelled by a general impulse, rushed tumultuously from the place of carnage, and with dastardly precipitation fled across the Monongahela. The enemy did not pursue beyond the river, flocking back to the field to collect the plunder, and gather a rich harvest of scalps. The routed troops pursued their flight until they met the rear division of the army, under Colonel Dunbar; and even then their senseless terrors did not abate.

He took her to the hospital and took care of her, but would not he rather have been paying <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> dollars a year for insurance for all the risks that might come to her in that industry? Would not you rather do that yourself? And besides that, from the humane standpoint, would not you rather that the poor girl should be placed in a position where she certainly will receive compensation in case of an accident which perhaps she or any one else could not have avoided, than to have her go on and lose her wages or else you pay them to her?

In the middle was a green griffin trampling on a winged serpent, which threatened its adversary with open mouth. At the head of the proa sat the Sultan, with <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> of his sons and several of his nobles, while ten ministers as guards were standing on each side of him. Other guards were arranged about the vessel. The Sultan was handsomely dressed in a silken turban, a sky-coloured silk pair of breeches, and a piece of red silk thrown across his shoulders, the greater part of his back and waist appearing naked. He had neither stockings nor shoes. As he was conducted by the captain into his cabin, five guns were fired in his honour.

I shall not attempt any exhaustive treatise on this subject, for the task is beyond me, but a slight notice of ancient theology may not here be irrelevant. The late George Smith, the eminent Assyriologist, says:-- \"Upwards of 2000 years B.C. the Babylonians had three great gods--_Anu_, _Bel_, and _Hea_. These <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> leading deities formed members of twelve gods, also called great. These were-- 1. Anu, King of Angels and Spirits. Lord of the city Eresh. 2.

The characteristics of these <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> sects are in brief. The first limited patients' diet, used no stimulants, dilated all wounds and looked for union only after pus formation. The second allowed a liberal diet to weak patients, though not to the strong, but generally interfered with wounds too much.

In a short time we had nearly fifty whale-boats, twenty-five on each bow, in two long lines. It was one of the prettiest sights I ever witnessed, towing on the big ship at the rate of about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> knots an hour between the coral reefs, making what would otherwise have been a difficult business perfectly easy.

But the Americans, commanded by General Gates, who had superseded Schuyler, were strongly intrenched at the principal passes on his route, and had fortified the high grounds. The army of Burgoyne was moreover attacked by the Americans at Stillwater, and he was forced to retreat to Saratoga. His army was now reduced to five thousand men; he had only <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days' provisions; all the passes were filled by the enemy, and he was completely surrounded by fifteen thousand men. Under these circumstances, he was forced to surrender. His troops laid down their arms, but were allowed to embark at Boston for Europe. The Americans, by this victory, acquired forty-two pieces of brass artillery, four thousand six hundred muskets, and an immense quantity of military stores. This surrender of Burgoyne was the greatest disaster which the British...", "...that name by the end? 'Twas you betrayed me: not I, faith; I'll not break his head.

But very slight results attended these elaborate schemes, although their failure did not deter Leibnitz from pursuing the same end.

Leibnitz worked at another collection, the _Origines Guelficae_, which was completed and issued by his pupils (Hanover, 1750-1780), and also at _Annales imperii occidentis Brunsvicenses_, which, although the most valuable collection of the kind yet made, was not published until edited by G.

About the year 1800, he might have had a boy or one or two young men to help him. They would begin one or two dozen at a time, using no machinery, but cutting the wheels and teeth with a saw and jack-knife. Mr. Terry would make two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> trips a year to the New Country, as it was then called, just across the North River, taking with him three or four clocks, which he would sell for about twenty-five dollars apiece. This was for the movement only. In 1807 he bought an old mill in the southern part of the town, and fitted it up to make his clocks by machinery. About this time a number of men in Waterbury associated themselves together, and made a large contract with him, they furnishing the stock, and he making the...", "...but one anxiety still remained.

With great care the hunters crept over the ice towards the animals, whose sacrifice meant so much to the castaways. Only two had rifles, the others carrying harpoons they had made from the tent-poles, and which were anything but reliable weapons. Steady aim was taken by the two men who had the rifles at the two larger of the seals.

Inside of <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> weeks the available stores were consumed. The insistent demand for fuel led to a rush upon the lines tapping the coal-fields. Congestion resulted, and when the tangle was worst heavy snows began to fall. The railroads failed utterly. Electric street traction shared the fate of the railroads.

This Imperial Guard was a choice corps created by Napoleon III. at the outset of the Crimean War. It was a force numbering nominally twenty thousand infantry and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> thousand cavalry.

Where have I left her? I can't remember if the Carrywoods were at home or if I just left cards. If there were at home I may have left Louise there to play bridge. I'll go and telephone to Lord Carrywood and find out.\" \"Is that you, Lord Carrywood?\" she queried over the telephone; \"it's me, Jane Thropplestance. I want to know, have you seen Louise?\" \"'Louise,'\" came the answer, \"it's been my fate to see it <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> times. At first, I must admit, I wasn't impressed by it, but the music grows on one after a bit. Still, I don't think I want to see it again just at present. Were you going to offer me a seat in your box?\" \"Not the opera 'Louise'--my niece, Louise Thropplestance. I thought I might have left her at your house.\" \"You left cards on us this afternoon, I understand, but I don't think you left a niece. The footman would have been sure to have mentioned it if you had. Is it...", "...which he throws over a chair back while he calls attention to the empty condition of the drawer box. The performer now takes the borrowed handkerchiefs one by one and places them in the box. After placing the third handkerchief in the drawer box, he looks round as if for another handkerchief, and remarks, \"I should have borrowed _four_ handkerchiefs, but I will not trouble you again, I will use my own.\" Drawing this (the coloured one) from his pocket and placing it in the box with the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> white ones, he closes the drawer. The drawer box is now placed on a table or chair near the footlights. The performer next introduces the umbrella tube, being careful to remove the lid from the end containing the unprepared parasol, which he withdraws, opens, and passes for inspection to prove its unpreparedness. The parasol being returned is placed back into the tube, the lid put on, and in turning to place the tube on the table, it (the tube) is reversed, which brings the lid...", "...ask whether you would ever care to come and pay us a visit at Burnbrooke, but we could offer you no such luxury as this. If, however, you would care to come, we have peace there.\" \"It is very kind of you, and of Cousin Ellen to have thought of it,\" Cicely faltered with a recollection of a depressing fortnight spent in Sir Arthur's home, during her husband's lifetime; \"perhaps in the spring or summer you would let us come and see you.\" \"We have been away so frequently during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> years that we have seen few people. My poor wife being a martyr to rheumatism, has had to visit foreign watering places; we have, as you know, been little at home, and we have invited few guests to Burnbrooke.

So it couldn't have been Nicknack. \"Anyhow, Trouble's blue-stone castle wasn't just knocked down,\" went on Hal, \"it's gone--every stone is gone. Somebody took 'em!\" Jan and Ted noticed this for the first time. When Trouble had called out that his playhouse was gone they had thought he meant it was just knocked over. But, instead, it was gone completely. Not a blue stone was left. And, strangely enough, none of the other <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> castles was touched. Hal had built quite a large one, but not a stone had been taken from it. \"Where my p'ayhouse?\" asked Trouble, looking all about. \"I want my p'ayhouse.\" \"We'll find it for you,\" promised Jan, though she did not know how she was going to do it. Perhaps Hal could think of a way. Hal was older than Jan and Ted. \"What's the matter, Curlytops?\" asked Mother Martin as she came out of the tent. \"Has anything happened? Why is Trouble crying? Did he get...", "...A Curious Poetic Creation That Has Puzzled Many Readers, and a Solution of the Mystery. In the earlier history of man the riddle was an important intellectual test. To be able to guess hard riddles was supposed to indicate wisdom, and often a great deal was made to depend upon the issue of a guessing contest. The most famous riddle of antiquity was the one which the Sphinx is said to have proposed to Oedipus: \"What is that which has four feet in the morning, two at noon, and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> at night?\" And it has been asserted that Homer died of vexation because he could not find an answer to the riddle: \"What we caught we threw away, what we could not catch we kept.\" The riddle is the result of the perception of analogies. Note your analogy and put it in the form of a question, and you have your riddle. The conundrum, which has largely replaced the riddle, is a pun concerning which a question is asked. The conundrum may be witty; the riddle may be broadly...", "...put on by _Alexander_ the Great, and taken alive an hundred years after, with other relations of this nature, we much suspect imposture or mistake. And if we grant their verity, they are but single relations, and very rare contingencies in individuals, not affording a regular deduction upon the species. For though _Ulysses_ his Dog lived unto twenty, and the _Athenian_ Mule unto fourscore, yet do we not measure their days by those years, or usually say, they live thus long. Nor can the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> hundred years of _John_ of times [SN: _Psalm_ 90.], or _Nestor_, overthrow the assertion of _Moses_, or afford a reasonable encouragement beyond his septuagenary determination. The ground and authority of this conceit was first Hierogliphical, the _AEgyptians_ expressing longaevity by this Animal; but upon what uncertainties, and also convincible falsities they often erected such Emblems, we have elsewhere delivered. And if that were true which _Aristotle_ delivers of his time...", "...and we were continually sitting down into unexpected laps. Expostulations, apologies, and so on.

We had an enormous director of a sanitary department and a plump wife, evidently risen, but fat people rise in Serbia automatically like balloons. We had <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> meagre old gentlemen, one unshaven for a week, one whiskered since twenty years with Piccadilly weepers like a stage butler; some ultra fashionable girls and men; and a dear old dumb woman wearing three belts, who had been a former outpatient; and several sticky families of children.

In its typical form (Plate 63, Fig. 3) the blackish band of the fore wings is entire, but in ab. _insulata_, Haworth (Fig. 4), this band is interrupted by two whitish lines along the median veins, and so divided into <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> or four portions, the smaller section placed between the lines; occasionally, the dividing lines assume stripe-like proportions, and the main portions are consequently smaller in size and further from each other, but one \"island\" still remains. In another form, the lower outer corner is distinctly separate from the costal portion; thus the band is broken into four parts. [Illustration] 2 Pl. 62. 1. THE TISSUE: _caterpillar_. 2.

In the evening of the 16th, the weather cleared up, and we then found ourselves surrounded on every side by land. Our station was on the east side of the Sound, in a place, which in the chart is distinguished by the name of _Snug Corner Bay_. And a very snug place it is. I went, accompanied by some of the officers, to view the head of it, and we found that it was sheltered from all winds, with a depth of water from even to <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> fathoms over a muddy bottom. The land, near the shore, is low, part clear, and part wooded. The clear ground was covered, two or three feet thick, with snow; but very little lay in the woods. The very summits of the neighbouring hills were covered with wood; but those farther inland seemed to be naked rocks, buried in snow.

There are four good golf courses here, and the village has a well-built club house, called the \"Neighborhood House.\" The village lies on the narrow strip of land (about 1/3 m.) between Mirror Lake (about 1 m. long, N. and S., and 1/3 m. wide), and Lake Placid, about 5 m. long (N.N.E. by S.S.W.), and about 1(1/2) m.

Of course, it doesn't really matter, for you could come on after us; but I don't want Elsie to lose a day's work.\" Septimus Rainer, Sir Tancred, and Lord Crosland looked a little taken aback; it struck them all <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> with the same sense of oddness that a small boy should direct the movements of the daughter of a millionaire. \"Oh, I can easily pack up by Wednesday,\" said Dorothy, as if it were a matter of course that he should direct her movements. \"That's all right,\" said Tinker. \"But I don't understand,\" said Septimus Rainer. \"Has Dorothy bound herself to do as you tell her?\" \"Well, I suppose she has, as far as teaching Elsie goes.

We stood on toward it till four o'clock, when, being four or five miles from it, we tacked; and, soon after, the wind falling, we anchored in thirteen fathoms water, over a sandy bottom; being about two leagues from the land, and, by our reckoning, in the latitude of 64 deg. 27', and in the longitude of 194 deg. 18'. At intervals, we could see the coast extending from E. to N.W., and a pretty high island, bearing W. by N. <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> leagues distant. The land before us, which we supposed to be the continent of America, appeared low next the sea; but, inland, it swelled into hills, which rise, one behind another, to a considerable height. It had a greenish hue, but seemed destitute of wood, and free from snow.

The continuance of frosty weather, which rendered their soft paddy-fields firm and fit for operations, determined the general to make a military expedition as far as Yuyow, in order to ascertain how far these reports were correct, and to dislodge the Chinese troops if any of them should be found collected there. On the 27th of December, the <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> steamers, Nemesis, Sesostris, and Phlegethon, having a number of boats in tow, and carrying altogether about seven hundred men, including the marines and seamen, proceeded up the north-western branch of the river.

The Sesostris, owing to her greater draught of water, was compelled to bring up below the intended point of debarkation.

CHAPTER LV. How those people landed on the Island of Tider.

But the blame for this was not so much with the pilots...", "...of a restoration with a ruin, there has been sacrificed the most impressive spectacle on the island--the ancient church tower of vanished James Towne, standing in the shadow of the little grove by the river, broken, desolate, alone. As we stood amidst ruins and building stuff, we tried to bear in mind that, of the two pilgrims, the unimaginative one is much the bigger; but we were so hopelessly a part of the other fellow. CHAPTER VI IN THE OLD CHURCHYARD For two or <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> days after our visit to the church ruins, rain kept us prisoners within the houseboat. Such times are good tests to determine how much one possesses of the houseboating spirit. All the charms usually associated with such a life are blotted out by the lowering clouds, washed away by the falling water. And how the houseboat shrinks when it gets so wet! With decks unavailable, what a little thing the floating home suddenly becomes! Then there is the ceaseless patter overhead, and so...", "...In the second it has struck the top stair, which is giving off its echo, the first wave of our artificially constructed musical tone. In the third we find the original wave at the sixth step, with a well-developed train of five waves rising from the flight. The following three pictures show the further development of the wave train. The height of each step was about a quarter of an inch; consequently the distance between the waves was half an inch. This would correspond to a note about <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> octaves above the highest ever used in music. [Illustration: FIG 9. THE REFLECTION INSIDE THE HOLLOW SPHERE.] While experimenting with the complete circular mirror, which, it will be remembered, gave the most complicated forms, it occurred to me that a very vivid idea of how these curious wave surfaces are produced could be obtained by preparing a complete series in proper order on a kinetoscope film, and then projecting them in succession on the screen.

In the House the Republicans controlled eight States to the Federalists' six, with Maryland and Vermont without a majority of either party. To elect Jefferson, therefore, an additional State must be secured, and to prevent it, if possible, the Federalists, by a party caucus held in January, resolved to support Burr, Bayard and <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> others, any one of whom could decide the choice for Jefferson, reserving the right to limit the contest to March 4, and thus avoid the risk of general anarchy by a failure to elect. Very naturally the Republicans became alarmed and ugly. Jefferson wrote Madison of the deplorable tie, suggesting that it had produced great dismay and gloom among Republicans and exultation among Federalists, \"who openly declare they will prevent an election.\"[102] James Gunn, a United States...", "...punished, sir.' The Scotchman said he'd inquire into it; but shortly after he came back, saying he 'doubted' he couldn't be sure of the man; and, at any rate, he could have 'meant no ill.'

Indeed, he was suddenly alarmingly formal and ceremonious as he asked us to sit down and opened Mr. Chesterton's letter. I couldn't help watching his face as he read it, to enjoy the look of blank amazement that I thought would appear there when he found that the little maid-servant he had noticed at the kitchen window of the next-door villa to his own should be the young lady about whom he had received this lawyer's letter.

Gianbattista was for sending for the landlord and making a riot in that hostelry; but I stayed him, and bidding him fetch me a flask of white wine, <span class=\"clocktext\">three</span> lemons, and a glass of eau de vie, I sat down peaceably at one of the little tables in the courtyard and prepared for the quenching of my thirst. Presently, as I sat drinking that excellent compound of my own invention, my shoulder was touched, and I turned to find the maid and her mistress.
