On the morning that followed began my new life. I was no longer to be the pampered and spoiled child of fortune, surrounded with every appliance of luxury, and waited on by obsequious servants. I was now to travel modestly, to fare humbly, and to ponder over the smallest outlay, lest it should limit me in some other <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of greater need. But of all the changes in my condition, none struck me so painfully at first as the loss of consideration from strangers that immediately followed my fallen state. People who had no concern with my well-to-do condition, who could take no possible interest in my prosperity, had been courteous to me hitherto, simply because I was prosperous, and were now become something almost the reverse for no other reason, that I could see, than that I was poor.

All being in readiness for their departure, Dame Wingfield took leave of her guests with tears in her eyes, and the honest farmer was little less affected. Both gazed after them as long as they continued in sight. Having ascertained from Wingfield the route they ought to pursue, Leonard proceeded about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile along the Harrow-road, and then turned off on the left into a common, which brought them to Acton, from whence they threaded a devious lane to Brentford. Here they encountered several fugitives from the great city, and, as they approached Hounslow, learned from other wayfarers that a band of highwaymen, by whom the heath was infested, had become more than usually daring since the outbreak of the pestilence, and claimed a heavy tax from all travellers. This was bad...", "...reals and a half may be given me.\" \"Proceed,\" said Don Quixote. \"Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,\" continued Master Pedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, \"it would not be much if I were to ask five reals and a quarter.\" \"It's not little,\" said Sancho. \"Nor is it much,\" said the landlord; \"make it even, and say five reals.\" \"Let him have the whole five and a quarter,\" said Don Quixote; \"for the sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> more or less; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it's getting on to supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.\" \"For this figure,\" said Master Pedro, \"that is without a nose, and wants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am reasonable in my charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.\" \"The very devil must be in it,\" said Don Quixote, \"if Melisendra and her husband are not by this time at least on the French border, for the horse they rode on...", "...said, a common danger is often a common blessing.

The mutinous \"paupers\" brought their arguments on the bank to a close; and it was decided for the rest of the way to attach the _Firefly_ officially to the _Sarah_, and allow the seven tugs to pull the lot. They were quite sufficiently alive to their own interests to see each pulled his fair share; and the progress we made, although not racing speed, was, compared at any rate with our bad <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour in the bulrushes, satisfactory. No further adventure happened till Langrish pointed to a wooded hill a quarter of a mile further up stream, and said-- \"That's Camp Hill.

It goes without saying that there was almost no thought of organized sport in the early days. Nathaniel West, '46, once told the Washington alumni, that \"among our athletics were various forms of activity--the foot race from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to a half mile,--baseball, a few rods from the stile,\"--and what will seem certainly a novel event to a modern athlete,--\"sawing our own wood and carrying it upstairs.\" Edmund Andrews, the President of '49, has also left a record of his time. Athletics were not regularly organized, nor had we any gymnasium. We played base-ball, wicket ball, two-old-cat, etc., but there was no foot-ball nor any trained \"teams.\" There was mere ex tempore volunteering. We had...", "...I remember L. at school; and can well recollect that he had some peculiar advantages, which I and others of his schoolfellows had not. His friends lived in town, and were near at hand; and he had the privilege of going to see them, almost as often as he wished, through some invidious distinction, which was denied to us. The present worthy sub-treasurer to the Inner Temple can explain how that happened. He had his tea and hot rolls in a morning, while we were battening upon our <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a penny loaf--our _crug_--moistened with attenuated small beer, in wooden piggins, smacking of the pitched leathern jack it was poured from.

The tincture was of a darker colour than that before described, and was reduced by a gentle heat to a pilular consistence.

Behind is the citadel, crowned by Mohammed Ali's tomb-mosque of white marble, whose tall twin minarets seem to tower above the rosy-tinted heights of the Mokattam Hills.

After proceeding for more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour along a circular corridor, lighted only by the red flickering flame of the torch carried by the guide through this labyrinth, the General was suddenly stopped by a door in front of him. He turned hesitatingly towards the masked men, who had followed him step by step. \"What do you wait for?\" said one of them in reply to his mute interrogation. \"Is it not written, _Knock and it shall be opened unto you?_\" The General bowed in sign of acquiescence, and knocked...", "...cost more than he had spent on his clothes for two or three years previously.

His whole way of life had imperceptibly changed and his year's salary was gone before the second <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was due. He had invested the few thousand dollars which had been his portion of his father's shrunken estate: when his debts began to pile up, he took a flyer in stocks and after a few months of varying luck his little patrimony disappeared.

His faith in this girl, whom he had seen but twice, was supreme. A second and a third time he patrolled the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> mile of cliff. Again his watch tinkled the half-hour, and he knew that the last minutes of the appointed time had come. The third and last time he went beyond the quarter-mile limit, searching in the white distances beyond.

Carlo puffed the smoke of a cigarette rapidly, and Agostino replied for him:--\"From the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where the best donkeys are to be had.\" It was supposed that Agostino had resumed the habit usually laid aside by him for the discussion of serious matters, and had condescended to father a coarse joke; but his eyes showed no spark of their well-known twinkling solicitation for laughter, and Carlo spoke in answer gravely:--\"From Baveno it will be.\" \"From Baveno!

They each of them carry a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> staff,--not a formidable weapon, it is true; but no formidable weapon would be permitted them. At one end of those staves they have deftly inserted stout steel goads, which no casual observer would detect.

It is a noteworthy fact that no direct tax for school purposes was laid by the State until 1853, the interest of the fund alone being appropriated. How small a portion the income plays in maintaining the schools of the State to-day can be seen in the fact that the State for the year 1896 appropriated for educational purposes $4,970,134.53, and this is not a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the amount expended in the State for the purpose of free schools, when the local contributions are taken into account.

The pirates, knowing that they could expect no mercy, showed none, and no <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was given on either side. Frobisher, at the head of his men, strove to cut his way forward, driving the pirates ahead of him and overboard; but he soon realised that this was going to be an exceedingly difficult task. The desperadoes were splendidly armed, and seemed not to know the meaning of the word fear. Men found revolvers flashing in their very faces, and spoke no more in this world; the air scintillated with the gleam of whirling steel and vibrated with the hoarse...", "...seven o'clock in the morning drove out of the town. In fifteen or twenty minutes we had passed through the streets and had reached the pleasant roads of the open plains. Soon we passed the race-track and then bowled merrily along between peaceful barbed-wire fences. Occasional groups of Kikuyus were tramping along the road, bringing in eggs or milk to Nairobi. A farm-house or two lay off to either side, and once or twice we passed boys herding little bunches of ostriches. At about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to eight we drove up the tree-lined avenue of a farm-house and a pleasant-faced woman responded to our knock. We asked for permission to shoot on the farm and were told that we were quite welcome to shoot as much as we wished. Five minutes later, less than an hour's drive from Nairobi, we drove past a herd of nearly sixty impalla. They watched us gravely from a distance of two hundred yards. At this point we left the well-traveled road and drove into the short prairie grass...", "...seem to have helped them much. True, the Atlantic was all before them, where to choose, but what Father Mahony would call the teeming treasures of the deep were practically left untouched. If we accept the plain meaning of the good priest's speech, we must believe that the Aran Islanders and Irish fishermen generally preferred to starve rather than to catch fish, unless an Irish Parliament were fixed on College Green. They had no objection to accept charitable aid, no matter from what <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> it came, and the Araners required assistance every other year. They were not unwilling to catch fish, but they had nothing to catch them with; and, strange as it may seem, these islanders, who could scarcely move five yards in any direction without falling into the sea, these amphibious Irishmen, did not know the art of catching fish! They tinkered and slopped around the shoals in the vicinity of the island, but they were never able to catch enough fish to keep themselves from...", "...He and I had stumbled into the friendship of propinquity, and there had never been any reason for dropping it, though I cannot flatter myself he found my company more enlivening than I found his.

I suppose the child got her looks from her mother, though by this time Mrs. Dainton was verging on stoutness, with a mottled skin and hair beginning to seem dry and lustreless. Sonia, with her velvety brown eyes, her white skin and her dark hair certainly owed nothing to her father, who was one of the most commonplace men I have ever met, whether in mind or appearance.

He awoke early, took a breakfast of fresh beef with the men in the convent yard, and then, rifle in hand, he mounted the church wall. All his intensity of feeling returned with the morning. He was eager to see what was passing beyond the Alamo, and the first object that caught his eye was the blood-red flag of no <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> hanging from the tower of the Church of San Fernando. No wind was blowing and it drooped in heavy scarlet folds like a pall. Looking from the flag to the earth, he saw great activity in the Mexican lines.

HANNIBAL ATTACKS SAGUNTUM.--In two years Hannibal extended the Carthaginian power to the Ebro. Saguntum, a Greek city upon the east coast of Spain, alone remained unsubdued. The Romans, who were jealously watching affairs in the peninsula, had entered into an alliance with this city, and taken it, with other Greek cities in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the Mediterranean, under their protection. Hannibal, although he well knew that an attack upon this place would precipitate hostilities with Rome, laid siege to it in the spring of 219 B.C. He was eager for the renewal of the old contest. The Roman Senate sent messengers to him forbidding his making war upon a city which was a friend and ally of the Roman people; but Hannibal, disregarding their remonstrances, continued the siege, and, after an investment of eight months,...", "...and to wider obligations.

Her task within the Commonwealth is to maintain the common character and ideals and to adjust the mutual relations of one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the human race. Her task without is to throw her weight into the scales of peace, and to uphold and develop the standard and validity of inter-State agreements. It is a task which requires, even at this time of crisis, when, by the common sentiment of her citizens, the real nature and purpose of the Commonwealth have become clear to us, the active thoughts of all political students.

He accordingly made a speech of some length and of a temperate character, so that they might experience good-will toward him at the present and feel an excellent hope for the future. And since he saw them displeased at what was going on and suspicious of the multitude of soldiers, he wished to encourage and to conciliate them somewhat, to the end that quiet might prevail in their <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> while he was conducting the war. Therefore he censured no one and delivered no threat against any person, but made an attack not without imprecations upon those who wished to war against citizens, and at last moved that ambassadors be sent immediately in behalf of peace and harmony to the consuls and to Pompey.

As she walked swiftly along she thought that she heard faint cries far behind her. Looking up, she noted that it was a lonely, barren <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and that the only figure in sight was a woman some distance away. A few paces farther on the shouts recurred--more plainly this time, and a gunshot sounded. Glancing back, she saw several men running, one bearing a smoking revolver, and heard, nearer still, the snarling hubbub of fighting dogs. In a flash the girl's curiosity became horror, for, as she watched, one of the dogs made a sudden dash through the now subdued group of animals and ran swiftly along the planking on...", "...company to pardon her sins.

Then Alison turned against the rival Hecate, Anne Whittle, _alias_ Chattox, between whom and her family raged a deadly feud with Mother Demdike and her family; accusing her of having bewitched her father, John Device, to death, because he had neglected to pay her the yearly tax of an aghen dole (eight pounds) of meal, which he had covenanted...", "...nearly sunk it now by violating the rules of navigation. \"What d'ye mean, you yellow-faced heathen, lying here in a fairway without a horn a-going?\" Charley cried hotly. \"Mean?\" Neil calmly answered. \"Just take a look--that's what he means.\" Our eyes followed the direction indicated by Neil's finger, and we saw the open amid-ships of the junk, half filled, as we found on closer examination, with fresh-caught shrimps. Mingled with the shrimps were myriads of small fish, from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch upwards in size.

During all this time, nearly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, our journal has endeavored to represent the actual condition of our scientific and mechanical progress and to record the discoveries and improvements in these departments wherever made.

The boards are about sixteen inches square, and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch thick: wainscot is the best, as it does not warp. These will go into the groove of the lesson post: there should be about twenty articles on each board, or twenty-five, just as it suits the conductors of the school; there should be the same quantity of things on each board, in order that all the children may finish at one time; this will not be the case, if there be more objects on one board than another.

It was a fine morning, and it occurred to Sam that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten his next <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour or so, as well as any little amusement in which he could indulge. Having arrived at this conclusion, he betook himself to the tap.

The glass, which had dropped very fast all day, and fallen lower than the captain had ever seen it in the southern hemisphere, had given him warning what was coming, and he had prepared for it.

Looking out over the quiet ocean in those wonderful November days, when a peaceful calm brooded over all things, I gathered up all the threads of my various experiences and wove them together. But the people and the lands I wrote about did not really exist for me; they were dream people and dream lands. I wrote of them as they had appeared to me in those early years, and, strange as it may seem, I did not once stop to think if the people and the lands still existed. For a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century I had lived in the day that began with reveille and ended with \"Taps.\" Now on this enchanted island, there was no reveille to awaken us in the morning, and in the evening the only sound we could hear was the \"ruck\" of the waves on the far outer shores and the sad tolling of the bell buoy when the heaving swell of the ocean came rolling over the bar. And so I wrote, and the story grew into a book which was published and sent out to friends and family. As time...", "...movement continued to the close of the Pliocene.

This alarmed and raised all the neighborhood, who, coming into their honors' room, gathered up the great stones, fourscore in number, and laid them by in the corner of a field, where they were afterwards to be seen. This noise, like the discharge of cannon, was heard for several miles round. During these noises, the commissioners and their servants gave one...", "...dogs and horses painted by Landseer, with nobility incidentally introduced, or vice versa, if you prefer.

The record of Fremont and Carson's journey through this region of country, already so thoroughly explored at such great hazard, and accompanied with such unheard-of sufferings, would be but a repetition of what has already been written, for they were again driven to mule meat, or whatever else chance or Providence might throw in their way, to sustain life. In every need--in every peril--in every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where coolness, sagacity, and skill were most required, Carson was ever first, and his conduct throughout cemented, if possible, more firmly the friendship between him and his young commander.

When we had arrived upon the Marigot, in the island of Babaguey, we hailed the keeper of our island to come and take us over in his canoe. In the mean time I amused myself in looking at our habitation, which seemed to be very much embellished since my departure, as it had been augmented with two new cottages. I discovered the country to be much greener since I last saw it; in a word, all nature seemed smiling and beautiful. At last Etienne, to whom we had been calling for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, arrived with his canoe, into which we stepped, and soon were again in the island of Safal. Arrived at my cottage, I began to examine all the changes my father had made during my illness. The small cottage situated to the west, I chose as my sleeping apartment. It was well made with straw and reeds yet green, and the window, whence was seen the cotton-field, was of the greatest advantage to me.

The very next morning, I think it was, one of the government mules wandered away, and two of the drivers went in search of it, but not finding it in the post, one of the men suggested that they should go to the river where the post animals are watered. It is a fork of the Canadian River, and is just over a little sand hill, not one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile back of the quarters, but not in the direction of the sunflower road. The other man, however, said he would not go--that it was not safe--and came back to the corral, so the one who proposed going went on alone. Time passed and the man did not return, and finally a detail was sent out to look him up. They went directly to the river, and there they found him, just on the other side of the hill--dead. He had been shot by some fiendish Indian soon after leaving his...", "...Aren't we nearly there?\" \"That's Ashington, round the bend--that square tower's the town hall.

So, turning reluctantly from the window, he set himself to work out some problems in his favorite card game, \"yerolash\": a Russian form of whist; which, despite constant practice, he continued to play very badly. For some time mathematical feats absorbed him. When, at last, he finished his third puzzle, Ivan Veliki was booming out the third <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> after twelve. Rather drearily, he lounged across to the piano. But to-day there was no music in the heart which, on the contrary, was growing, minute by minute, more heavy and more sad. Finally, thinking unhappily of the innumerable joyous feasts now beginning throughout the city--for late mass would be ended everywhere by now--he sat down alone to the cheerless meal which, poor though it was, but for Rubinstein he would not have had at all. It was nine o'clock that night...", "...all present. No question was asked of the boys. As the driver of the first of those belonging to the count reported twelve carts, each laden with thirty sacks of flour supplied by Count Preskoff, the officer, seeing the number was correct, allowed them to pass without further question.

After two hours' travelling there was a halt for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, and the doctor, passing along, spoke to Dick, and then walked with him back along the line to the hospital carts which were in the rear. Here Dick took his place among some bales of blankets, and another was thrown over him, in such a way that his presence there would not be suspected by any one riding past the cart. Upon the train proceeding Jack took charge of the two carts. This was an easy task, the oxen proceeding steadily along without deviating from the line,...", "...\"Captain Breaker,\" he called to the commander. \"Here, sir.\" \"Pipe the entire ship's company on the forecastle, and see that no one from the tug is near enough to hear what is said there.\" Captain Breaker had formerly been a lieutenant in the navy, and the forms and discipline of a man-of-war prevailed on board of the steam-yacht. In a minute more the pipe of the boatswain rang through the vessel, and all hands were mustered on the forecastle. The tug was made fast on the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the steamer, and no one from her had come on board. Captain Passford and Christy walked forward, leaving the lady with her own thoughts. She was a daughter of a distinguished officer in the navy, and she had been fully schooled in the lesson of patriotism for such an emergency as the present.

The virgate was again divided into quarters, called ferlings, of 7-1/2 acres each. We must not confound this word ferling with our present word \"furlong,\" which originally meant the longest furrow which it was deemed possible a team of oxen could plough without stopping, viz., 220 yards.

At different times he continued adding to his property, acquiring two other <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> sections of land, so that his ranch came to be one of five hundred and sixty acres. A quarter section of this he afterward deeded to his two older sons upon his retirement from active business, but he still retains ownership of four hundred acres, which he rents to his sons.

About a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour after the sun was up, there was a squall to the windward of us; when on sudden one of our men on the forecastle called out that he saw something astern, but could not tell what: I looked out for it, and immediately saw a spout beginning to work within a quarter of a mile of us, exactly in the wind: we presently put right before it. It came very swiftly, whirling the water up in a pillar about six or seven yards high. As yet I could not see any pendulous cloud, from...", "...more abundant, we shall, if we are wise, perceive that only by moving promptly will it be possible in this case to take the tide at the full. Never again will opportunity be more ripe. Another evidence of timeliness is supplied by the present pacific condition of the Church. Previous movements toward liturgical revision have been of a more or less partisan and acrimonious temper. Now for the first time we seem to be taking up this subject without the expression of a fear from any <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> that if changes are made this or that party will get the advantage of some other. The peculiar conditions that ensure this unwonted truce of God are not likely to last forever, nor is it perhaps wholly desirable that they should do so; what is desirable, and very desirable, is that we should avail ourselves of the lull to accomplish certain changes for the better, which in ordinary times the prevalent heat of friction makes impossible. The Joint Committee of Twenty-one is...", "...hear or see me, but stood perfectly still, probably mistaking me in the dusk for one of their number. One was a big fellow, I could see, as he stood out against the sky. What horns he had! The failing light made him seem gigantic. I crawled on till within easy range, and still he never moved. He was standing breast on, apparently watching me. Aiming for where his great shaggy throat joined his broad breast I fired. The rifle blazed out in the dusk; the elk gave a bound, and turned his <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> toward me; the other two dashed off into the woods. Again I fired; this time for his shoulder. The flash of the rifle half blinded me for an instant, but I could see that he was down. I started for him at a run. Up he got, and went lurching heavily down hill toward camp. I was now quite close to him, and fired once more. Again he fell, but, the slope aiding him, he struggled up and went stumbling along. There was no need of another shot. He was nearly spent, and my only thought...", "...What is it to be born free and not to live free? What is the value of any political freedom, but as a means to moral freedom? Is it a freedom to be slaves, or a freedom to be free, of which we boast? We are a nation of politicians, concerned about the outmost defences only of freedom. It is our children's children who may perchance be really free. We tax ourselves unjustly. There is a part of us which is not represented. It is taxation without representation. We quarter troops, we <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> fools and cattle of all sorts upon ourselves. We quarter our gross bodies on our poor souls, till the former eat up all the latter's substance. With respect to a true culture and manhood, we are essentially provincial still, not metropolitan,--mere Jonathans. We are provincial, because we do not find at home our standards,--because we do not worship truth, but the reflection of truth,--because we are warped and narrowed by an exclusive devotion to trade and commerce and...", "...this unnatural gravity is on the surface and is a mask which drops or fades off when they assemble together out of sight and hearing of their elders. In like manner our little ones have masks to fit the character of the homes they are bred in. Here I recall a little girl I once met when I was walking somewhere on the borders of Dorset and Hampshire. It was at the close of an autumn day, and I was on a broad road in a level stretch of country with the low buildings of a farmhouse a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile ahead of me, and no other building in sight. A lonely land with but one living creature in sight--a very small girl, slowly coming towards me, walking in the middle of the wet road; for it had been raining a greater part of the day. It was amazing to see that wee solitary being on the lonely road, with the wide green and brown earth spreading away to the horizon on either side under the wide pale sky. She was a sturdy little thing of about five years old, in heavy...", "...in the seat. In either case, both discomfort and ungainly appearance are the result; while to a lady of slight _petite_ figure, a saddle too long from front to rear is equally unsightly, though possibly not quite so uncomfortable to the rider. Broad girths of the best materials are indispensable. There should be three of them. The quarter strap or girth should lead from the near side fork of the tree to a buckle piece attached to a ring on the off-side quarter, the ring giving the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> strap a better bearing. A crupper should never be used; a horse that requires one is not fit for a lady. Saddle cloths are unnecessary to a carefully-pannelled saddle, and hide the symmetry of the horse. Breastplates or neck straps may be used for hunting, or the fitting of martingales (necessary sometimes). But the less leather about the horse, where it can be dispensed with, the better he will look. As to bridles, as a rule, I maintain that a lady's horse properly broken...", "...by either; but they gazed at each other with a fondness which showed that their souls were in communion. \"Now, William, jump on board--cast off there forward,\" exclaimed the captain; \"swing her head round--heave away my boys--come, William, come my boy.\" The youth awoke as from a startled sleep. He imprinted a kiss, the last kiss, upon the cold cheeks of his benefactress, and dashing away with the sleeve of his jacket a tear, of which he felt ashamed, in a moment he was on the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> deck of his commander. He durst not look again upon the Quay; but had he looked he would have seen many a weeping maiden who had never told her love, and he would have seen his affectionate benefactress borne away in a fainting fit. All this he saw not, for he braced his courage up before his future messmates, and he looked forward to his duties, considering the past as but a dream. Months elapsed and tidings were frequently received of William. He had distinguished himself...", "...Your friends will rally round you,' exclaimed Mr Catcott vehemently. 'Gently, gently, George,' exclaimed his more wary brother Alexander: 'We must first know that Mr Walpole has any dishonest intentions, which in a person of quality like him is scarce reasonable to suppose,' and then the author of _The History of the Deluge_ pulled from his capacious waistcoat pocket a bit of fossil, which he handed round for inspection in support of one of his theories. When the clock chimed the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to ten o'clock Chatterton hastily rose, saying,-- 'I am late as it is, sir. Permit me to bid you good evening.' Mr Barrett followed Chatterton to the door, and laying his hand kindly on his arm, he slipped into his hand half-a-guinea.

Be of good courage, my boy; your time will come, and your industry in adding to the history of past ages will meet its reward.'...", "...They were passing rows of narrow old-fashioned tenement-houses, standing, like crumbling walls of red brick, behind sagging wooden fences; and suddenly, while Stephen's eyes were on the lights that came and went so fitfully in the basement dining-rooms, Darrow stopped the car in the gutter of cobblestones, and motioned in silence toward the pavement. As Stephen got out, he glanced vaguely round him at the strange neighbourhood. \"Where are we?\" \"North of Marshall Street. A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> which was once very prosperous; but that was before your day. This is one of several rows of old houses, well-built in their time, better built, indeed, than any houses we're putting up now; but their day is over. The cost of repairing them would be so great that the agent is deliberately letting the property run down in the hope that this part of the street will soon be turned over to negroes. The negroes are so crowded in their quarter that they are obliged to expand, and...", "...off in numbers from the first day. The yachts were sent off east by south at a six or seven mile pace, the 'Vigilant' slowly gaining; but when about half-way to the outer mark 'Vigilant' took a start and rapidly drew away from 'Valkyrie,' so that when within three miles of the mark she was one and a quarter mile in the lead. Here a soft spot in the wind occurred, and 'Valkyrie' drew on the brass-bottomed boat; but at that moment the wind shifted more southerly, blowing over the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> rail of the yachts, and 'Vigilant' again drew away from her pursuer, turning nearly a mile and a half in advance. The wind having changed in direction there was no windward work, the yachts returning two or three points free, and maintaining the same relative distance at the close as at the outer mark. The race of the 7th, although a decided victory for the American, was not generally considered as a satisfactory test of sailing qualities; the wind was unsteady in force and...", "...where he was? It looked very like rain--he hesitated--then again came that strange propulsion forward, urging him to pursue the undertaking. He crossed the five or six broad lines of railroad track. He walked down the road and over the bridge. There was a steep embankment on the other side of the bridge, and the stream went winding down the level, open lot or field below. Gilderman wondered whether this was the place where Tom Kettle had received his sight. He walked on for perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile without seeing any sign of a crowd. At last he came to a sort of tobacco-shop that was half a dwelling-house. He hesitated for a moment or two and then went up the two dirty steps and pushed open the door. It stuck for a moment, and then suddenly gave way with a loud jangling of a bell over his head. The bell continued a persistent tink-tinking for some time. The place was full of a heavy, musty smell that was not altogether of tobacco. A woman emerged somewhere from...", "...foot at daylight, whether they have been out all night or not, and from that time until an hour after sunrise, and again just before dark in the evening, are the most favorable times to hunt. The game is intent on feeding at these times and is not so wary as at other times. I told Seymour we would get up at four o'clock, get breakfast, and be ready to move at daylight. And so we did.

Ten years of extraordinary scarcity, besides, are not more wonderful than ten years of extraordinary plenty. The low price of corn, from 1741 to 1750, both inclusive, may very well be set in opposition to its high price during these last eight or ten years. From 1741 to 1750, the average price of the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of nine bushels of the best wheat, at Windsor market, it appears from the accounts of Eton College, was only L.1 : 13 : 9-4/5, which is nearly 6s. 3d. below the average price of the sixty-four first years of the present century. The average price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat comes out, according to this account, to have been, during these ten years, only L.1 : 6 : 8. Between 1741 and 1750, however, the bounty must have hindered the price of corn from...", "...of the present year from all sources amount to $26,616,593.78, of which more than fourteen millions were received from customs and about one million from the public lands.

The expenditures of the first three quarters of the present year exceed twenty-six millions, and those estimated for the fourth <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> amount to about eight millions; and it is anticipated there will be a deficiency of half a million on the 1st of January next, but that the amount of outstanding warrants (estimated at $800,000) will leave an actual balance of about $224,000 in the Treasury.

Only last year a determined fight was made by the women of California for a law giving them equal guardianship of their children. The women's bill was lost in the California Legislature, and lost by a large majority. What arguments did the California legislators use against the proposed measure? Identically the same that were made in Massachusetts and New York a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century ago. If women had the guardianship of their children, would anything prevent them from taking the children and leaving home? What would become of the sanctity of the home, with its lawful head shorn of his paternal dignity? In California a husband is head of the family in very fact, or at least a law of the State says so. At one time the law which made the husband the head of the home guaranteed to the family support by the husband. It does not do that now.

I was watching the edge of the forest one afternoon at about four o'clock, when I noticed the massive form of one of these tank rogues stalk majestically from the jungle and proceed through the deep mud towards the lake. I had the wind, and I commenced stalking him. Advancing with my two gun-bearers in single file, I crept carefully from tree to tree along the edge of the forest for about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, until I arrived at the very spot at which he had made his exit from the jungle. I was now within eighty yards of him as he stood with his head towards the lake and his hind-quarters exactly facing me. His deep tracks in the mud were about five feet apart, so great was his stride and length of limb, and, although the soft bog was at least three and a half feet deep, his belly was full two feet above the surface.

In less than two years after he assumed the government, he had, without imposing any additional burdens on the people subject to his authority, added about four hundred and fifty thousand pounds to the annual income of the Company, besides procuring about a million in ready money. He had also relieved the finances of Bengal from military expenditure, amounting to near a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million a year, and had thrown that charge on the Nabob of Oude. There can be no doubt that this was a result which, if it had been obtained by honest means, would have entitled him to the warmest gratitude of his country, and which, by whatever means obtained, proved that he possessed great talents for administration.

This house saw some fine performances of the Italian Opera Company, and in it the names of Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, Lablache, Mario, and Jenny Lind, first became known to the public. In 1867 it also was burnt down. For about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century a third theatre stood here, but had no success, and was pulled down.

He then hopped from perch to perch, uttering a peculiar hollow, chattering noise, and began pulling off piece after piece, till he had swallowed the whole, not even leaving the beak and logs. In a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour he had finished, when he cleansed his bill from the feathers. After a time he returned his food into his crop, and after masticating the morsel for a while in his bill, again swallowed it.

After Jean had climbed a jack pine to get a better view of the surroundings, the two followed along the ridge to the southwest, noting the cropped moss and nibbled bushes as they went. Reaching a gully, which bore signs that the animals might have gone that way, the boys scrambled through it and down over the rocks to the narrow, stony beach. A rocky, wooded island, perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile out and almost parallel with the shore, served as a slight windbreak and had probably aided in the formation of the beach, which was about a mile in length. Beyond it on either hand the cliffs rose straight from the water.

COOPER, ESQ., COOPERSTOWN. We entered France in July, 1826, and having remained in and about the French capital until February, 1828, we thought it time to change the scene. Paris is effectually the centre of Europe, and a residence in it is the best training an American can have, previously to visiting the other parts of that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the world. Its civilisation, usages, and facilities take the edge off our provincial admiration, remove prejudices, and prepare the mind to receive new impressions, with more discrimination and tact. I would advise all our travellers to make this their first stage, and then to visit the North of Europe, before crossing the Alps or the Pyrenees. Most people, however, hurry into the South, with a view to obtain the best as soon as possible; but it is with this, as in most of...", "...run, by dead reckoning, as about another fifty miles or so?\" \"Yes, sor.

Hatteras is doing all this to save us.\" The doctor was agitated; he looked at the bear, which had grown excited, as if he had become conscious of the danger which threatened him. A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later the seal was crawling over the ice; he made a circuit of a quarter of a mile to baffle the bear; then he found himself within three hundred feet of him. The bear then saw him, and settled down as if he were trying to hide. Hatteras imitated skilfully the movements of a seal, and if he had not known, the doctor would certainly have taken him for one. \"That's true!\" whispered Johnson. The seal, as he approached the bear, did not appear to see him; he seemed...", "...this fact quite well, but had trusted that Fanchon had not noticed it.

Meanwhile, plans were being made in another <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> which were likely to upset the most astute calculations on the part of Brenda and her eldest pupil.

The Elegy in a country church-yard, is one of the most popular poems, which is usually given to children to learn by heart; it cost at least a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour to explain to intelligent children, the youngest of whom was at the time nine years old, the first stanza of that elegy. And we have heard it asserted by a gentleman not unacquainted with literature, that perfectly to understand l'Allegro and Il Penseroso, requires no inconsiderable portion of ancient and modern knowledge.

White hunters trespassed far and wide on Indian territory, until by 1810 great regions, which a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century earlier abounded in deer, bear, and buffalo, were made as useless for Indian purposes as barren wastes. Although entitled to the protection of law in his person and property, the native was cheated and overawed at every turn; he might even be murdered with impunity.

She sought her post of observation for the twentieth time just before sunset, and remained there till it grew too dark to see much beyond the line of breakers along the shore below.

From an old Breton legend we learn incidentally that it was customary for the three masses of Christmas to be said consecutively by anticipation, after which all adjourned for a gorgeous feast in the neighbouring Church House. Sometimes two parishes united for the celebration of the Church Ale. In Dodsworth's manuscripts there is an old indenture preserved, an agreement between the parishioners of Elveston and Okebrook, in Derbyshire, to brew four ales, and every ale of one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of malt between Easter and the feast of St. John the Baptist; every inhabitant of the two parishes to attend the several ales. Charitable folks bequeathed funds for the maintenance of these parish banquets on particular festivals.

The bottom was covered with rocks, which had fallen from the roof, thickly clustered over with wet seaweed, which, indeed, hung from the sides far up, showing that at high tide the sea penetrated far into the cave. \"The ground rises beyond,\" Ronald said, \"and you will find recesses there which the tide never reaches.\" They moved slowly at first until their eyes became accustomed to the darkness; then they kept on, the ground...", "...quadrangle. Under Dr. Pynchon's direction the former plans had been much modified, in order that this one range of buildings might suffice for the urgent needs of the college, provision being made for suitable rooms for the chapel, the library, and the cabinet, as well as for lecture-rooms and for suites of students' apartments. During his presidency the endowments were largely increased by the generous legacies of Col. and Mrs. Northam, whose gifts to the college amount to nearly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million of dollars; large and valuable additions were made to the library and the cabinet, and the number of students was, in 1877-80, greater than ever before. By a change in the charter, made in 1883, the election of three of the trustees was put into the hands of the alumni. [Illustration: (signature) T. R. Pynchon] In 1883 the Rev.

The effect of this disaster was severely felt by many of the great mercantile houses of London and Bristol. [324] A still heavier calamity was the failure of the harvest. The summer had been wet all over Western Europe. Those heavy rains which had impeded the exertions of the French pioneers in the trenches of Namur had been fatal to the crops. Old men remembered no such year since 1648. No fruit ripened. The price of the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of wheat doubled. The evil was aggravated by the state of the silver coin, which had been clipped to such an extent that the words pound and shilling had ceased to have a fixed meaning.

Before he had eaten all he wanted, he saw the bow of the Sylph beyond the point of the little island. She had stopped her screw, and this made it evident to Dory that his uncle suspected he had gone through one of the openings to the other side of the islands. The skipper of the Goldwing was tired of the chase, but he did not intend to be captured by his uncle. He could hear the escaping steam on board of the Sylph, and he knew that she was not more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile distant from him. Captain Gildrock would get out his boats again, and send them through the passage, where the steamer could not go. Weighing the anchor, he stood off to the north-west under the foresail only.

After, as it seemed, a long time, he found himself looking at a clock which said a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past ten.

He had stopped in the chilly shadow of a gateway and was looking vacantly about. He saw the sunshine across the street and shivered where he was, and yet he did not leave the shadow. He stood and watched the sparrows taking bold little baths in the puddles of melted snow water. They seemed to enjoy the sunshine, but it was cold in...", "...found the whole crew gazing in one direction, and, though speaking in little more than whispers, evidently in a state of extraordinary excitement.

The vessel was now only about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile distant from the object and therefore near enough to allow it to be distinguished without the aid of a glass. What! The flag bore the well known Stars and Stripes! An electric shudder of glad surprise shot through the assembled crowd.

I could hear a dropping fire of muskets, and guessed that those on board were keeping up a fire on any who so showed themselves on the beach. The natives got more and more excited, and kept jabbering together and pointing away along the coast; and I guessed that some of their own craft were coming to attack the ship. \"Presently I heard one of the guns, then another and another. The shot didn't come whistling our way, so I had no doubt that the ship was attacked. For a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour the firing went on--cannon and musketry. I could hear the yells of the natives and the shouts of our men, though I could see nothing. The natives round me were pretty near out of their minds with excitement; then they began to dance and yell, and all at once the firing ceased, and I knew that the niggers had taken the ship. I was afraid it would come to that; for you see they had lost pretty well a third of their crew in the fight on shore, and the niggers would...", "..._They had passed since the rickshaw_ (overriding its tracks). _They were cantering_ (two single hoof-prints, and then two near together). _A quarter of a mile farther on they were walking_ for a quarter of a mile.

For the command of this expedition I have designated Major-General Wesley Merritt, and it now becomes my duty to give instructions as to the manner in which the movement shall be conducted.

It had a clay bottom, generally speaking, in many places semi-indurated and fast forming into sandstone, while there was crystallized sulphate of lime running in veins through the soil which composed the bank. This river differs from most in the colony, in having a belt of barren land of from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile to two miles in breadth in its immediate neighbourhood, and which is subject to overflow. This belt runs to the inland plains, where a small elevation checks the further progress of the flood. There is magnificent blue gum on both sides the river, but the right bank is evidently the most fertile, and I am mistaken greatly if there is not a beautiful country north of it. Of the country over which we have passed, it is impossible for me to have formed a correct...", "...along close to Mandeville Place, it crossed Wigmore Street and so reached Oxford Street. The manor of Tyburn is mentioned in Domesday Book among the possessions of the Abbess and Convent of Barking. Early in the thirteenth century it was held by Robert de Vere, whose daughter married William de Insula, Earl of Warren and Surrey, from whom the manor passed to their heirs, the Fitzalans, Earls of Arundel. The Berkeleys, Nevilles and Howards divided three-quarters of it later, and one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> went to Henry V. as heir of the Earls of Derby. About the end of the fifteenth century Thomas Hobson bought up the greater part of the manor, and in 1544 his son Thomas exchanged it with Henry VIII. in consideration of lands elsewhere. The manor remained with the Crown until James I. sold it to one Edward Forset, who had previously held it at a fixed rental under Elizabeth. James reserved to the Crown the tract of land then known as Marylebone, now Regent's, Park. Sir John...", "...should appear exaggerated; but we do not doubt that Polish wheat could be delivered at Dantzic at 16s., and yet leave a considerable profit to the grower. We must also note that the variableness of our climate, and the comparative poorness of our soil, places us at a vast disadvantage in point of quality, as compared with the southern grower. It can be established, by consulting the prices-current of Mark Lane for a series of years, that it would require a differential duty of 6s. per <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> on wheat, on this account alone, to put the British farmer on a fair footing with the great bulk of his foreign competitors. Last season, the difference between the best foreign and English wheat throughout the year, as proved by the same authority, was upwards of 10s. per quarter. We beg it will be distinctly understood, that, in estimating the remunerative prices of foreign grain, we do not profess to arrive at more than general conclusions.

Luff to a hair, boy; luff her short into the wind, and try a half-board.\" The man at the helm obeyed the order. Releasing his hold of its spokes, the wheel made a quick evolution; and the ship, feeling a fresh impulse of the wind, turned her head heavily towards the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> whence it came, the canvas fluttering with a noise like that produced by a flock of water-fowl just taking wing. But, met by the helm again, she soon fell off as before, powerless from having lost her way, and settling bodily down toward the fancied slaver, impelled by the air, which seemed, however, to have lost much of its force, at the critical instant it was most needed. The situation of the \"Caroline\" was one which a seaman will readily understand.

It is summer. A party of visitors are just crossing the iron bridge that extends from the American shore to Goat's Island, about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile above the Falls. Just as they are about to leave, while watching the stream as it plunges and dashes among the rocks below, the eye of one fastens on something clinging to a rock, caught on the very verge of the Falls. Scarcely willing to believe his own vision, he directs the attention of his companions. The terrible news spreads like lightning, and in a few minutes the bridge and the surrounding shore are covered with thousands of spectators. \"Who is he?\" \"How did...", "...with pepper, salt, mace, celery seed, cayenne pepper, allspice and cloves.

Miriam looked up at the clock dizzily as she drank the last of her coffee. It marked half-past eleven. Fraulein had told her to be ready at a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to twelve. Her hands felt large and shaky and her feet were cold. The room was stifling--bare and brown in the gaslight. She left it and crept through the hall where her trunk stood and up the creaking stairs. She turned up the gas. Emma lay asleep with red eyelids and cheeks. Miriam did not look at Ulrica. Hurriedly and desolately she packed her bag. She was going home empty-handed. She had achieved nothing. Fraulein had made not the slightest effort to keep her. She was just...", "...head up stream this time; the ebb has made.\" \"Head up stream, sir.\" \"You will see to it, Mr. Sterne.\" The answer was covered by the autocratic clang on the engine-room gong. The propeller went on beating slowly: one, two, three; one, two, three--with pauses as if hesitating on the turn. The gong clanged time after time, and the water churned this way and that by the blades was making a great noisy commotion alongside. Mr. Massy did not move. A shore-light on the other bank, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile across the river, drifted, no bigger than a tiny star, passing slowly athwart the circle of the port. Voices from Mr. Van Wyk's jetty answered the hails from the ship; ropes were thrown and missed and thrown again; the swaying flame of a torch carried in a large sampan coming to fetch away in state the Rajah from down the coast cast a sudden ruddy glare into his cabin, over his very person. Mr. Massy did not move. After a few last ponderous turns the engines stopped,...", "...Pride had given him. But the scanty garment had dropped from his shoulders so he sprang to his feet and ran back until he discovered it. The box was still there. He examined it curiously turning it over and over in his hands. The seal was stubborn but it finally gave and he peeled off the heavy wrapping. A small white box came to light. This he opened to stand frowning at what it contained. An odd instrument of some sort--a flat disc about two inches in diameter and possibly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch thick. Both faces were of shining, crystalline metal reflecting back anything that was imaged upon them. Two short metal straps appended from opposite sides of the queer instrument, one of which held a buckle at its end. He held the shining disc to his ear but there was no sound that he could detect. Frustrated he looked again into the box. It appeared to be empty. But no. As he was about to fling it away, he noted that what appeared to be its inner bottom was in...", "...good fortune if you ever again find yourself in harmony with fate\"? Mallard had far too much discretion to assume the part of lay preacher, and involve himself in the dangers of suggesting comfort. The situation was delicate enough, and all his efforts were directed to subduing its tone. After a pause, he said to her: \"Have you taken your meals to-day?\" She smiled a little. \"Yes. But I am thirsty. Can you give me a glass of water?\" \"Are you _very_ thirsty? Can you wait a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour?\" With a look of inquiry as to his meaning, she answered that she could. Mallard nodded, and began to busy himself in a corner of the studio. She saw that he was lighting a spirit-lamp, and putting a kettle over it. She made no remark; it was soothing to sit here in this companionship, and feel the feverish heat in her veins gradually assuaged. Mallard kept silence, and when he saw her beginning to look around at the pictures, he threw out a word or two concerning...", "...but by hard lashing we overtook them, and Shaw, running alongside of a bull, shot into him both balls of his double-barreled gun. Looking round as I galloped past, I saw the bull in his mortal fury rushing again and again upon his antagonist, whose horse constantly leaped aside, and avoided the onset. My chase was more protracted, but at length I ran close to the bull and killed him with my pistols. Cutting off the tails of our victims by way of trophy, we rejoined the party in about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour after we left it. Again and again that morning rang out the same welcome cry of \"Buffalo, buffalo!\" Every few moments in the broad meadows along the river, we would see bands of bulls, who, raising their shaggy heads, would gaze in stupid amazement at the approaching horsemen, and then breaking into a clumsy gallop, would file off in a long line across the trail in front, toward the rising prairie on the left.

A few people were assembled together, though no one had really expected me, and after a short service I started on my homeward journey, having refused the invitations of my kind people to stay the night amongst them, as I was anxious to get back to Wolstaston in time for my six o'clock evening service, and I did not anticipate that I should encounter any greater difficulties in my return home than I had done in coming to Ratlinghope....", "...\"It--well it really wouldn't be too great a breach of the convenances for a woman to go out on a racing-car, would it?\" \"I don't think so, Mrs Edmondson,\" remarked the Reverend Thomas, in his most cultivated clerical drawl. \"But I would wrap up well, for the Prince travels very fast on a clear road.\" So \"the old crow\" decided to accept his Highness's invitation, and ascended to put on her brown motor-cap and veil and a thick coat against the chill, evening winds.

Happy to have a complaisant listener, Balzajette did all the talking, so that Saniel had only to reply \"yes\" or \"no\" from time to time, and of course it was not of Madame Dammauville that he spoke, but other matters--of a first representation on the previous evening at the Opera Comique; of politics; of the next salon. At exactly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past six they reached the house in the Rue Sainte-Anne, where Saniel had not been since Caffies death.

But the gentleman from Georgia further says we have deserted all our principles, and taken shelter under General Taylor's military coat-tail, and he seems to think this is exceedingly degrading. Well, as his faith is, so be it unto him. But can he remember no other military coat-tail under which a certain other party have been sheltering for near a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century? Has he no acquaintance with the ample military coat tail of General Jackson? Does he not know that his own party have run the five last Presidential races under that coat-tail, and that they are now running the sixth under the same cover? Yes, sir, that coat-tail was used not only for General Jackson himself, but has been clung to, with the grip of death, by every Democratic candidate since.

She stood as close to the papers she had brought as if, without them, her sole reason for being there, she might have been ejected; and as she still persisted in her refusal to sit, I sat down myself. It took me perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour to go through the papers. It was as I was pushing back my chair that Stillhausen's bell purred again. A moment later there was a tap at the door. \"Come in!\" I called. Evie entered. I was not embarrassed. It humiliates me to have to write that word now, so many hours later. There was nothing to be embarrassed at. Indeed, as Evie advanced from the door, I barely explained the reason for Miss Causton's call. Louie touched the hand Evie extended.

In a minute he followed me, and in the corner facing the ocean, where the vines cluster the thickest, we held our conversation. I began it, with a directness born of my desperation. \"Beaton,\" said I, \"we have not known each other long, but I recognize a man when I see him, and I am disposed to be frank with you.

I walked along the beach for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, and finding a boat empty, but with a pair of oars, I got in her, and unfastening her, I rowed as hard as I could towards a large caicco, sailing against the wind with six oars. As soon as I had come up to her, I went on board and asked the carabouchiri to sail before the wind and to take me to a large wherry which could be seen at some distance, going towards Vido Rock. I abandoned the row-boat, and, after paying the master of the caicco generously, I got into the...", "...above the ground. They are there, but how they got there is the question. I have seen the hull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stones. All these great walls are as exact and shapely as the flimsy things we build of bricks in these days.

We went to the quarry from whence the stones of Baalbec were taken. It was about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile off, and down hill. In a great pit lay the mate of the largest stone in the ruins. It lay there just as the giants of that old forgotten time had left it when they were called hence--just as they had left it, to remain for thousands of years, an eloquent rebuke unto such as are prone to think slightingly of the men who lived before them. This enormous block lies there, squared and ready for the builders' hands--a solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen, and but a few...", "...on the throat of the spy, \"the bag! it is large enough to wrap his head and arms; we will bind him tight around the loins and he will not budge any more than a roll of old canvas.\" No sooner said than done. In a few seconds the spy, cowled like a monk in the bag to the middle of his body, with his legs bound, found himself unable to move. Sans-Plume had the courtesy to push his victim into one of the wide verdant slopes which separated the trees, and nothing more was heard from that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> but an interrupted series of smothered bellowings. \"The alarm will be given at the convent! Half-past seven has just struck,\" said the captain to his sailor. \"We must risk all now or all is lost!\" \"In twice three movements the thing is ready, captain,\" replied Sans-Plume, running with his companion toward the large trees which hung over the wall near which they had at first stood.

In the yellow glare of the Del Monte lights the buckskin looked very little like a race horse. He stood about fifteen and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> hands, looking not much more than a pony, as, half asleep, he had relaxed his body; the lop ears hanging almost at right angles to his lean bony head suggested humor more than speed. He stood \"over\" on his front legs, a habit contracted when he favoured the weak knees. As he was a gelding his neck was thin, so far removed from a crest that it was almost ewe-like; his tremendous width of rump caused the hip bones to project, suggesting an archaic design of equine structure. The...", "...supposition that we had got our usual week's allowance, and that we should remain quiet again for a time.

However, in less than five minutes, we received an order for our battalion to move up instantly to the support of the piquets; and, on my descending to the door, to mount my horse, I found Sir Lowry standing there, who asked if we had received any orders; and, on my telling him that we had been ordered up to support the piquets, he immediately desired a staff-officer to order up one of his...", "...exclaimed Mr. McKay. \"That's equivalent to a trifle over 29.1 inches.

He had slept through severe gales in the old _Tophet_ when she was scudding under close-reefed canvas before the wind or lying hove-to in a hurricane in Magellan Straits; but there was something in the peculiar motion of the _San Martin_ that roused his seaman's instincts.

The matter of appearance should at all times be respected, for it is just as easy to obtain results in most instances and also have a well-appearing balance.

But the fact of the matter was, she felt suspicious about the note, and all because I was so clumsy in trying to throw dust in her eyes. Five minutes--ten minutes--a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour had passed, and still no Clara. Then another quarter of an hour, and still she did not come. \"Whatever shall I do?\" I thought to myself--\"surely she is not deceiving me?\" And then, just as my spirits were regularly boiling over, heated as they were by impatience and vexation, in she came, with the note in her hand; and I saw her laugh maliciously, and cross over to Patty Smith. \"Oh,\" I said to myself, \"I shall die of shame.\" And I'm sure no one can tell what...", "...and none thought of applauding.

They had conversed for some minutes when the king said: \"I must tell this news to the queen. Wait for me here; I will come back in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour.\" Within the palace King George required no guide. Queen Mary was engaged upon a piece of wool work with the young princesses. Seeing her husband she went to him and offered him her forehead to kiss.

As they approached the corner and the watering-trough where four cross-roads met, the whole neighborhood seemed to be in evidence, and Mr. Simpson suddenly regretted his chivalrous escort of Rebecca; especially when, as he neared the group, an excited lady, wringing her hands, turned out to be Mrs. Peter Meserve, accompanied by Huldah, the Browns, Mrs. Milliken, Abijah...", "...any nest. At last we hid in a willow thicket, thinking that perhaps the hawk might go back to her nest. Instead, both birds disappeared in some distant woods. The sun was getting low and we were miles from our inn; yet as this was the nearest either of us had ever been to finding a marsh hawk's nest, we decided to hunt on until dark.

It seemed an almost hopeless hunt, for the marsh at this point was dry, with patches of bushes, masses of sedge, and piled heaps here and there of dry rushes. As I reached my farther boundary and was about to return, I straightened my aching back and looked beyond the bush. There, directly ahead, in a space fringed by spirea bushes but in plain sight, lay a round nest on the...", "...dank!_--and people will expect that I, who give every Sunday twice to the kirk, should have chairs in accordance.' _Moeder_, you know how it will be.

To begin in order, I should tell you that there were 289 members at the Cockpit meeting, the greatest number ever known there: but Mr. Pitt, who is too great a general to regard numbers, especially when there was a probability of no great harmony between the commanders, did not, however, postpone giving battle. The engagement was not more decisive than long: we sat till within a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of five in the morning; an uninterrupted serious debate from before two. Lord Hillsborough moved the address, and very injudiciously supposed an opposition. Martin, Legge's secretary, moved to omit in the address the indirect approbation of the treaties, and the direct assurances of protection to Hanover. These questions were at length divided: and against Pitt's inclination, the last, which was the least unpopular, was first decided by a majority of 311 against 105. Many...", "...said Wyndham, \"and you mean to go with Esther to-night? A very good idea--excellent. But how will she take it?\" \"How will she take it, Mr. Wyndham? I feel fit to pull my grey hairs out. How would she have taken it, you mean? For it's all a thing of the past, sir. Oh, I had it all planned fine.

And if he spoke up, the ruffian, I had my reply for him. I'd stay quiet enough till we got outside, and then just one blow in the middle of his face--yes, just one, to relieve a father's feelings.

She saw his dark, mad eyes. \"I will try at a quarter past.\" And he had to be content. He went and got some dinner. All the time he was still under chloroform, and every minute was stretched out indefinitely. He walked miles of streets. Then he thought he would be late at the meeting-place. He was at the Fountain at five past two. The torture of the next <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour was refined beyond expression. It was the anguish of combining the living self with the shell. Then he saw her. She came! And he was there. \"You are late,\" he said. \"Only five minutes,\" she answered. \"I'd never have done it to you,\" he laughed. She was in a dark blue costume. He looked at her beautiful figure. \"You want some flowers,\" he said, going to the nearest florist's. She followed him in silence. He bought her a bunch of scarlet, brick-red...", "...I insisted on the chair. Feverish, anxious, oppressed in my breathing--with nerves unstrung, as a doctor would have put it--I disturbed the order of the household towards twelve o'clock by interfering with old Toller in the act of locking up the house-door. \"Let me get a breath of fresh air,\" I said to him, \"or there will be no sleep for me to-night.\" He opened the door with a resignation to circumstances, so exemplary that it claimed some return. I promised to be back in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour. Old Toller stifled a yawn. \"I call that truly considerate,\" he said--and stifled another yawn. Dear old man! Stepping into the road, I first examined the Cur's part of the cottage. Not a sound was audible inside; not a creature was visible outside. The usual dim light was burning behind the window that looked out on the road. Nothing, absolutely nothing, that was suspicious could I either hear or see. I walked on, by what we called the upper bank of the river;...", "...hollow portion of the shell consists of a chamber C extending from the base to the forward end of the shell. The walls of this chamber are provided with the ribs D extending from the base to the point of the chamber in a spiral direction.

I have shown a pitch of one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> turn particularly for purposes of illustration, as if a greater pitch had been used the section Fig. 2 would not have shown any one rib entirely. As will be seen by Fig. 1, the grain or fiber of the metal is also twisted spirally in accordance with the pitch of the ribs D, in this case a quarter turn from the rear end of the projectile to its point. In order to manufacture a projectile of this character I have devised the following method which I deem preferable, though I...", "...majesty on the opposite heights. The spirit and the wealth of our countrymen would make Caudebec one of the most enchanting summer-residences in the world. The population of the town is estimated at about five thousand.

It was the _coming in of the tide_.... and within a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour it appeared to have risen upwards of three feet. You may remember that, in our own country, the Severn-tides exhibit the same phenomenon; and I have seen the river at Glocester rise _at once_ to the height of eight or ten feet, throwing up a shower of foam from the gradually narrowing bed of the river, and causing all the craft, great and small, to rise up as if by magic, and to appear upon a level with the meadows. The tide at Caudebec, although similar in kind, was...", "...collected the garrison. Their defence of seventeen days, under continual rifle and shell fire, in hastily dug trenches, which they were unable to leave even at night; exposed to several fierce attacks; in spite of heavy losses and with uncertain prospects of relief, will deserve careful attention when full accounts are published, and is a very honourable episode in the history of Brabant's Colonial Brigade, and particularly in the records of the Cape Mounted Rifles, who lost nearly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of their strength. Bringing the defenders with him, and having communicated with Hart and Brabant, Brabazon returned to Dewetsdorp, and was ordered to move thence to Thabanchu, which he did in an exceedingly convenient hour, as it turned out, for a certain convoy with an escort of Scots Guards and Yeomanry.

These were questions asked by the people of the United States. If Europe was to become the champion of monarchy and legitimacy, why should not America become the guardian of freedom and republicanism? Undoubtedly the tendency of Russia to creep quietly down the Pacific coast from her north-west possessions contributed to the conviction that the offices of the Holy Alliance could be called into service in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> also if necessary. It is just as true that the struggle for autonomy which the Greeks were instituting attracted sympathy in America and added to the conviction that a world struggle was imminent between monarchy and republicanism. That destiny had marked the United States for an unparalleled career had been a common saying since the days of Patrick Henry. But that isolation from European entanglements was necessary to fulfil it was equally appreciated. Washington had...", "...not to testify, my eyes I am convinced had something in them of the reproach of violated friendship. I thought I could trace, and by what followed I could not be mistaken, in the air of my Rinaldo, a confession of wrong, united with a kind of triumph, that he had been enabled so unexpectedly and completely to regain that moral equilibrium which he had before lost. It was not long before his servants returned from an unsuccessful pursuit, and we set forward for a village about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a league further upon the road from Leontini.

For some posts he was not suited; for others his application could find no support. He even thought of going to America, where Emerson and other admirers would have welcomed him. But the disappointments in Scotland decided him to make one more effort in London before accepting defeat, and in 1834 he found a house at Chelsea and prepared to quit his hermitage among the moors. Cheyne Row, Chelsea, was to be his new home, a quiet street running northward from the riverside in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of London not then invaded by industrialism.

I did so. I found that I could get soil about one-third of the way up the ravine, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile below where the brushwood grew; and having ascertained that, I returned to the cabin, threw down my provisions which were to have lasted me a week, and as it was late, I decided that I would not commence operations until the following day.

Sawley, with an air of great mystery, informed me that this was a Mr Dalgleish of Raxmathrapple, the representative of an ancient Scottish family who claimed an important heritable office. The name, I thought, was familiar to me, but there was something in the appearance of Mr Dalgleish which, notwithstanding the smiles of Miss Selina, rendered a rivalship in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> utterly out of the question. I hate injustice, so let me do due honour in description to the Sawley banquet. The tea-urn most literally corresponded to its name. The table was decked out with divers platters, containing seed-cakes cut into rhomboids, almond biscuits, and ratafia drops; but somehow or other they all looked clammy and damp, and, for the life of me, I could not divest myself of the idea that the selfsame viands had figured, not long before, as funeral...", "...help.

But not blind yet.

It was a piteous, involuntary staving-off of the inevitable. The next moment that fascination which leads us to our own undoing made her look in Paul's direction, and this time she could not avoid his eager gaze and bent her head mechanically. \"After all, I believe I must have met him somewhere,\" she said hastily. Mrs. Bobby, who for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, had been determinedly ignoring them both, apparently giving her whole attention to the music and the people, now turned towards them. \"Who is that handsome man who bowed to you, Elizabeth?\" she asked. \"I never saw him before.\" \"His name is Halleck.

Ten minutes later, as it was perceived that his signals were disregarded, the _Badger's_ commander ordered a shot to be fired at her, and this was immediately returned by the smuggler with one of her stern guns.

Wren in writing of the tower at the north-west, which had fallen about 1630-1640, said that it had not been built at the same date nor in the same manner as the other then remaining to the south of the same front. The upper part of the central tower itself had been built perhaps during the second <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the fourteenth century or even earlier. Consequently it seems probable that the two towers which fell in 1210 were the original twelfth-century central tower and that of the same date to the south of the west front. In Speed's map of 1610 both the western towers are represented as having small spires.

In the ancient Greek forms, Winckelmann distinguishes four kinds of grace--lofty, pleasing, humble, and comic--but the grace exhibited by sculptured forms necessarily depends upon the harmony of expression, character of form, and pose. This should be the case with painted portraits also, but drapery restrictions and accessories commonly compel a limitation in the design of the artist. In three <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and full length portraits it is impossible to depart from the dress customary at the period of execution, unless the sitter assume a classical character, and this is only possible in comparatively few instances.

But as the river at flood-time carries down large quantities of rich deposit which is extremely beneficial to the soil on which it settles, it would never do to erect any obstruction to check this in its flow.

To be perfect in this art she must know in which <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the moon to plant and gather all kinds of salads and herbs throughout the year; she must also be cleanly, have \"a quick eye, a curious nose, a perfect taste, and a ready eare;\" and be neither butter-fingered, sweet-toothed, nor faint-hearted: for if she were the first of these, she would let everything fall; if the second, she would consume that which she should increase; and if the third, she would lose time with too much niceness.

The magistrates represent no one but themselves, their party, and their own class; they are necessarily swayed by the passions and prejudices that party and class possess; and, seeing that the English people long ago refused power over the national purse to an unrepresentative body like the House of Lords, it is surprising they have until now allowed power over the local purse to be in the hands of such equally unrepresentative bodies as the courts of <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> sessions. The line which the immediate reform of local government must take is, therefore, the creation of a directly-elected body to deal with county affairs, and the federation of such of the smaller boards as have to do with the more purely district concerns, both of which points the Cabinet of Lord Salisbury appear disposed to concede. But upon the former point Liberals will claim that the whole--and not merely three-fourths--of the County Councils shall be directly...", "...themselves, one after another, as tributary sovereigns in Transylvania and Hungary; and they maintained their ground by no deeper policy than that of occasionally joining the enemy, in order to render themselves more formidable to their own prince.

In this <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> destructive wars were succeeded but by brief truces, which were scarcely less hurtful: far and wide the land lay waste, while the injured serf had to complain equally of his enemy and his protector.

A district six blocks long and two blocks wide, housed 30,000 Chinese when the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was full. The dwellings were old business blocks of the early days; but the Chinese had added to them, had rebuilt them, had run out their own balconies and entrances, and had given the quarter that feeling of huddled irregularity which makes all Chinese built dwellings fall naturally into pictures. Not only this; they had burrowed to a depth of a story or two under the ground, and through this ran passages in which the Chinese transacted their dark and devious affairs--as the...", "...with his companions, gave way.

A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour or so of paddling through these weed-encumbered shallows brought us to the deep and open lake. Here, on the edge of the reeds a tall pole that served as a mast was shipped, and a square sail, made of closely-woven mats, run up. It filled with the morning off-land breeze and presently we were bowling along at a rate of quite eight miles the hour.

He was the boy's grand-father; and, if intellect were hereditary, the boy might presume on his lineage with more chance of correctness than many of higher birth.

For a full quarter of an hour Clyde convinced himself that he was entirely satisfied with the situation. The brig was not a bad place, or, at least, it would not be, if the boatswain would only leave the steerage and allow the prisoner to be by himself. He wished very much to try the carpenter's saw upon the slats of his prison.

All these ragged and unprincipled rascals--no matter from what <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> they came--were instantly set at work; some, who were fit for nothing else, rubbed and scrubbed and polished corslets and helmets, shields and spurs; others sharpened spears and pikes and javelins, grinding and rubbing the points upon any stone they could find; many were beasts of burthen, and toiled from morning till night, in carrying stores to the ships; and all these ragamuffins were destined to sail under a banner, which the pope himself had consecrated, and under a bull...", "...exhibited, but in a manner that showed its whole animal nature was absorbed by the spirit of revenge. By the time he had placed the bullet in the barrel of his gun and driven it home, the brute was close upon him. There was not time for him to withdraw the ramrod, much less to put on a cap. Grasping his roer by the barrel, he prepared to defend himself, intending to use the weapon as a club. The enraged creature was about to make a spring upon him, when assistance came from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> altogether unexpected. One of the dogs--a large bull-dog called \"Smoke\"--had not followed the buffaloes to cover. It had obeyed its master's command when called back from the chase. Just as the leopard was crouching upon the earth to gather force for the final spring, Smoke seized it by one of the hind legs. Not a second of time was lost by Willem. One more chance for life had been thus given him, and he hastened to avail himself of it.

At one extremity of the enclosing canal is the Schreijerstoren (1482) or ``Weepers' Tower,'' so called on account of its being at the head of the ancient harbour, and the scene in former days of sorrowful leave-takings. Between this and the next crescent of the Heeren Gracht sprang up, on the east, the labyrinthine <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where for more than three centuries the large Jewish population has been located, and in the middle of which the painter Rembrandt lived (1640-1656) and the philosopher Spinoza was born (1632).

In a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour the little ceremony was over, and the registers were signed by us all. Nino also got a stamped certificate, which he put very carefully in his pocket-book. I never knew what it cost Nino to overcome the scruples of the sindaco about marrying a strange couple from Rome in that outlandish place, where the peasants stared at us as though we had been the most unnatural curiosities, and even the pigs in the street jogged sullenly out of our way as though not recognising...", "...brown in a little butter, in a frying-pan, taking care that the onions are browned and not burnt black; add the contents of the frying-pan to the vegetables and stock, and after it has boiled some time, till the onions are tender, rub the whole through a wire sieve, thicken with a little brown roux, adding, of course, pepper and salt to taste.

I feel convinced that the cigars of Regent Street were of a more curious aroma than cigars bought in any other street, that it was the very place wherein to purchase a great green flagon of rare scent as a present for a lady, that if you happened to want a Monte Cristo emerald this was the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> wherein to search for it. That was my impression, but lest it should be mere fancy, a year or so ago I asked one of the older shopkeepers whether the street was quite what he and I remembered it. He said very emphatically it was not at all what it had been; and I feel sure that he was right, and that in a less degree the other principal shopping centres have declined from their former splendour.

On the day of this fated election the little Scalawag Governor sat in the Capitol, the picture of nervous despair. Since sunrise his office had been flooded with messages from every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the state begging too late for troops. Everywhere his henchmen were in a panic. From every quarter the stories were the same. Hundreds of determined, silent white men had crowded the polls, taken their own time to vote and refused to give an inch of room to the long line of panic-stricken negroes who looked on helplessly. At five o'clock in the afternoon less than a hundred blacks had voted in the entire township in which the Capital was located. Norton was a candidate...", "...the doctor had to pay half the man's market value to the owner. Professional fees were fixed according to a patient's rank. Gentlemen had to pay five shekels of silver to a doctor who set a bone or restored diseased flesh, commoners three shekels, and masters for their slaves two shekels. There was also a scale of fees for treating domesticated animals, and it was not over-generous. An unfortunate surgeon who undertook to treat an ox or ass suffering from a severe wound had to pay a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of its price to its owner if it happened to die. A shrewd farmer who was threatened with the loss of an animal must have been extremely anxious to engage the services of a surgeon.

He had no need to repeat his order, for the ship began to list over at a sharp angle, and the men broke into a run.

There would be an analogy between his manner of regarding her and the way that superstitious villagers look on their crazy innocents, she thought sadly. And she bled for him too: she grieved to hurt his pride. But she had come to imagine that there was no avoidance of this deed of personal humiliation. Nevil had scrawled a note to her. She had it in her hand one forenoon in mid November, when she said to her husband: 'I have ordered the carriage for two o'clock to meet the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to three train to London, and I have sent Stanton on to get the house ready for us tonight.'

Then, intoxicated with drink and food, besotted, red in the face, shaken by hiccoughs, his mind clouded and his speech thick, he unbuttoned his uniform in order to breathe or he could not have taken a step. His eyes closed, his mind became torpid; he leaned his heavy forehead on his folded arms on the table and gradually lost all consciousness of things and events. The last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the moon above the trees in the park shed a faint light on the landscape. It was the chill hour that precedes the dawn. Numerous silent shadows glided among the trees and occasionally a blade of steel gleamed in the shadow as a ray of moonlight struck it. The quiet chateau stood there in dark outline. Only two windows were still lighted up on the ground floor. Suddenly a voice thundered: \"Forward! nom d'un nom! To the breach, my lads!\" And in an instant the doors,...", "...glass above, and turning back, deliberately opened the door of the kitchen stove, and looked in. As I half expected, I found a pile of partly charred rags, showing where the wretches had burned their prison clothing, and proceeding further, picked up from the ashes a ring which whether or not they were conscious of having attempted to destroy in this way I cannot say, but which I thankfully put in my pocket against the day it might be required as proof. Discerning nothing more in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> inviting interest, I asked myself if I had nerve to descend into the cellar. Finally concluding that that was more than could be expected from any man in my position, I gave one look of farewell to the damp and desolate walls about me, then with a breath of relief jumped from the kitchen window again into the light and air of day.

We have only been at it a few days, and we have already placed with responsible firms orders for 150,000 shells a month. In a very short time I am confident it will be a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million or 300,000. (Cheers.) It is a process of inviting business men to organize themselves and to assist us to develop the resources of their district.

Let us look at a few of its hurtful results; beginning with those of minor importance. It produces extravagance. The desire to be _comme il faut_, which underlies all conformities, whether of manners, dress, or styles of entertainment, is the desire which makes many a spendthrift and many a bankrupt. To \"keep up appearances,\" to have a house in an approved <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> furnished in the latest taste, to give expensive dinners and crowded _soirees_, is an ambition forming the natural outcome of the conformist spirit. It is needless to enlarge on these follies: they have been satirized by hosts of writers, and in every drawing-room. All that here concerns us, is to point out that the respect for social observances, which men think so praiseworthy, has the same root with this effort to be fashionable in mode of living; and that, other things...", "...may be of great service to young mothers, and those who have not been accustomed to minister to the sick. 337. _To purify the Chambers of the Sick._--Close the windows and doors of the room to be purified, except one door; close also the chimney aperture, except two or three inches at the bottom, and remove all the iron and brass furniture; then put three table-spoonsful of common salt into a dish or pan, place it upon the floor of the apartment, and pour at once upon the salt a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a pint of oil of vitriol; retire, and close the room for forty-eight hours, during which time vapor will continue to rise and diffuse itself completely through the room, so as to destroy the matter on which infection depends.

He all but licked them on the spot, so that they forgot their grievance in their haste to defend themselves. He then divided them into squads of five and took them to another saloon--one squad and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a dollar at a time. He only used one dollar and fifty cents cash that way. He then promised all of them forty beers a day beginning on Monday. He told them to get recruits, who would not be admitted to the union, but could have the privilege of parading. They must be thirsty men and look it. They would receive two beers apiece.

Now clear out, and--silence!\" A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later the Rover boys and Songbird walked down to the river. There were plenty of boats to be had, and Dick and Tom were soon out. Songbird and Sam received an invitation to go for a ride in a gasolene launch owned by Stanley. \"Suits me!\" cried the would-be poet. \"I can row any time, but I can't always ride in a motor boat.\" \"Same here,\" said Sam. A number of craft were on the river, including one containing Jerry Koswell and Bart Larkspur. Koswell scowled as...", "...ground and again stood motionless. Evidently it trusted for safety to escaping observation. We saw some monkeys and fresh tapir sign, and Kermit shot a jacu for the pot. At about three o'clock I was in the lead, when the current began to run more quickly. We passed over one or two decided ripples, and then heard the roar of rapids ahead, while the stream began to race. We drove the canoe into the bank, and then went down a tapir trail, which led alongside the river, to reconnoiter. A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile's walk showed us that there were big rapids, down which the canoes could not go; and we returned to the landing. All the canoes had gathered there, and Rondon, Lyra, and Kermit started down-stream to explore. They returned in an hour, with the information that the rapids continued for a long distance, with falls and steep pitches of broken water, and that the portage would take several days. We made camp just above the rapids. Ants swarmed, and some of them bit...", "...vigor and the same antic play of fancy inherent in his verse. In 1906 he took his first long tramp through Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, and in 1908 a second through the northeastern states. During these two, as in his latest like excursion through the Western wheat belt, he traveled as a minstrel, observing the following rules: (1) Keep away from the cities. (2) Keep away from the railroads. (3) Have nothing to do with money. Carry no baggage. (4) Ask for dinner about <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> after eleven. (5) Ask for supper, lodging and breakfast about quarter of five. (6) Travel alone. (7) Be neat, truthful, civil and on the square. (8) Preach the Gospel of Beauty.

I do not think she has ever had such a frightful attack before.\" For a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour longer profound silence prevailed. Then Grandidier came out of the pavilion, bareheaded and still ghastly pale. Passing the little glazed work-shop on his way, he perceived Thomas and Pierre there, and at once came in. But he was obliged to lean against a bench like a man who is dazed, haunted by a nightmare. His good-natured, energetic face retained an expression of acute anguish; and his left ear was scratched and bleeding. However, he at once wished to talk,...", "...With all the accustomed despatch of a restaurant, a most appetizing petit souper made its speedy appearance; and although now perfectly divested of the high excitement which had hitherto possessed me, my spirits were excellent, and I never more relished our good fare and good fellowship. After a full bumper to the health of the fair Emily had been proposed and drained by all three, Trevanion again explained how much more serious difficulty would result from any false step in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> than from all my other scrapes collectively. This he represented so strongly, that for the first time I began to perceive the train of ill consequences that must inevitably result, and promised most faithfully to be guided by any counsel he might feel disposed to give me. \"Ah! what a pity,\" said O'Leary, \"it is not my case. It's very little trouble it would cost any one to break off a match for me.

And when he found himself alone with Aunt Dide he returned to his pictures quietly. This lasted for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour amid the profound silence of the asylum, broken only at intervals by some prison sound--a stealthy step, the jingling of a bunch of keys, and occasionally a loud cry, immediately silenced. But the boy must have been tired by the excessive heat of the day, for sleep gradually stole over him.

Somehow Norman felt it necessary to bring him in. \"He does suck up to you,\" he said. \"_I'm_ not going to, you know.\" Hugo stirred uneasily, and said: \"It's quite true what he says. It's cheek keeping us waiting like this for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour.\" \"To play with a baby,\" added Fred with scorn. It was the charge, so frequently brought, which had hurt him the year before. But it hurt him no longer. \"I like playing with little Pam,\" he said. \"So does Hugo sometimes, when you're not here.

Nor did some corpses in the neighborhood of our improvised camp disturb us. There was only a lack of water and after having eaten thirst began to torment us. Soon afterwards we continued our march in the scorching midday sun; dust was covering our uniforms and skin to the depth of almost an inch. We tried in vain to be jolly, but thirst tormented us more and more, and we became weaker and weaker from one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour to another. Many in our ranks fell down exhausted, and we were simply unable to move. So the commander of our section had no other choice but to let us halt again if he did not want every one of us to drop out. Thus it happened that we stayed behind a considerable distance, and were not amongst the first that were pursuing the French. Finally, towards four o'clock, we saw a village in front of us; we began at once to march at a much brisker pace. Among other things...", "...short,\" exclaimed George, suddenly discovering the absence of Miss Thompson. \"Did she fall by the wayside? Was the pace too swift for her?\" \"Young man, you talk too much,\" objected Margery indignantly. \"I know it,\" laughed George. \"I can't help it.\" Miss Elting's face relaxed in a smile. \"Where _is_ Miss Thompson?\" questioned Dill. \"Miss Thompson will be here soon,\" replied the guardian. Unnoticed by the boys Harriet slipped away, a bundle under her arm. She returned, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later, accompanied by Tommy clad in her outside skirt and at peace with the world.

Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man....", "...effect.

Returning home thence toward his own fence, he had smelled the smoke of fire, and had found within a furlong of his path a long ridge of burning grass. According to Mickey's account, it could not have been lighted above a few minutes before Heathcote's presence on the spot. As it was, it had got too much ahead for him to put it out single-handed; a few yards he might have managed, but--so Mickey said, probably exaggerating the matter--there was half a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile of flame. He had therefore ridden on before the fire, had called his own two men to him, and had at once lighted the grass himself some two hundred yards in front, making a second fire, but so keeping it down that it should be always under control.

Now, I'll answer for it, if I pull his right ear he will offer me his left.\" So saying, he lugged me by the ear, upon which I knocked him down for his trouble.

I had hardly time to wash myself and change my shirt, which was bloody, when I was summoned on the quarter-deck. When I arrived, I found Mr Falcon walking up and down. He looked very hard at me, but did not ask me any questions as to the cause of my unusual appearance. \"Mr Simple,\" said he, \"I sent for you to beg your pardon for my behaviour to you last night, which was not only very hasty but...", "...from Sautter's and the Madeira!

I had not stood stock still for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, why should I expect Philadelphia to? And little by little, as I got my breath again after my first indignant surprise, as I pulled myself together after my first series of shocks, I began to understand that the wonder was that anything should be left, and to see that Philadelphia has held on to enough of its character and beauty to impress the stranger, anyway, with the fine serenity that I missed at every turn.

You need not take them into account.\" By the look of Miss Wilson's face, it might have been gathered that she would have preferred to take them into account, at any rate to the extent of hearing a little more about them. But her momentary dejection disappeared. She had to keep her control of the situation. \"And now as to hours,\" she said. \"My plan would be to work the _whole_ of the morning, with perhaps a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour off for a glass of milk and a rock cake or something of that sort--say from nine o'clock to lunch time; exercise and games in the afternoon, till four.

She abused herself for ever having let it drop. It really was much better than yawning and being bored. She had no idea how entertaining she was to herself.

There he was first employed in the stables of the Tramway Company in New York, and lived in the Italian <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city, but afterwards he rose out of his poverty and low position and became a journalist. In that character he attracted attention by a new political and religious propaganda.

Switchboards having hundreds of thousands of jacks are not uncommon. The multiple jacks are nearly always mounted in strips of twenty and the answering jacks usually in strips of ten, the length of the jack strip being the same in each case in the same board and, therefore, giving twice as wide a spacing in the answering as in the multiple jacks. The distance between centers in the multiple jacks varies from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch--which is perhaps the extreme minimum--to half an inch, beyond which larger limit there seems to be no need of going in any case. It is customary that the jack strip shall be made of the same total thickness as the distance between the centers of two of its jacks, and from this it follows that the strips when piled one upon the other give the same vertical distance between jack centers as the horizontal distance. In Fig. 358 is shown a strip of multiple and a strip...", "...When they encountered, Sir Tristram met Sir Gaheris and gave him a fall, but Sir Palomides unhorsed Sir Dinadan and bruised him much.

During the six weeks that had elapsed since his arrival at Cephalonia, he had been living in the most comfortless manner, pent up with pigs and poultry, on board the vessel which brought him.

The difference in strength between a three-quarter and a full thread in cast iron is no doubt practically very small indeed, while the process of tapping is very much easier for the three-quarter full thread, because the tap may, in that case, be wound continuously forward without backing it at every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> or half revolution, as would otherwise be necessary, in order to give the oil access to the cutting edges of the tap--and oil should always be used in the process of tapping (even though on cast iron it causes the cuttings to clog in the flutes of the tap, necessitating in many cases that the tap be once or twice during the operation taken out, and the cuttings removed) because the oil preserves the cutting edges of the tap teeth from undue abrasion, and, therefore, from...", "...had received communications from those who had visited Ethiopia as far south as eleven degrees north latitude.

This difficulty can be solved by supposing either that if he himself had visited this part of Africa, it was at a season of the year when the sun was in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the heavens in which he was accustomed to see it; or, if he received his information from the inhabitants of this district, that they, not regarding the periodical appearance of the sun to the north of the zenith as extraordinary, did not think it necessary to mention it.

This suited my plans to a nicety; so we filled upon the schooner and followed the ship closely, luffing up for her lee <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> as we did so; and so well had everything worked with us that I believe none of the Frenchmen had the slightest suspicion that anything was wrong until we had actually run them aboard and thrown our grappling-irons.

Though the water was perfectly smooth, the boat, with all our party and our stores, had as much in her as she could conveniently carry. A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour served to carry us across, when we again hauled our boat up; and choosing the highest hummock in the neighbourhood, we again erected our flagstaff.

Another member of the party thought that it would be more desirable to take up a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> section of land at the Upper Geyser Basin, for the reason that that locality could be more easily reached by tourists and pleasure seekers. A third suggestion was that each member of the party pre-empt a claim, and in order that no one should have an advantage over the others, the whole should be thrown into a common pool for the benefit of the entire party.

We were drawn, along with the greater part of our companions, to the edge of the cliff, there to listen to and make a thousand conjectures. A fog narrowed our horizon to about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, and the misty veil, cold and dense, enveloped sky and sea in equal obscurity.

The wish to get rid of the dangers presumably threatening from the German <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> is all the more real since geographical conditions offer a prospect of crippling the German overseas commerce without any excessive efforts.

The smaller craft, some of which had now arrived, seem to have taken little part in the action, which was thus left to the galleys. Each commander was to occupy so much space with his galley as to allow room for manoeuvring it to advantage, and yet not enough to allow the enemy to break the line. He was directed to single out his adversary, to close with him at once, and board as soon as possible. The beaks of the galleys were...", "...ten minutes.

Gaudenzio was too young to have done the figures before Bernardino died. Originally, doubtless, the grotto was shown without figures, which were added by Gaudenzio, later on; they were probably among his first works.

It remains to consider how far the external evidence for the Gospels goes to prove their authenticity. It may indeed well be asked how the external evidence can be expected to prove the authenticity of these records. It does so, to a considerable extent, indirectly by throwing them back into closer contact with the facts. It also tends to establish the authority in which they were held, certainly in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the second century, and very probably before. By this time the Gospels were acknowledged to be all that is now understood by the word 'canonical.' They were placed upon the same footing as the Old Testament Scriptures. They were looked up to with the same reverence and regarded as possessing the same Divine inspiration. We may trace indeed some of the steps by which this position was attained. The [Greek: gegraptai] of the Epistle of Barnabas, the public reading of the...", "...and of preventing their possible repetition elsewhere. The first of these aims was attained with a fuller employment, and perhaps more moderate statement of historical facts, than can be found in any other fiction of the same class; the second was ineffective, because, when it found expression, the abuses which had suggested it no longer continued at the Antipodes, and could not conceivably be repeated on the existing settlements at Port Blair and Noumea.

There were divans in the marquee, on which we reclined. We had waited about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, when some musicians appeared with tom-toms and rude guitars, on which they began strumming, and making a hideous noise. Then some dancing girls were brought in, and their extraordinary performance surpassed anything I had ever seen either in India or at Covent Garden. The natives of Moncullu were ranged round the open part of the marquee, singing to the music and keeping time by clapping their hands.

Life at Bisanthe would, in any case, have been remarkably attractive to Callias. The taste for sport was hereditary with him, as it was with most Athenians of his class. But, ever since his boyhood, circumstances had been altogether adverse to any indulgence of it. For a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century an Athenian's life had been perforce a city life.[49] The country outside the walls was not available for when it was not actually in the occupation of a hostile army, it was still in a state of desolation.

These the sportsman had been obliged to seek in the mountain regions of Phocis, Doris, and Thessaly. Now the smaller such as the...", "...in well nigh every street there are one or more \"Prenditoria di Lotti.\" In fact, begging and gambling are the only two trades that thrive in Rome, or are pushed with enterprise or energy.

Over each office are placed the Papal arms, the cross keys of St Peter and the tiara. Outside their aspects differ, according to the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city. In the well-to-do streets, if such an appellation applied to any street here be not an absurdity, the exterior of the lottery-offices are neat but not gaudy. A notice, printed in large black letters on a white placard, that this week the lottery will be drawn for in Rome, or where- ever it may be, and a simple glass frame over the door, in which are slid the winning numbers of last week, form the whole outward adornment. In the poor and populous parts the...", "...keep sounding the fog-horn every minute or so.

As they neared the Parish of Bonaventure, Lavilette looked back again, and saw the little black notary a few hundred yards behind. He recognised him this time, waved a hand, and then called to his own fagged horse. Shangois's mare was not fagged; her heart and body were like steel. Not a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile behind them both were three of the twenty artillerymen. Lavilette came to the bridge shouting for Baby, the keeper. Baby recognised him, and ran to the lever even as the sorel galloped up. For the first time in the ride, Nic stuck spurs harshly into the sorel's side. With a grunt of pain the horse sprang madly on.

But the country ruled over by the Mahrattas was very extensive, and, as has already been narrated, there was more than one chieftain who had thrown down the gage to England, and in consequence there were other forces to be encountered in addition to that under the command of Scindia in person.

He was all night in the saddle, leading his troop hither and thither, but utterly unable to subdue a mob that broke out in one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> after another and always melted away at his approach, to muster again immediately afterward in another part of the town.

Louise, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, followed her. CHAPTER X OUTCAST The room into which a waiting man servant showed them was large and handsomely furnished. Whisky and soda, wine and sandwiches were upon the sideboard. The Baroness, stopping only to light a cigarette, moved towards the door. \"I shall return,\" she said, \"in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour.\" She looked for a moment steadily at her friend, and then turned away. Louise strolled to the sideboard and helped herself to a sandwich. \"Come and forage, won't you?\" she asked carelessly. \"There are some _pate_ sandwiches here, and you want whisky and soda, of course--or do you prefer brandy?\" \"Neither, thanks!\" Wrayson answered firmly. \"I want what I came for. Please sit down here and answer my questions.\" She laughed a little mockingly, and turning...", "...to Mammoth Hot Springs, where it was joined by another coming up the valley of the Gardiner. Thence it led across the Black-tail Deer plateau to the ford above Tower Falls; and thence up the Lamar Valley, forking at Soda Butte, and reaching the Bighorn Valley by way of Clark's Fork and the Stinkingwater River. This trail was certainly a very ancient and much-traveled one. It had become a deep furrow in the grassy slopes, and it is still distinctly visible in places, though unused for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century. Additional evidence in the same direction may be seen in the wide-spread distribution of implements peculiar to Indian use. Arrows and spear heads have been found in considerable numbers. Obsidian Cliff was an important quarry, and the open country near the outlet of Yellowstone Lake a favorite camping-ground. Certain implements, such as pipes, hammers, and stone vessels, indicating the former presence of a more civilized people, have been found to a limited...", "...That a group of Greeks should be permitted to slaughter sheep in a basement, that Italian women should be allowed to sort over rags collected from the city dumps, not only within the city limits but in a court swarming with little children, that immigrant bakers should continue unmolested to bake bread for their neighbors in unspeakably filthy spaces under the pavement, appeared incredible to visitors accustomed to careful city regulations. I recall two visits made to the Italian <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> by John Burns--the second, thirteen years after the first. During the latter visit it seemed to him unbelievable that a certain house owned by a rich Italian should have been permitted to survive. He remembered with the greatest minuteness the positions of the houses on the court, with the exact space between the front and rear tenements, and he asked at once whether we had been able to cut a window into a dark hall as he had recommended thirteen years before. Although we...", "...that somehow or other the trustees and officers of the New York and Rangoon do not own so much stock of their company as they did, having managed to have their stock sold to subscribers as if it were company stock. If this is so, those gentlemen have made their reward sure; and Mr. Peter Rolleum, having the cash in hand for that very liberal allotment of stock which he gave himself for his trouble in getting up the New York and Rangoon Petroleum Company, is very likely half or a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> as rich as he says. CHAPTER XXV. THE TULIPOMANIA. Alboni, the singer, had an exquisitely sweet voice, but was a very big fat woman. Somebody accordingly remarked that she was an elephant that had swallowed a nightingale. About as incongruous is the idea of a nation of damp, foggy, fat, full-figured, broad-sterned, gin-drinking, tobacco-smoking Dutchmen in Holland, going crazy over a flower. But they did so, for three or four years together. Their craze is known...", "...intricacies melted into a blur from which the eyes of Mrs. Leath again looked out at him. He saw the fine sweep of her brows, and the deep look beneath them as she had turned from him on their last evening in London. \"This will be good-bye, then,\" she had said; and it occurred to him that her parting phrase had been the same as Sophy Viner's. At the thought he jumped to his feet and took down from its hook the coat in which he had left Miss Viner's letter. The clock marked the third <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> after midnight, and he knew it would make no difference if he went down to the post-box now or early the next morning; but he wanted to clear his conscience, and having found the letter he went to the door. A sound in the next room made him pause. He had become conscious again that, a few feet off, on the other side of a thin partition, a small keen flame of life was quivering and agitating the air. Sophy's face came hack to him insistently. It was as vivid now as Mrs....", "...me if I should encroach upon their rights and separate them from the adored person of the queen. It is their right, it is their duty to draw the robe upon the person of your majesty, and to secure your shoes. I beg, therefore, your gracious permission to allow the ladies to come in.\" \"Well, do it then,\" sighed the queen. \" Let me bear the fetters here in Versailles until the last moment. I shall have my compensation in Trianon. Be assured I shall have my compensation there.\" A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later the queen was arrayed in her changed attire, and came out from the toilet-chamber. The stiff crinoline had disappeared; the whalebone corset, with the long projecting point, was cast aside; and the high coiffure, which Leonard had so elaborately made up in the morning, was no more to be seen. A white robe, decorated at the bottom with a simple volante, fell in broad artistic folds over her noble figure, whose full proportions had been concealed by the rigid...", "...the organ-loft. Just then the singers came. Instead of going out like a man, he dodged them from some absurd cause or other, with a half idea that he would get into trouble for intruding. The longer he stayed the worse it was for him. At last he saw Buttons and Dick enter, and tried to make signals. \"Well,\" said Buttons, \"we had better leave. The Sorrentonians will be around here soon to see the maniac. They will find out all about him, and make us acquainted with Lynch law.\" In a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour more they were on their way back to Naples. CHAPTER XII. HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII, AND ALL THAT THE SIGHT OF THOSE FAMOUS PLACES PRODUCED ON THE MINDS OF THE DODGE CLUB. They had already visited Herculaneum, but the only feeling which had been awakened by the sight of that ill-fated city was one of unmitigated disgust. As honesty was the chief characteristic of the whole party, they did not hesitate to express themselves with the utmost freedom on...", "...reached any one else's ears but her own, no one's feelings were hurt. A chance visitor to Greystones, regular visitors were not encouraged, had once observed that the entire grounds, some thirty or forty acres in extent, which comprised the domain must have been an elm wood originally, and that a space just sufficient on which to erect a house of moderate dimensions had been cleared in the heart of it, Greystones had been built, a way cut through the trees to form a drive to the road a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile distant from the house, and the rest of the wood left undisturbed to be called a garden or not as the owner pleased. Certainly the present owner had made no attempt to form a garden, but had allowed the elms to grow right up to the walls of the house and to darken the windows of the gloomily situated dwelling as much as they pleased. \"Margaret Anstruther, if you will not come and play tennis, will you come for a ride upon your bicycle--that nice new one that you...", "...think that was all,\" returned Archie, then suddenly abandoning the subject he inquired where Charlie might be. \"He's with papa in the study,\" replied Minnie. \"I saw him go in a few minutes ago.\" \"Then I think I'll go and find Seymour. I want somebody to talk to, and Ned looks too lazy even to wink.\" \"Seymour isn't back yet,\" drawled Ned, speaking solely for the purpose of disproving Archie's accusation, \"he went off with Miss Mabel, and a precious while he has been doing that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile.\" \"Oh, there he is!\" exclaimed Minnie, as he passed the window, and a moment later he entered the room looking very grave indeed. \"What's the matter?\" inquired all three almost in a breath. \"It's Mabel,\" he replied slowly. \"She is in great danger, the doctor thinks she has burst a blood-vessel, but cannot be quite sure yet.\" \"But how did it happen?\" cried Minnie, \"she was all right when she left here. She did not feel ill at all--only tired.\" \"The doctor...", "...too vain of his rank and precedency to suffer any one else to lead the bride down the first dance; but she was not, I believe, much obliged to him for his politeness; it cost her the tail of her wedding-gown and a broken nail, and she continued lame during the remainder of the night. In making an apology to her for his want of dexterity, and assuring her that he was not so awkward in handling the enemies of his country in battle as in handling friends he esteemed in a dance, he gave no <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to an old maid aunt, whom, in the violence of his gesticulation, he knocked down with his elbow and laid sprawling on the ground. He was sober when these accidents literally occurred. Of this original I collected the following particulars: Before the Revolution he was a soldier in the regiment of Flanders, from which he deserted and became a corporal in another regiment; in 1793 he was a drum-major in one of the battalions in garrison in Paris. You remember the struggles...", "...is Thine and that I am Thine, and he has no part or lot in me, nor can ever have. Here is Crooked lane. Good-night, Mr. Lindsay.\" She had slipped into the devious darkness of the place before he could find any reply, before he quite realised, indeed, that they had reached her lodging. He could only utter a vague \"Good-night\" after her, formulating more definite statements to himself a few minutes later in Bentinck street. CHAPTER XI. Miss Howe was walking in the business <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of Calcutta. It was the business quarter, and yet the air was gay with the dimpling of piano notes, and looking up one saw the bright sunlight fall on yellow stuccoed flats above the shops and the offices. There the pleasant north wind blew banners of muslin curtains out of wide windows, and little gardens of palms in pots showed behind the balustrades of the flat roofs whenever a story ran short. Everywhere was a subtle contagion of momentary well-being, a sense of lifted...", "...your endeavours to get into an empty quart bottle, you are not a whit more likely to succeed when you come to experiment upon a pint. But let us whisper in your ear that this excuse will hardly serve your turn, and that it is wholly irreconcilable with the arguments which you used to advance. A copious supply of foreign grain was the very thing for which you and your associates primarily clamoured. You wanted an import to a prodigious extent, and you flattered yourselves that, for each <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of American wheat, you would be able to send in exchange so many yards of that calico which you fondly maintain to be the principal fabric of the world. You were content, and you have said it over and over again, to take your chance of the home market, provided the other ones were opened to you. Now that you have them open, and now that wheat has come in such abundance as even your most sanguine anticipations could not have conceived, you have the coolness and effrontery to...", "...egg, beat white and yolk separately.

You are on the sure track, my friend,\" returned my uncle. \"Where will deadlier feeling harbour than in the bosom of a monk, thwart but his ambition? or in that of a sordid scoundrel, who trembles for wealth acquired by knavery? Were you acquainted with recent occurrences in which our young friend has been connected, my life upon it, your conviction would be confirmed as to the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> from which the danger came.\" \"And am I not worthy of that confidence?\" inquired the gipsy, in a tone that showed herself offended. \"Undoubtedly,\" returned Mr. Hartley. \"One day more, and I will give you ample proof of the dependence I place in your fidelity and discretion.

The house of Fletcher and David, one of the oldest in London, smashed!\" \"I know it,\" said Grenfell, dryly. \"Then you know, perhaps, how your friend, Sir Gervais Vyner, has let them in for nigh a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million?\" \"I know more; for I know that _you_ know nothing of the matter; but, to turn to something that concerns ourselves.

James was still in the dining-room talking to Soames, who had come round again before breakfast. On hearing who his visitor was, he muttered nervously: \"Now, what's he want, I wonder?\" He then got up. \"Well,\" he said to Soames, \"don't you go doing...", "...larvae construct their habitations wholly of silk. Of this description is that of a moth, whose abode, except as to the materials which compose it, is formed on the same general plan as that just described, and the larva in like manner feeds only on the parenchyma of the leaf.

Prominent among these stately combatants was an anomalous figure with a brain as shallow and futile as St. John's was active and brilliant, but by the nature of things as formidable as Bolingbroke was impotent, Frederick Prince of Wales. For Frederick was soon to add to the second position in the country the leadership of the Opposition. The King's health was supposed to be precarious, though he lived cheerfully and not ingloriously for another <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century. And the Heir Apparent, feeling conscious of his advantages, and determined to assert himself, became the complacent puppet of all the factions opposed to his father's Government. His Court, indeed, resembled that famous cave to which were gathered every one that was discontented and every one that was in distress. All who had been spurned or ousted by Walpole, all who were under the displeasure of the King, all who saw little prospect of advancement under the...", "...heathen are surging round us again, and will kill us. Is this the reward of victory for our striving and our long wrestling?\" The rest joined in the lamentation of the Saite, but Paulus stepped into their midst, blamed them for their cowardice, and with warm and urgent speech implored them to return to their posts so that the wall might be guarded at least on the eastern and more accessible side, and that the castle might not fall an easy prey into the hands of an enemy from whom no <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was to be expected. Some of the anchorites were already proceeding to obey the Alexandrian's injunction, when a fearful cry, the war-cry of the Blemmyes who were in pursuit of the Pharanites, rose from the foot of their rock of refuge.

It is sent to a much greater extent than beef, in consequence of its arriving in finer condition, being more easily carried, and better worth the cost of conveyance on account of the larger proportion of prime joints.

Accordingly, most of the beef \"pitched\" here consists of sirloins and ribs; and, in addition to whole carcases of sheep, there are numerous separate legs and saddles of mutton. This accounts for a fact that has puzzled many, namely, how London manages to get such myriads of chops.

The country generally was more open, with grassy box-flats; melaleuca scrubs less frequent.

Water-vapour, then, is a very important factor in the physics of the atmosphere, but it can only be considered briefly here. =Moisture of the Atmosphere.=--The air is constantly absorbing moisture from the water on the earth, but the tension of this aqueous vapour decreases with elevation much faster than does the atmospheric pressure. At the height of about a mile and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> half the quantity of water-vapour is below, while we must rise about three and a half miles to reduce the quantity of air one-half, as may be seen in Plate I. The relative humidity, or the percentage of moisture in the air, as compared to the amount which it could contain at that temperature, is nearly the reverse at low and at high levels. It is found from the kite-observations at Blue Hill, that up to the height of a mile or two the air is drier during winter and at night,...", "...he said fiercely. \"No, that I don't,\" I said, pretending to be horribly frightened. \"Because, just you look here--\" \"Ahoy--oy!\" \"Ahoy--oy! Ahoy--oy!\" I shouted back in answer to the faint cry that came from below, where we could see Bigley waving his hat. It was easier work for us to go down the precipitous slope than for him to climb up; but he did not seem to study that for he came eagerly towards us, while we slipped and scrambled down, ignoring the path, which was a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away. Bob did not speak as we were scrambling down, and the exertion made him forget his ill-temper, so that he was a little more amiable when we came within speaking distance of Bigley. \"Going to the drill?\" he shouted; and then without waiting for an answer, \"So am I. Has your father come back, Sep?\" \"Come back!\" I said. \"What do you mean? He came on here.\" \"Yes,\" said Bigley; \"and then he got our boat and went off in her--so Mother Bonnet said. I was...", "...stood face to face with an entirely altered aspect of the military situation. In Versailles the appropriate dispositions and arrangements were promptly made, and steps taken for the formation of a new Army of the South. There was available for this purpose the IInd Corps at Montargis, and half of the VIIth under General von Zastrow at Auxerre, which during this period of uncertainty had been constantly moving to and fro between the Saone and Yonne, according as the one or the other <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> appeared to be threatened. The chief command of these two Corps, to which was afterwards added that of the XIVth, was entrusted to General von Manteuffel. General von Werder could not be immediately reinforced, and for a time the XIVth Corps was thrown upon its own resources. Notwithstanding their superiority of strength, the French did more manoeuvring than fighting. General Bourbaki aimed at outflanking the left wing of the XIVth Corps, and thus entirely cutting it off...", "...a bright lookout kept for the Sweepstakes.\" Scarcely had this order been issued, when one of the lookouts, who had learned the particulars of the fight from the boat's crew, came aft to report that a schooner, which looked very much like the Sweepstakes, was standing across the bay toward the head of the island. The officer of the deck went forward to examine the vessel through his glass, and came back to Harry with the information that the pirate was in plain sight. During the next <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour the first lieutenant stood on the forecastle, watching the movements of the schooner, and turning over in his mind various plans for her capture. When he saw her stop to pick up the yawl and the burglars, he called his crew to quarters, and made every preparation for boarding her. \"If Tom knows any thing,\" said he to Jackson, \"he will come back and go down on this side of the island; and if he tries that, we may be able to cut him off.\" \"But he's not going to try...", "...them.

I dare not tarry by the way. But I no longer feel quite alone and unprotected.

For the present you must be satisfied so, and there is nothing more to be said.\" \"I shall see you again, I trust,\" I pleaded, as she rose to leave me. \"If you wish, by all means.

The latest word of advanced science has thus landed us back to the apostolic assertion that man is composed of body, soul and spirit; and there are some who see in the scientific doctrine of the Unconscious Personality a welcome confirmation from an unexpected <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the existence of the soul. The fairy tales of science are innumerable, and, like the fairy tales of old romance, they are not lacking in the grim, the tragic, and even the horrible.

For example, in the Arkansas River Valley, California, where it was suspected that water was flowing underground, a trench was dug transversely across the valley, and at a depth of six feet sufficient water was found to amount to 200,000 gallons per day for each one hundred feet of trench. On the South Platte River, near Denver, much the same thing has been done, and in a trench eighteen feet deep, water is collected at the rate of a million and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> gallons per day for each one hundred feet of trench. Other examples of the same sort might be given. For a single house, the spring need usually only be extended by means of a short trench, and three-inch terra-cotta tile should be laid in the trench and surrounded by gravel and then covered over. The spring receiving water from these tiles should be inclosed, as will be described in a later chapter. _Supply from brooks._ Whenever a spring is not available and at the...", "...and one of the gins, to whom I gave a red woollen neck comforter, wanted to get up behind one of my companions, and although her advances were rejected she followed us until Jemmy, the trooper, made signs to her to return to camp.

Plutarch and Arrian, the two most eminent authors of the age, both spent much of their time there; and the Emperor Hadrian, by his repeated and protracted visits--he once lived at Athens for three years together--established the reputation of the city as a fashionable resort, and superintended the building of an entirely new <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to accommodate the great influx of permanent residents. The accident of imperial patronage doubtless added force to the other causes which made Greek take fresh growth, and become for a time almost the dominant language of the Empire.

In the morning the valley was filled with a thick mist, and the hills were visible on either side above it; upon their ridges was no sign of the enemy, and from the white vapour which hid the valley, not a sound issued. Had the enemy withdrawn? Was it a false alarm? From the camp the course of the river was scarcely distinguishable beneath the thick cloud of mist which covered it. Towards the end of the first <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the day Sigild sent out a detachment of a hundred men, with orders to explore the bridge and the banks of the river and rivulet. If no enemy appeared they were to follow the course of the latter and to reconnoitre towards the north; they were to avoid engaging with the enemy. Ten men were to remain upon the bridge to collect brushwood, and set fire to it the moment they saw the enemy in the valley.

The spinster and the ladies who were alone--Madame Lerat, Madame Fauconnier, Mademoiselle Remanjou--discreetly placed their five-franc pieces in it first. Then the gentlemen went to the other end of the room, and made up the accounts. They were fifteen; it amounted therefore to seventy-five francs. When the seventy-five francs were in the plate, each man added five sous for the waiters.

But when Monsieur Madinier, who wished to deal direct with the landlord, had got him to step up, the whole party became lost in astonishment on hearing him say with a smile that there was still something due to him.

In less time than one might have supposed from the condition of poor Vaucher, he had elicited some outstanding facts--the note which Truda had sent to the Jewish <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> among them.

Now, tell mother what has become of Hannah Maria.\" But it was of no use. Finally, Mrs. Lamb tucked the clothes over Mehitable with a jerk, and went down-stairs herself. They were having a consultation there in the sitting-room. It was decided that Mr. Green should drive to Mr. Pitkin's, about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away, and see if they knew anything of Hannah Maria, and get Mr. Pitkin to aid in the search. \"I wouldn't go over to Timothy's to-night, if I were you,\" said Mrs. Green. \"Jenny's dreadful nervous, and it would use her all up; she thought so much of Hannah Maria.\" Mrs. Green's voice broke with a sob. \"No, I'm not going there,\" returned Mr. Green. \"It isn't any use.

On a brilliant summer morning in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the seventeenth century a small troop of horsemen crossed the ford of the river Cairn, in Dumfriesshire, not far from the spot where stands the little church of Irongray, and, gaining the road on the western bank of the stream, wended their way towards the moors and uplands which lie in the neighbourhood of Skeoch Hill. The dragoons, for such they were, trotted rapidly along the road that led into the solitudes of the hills, with all the careless dash of men whose...", "...Kshatrya pedigrees, Kanishka, having himself no claim to caste, may well have preferred for reasons of state to favour Buddhism as a creed fundamentally opposed to caste distinctions. Whatever the motives of his conversion, we have it on the authority of Hiuen-Tsang that he ultimately did great things for Buddhism, and the magnificent _stupa_, which he erected outside his capital, five-and-twenty stories high and crowned with a cupola of diamonds, was still 150 feet high and measured a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile in circumference when the Chinese pilgrim visited Purushpura five centuries later. To the present day there are traces outside the northern gate of Peshawar of a great Buddhist monastery, also built by Kanishka, which remained a seat of Buddhist learning until it was destroyed by Mahomedan invaders; and it was only a mile from Peshawar that the American Sanskritist, Dr. Spooner, discovered ten years ago the casket containing some of Buddha's bones, which is one of the...", "...rolling between unpeopled shores and straight over the spot where I used to see a good big self-complacent town twenty years ago.

The bulk of the inhabitants live closely packed between the Corso and the Tiber, some in fine palaces, splendid indeed, yet with little comfort, the rest in small and miserable dwellings. These latter, at least, will doubtless disappear in time as the population gradually become aware of the expediency of rebuilding this <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city, some parts of which offer striking contrasts of gorgeous splendour and squalid misery.

The red spot completes a rotation in a little less than nine hours and fifty-six minutes, but its period can not be positively given for the singular reason that it is variable.

Certain spots move faster than others, so that if we would obtain a fair value for the rotation period of any current it is not...", "...have none of the ten thousand rivaled the first, the original Chautauqua?

All the assemblies which were established with the highest promise have either been abandoned or are continued as chain Chautauquas, meeting for a week only.

Actaeon, turning his gaze toward the enclosed <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the Acropolis, noticed the temple of Hercules; near it the portico on which the Senate gathered; the mint where money was coined; the temple where the treasure of the Republic was stored; the arsenal where the citizens were armed; the barracks of the mercenaries; and, dominating all these buildings, the tower of Hercules, an enormous cyclopean structure which at night answered with its lights to the _speculae_ on the shore and on the hills around the port, spreading alarm or...", "...expense of which was estimated at $1,850,000; and that the balance of the loan, which was taken at 90, was to be turned over to the city for general purposes.

But mum!\" Soon after these words were written, his life, a life which might have been eminently useful and happy, ended in the same gloom in which, during more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, it had been passed.

The other colony endured dangers and greater hardships.

This stood on a bench of the moraine at an altitude about fifty feet greater than that of the beaver pond. Aspens from the grove were dragged about two hundred feet, then floated across a small water-hole, and from this taken up the steep slope of a ridge, then down to a point about one hundred feet from the pond.

On the complete circle of the compass there are thirty-two lines drawn from the centre to the circumference to indicate the direction of the wind. Each <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the circle, or 90 deg., contains eight lines representing the points of the compass in that quarter. They are named with reference to the cardinal points from which they begin, as: 1, north, 2, north by east, 3, north-northeast; 4, northeast by north; 5, northeast; 6, northeast by east; 7, east- northeast; 8, east by north.

Her dying legacy to me was her hatred of you, and I will pay the old debt with double interest, my noble, haughty, titled father!\" She turned with the last words and sped away like an evil spirit, vanishing in the gloom among the graves. CHAPTER VI. TWO DYING BEQUESTS. This midsummer night was sultry and still. The darkness was like the darkness of Egypt, lighted every now and then by a vivid Hash of lightning, from what <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the heavens no man knew. The inky sky was invisible--no breath of air stirred the terrible calm. The midsummer night was full of dark and deadly menace. Hours ago a fierce and wrathful sunset had burned itself out on a brassy sky. The sun, a lurid ball of fire, had sunk in billows of blood-red cloud, and pitch blackness had fallen upon earth and sky and sea. Everything above and below breathed of speedy tempest, but the midnight was drawing near, and the storm had not...", "...seen Jesus at once, and we do not think that any one who seriously considers the Age, and the circumstances under which the phenomenon is alleged to have occurred, can doubt that such belief could very easily have resulted from merely subjective impressions. Before going further into the discussion of the matter, however, we must again, with a little more minuteness, call attention to the date of the actual statements upon which the whole argument turns. The Apostle Paul writes about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century after the time when it is said that Jesus \"was seen\" by those whom he names. Whatever opinion may be formed as to the amount of information obtained by Paul during the visit he paid to Jerusalem for the purpose of making the acquaintance of Peter, it is undeniable that some years had elapsed between the time when Jesus is supposed to have been seen and the time when Paul could have received information regarding these appearances from any of the Apostles. If we...", "...replied; \"I have just been saying to myself, how like your dear father you are growing--in goodness and kindness of face, I mean. But when you look like that, the resemblance is quite lost. I should never have thought you capable of such a ferocious aspect.\" \"Ah, that is because you don't know what I can do.\" But as she spoke, her arched brows were relaxing, and her flashing eyes filled with their usual soft gleam. \"You forget that I am half a Spaniard still, or at any rate a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> one, and therefore I can be very terrible sometimes. Ah, you should have seen me the other day. I let somebody know who I am. He thought perhaps that butter wouldn't melt in my mouth. Did not I astonish him, the impertinent low wretch?\" \"Why, Nicie, this is not at all like you! I always quote you as a model of sweet temper. Who can have aroused your angry passions thus?\" \"Oh, never mind. I should like to tell you, and I want to tell you very much. But I am not permitted,...", "...-28 deg.]. After the first two hours it increased to force 4, S.S.W., and filling the sail we sped along merrily, doing 83/4 miles before lunch. In the afternoon it was even stronger, and I had to go back on the sledge and act as guide and brakesman. We had to lower the sail a bit, but even then she ran like a bird. \"We are picking up our old cairns famously. Evans got his nose frost-bitten, not an unusual thing with him, but as we were all getting pretty cold latterly we stopped at a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to seven, having done 161/2 miles.

As the Delaware was aware that the hour was near when he ought to repair to the rendezvous, he no longer thought of trophies torn from his foes, and one of the first things arranged between him and his associate was to permit the two others to sleep on, lest they should disturb the execution of their plans by substituting some of their own. The ark moved slowly, and it would have taken fully a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour to reach the point, at the rate at which they were going, thus affording time for a little forethought. The Indians, in the wish to conceal their fire from those who were thought to be still in the castle, had placed it so near the southern side of the point as to render it extremely difficult to shut it in by the bushes, though Deerslayer varied the direction of the scow both to the right and to the left, in the hope of being able to effect that object. \"There's...", "...how quick buffalo an' deer an' antelope learn about these things.\" They slept the night through on the open prairie, keeping watch by turns. The weather was cold, but they had their good blankets with them and they took no discomfort. They rode forward again early in the morning, and about noon struck an old but broad trail. It was evident that many men and many wagons had passed here.

Even Tim Fid, when the firing began, was not altogether as steady as usual; but though he bobbed and sprang about with the feeling that he was dodging the shot, which he could not do in reality, it was much in the same way that he would have dodged a big play fellow whom he did not wish to touch him; and as he never for a moment was found wanting at his post, no one complained. The action began at a quarter-past six that bright summer morning, and for about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour the two frigates ran along parallel to each other, exchanging broadsides with the greatest rapidity of which their respective crews were capable. They were keeping all the time directly before the wind, and within hailing distance of each other. In that short period great had been the carnage on both sides. One of the English lieutenants and two midshipmen, besides a dozen men or more, had been killed, and half as many again had been wounded; while the bulwarks of...", "...in short, this summer all was gaiety at the Black Islands. Miss O'Faley was said to be a great acquisition in the neighbourhood: she was so gay, so sociable, so communicative; and she certainly, above all, knew so much of the world; she was continually receiving letters, and news, and patterns, from Dublin, and the Black Rock, and Paris. Each of which places, and all standing nearly upon the same level, made a great figure in her conversation, and in the imagination of the half or <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> gentry, with whom she consorted in this remote place. Every thing is great or small by comparison, and she was a great person in this little world. It had been the report of the country, that her niece was promised to the eldest son of Mr. Connal of Glynn; but the aunt seemed so averse to the match, and expressed this so openly, that some people began to think it would be broken off; others, who knew Cornelius O'Shane's steadiness to his _word of honour_, were convinced that...", "...whose names he had not yet registered, and therefore, inquired of what country they were, and what way of living they had.

At dawn he found them easily close at hand, and though they ran at first they did not go far before they dropped into a walk. The battle seemed nearly won now, for the chief difficulty in the 'walk-down' is to keep track of the herd the first two or three days when they are fresh. All that morning Jo kept in sight, generally in close sight, of the band. About ten o'clock, Charley relieved him near Jos. Peak and that day the mustangs walked only a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile ahead with much less spirit than the day before and circled now more north again. At night Charley was supplied with a fresh horse and followed as before. Next day the mustangs walked with heads held low, and in spite of the efforts of the Black Pacer at times they were less than a hundred yards ahead of their pursuer. The fourth and fifth days passed the same way, and now the herd was nearly back to Antelope Springs. So far all had come out as expected. The...", "...in the carriage, and half an hour's drive took us down the street, across the long bridge to the other side of the river, and to the Willow Cottage. There is, as I have noticed always, a remarkable fitness in the names given to country houses. This was certainly the case with the present one. There was not a willow near the place. A few yards from the end of the bridge, and to the right hand of the highway, a disused, grass-grown road led through a close thicket of evergreens, some <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile on to an open level area, of about a hundred acres of exhausted land, grown up in broom sedge and completely surrounded by the pine forest. In the midst of this area stood a red stone cottage, consisting of a central building of two stories, flanked each side by wings of one story in height. The central building was finished by a gable roof front, with a large single fan-shaped window just above the front portico.

In its nature, and in the mode of its invasion, it very much resembles the dreaded fire-blight of the pear, with which most orchardists have unfortunately become already but too familiar. Like it too, all the guesses which Solons have offered for the explanation of its cause, appear equally unsatisfactory. A whole branch or limb of the tree becomes simultaneously affected; sometimes one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> or even one half of the top is destroyed by the disease, and the removal of the dead portions is not followed by the reproduction of healthy branches. Certain varieties are more subject to this blight than others, and they seem to poison the grafts that are inserted into them, to produce a new top to the tree with a more healthy variety.

Here his view was inconvenienced by trees, and it was with a start that he discovered the Zeppelin, which he knew had still a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of her magazines to fill, was rising over Goat Island. She had not waited for her complement of ammunition. It occurred to him that he was left behind. He ducked back among the trees and bushes until he felt secure from any after-thought on the part of the Zeppelin's captain. Then his curiosity to see what the German air-fleet faced overcame him, and drew him at last halfway across the bridge to Goat Island. From that point he had nearly a hemisphere of sky and got his first...", "...\"what art thou good for?

It presently occurred to me that it was in vain to pretend to make a raft with the wind off shore, and that it was my business to be gone before the tide of flood began, otherwise I might not be able to reach the shore at all. Accordingly I let myself down into the water, and swam across the channel, which lay between the ship and the sands, and even that with difficulty enough, partly with the weight of the things I had about me,...", "...as it was impossible to see a yard ahead, and a bear might spring upon you before you knew that it was near. As I had a double-barrelled powerful rifle, I of course went first, followed by Bob close behind. As noiselessly as possible, we pushed through the elastic branches, and very slowly followed the track, which was now more difficult to distinguish, owing to the close proximity of the young trees that overshadowed the surface of the ground. In this manner we had advanced about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, when a sudden rush was made exactly in my front, the young trees were roughly shaken, and I jumped forward immediately, to meet or to follow the animal, before I could determine what it really was. Something between a short roar and a grunt proclaimed it to be a bear, and I pushed on as fast as I could through the opposing branches; I could neither see nor hear anything.

Danton would be gone!\" In short, he should not hear the Jacobin lion roar, nor have the reward on which he reckoned for flinging me into his jaws. The postilion was again ordered to move, and the...", "...zink. He zink all the time now. He zink of those many insult'! Some day he will have his revengement--you see.\" About this time the manager of the White Star noticed a falling off in the number of applicants for his peculiar variety of \"job.\" There was a slump in the Andre Francois market. One morning he called in a youngster whom he saw going early to school, stated his terms, and made his usual proposal. The boy hesitated a few moments, then said: \"It'll cost yer a dollar an' a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> now, Mr. Biron. Yer see, 'taint so easy as 'twas at first. 'Course Andray Franswa never runs, an' it's easy t' git him, but he's growin' awful savage. He kicks an' bites somethin' fierce, sir. He nearly chewed Harry Peters' finger offer him day 'fore yesterday.\" The manager paid the extra quarter without any demur. It was about this time also that Mr. Biron made a discovery which gratified him. He found, secreted under a pillow in the window-seat where Andre Francois...", "...indignantly at his temples. The farmer threw one leg back over the fence. \"There'll be hell to pay when the day comes,\" he said, and he strode away, while the mountaineer leaned motionless on the fence with his grip on the knife unrelaxed. Noiselessly the boy made his way through the edge of the woods, out under the brow of a hill, and went on his restless way up the bank of the creek toward Steve's home. When he turned toward the turnpike he found that he had passed the house a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, so he wheeled back down the creek, and where the mouth of the lane opened from the road he dropped in a spot of sunlight on the crest of a little cliff, his legs weary but his brain still tirelessly at work. These people of the Blue-grass were not only robbing him and his people of their lands, but of their political birthright as well. The fact that the farmer was on his side but helped make the boy know it was truth, and the resentments that were always burning...", "...de la Fayette, who died in 1834, having survived his wife twenty-seven years.

This spot was hallowed to them by sacred memories, for there reposed above thirteen hundred victims of the revolution. Its continued existence as a cemetery was due to the pious labors of Madame d'Ayen's daughters. In the days of terror, a pit had been dug outside the Barriere du Trone, and all the persons immolated in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of Paris were promiscuously thrown into it. The savage mode of proceeding has been related. As each head fell from the guillotine, it was cast, together with the body, still dressed, into a large barrel painted red. Each night after the executions were over, these barrels were taken to Picpus, and their contents indiscriminately emptied into the pit. The ground had formerly belonged to an Augustinian convent. There, it could not be doubted, lay the remains of Madame d'Ayen and...", "...instead of warm. _Bittany Wine._ Take six gallons of water and twelve pounds of sugar; put your sugar and water together.

This bird, widely spread over the continent of Australia, inhabits the interior in great numbers, wherever there are trees large enough for it to build in. Their young were just fledged when the Expedition descended into the western interior, and at sunset came out on the branches of the gum-trees, where they sat for several hours to be fed, making a most discordant noise every time the old birds came with a fresh supply of food, which was about every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour. It was frequently impossible to sleep from the constant screeching of the young owls. Their food is principally mice, bats, and large moths. 14. ATHENE BOOBOOK.--Boobook Owl.

'What are you doing?' he asked abruptly, at the same time turning his back upon the clerk. Hood explained that he was under the necessity of searching through the accounts for several years, to throw light upon a certain transaction which was giving trouble. 'All right,' was the reply, as Dagworthy took his keys out to open his desk. A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later, he entered the room where Hood was busy over the ledger. A second clerk was seated there, and him Dagworthy summoned to the office, where he had need of him. Presently Hood came to replace the ledger he had examined, and took away the succeeding volume. A few minutes later Dagworthy said to the clerk who sat with him-- 'I shall have to go away for an hour or so. I'm expecting a telegram from Legge Brothers; if it doesn't come before twelve o'clock, you or...", "...I must give you a bad mark for want of punctuality, Go at once into the schoolroom.\" To hear these incisive, sharp tones in the midst of her own delightful reflections was anything but agreeable to Pauline. She felt, as she expressed it, like a cat rubbed the wrong way. She gave Miss Tredgold one of her most ungracious scowls and went slowly into the house. There she lingered purposely before she condescended to tidy her hair and put on her house-shoes. In consequence she was quite a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour late when she appeared in the schoolroom. Miss Tredgold had just finished morning prayers. \"You have missed prayers this morning, Pauline,\" she said. \"There was no reason for this inattention. I shall be obliged to punish you.

The other members of the team had a word of encouragement for him, but it was impossible for them to hide completely their belief that a disaster had come upon the eleven. Teeny-bits was a good substitute, they all acknowledged, but as a regular against such a team as Jefferson, well, he was too light in spite of his quickness and grit. After a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour of practice, Coach Murray sent Teeny-bits back to the side lines and called Tracey Campbell out. A few minutes later he recalled Teeny-bits and put the team through a long signal drill in which the new plays that he had been developing were practiced again and again. Those two maneuvers on the part of the coach indicated plainly enough that he had chosen Teeny-bits as regular left half-back in the place of White and that he had selected Tracey Campbell as first...", "...of solitary rambles. \"After supper I felt more restless than ever. Mr. Birchmore brought out his invariable cigars, expecting me to join him in a smoke; but I was not in the mood for it, neither did I feel at ease in his company until things should have begun to look a little more comprehensible. I left him, therefore, and wandered aimlessly about outside the house, exploring the farmyard and buildings, and then coming round to the road, and pacing up and down on a beat about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile in length. It was a clear moonlight night, and so warm as to be almost oppressive. At length I returned to the house, it being then after nine o'clock. Mr. Birchmore had apparently retired; Christina was nowhere to be seen; so I got a lamp from my surly landlord, and found my way without much difficulty to my own chamber. \"The warmth within doors was still more oppressive than outside.

When a song is taught, the words are the chief and most important part, the musical rendering of a second person may be so different from that of the person from whom he learns it as to be unrecognizable without the words. Another fact which often presents itself is the absence of time and measure, which prevents any reduction to notation by full bars; e.g., one or two bars may appear to consist of four <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> notes or a sufficient number of quarters and eighths to complete such bars, but the succeeding one may consist of an additional quarter, or perhaps two, thus destroying all semblance of rythmic continuity. This peculiarity is not so common in dancing music, in which the instruments of percussion are employed to assist regularity and to accord with the steps made by the dancers, or vice versa. In some of the songs presented in this paper the bars have been omitted for the...", "...for us three hundred years ago when he was past ninety, and toothless--and angry \"because the historians didn't get it straight.\" The student of Spanish America has often to wish there had been a Bernal Diaz for every decade and every province from 1492 to 1800.

It must be said that Don Melchor had a blind affection, almost adoration, for his nephew's betrothed--the girl was sacred to him. From the time that he knew Gonzalo's affections were set in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> he inspected her as carefully as if he were examining the hulk of a ship before masting her. He had considered her kind, quiet, intelligent, and capable, and his delight at the marriage was only embittered by hearing that the engaged couple were not going to live with him. He seldom visited Belinchon's house, but when he met the girl in the street he made a point of stopping her and treating her with exceptional courtesy and attention. \"You do not love her?\" he repeated....", "...a moment of tense expectancy and then the official waved his arm in a direction that brought forth a vast yell of joy from the Ridgley stands. Jefferson had been held; that leather oval had failed by inches to cross the last thin smear of white. The next event in this struggle between the red and the purple was a kick from behind the goal line by Neil Durant,--the longest punt that had ever been seen on the Ridgley field. It flew for sixty yards, went over the head of the Jefferson <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and rolled down the field end over end. The purple player finally overtook it and attempted to recover the lost ground, but Ned Stillson checked his career and Jefferson lined up on her own thirty-yard line. She bravely attempted to repeat her heartbreaking advance and gained a first down; but the Ridgley team suddenly became an impenetrable barrier.

A wonderful and fearsome sight it was to Larry: like something seen in a nightmare--a fantastic desert waste of rocks and dunes, with here and there a yawning chasm whose ominous depths their ray failed to penetrate, and now and then a jutting plateau that would appear on the forward square and cause Captain Petersen to elevate their bow sharply.

Henry had ordered a small Bearnais horse to be made ready for him; that is, to be saddled and bridled at eight o'clock in the morning. He had intended giving this horse to Madame de Sauve, but he wanted to try it first. At a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> before eight the horse was ready. On the stroke of eight Henry came down to the court-yard. The horse, proud and fiery in spite of its small size, pricked up its ears and pawed the ground. The weather was cold and a light frost covered the pavement. Henry started to cross the court-yard to the stables where the horse and the groom were waiting, when a Swiss soldier whom he passed standing sentinel at the gate presented arms and said: \"God keep his Majesty the King of...", "...there was just wind enough for the purpose I wanted, without any apprehensions of this being increased. I got up the awning, and spread the sail, and handing Mrs Reichardt to her appointed seat, we bid farewell to our four-footed and two-footed friends ashore, that were gazing at us as if they knew they were parting from their only protectors.

I let her proceed in this way about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of mile from the island, and then tacked; the boat, obedient to the position of the sail, altered her course, and we proceeded at about the same rate, for a considerable distance.

Every command in Bragg's army, with the exception of his reserve, had felt the impulse of the great maneuver, had taken a place therein, in regular order, and, at first glance, it would have seemed with complete success. For the entire Union army, with the exception of a small part of the left wing, had been forced from position.

Then, taking Betty by the shoulder, he asked quietly: \"What happened to HIM?\" Betty could not answer, but the maid said: \"The horse killed him at that linhay, sir, down in 'the wild.' And the mistress was unconscious till <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour ago.\" \"Which way did she go?\" \"Out here, sir; the door and the gate was open--can't tell which way.\" Through Winton flashed one dreadful thought: The river! \"Turn the cab round!

In which case he might find it rather hard to explain what he was doing in the middle of the grounds with a couple of ferrets in his possession when the hands of the clock pointed to twenty minutes to eleven. But the odds were against his being seen. He risked it. When the bell rang for the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to eleven interval the ferrets were in their new home, happily discussing a piece of meat--Renford's contribution, held over from the morning's meal,--and O'Hara, looking as if he had never left the passage for an instant, was making his way through the departing mathematical class to apologise handsomely to Mr Banks--as was his invariable custom--for his disgraceful behaviour during the morning's lesson.

Beholding this miracle of female loveliness through the window-panes, he took it into his head to read the newspapers in the beauty's reading-room; and a sometime custom-house officer, named Denisart, with a ribbon in his button-hole, followed the example. Croizeau chose to look upon Denisart as a rival.

The bear at once pulled up, smelt it all round, tossed it into the air with his snout, pawed it once or twice, then tore it to pieces with one wrench, and continued the chase. Very little time was lost in this operation. He was soon up with the man again; then a mitten was thrown down for his inspection. After that the other mitten went, the cravat followed, and the axe went next. All that I have just related happened in a very few minutes. Davy was still a good <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile from the brig; everything that he could tear off his person in haste and throw down was gone, and the bear was once more coming up behind. As a last hope he pulled off his heavy fur-coat and dropped it. This seemed to be a subject of great interest to the bear, for it was longer in inspecting it than the other things. And now poor Butts went tearing along like a maniac, in his flannel shirt and trousers. He was a miserable and curious object, for his body, besides...", "...boats were now side by side, and they continued in this relative position until they were within half a mile of the stake boat. The race had become intensely exciting, and again the two cliques on shore were breathless and silent with interest. Neither party had any thing to indicate the success of its favorite. Even yet Richard had not put his crew to their utmost. But the decisive moment had arrived, and his body began to sway backward and forward with increasing rapidity, and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile more gave him half a boat-length's advantage over his rival. \"Steady, fellows; keep cool,\" said he, in a loud whisper. \"Don't miss a stroke, and make every one tell all it will.

The boats were within an eighth of a mile of the end of the course, and the murmuring applause of the Grant party on shore began to reach the ears of the...", "...\"They want you,\" she said to Julian, \"to take off your uniform and to put on clothes like theirs.

You won't mind that, will you?\" \"Not at all, Stephanie; I think that it is a very good plan indeed.\" A <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later Julian was equipped in the attire of a well-to-do peasant, with caftan lined with sheep-skin, a round fur cap, a thick pair of trousers of a dark rough cloth, bandages of the same material round the leg from the knee to the ankle, and high loose boots of untanned leather with the hair inside.

One man after another of the detachment was shot, but the gun still continued in action, though five bodies lay around it. When the sixth man took the place of his fallen comrades, of whom one was his brother, the Germans were still pressing on. He waited until they were only a few yards away, and then poured a stream of bullets on to the advancing ranks, which broke and fell back, leaving...", "...Toots is coming to-night, and she wouldn't for the world lose her elegant _coiffure_ and the chance of looking pretty in his eyes.\" Before she had finished speaking her eyes were fastened on the book again, and whatever Tilly replied about not wishing to receive a solitaire as gift from her father fell unheeded, apparently, on the fair Fanny's ears. It was a mistake about Lola's having gone to the matinee. If we follow her we shall see her ascending one of the streets in the same <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city in which the paternal mansion--as the novel-writers have it--stood, though in a far less fashionable part. Indeed, there was no fashion about; for a corner-grocery, or a retail fruit-shop occasionally made its appearance among the ranks of the generally neat houses, each of which was provided with a flower-covered veranda, or a trim front yard. One of them boasted of a garden and veranda both--the former set out with well-tended flowers, the latter almost hidden...", "...Benito's brief interval of absence.\" \"We will grant that so it may be, Reverend Father, but what proof have we that the murder had not been just committed when the body and the assassin were discovered?\" Father Francis replied, by commanding the appearance of Don Ferdinand's steward, and after the customary formula, inquired what hour his late lamented master had quitted his mansion the night of the murder. The man replied, without hesitation, \"Exactly as the chimes played the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> before nine.\" \"But was not that unusually early?

Our chief cause for fear was, that some of them might dismount, when they would be much more formidable at close quarters. They did not, however, seem inclined to attempt such a proceeding. Now with loud shrieks they advanced, and then wheeling round, off they went as if in fall flight, but in another moment they were again advancing towards us with threatening gestures. I thought they would turn, but no; on they came from each <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the compass, shouting, shrieking, and flourishing their spears. The next instant a flight of arrows came flying among us, compelling us to sink down under our barricade to avoid them. This was no easy matter. One grazed my shoulder, and another went through Peter's hat, and for a moment I thought he was wounded. \"Fire, lads!\" I shouted, \"steady as before.\" I, with two of the men, sprang into the waggon to receive our enemies, and as they approached, we fired in quick...", "...specialists, his folio dictionary, the greatest lexicographical work yet undertaken in English, into which he also introduced diagrams and proverbs.

Every thing that was on deck was cut loose and cast into the sea. The faces of the crew became paler than usual. Wild Cat was on deck, an attentive observer of the increasing consternation of the white men, when suddenly he accosted the officer in these words: \"Be not afraid. The Great Spirit will not suffer me to die with the pale faces in the manner you now apprehend. Tell me from what <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> you wish the wind to blow, in order that the big water may become quiet and the fire-canoe paddle on.\" The officer, although attaching little importance to what the chief said, complied with his request to keep him quiet. He was taken to the binnacle and shown the compass, by which means he was made to understand from what quarter the wind must blow in order to produce a calmer sea. Thereupon, Wild Cat commenced making signs in the air, and other demonstrations.

Going in her direction I met Joe Archer, one of the Five-Bob jackeroos, and a great chum of mine. He had a taste for literature, and we got on together like one o'clock.

Dr. G. Buist, in a recent communication to the Bombay Geographical Society (vol. ix.), has asked how it happens that the Red Sea should not exceed the open ocean in saltness, by more than 1/10th per cent. The Red Sea receives no supply of water from any <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> save through the Straits of Babelmandeb; and there is not a single river or rivulet flowing into it from a circuit of 4000 miles of shore. The countries around are all excessively sterile and arid, and composed, for the most part, of burning deserts. From the ascertained evaporation in the sea itself, Dr. Buist computes that nearly 8 feet of pure water must be carried off from the whole of its surface annually, this being probably equivalent to 1/100th part of its whole volume....", "...vultures, buzzards, falcons, hawks, kites, owls, as well as crocodiles and serpents!

There would be, at least, three thousand animals feeding upon flesh; and, if we calculate that they averaged two pounds of flesh a day, this would give a total of more than two million and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> pounds of flesh to be stored up and distributed. And since dried, salted, or smoked meat would not answer, this flesh must have been taken into the ark alive. It would be equal to more than thirty thousand sheep at seventy-five pounds each; a great addition to the original cargo, and necessitating an extra quantity of hay for their food, till their turn came to be eaten.

There is, of course, some reduplication, but in these four public service enterprises there are in Massachusetts almost twice as many direct owners as there are employees. Two persons out of three have money in the savings bank--men, women, and children. There is this additional fact: more than one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the stupendous sum of over a billion dollars of the savings of nearly two and a half million savings depositors is invested in railroad, street railway, and telephone securities.

He assured him that if he would surrender, all his property would be respected and that only the weapons would be taken. Negociations were started, and the Bishop went in person to the Burmese leader's hut. He was received with every mark of honour and the general was lavish in promises which however were not confirmed by any documents. He added that it was his intention that night to fire the Christian <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> as a warning to them to seek refuge elsewhere. He assigned a temple to the Bishop for a dwelling place and guards were given for his safe keeping. Nothing could be done but to submit to these conditions as it was impossible to obtain any better terms. It was lucky that these conditions were accepted.

In this I was mistaken. I found them very earnestly opposed to the idea of my starting a paper, and for several reasons. First, the paper was not needed; secondly, it would interfere with my usefulness as a lecturer; thirdly, I was better fitted to speak than to write; fourthly, the paper could not succeed. This opposition, from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> so highly esteemed, and to which I had been accustomed to look for advice and direction, caused me not only to hesitate, but inclined me to abandon the enterprise. All previous attempts to establish such a journal having failed, I felt that probably I should but add another to the list of failures, and thus contribute another proof of the mental and moral deficiencies of my race.

To him it had been a marked day on account of the skating match, but this had turned out a disappointment. He accomplished his errand, which occupied a considerable time, and then set out on his return. It was half-past eight, but the moon had risen and diffused a mild radiance over the landscape. Luke thought he would shorten his homeward way by taking a path through the woods. It was not over a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, but would shorten the distance by as much more. The trees were not close together, so that it was light enough to see. Luke had nearly reached the edge of the wood, when he overtook a tall man, a stranger in the neighborhood, who carried in his hand a tin box. Turning, he eyed Luke sharply. \"Boy, what's your name?\" he asked. \"Luke Larkin,\" our hero answered, in surprise. \"Where do you live?\" \"In the village yonder.\" \"Will you do me a favor?\" \"What is...", "...this morning for Bristol.

This morning I rose a little before five, and attended a prayer meeting from a quarter past five, to a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past six. I spoke for some time at the meeting. Afterwards I prayed and read again with some believers, and likewise expounded the Scriptures. The Bristol coach took me up about ten. I was very faithless on the journey.

Mr. Puffington took it pretty quietly at first, Bragg inundating him with what they did at the Duke of Downeybird's, Lord Reynard's, and the other great places in which he had lived, till he almost made Puff believe that such treatment was a necessary consequence of hound-keeping. Moreover, the cost was heavy, and the promised subscriptions were almost wholly imaginary; even if they had been paid, they would not have covered a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the expense Mr. Bragg ran him to; and worst of all, there was an increasing instead of a diminishing expenditure.

Still farther behind that--a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile distant but built upon a bend of the coast--was the village, overlooking a pretty bay. Cap'n Bill and Trot came often to this tree to sit and watch the ocean below them.

At that time it was considered a terrible blow, and the sparse population thought that many years would elapse before the little city could recover from the wreck which the fire had made. Eleven houses were burned, and a large number of discharged soldiers of the 42nd Regiment were the principal sufferers. About this time a woman and child were burned to death at the Falls, and seven houses in this <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> were destroyed. In April, 1787, the people decided to take active measures for protection against fire, and accordingly the following document was drawn up: We, the subscribers, taking into our serious consideration the alarming situation of the city for want of fire-engines and public wells, should a fire break out in any part of it, and, at the same time, being sensible of the present inability of the city corporation to advance money for the...", "...and soil them. Guards should usually be attached to the backs of plates, and should be wide enough to turn up round the adjoining section, so that they may be sewn through.

This is done by cutting a strip of about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch off the back of the plate, and guarding with a wide guard of linen, leaving a small space between the plate and the piece cut off to form a hinge. It will save some swelling if the plate is pared and a piece of thinner paper substituted for the piece cut off (see fig. 11, C). If the plates are of cardboard, they should be guarded on both sides with linen, and may even need a second joint.

On Scopus, the high mountain north of Jerusalem, the Roman camp was pitched, that last autumn in the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth. A few years further on, if the warriors of the Emperor Tiberius could then have foreseen the future, Titus was to <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> his famous legions on that vantage point; and from its elevation he was to hurl himself as a resistless battering ram against the Holy City. But, on this autumn day, when these chronicles begin, no blare of trumpets was summoning the Roman soldiery to arms; only the feet of the camp sentinels, as they walked their appointed rounds, broke the quiet of the sunlit afternoon.

We rode southward, down the valley of the Eurotas, through orchards of olive and mulberry. We stopt for the night at the little khan of Levetzova. I saw some cows pasturing here, quite a rare sight in Greece, where genuine butter is unknown. That which is made from the milk of sheep and goats is no better than mild tallow. The people informed me, however, that they make cheese from cow's milk, but not during Lent. They are now occupied with rearing Paschal lambs, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million of which are slaughtered in Greece on Easter Day. The next morning, we rode over hills covered with real turf, a little thin, perhaps, but still a rare sight in southern lands. In two hours we entered the territory of Maina, on the crest of a hill, where we saw Marathonisi (the ancient Gythium), lying warm upon the Laconian Gulf. The town is a steep, dirty, labyrinthine place, and so rarely visited by strangers that our appearance created quite a sensation....

The Prussian armies, numbering more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million of men, began to move about the middle of June. Battle followed battle in rapid succession. Almost every encounter proved a victory for the Prussians. On the third of July was fought the great battle of Sadowa, in Bohemia. It was Austria's Waterloo.

After some little time had elapsed, and as our friends were debating what steps they had best take, a fresh surprise was provided for them, as the pair distinctly saw a snow-white pigeon leave the bush in question, describe one or two airy circles round it, and then wing its way directly towards the cliffs across the kloof, beyond which it quickly disappeared. \"A carrier pigeon, by Jove!\" said Kenyon,...", "...at least twelve feet high.

In order to see what kind of money was in circulation in Belgium, I immediately bought some pears of a fruit-woman, and handed her half a franc (10 cents).

Knowing, however, that though the coins had different impressions, the-system was the same as that of French money, I murmered to myself, \"Blessed be the Decimal System,\" and went to some retired <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to count it!

He remained on his elevated perch watching her for fully a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, a period long enough to satisfy him that both ships were standing in the same direction, and then he descended. \"Well; what do you make of her?\" demanded the skipper, as the lad joined him on the poop.

We have much to weigh in the contrary balance: Mrs. Behn's manifest first-hand knowledge of, and extraordinary interest in, colonial life; her reiterated asseverations that every experience detailed in this famous novel is substantially true; the assent of all her contemporaries. It must further be remembered that Aphra was writing in 1688, of a girlhood coloured by and seen through the enchanted mists of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century. That there are slight discrepancies is patent; the exaggerations, however, are not merely pardonable but perfectly natural. One of Dr. Bernbaum's most crushing arguments, when sifted, seems to resolve itself into the fact that whilst writing _Oroonoko_ Mrs. Behn evidently had George Warren's little book, _An Impartial Description of Surinam_ (London, 1667), at hand.

To what extent this is effective, will appear more clearly when we observe that in any balloon inflated, it is the _sides_ of the distended globe that bear out the weight of the appended cargo, through the intervention of the network; a weight only limited by the sustaining power of the machine itself, and in the case of the great Vauxhall or Nassau Balloon, amounting to more than two tons, and consequently pressing with a force far...", "...the back of the house, and took the horse from Pierre, who was holding it; while Henri entered the house with the countess.

Remember that we have millions of acres of land lying idle, and generally from a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to three-quarters of a million of men unemployed. Then consider this position. Here we have a million acres of good land producing nothing, and half a million men also producing nothing.

There can be no doubt but that the act was intended as a measure of severity against heretics, and as such Pius the Ninth considered it indefensible and abolished it. In actual fact it must have been of enormous advantage to the Jews, who were thus provided with a stronghold against the persecutions and robberies of the rabble. The little <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was enclosed by strong walls with gates, and if the Jews were required to be within them at night, on pain of a fine, they and their property were at least in safety.

He declared that every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the moon produced a tempest; that the shores were girt with inhospitable rocks; that the inhabitants were cannibals, and that the only vessels which could live in the waters of the torrid zone were caravels of Portuguese build.

Help 'em up, now.\" Dick allowed himself to be lifted to his feet and supported in a standing position by one of the most powerful-looking of the tramps. Darrin, however, continued to act as if he were almost lifeless. \"Give him the water cure,\" ordered the boss tramp, in an undertone to one of his confederates. Going to the peddler's wagon the one so directed took down a pail. He went off...", "...beneath the flag of freedom, is a trial hard to be endured; but when accompanied with indignities, insults and tortures, such as were inflicted upon the occupants of those prison hells of the South, it becomes simply unbearable. A. COOPER. CHAPTER I. DESCRIPTION OF PLYMOUTH, N. C. Plymouth, in 1863-4, was a small town, situate on the Roanoke river, about six miles from where the waters of that stream enters the Albermarle Sound. The river at Plymouth is nearly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile wide, and with a sufficient depth of water to float the largest draught gunboats. The shore next the town was supplied with a wharf for landing steamers that navigate the river; but the gunboats, of which there were quite a number stationed there, were usually anchored in the middle of the stream. The town was enclosed with earthworks, with the exception of about two hundred yards on the left next the river which was rather low and marshy, and covered with quite a...", "...Hamilton speaks of three clergymen of this description as follows:-- \"They pretended great zeal against the Indulgence; but alas! that was all their practice, otherwise being but very gross, which I shall but hint at in short. When great Cameron and those with him were taking many a cold blast and storm in the fields and among the cot-houses in Scotland, these three had for the most part their residence in Glasgow, where they found good <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and a full table, which I doubt not but some bestowed upon them from real affection to the Lord's cause; and when these three were together, their greatest work was who should make the finest and sharpest roundel, and breathe the quickest jests upon one another, and to tell what valiant acts they were to do, and who could laugh loudest and most heartily among them; and when at any time they came out to the country, whatever other things they...", "...hair, and a flat nose, and was altogether lacking in aristocratic attributes. But Thyrsis answered promptly, \"Yes, dear,\" and continued to watch. And Corydon continued to play. Apparently she knew something about babies--how to amuse them and how to handle them, and had even heard rumors about how to feed them. She was asking questions of the nurse-maid, and displaying interest--Thyrsis would have been no more amazed had he found her in converse with a Chaldean astrologer. For a full <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour she had managed to forget her agonies of spirit, and to play with a baby! They got up to go. \"You like babies, don't you, dearest?\" asked Thyrsis, as they walked. \"Why, yes,\" she said. And then there was a silence, while he pondered. Here, he perceived in a flash, was the great hand of Nature again! Since the first day of their marriage Thyrsis had been haunted by the sense of a dark shadow hanging over them, of a seed of tragedy in their love. He had his...", "...Artemus Ward; and every now and then, after a verbal flourish of this kind, he used to conclude by saying-- \"This is wrote sarcastic.\" So are these remarks concerning Richard Frayne's act, when, agonised by the horror of his position, and rankling mentally at being believed contemptible enough to have obtained the money, monkey-fashion, by using his cousin as catspaw, he had gradually become so out of balance that he was ready for any reckless act. A few words from the proper <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> would have set him right; a kindly bit or two of sympathy from his fellow-students would have helped him; but everyone but the servant held rigidly aloof, and when the dark, blank night-time came, and the long hours of agony culminated in a feeling of utter, hopeless despair, he sat alone there in his room, ready to dash at anything which would, even if temporarily, relieve him from the terrible strain. At last he forced himself into thinking as calmly as he could, setting...", "...we got to the hotel we saw three or four carriages drive up, and as we went in the porter told us the German Crown Princess with her daughters and a large suite was arriving. We stood in the court to see them pass--but the Princess was not there, only her daughters (3). They were tall, fair, very German-looking, each one with a large bouquet. There seemed any number of ladies and gentlemen in attendance, and a great deal of bowing and deferential manners. We went downstairs about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to eight. We had given the Murrays rendezvous in the reading-room, but they came in just as we crossed the court, and we went straight to the dining-room. They told us the Crown Princess only comes to-morrow. They had gone to the station to meet her (they had seen her in Venice), but there were only the young Princesses. We had a pleasant dinner. They are a nice couple (Scotch).

The house by the Ponte Rotto, just referred to, has still another name in folk-lore; it is called the _House of Pilate_. The denomination is not so absurd as it at first seems; it brings us back to bygone times, when passion-plays were performed in Rome in a more effective way than they are now exhibited at Oberammergau. They took place, not on a wooden stage, so suggestive of conventionality, but in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city most wonderfully adapted to represent the Via Dolorosa of Jerusalem, from the houses of Pilate and Caiaphas to the summit of Calvary. The passion-play began at a house, Via della Bocca della Verita, No. 37, which is still called the \"Locanda della Gaiffa,\" a corruption of _Gaifa_, or _Caiaphas_. From this place the procession moved across the street to the \"Casa di Pilato,\" as the house of Crescenzio was called, where the scenes of the Ecce Homo, the...", "...boy, a lad of fourteen, who had gone by the run. Singing out to the mate to lay to, I ran forward, and if ever I forget the expression of the poor bo's'n's face as he wrung his hands and cried, `Oh, save my laddie! Oh, save my laddie!' my name will change to something else than Silas. \"`I'll save him,' cried a voice behind me. Some one rushed past. There was a splash in the water next moment, and I had barely time to see it was Sandy. Before the boat reached the spot they were a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile astern, but they were saved; they found the bo's'n's laddie riding `cockerty-coosie' on Sandy's shoulder, and Sandy spitting out the mouthfuls of salt water, laughing and crying,-- \"`I've won the breeks! I've won the canvas breeks, boys!' \"He had won them, and that right nobly, too. Well, after he had worn them for over a month, it became painfully evident even to Sandy that they sorely needed washing; but, woe is me! Sandy was too lazy to put a hand to them....", "...and Gillam and Mason shot through the hole, the former with head down and a padded shoulder presented to the enemy, and the latter steadying him and hurling him forward. Then two things happened at the same moment; the ball passed from quarter to tackle, and Gillam and the leader of the tandem came together. The shock of that collision was plainly heard on the side-lines. For an instant the tandem stopped short. Then superior weight told, and it moved forward again, reenforced by <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and right end; but simultaneously the Erskine quarter and left half made themselves felt back of Mason and Gillam, and then chaos reigned. The entire forces of each side were in the play, and for nearly half a minute the swaying mass moved inch by inch, first forward, then backward, the Robinson left tackle refusing to believe that their famous play was for once a failure and so clinging desperately to the ball, the center of a veritable maelstrom of panting, struggling...", "...who, however, could not endure the thought of sending for him, knowing how severely his great practice taxed his strength. No especial change occurred during the beginning of April, but on Saturday 15th he was seized with giddiness while sitting at dinner in the evening, and fainted in an attempt to reach his sofa. On the 17th he was again better, and in my temporary absence recorded for me the progress of an experiment in which I was engaged. During the night of April 18th, about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to twelve, he had a severe attack and passed into a faint, from which he was brought back to consciousness with great difficulty. He seemed to recognise the approach of death, and said, \"I am not the least afraid to die.\" All the next morning he suffered from terrible nausea and faintness, and hardly rallied before the end came. He died at about four o'clock on Wednesday, April 19th, 1882, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.

Priessnitz said the mother would have done as well, if she had given him a long sitz-bath. _Catarrh and Fever._--Child restless all night.

Camp was pitched beside the ranch buildings. In the trees near the tents grew wonderful violet orchids. Many birds were around us; I saw some of them, and Cherrie and Miller many, many more. They ranged from party-colored macaws, green parrots, and big gregarious cuckoos down to a brilliant green-and-chestnut kingfisher, five and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> inches long, and a tiny orange-and- green manakin, smaller than any bird I have ever seen except a hummer. We also saw a bird that really was protectively colored; a kind of whippoorwill which even the sharp-eyed naturalists could only make out because it moved its head. We saw orange-bellied squirrels with showy orange tails. Lizards were common. We killed our first poisonous snake (the second we had seen), an evil lance-headed jararaca that was swimming the river. We also saw...", "...that machinery was returned to the Shoe Machinery Co.

The reduction in output of women's shoes amounted to approximately 30 and 25 per cent., respectively, in comprising corresponding periods.

We held our breath. What next? Only a faint throbbing seemed to pulse in the air above the spot where the missile sank. I was about to pronounce the diagnosis of \"a dud,\" when someone cried, \"My God, General, they've turned hell loose this time!\" The whole atmosphere for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile radius about the fatal bomb quivered as over a heated griddle. Even as we remarked this, the area began to glow cherry red. A deafening thunder assaulted our ears when to our horror the earth on which had stood the now burning town of Ogallala, rose a gigantic incandescent ball and shot like a meteor into the heavens. Our car was a feather tossed in the ensuing hurricane, but even while we bobbed back and forth there was an ear-splitting explosion as the land that was...", "...angel then said to me, \"Into this region new comers from the earth daily enter, and the former inhabitants are by turns separated and cast down into the gulphs of the west, which appear at a distance like lakes of fire and brimstone. All in those gulphs are spiritual and natural adulterers.\" 80. THE SIXTH MEMORABLE RELATION. As the angel said this, I looked to the western boundary, and lo! there appeared as it were lakes of fire and brimstone; and I asked him, why the hells in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> had such an appearance? He replied, \"They appear as lakes in consequence of the falsifications of truth; because water in the spiritual sense signifies truth; and there is an appearance as it were of fire round about them, and in them, in consequence of the love of evil, and as it were of brimstone in consequence of the love of what is false. Those three things, the lake, the fire, and the brimstone, are appearances, because they are correspondences of the evil loves of the...", "...we arrived there at noon the steamer had been gone for three-quarters of an hour; and when the German globe-trotter, the rival of Bly and Bisland, rushed on to the platform, it was to learn that the said steamer was then going out of the mouths of the Pei-Ho into the open sea. Unfortunate traveler! We were not astonished when, as Gaterna said, the baron \"let go both broadsides\" of Teutonic maledictions. And really he had cause to curse in his native tongue.

The perspiration stood upon Fitz's brow, forming drops which gradually ran together and then began to trickle down the sides of his nose, tickling horribly; but he dared not even raise his hand to wipe them away. By degrees, though, all became convinced that they could not be seen, and something in the way of relief came at the end of about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, when all at once the cigar in the man's mouth glowed more brightly, and then brighter still as it made a rush through the air, describing a curve and falling into the sea, when the silence was broken by a hiss so faint that it was hardly heard, and by something else which was heard plainly. Some one, evidently the smoker, gave vent to a yawn, a Spanish yawn, no doubt, but as much like an English one as it could be. Then, just audible in the silence, there was...", "...the sun rose, he was taken for a short canter. \"He's pretty good,\" said the jockey as they came in, \"but nothing wonderful that I can see.\" Meanwhile, Red Rover was also watered, fed, rubbed down, limbered up, and after every loving, horse-wise care was spent on both animals, the jockeys were given their mounts and headed for the starting point on the two-mile course. First they ambled easily around the track to study the ground. They started together and ran neck and neck for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, then pulled rein, as this was a mere warm-up. Then they returned to the starting post, and the cowboy jockey on the buckskin said: \"Well, boys, he's a good bronk, but I don't seem to feel any blood in him.\" At the signal, they went off together, and behind them Captain Wayne, the Preacher, and a dozen more white men who were interested. These onlookers dropped behind as the racers went at high speed, but the view was clear, even when afar. The tall sorrel horse was...", "...side emitted piercing shrieks by way of enlivening the proceedings. There was a mysterious One on the stage, who reminded me of an immense dice-box muffled in muslin; this, it turned out, was the COLOSSUS of SOUSSE, to whom was entrusted the function of \"presenting\" Mademoiselle FATMA at the close of the performance. This seemed superfluous, particularly as the excellent Colossus had no notion of doing more than taking her by the hand and stalking two paces forward. It was all over in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour or so; and, for my own part, I considered the old lady in the turban alone worth the paltry shilling charged for admission. I have also been to TERRY'S Theatre, where great precautions are taken to prevent fire. Everything, more or less, is labelled \"Exit,\" and, instead of doors, in several parts of the house there are curtains. On the whole it must be a good theatre to escape from. This is worth noting, if the performances are wearisome. * *...", "...fiercely as ever, and I could see a crisis coming which I knew would be either the making or the undoing of the Union. At the conclusion of the harvest in the third week in September I met all the men on strike in both districts who had lost their harvest through the strike and paid them the whole harvest wages which they would have received had they been at work. So no one man suffered the loss of one penny through the strike. Such a thing no Union had ever done before. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> from July to October we had some few little disputes over the harvest wages, at Swanton, Morley and Litcham, in which Mr. Arnett, a member of the Executive, and myself were able to effect a satisfactory settlement. On November 19, 1910, a most important meeting of the Executive was held at Cozens' Temperance Hotel. There were present Mr. George Nicholls, Mr. Richard Winfrey, Messrs. George Edwards, J.

I curled myself up in the confessional at four o'clock, hiding myself as best I could, and commending myself to the care of all the saints. At five o'clock the beadle made his usual tour of inspection, went out and locked the door. As soon as I heard the noise of the key I came out of my narrow cell and sat down on a bench facing the windows. Soon after my mistress's shadow appeared on the grated panes, and I knew she had seen me. I sat on the bench for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour and then pushed open the little door and entered. I shut it and sat down on the lowest step of the stair, and spent there five hours which would probably have not been unpleasant ones if I had not been dreadfully tormented by the rats running to and fro close to me. Nature has given me a great dislike to this animal, which is comparatively harmless; but the smell of rats always sickens me. At last I heard the clock strike ten, the hour of bliss, and I saw the form...", "...she, \"So deem I. Hath not our Lord promised us wine in Paradise?\" And he answered, \"Yes.

It was no longer safe for him to remain in England till the affair was blown over, and he did not return till October in the year 1790, and was soon again engaged in alternate preaching in Methodist chapels, and in smuggling brandy from Roscoff. On one of these excursions in 1793 he was arrested at Roscoff, as war had been declared between France and England. This was during the Reign of Terror, at a time when the Convention had decreed that no <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> should be given to an Englishman, and an English prisoner was placed on the same footing as a \"suspect\" or \"aristocrat,\" and stood a great chance of losing his head under the knife. He does not, however, seem to have been harshly treated, only moved about from place to place, sometimes in a prison, at others lodged in a private house; a good many of his French fellow-prisoners, however, suffered death.

I was happy, however, to see that every one seemed better satisfied with our situation than myself. Our stock of provisions consisted of about one...", "...monopolist rights which close great regions to private traders and subject the natives to vexatious burdens. This system took definite form in September 1891, when the Government claimed exclusive rights in trade in the extreme north and north-east. At the close of that year Captain Baert, the administrator of these districts, also enjoined the collection of rubber and other products by the natives for the benefit of the State. The next step was to forbid to private traders in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> the right of buying these products from natives. In May 1892 the State monopoly in rubber, etc., was extended to the \"Equator\" district, natives not being allowed to sell them to any one but a State official. Many of the merchants protested, but in vain. The chief result of their protest was the establishment of privileged companies, the \"Societe Anversoise\" and the \"Anglo-Belgian,\" and the reservation to the State of large areas under the title of _Domaines prives_ (Oct....", "...the trees did not grow close enough together, so they had to set up two poles near the teak, and tie the cords at one end of the rug to these.

It flew rapidly from <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to quarter, and from street to street, smiting the chosen of the tomb--the young, the old, the bad, the good, the rich, the poor--here, there, every where; in the palace, the hovel, the shop, the market-place, the deewan. All day and all night the shriek of sorrow resounded in the air; and the thoroughfares were filled with people following corpses to the cemetery. Many fled into other cities and other lands; but the plague followed those who were doomed, and struck them down...", "...upon, but gives each in its natural order without affectation. Do you not agree with me?\" he asked, turning to Mrs. Guthrie Brimston who was standing beside him. Her nostrils flapped. \"If you mean to say that you _like_ Mrs. Malcomson's book, I do _not_ agree with you,\" she answered decidedly; \"I consider it _improper_, simply!\" There was a momentary silence, such as sometimes precedes a burst of applause at a theatre; and then there was laughter! Such an objection from such a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was considered too funny, and when it became known, there was quite a run upon the book; for Mrs. Guthrie Brimston's stories were familiar to the members of all the messes, naval and military, in and about the island, not to mention the club men, and the curiosity to know what she did consider an objectionable form of impropriety in narrative made Mrs. Malcomson's fortune. From that time forward, however, Mrs. Guthrie Brimston's influence was perceptibly upon the wane. Even...", "...after a pause. \"Yes, I believe this story like a sincere and orthodox Christian.\" \"Well!\" the old man went on, while his pale closed lips wrinkled into a strange smile: \"I have a double aim, though I should hardly need to say more, if you had ever thought deeply about this incident. In the first place, if our Saviour himself had to bear such things, if it was possible for him to be suspected though but by the Evil One, surely you might forgive me with all your heart, if with half or a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of mine I have now and then half misdoubted you.

He was in a fever of impatience to be at it! It was as though the pan of ice were a foe needing only another and a heavier blow to be beaten down. \"Sure,\" said Billy, after a glance to the bridge, \"he'll hit that pan till he smashes it, if it takes till Tibb's Eve!\" \"Tibb's Eve?\" \"Sure, b'y. Does you not know what that is? 'Tis till the end o' the world.\" The ship was again to be launched against the pan. The second mate took the blasting crew to the ice in the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> boat; and he lost no time about it, as the captain made sure. Up aloft went other hands to cut away the broken spar and loose the canvas. Work was carried on under the spur of the captain's harshened voice; for the captain was in a passion to prove the quality of his ship. The ice picks were plied as fast as arms could swing them. Soon the mines were laid and fired. And when the dust of ice had fallen, and the noise of the explosion had gone rumbling into the distance, three...", "...of cavalry were facing the Russian forces across the winding frontier. At Bagdad the Thirteenth Corps, and at Mosul the Twelfth, stood guard over Mesopotamia. For centuries England had had a very genuine and active interest in the Persian Gulf, recognizing its strategic and potential commercial importance with that foresight which has distinguished her statesmen and traders for generations. Russia had been regarded as the most likely nation to contest England's predominance in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the world, and her every move was watched and checkmated in Downing Street. At the outbreak of the war, however, and for a decade before, Germany had given many signs that she had to be reckoned with in any arrangements in the waters washing the shores of Mesopotamia. And it soon became apparent that the domination of that part of Turkey was to be one of the chief spoils of victory. Much has been written about Germany's territorial ambitions. Much of it is based upon pure...", "...horses were out in the yard for anyone to see, and the greatest spoil of victory might at any moment fall into the hands of the meanest Prussian soldier out for loot. But the dreamer still sat on in the gloom, with the pale light of the moon streaming in through the narrow casement window and illumining that marble-like face, rigid and set, that seemed only to live by the glowing eyes--the eyes that looked into the future and the past and heeded not the awful present.

And now I must tell you something about the bazaars, which, after the mosques, are the most interesting relics in Cairo, and in many cases quite as old. First, I may say that the word \"bazaar\" means \"bargain,\" and as in the East a fixed price is unusual, and anything is worth just what can be got for it, making a purchase is generally a matter of...", "...there is an extensive view of much of the Coorg country, and I was particularly struck by its continuous jungly character, and with its great contrast to the Mysore country to the north, which is not so much a jungly country, as an open grass country studded with occasional wood, and park-like groups of trees. On the afternoon of my arrival I rode round part of this fine estate, and inspected other parts of it on the following morning and evening. On the next morning I started at a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to six, and after driving about twenty-four miles, crossed the frontier, and entered Manjarabad--the southernmost coffee district of Mysore. The northernmost part of Coorg consists of a long tongue of land which projects into Mysore, and the scenery, in its beautiful, open, and park-like character, naturally resembles that of Manjarabad. On my visit to Coorg I look back with pleasure. It was, indeed, extremely enjoyable and instructive, and I cannot help regretting the fact...", "...along which two black figures were still plunging heavily. \"Yes, Poeskop, of course,\" replied Guy; \"the rhinoster, by all means. Come along; forrard on! I'll keep the Martini for the present.\" Once more they set their ponies at the gallop, and rapidly overhauled the two black figures ahead of them. Far to their left front, the herd of wildebeest were vanishing into the heart of the great plain; the buffaloes had sheered away yet more to the left, and were standing at gaze a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away, evidently meditating a rush for the coveted shelter of the river bush. Galloping on, the hunters were presently within a quarter of a mile of the rhinos, which, considering their gigantic size and unwieldy shape, moved at an astonishingly fast pace. Now the two beasts swerved suddenly to the right hand, and were presently lost to view among the river jungle. As Guy and the Bushman approached the place where the animals had disappeared, Poeskop whispered,--...", "...had luncheons and visits; three evenings of promenading and dining at the Queen's Park Hotel.

The people had talked for weeks, they said, over the arrival of the fleet, but straightway when it was announced that the races would be held at the same time--well, how can any person attend to two important things at one and the same time? Didn't one of the daily morning newspapers give a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a column of space to the fleet on the second day after its arrival? Talk about enterprise in journalism! Trinidad is the place to go to see a specimen of it. Admiral Evans expected to sail at 8 o'clock on Sunday morning, December 29, but there was some delay in coaling and he did not get away until 4 P.

This was unusual, and her suspicions revived. \"I like it not,\" said she; \"I fear my father--God help me!--I hardly know what to do--I will not give it to Philip. The warm wine may produce perspiration sufficient.\" Amine paused, and again reflected. She had mixed the powder with so small a portion of wine that it did not fill a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the cup; she put it on one side, filled another up to the brim with the warm wine, and then went up to the bedroom. On the landing-place she was met by her father, whom she supposed to have retired to rest. \"Take care you do not spill it, Amine. That is right, let him have a whole cupful.

Here the black, burned monastery like a grim Carthusian monk stood threatening, and displaying its dark magnificence at every flash; there blazed the monastery garden.

Surrounded on every side with a superior force, hunted from every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> with veteran troops; you have found means to elude their attempts and to keep alive the expiring hopes of an oppressed militia, when all succour seemed to be cut off.

One man rose and went to stand on a little mound. He had long light hair, and a pale face.

Heavy charges had to be met in treating to bring it to sale condition and very heavy losses were incurred. Before the matter was cleaned up finally these losses totalled more than $230,000. When a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million dollars has been expended in a direction where tangible results have not been in evidence--when it has been sacrificed apparently for the sake of a principle--then does the manner in which such a loss is accepted become significant.

Regardless of the risk he ran by some heavy stones dropping on his head or feet,--regardless also of the noise made by the falling rubbish, and of the imminent risk to which he was consequently exposed of being interrupted by some of the gaolers, should the sound reach their ears, he continued to pull down large masses of the wall, which he flung upon the floor of the cell. Having worked thus for another <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, without being sensible of fatigue, though he was half stifled by the clouds of dust which his exertions raised, he had made a hole about three feet wide and six high, and uncovered the iron bar. Grasping it firmly with both hands, he quickly wrenched it from the stones in which it was mortised, and leapt to the ground.

Weighing as soon as the tide made out of the strait, although there was still no wind, we were rather surprised at daylight to find how little the ship had drifted to the North-North-West.

Thus, since it certainly takes more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a second to pass in imagination from one impression to another, it may be that we tend to confound this duration with that which we try to represent. Similarly, the fact that in the act of reproductive imagination we under-estimate a longer interval between two impressions, say those of the slow beats of a colliery engine, may be accounted for by the supposition that the imagination tends to pass from the one impression to the succeeding one too rapidly.[119] The gross...", "...and thee, Were still alive, thou dost great storms resent, Before they come, and know'st how near they be. \"Else all at rest thou lyest, and the fierce breath Of tempests can no more disturb thy ease; But this thy strange resentment after death Means only those who broke in life thy peace.\" This poem is founded upon the superstition that a tree which had been blown down by the wind gave signs of restlessness and anger before the coming of a storm from the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> whence came its own fall.

The stream of people from the theatres began to grow thinner. Still, Wolfenden did not come. Harcutt took out his watch. \"I propose that we do not wait any longer for Wolfenden,\" he said. \"I saw him this afternoon, and he answered me very oddly when I reminded him about to-night. There is such a crowd here too, that they will not keep our table much longer.\" \"Let us go in, by all means,\" Densham agreed. \"Wolfenden will easily find us if he wants to!\"...", "...plant of your own! Be careful to boil these beads before stringing, for a little grub sometimes lives in them, and he may appear when you least expect him or may even make a meal of the thread on which the beads are strung.

Use a No. 5 needle and a piece of No. 60 white linen thread four inches longer than you wish the chain to be when it is finished; two yards and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> is a good length. String a seed and draw it down to the middle of the thread, then string some of the gold-lined crystal beads for about three-quarters of an inch. A seed is next threaded on, and then quarter of an inch of gold-lined beads. Keep on in this way, first threading a seed and then quarter of an inch of gold-lined beads, until there are only two inches of the thread left. Tie this end through a bead to keep the others from slipping off. Thread your needle with the...", "...\"I can't help it,\" he muttered apologetically. \"Forgive me!\" As only answer she seemed to draw yet closer to him, and then she lay, still and silent, within his sheltering arms,--and at that moment he remembered to be glad he had not kissed her wrist. They two stood there, encompassed by a living wall, and yet how strangely alone. The fog had become less dense, or else the resin torches which flared up all about them cleared the air. From the captain's bridge there whistled every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> minute a high rocket, and soon from behind the wall of fog came in answer distant signals full of a mingled mockery and hope to the people waiting there. But for John Coxeter the drama of his own soul took precedence of that going on round him. Had he been alone he would have shared to the full the awful, exasperating feeling of being trapped, of there being nothing to be done, which possessed all the thinking minds about him. But he was not alone---- Nan, lying on his...", "...was attained--an orbit which terminated in a vertical line through the center of the Stretts' supposedly impregnable retreat. The planet Strett had a mass of approximately seven times ten to the twenty-first metric tons. Its moon, little more than a hundredth as massive, still weighed in at about eight times ten to the nineteenth--that is, the figure eight followed by nineteen zeroes. And moon fell on planet, in direct central impact, after having fallen from a height of over a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million miles under the full pull of gravity and the full thrust of those mighty atomic drives. The kinetic energy of such a collision can be computed. It can be expressed. It is, however, of such astronomical magnitude as to be completely meaningless to the human mind. Simply, the two worlds merged and splashed. Droplets, weighing up to millions of tons each, spattered out into space; only to return, in seconds or hours or weeks or months, to add their atrocious...", "...with a beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint a chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by seven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Caesar's 'Commentaries,' and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me, that unless the next morning, before six o'clock, four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his banker's, at a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past six I should have ceased to exist. The letter is still to be seen, for it is in Franz d'Epinay's possession, signed by me, and with a postscript of M. Luigi Vampa.

And the race only a third run.\" \"In other words,\" went on the young captain, \"the Rhinds boat is gaining steadily on us at the rate of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile an hour.

There, pallid and tranquil, sat the Irish leader, whose hard insight, whose patience, energy, and spirit of command, had achieved this astounding result, and done that which he had vowed to his countrymen that he would assuredly be able to do. On the benches round him genial excitement rose almost to tumult. Well it might. For the first time since the Union the Irish case was at...", "...man, girt and armed by this new passion of hate; stung and uplifted, as it were, by the sight of that which he can smite with a whole heart.

With the letter from Sydney to Governor Parr, she took a certificate of survey, which read as follows: This may certify, that by the desire of Captain ----, I have laid nine hundred acres of land on the Peninsular or place called Grimross Neck, in the Township of Gage, on the River St. John, beginning at the Portage and running down the river about two miles and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to a maple tree marked, thence running S.W. till it meets Grimross Creek, thence up the said Creek to the Portage, thence crossing the Portage to the first mentioned bounds.

I papered and painted the first house we owned there until it was perfect. I did so love this, our first home, but my husband was a natural wanderer. One day he came home announcing that he had sold our pretty home. We moved into a two room log house on a section of land out near where my father lived. The house was built so that a corner stood in each quarter section and complied with the law that each owner of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> section should have a home on it. It was built by the four Hemmenway brothers and was always called \"Connecticut\" as they came from there. My husband worked for Mr. Sibley and was gone much of the time buying furs. Then he carried mail from Traverse to Fort Lincoln. Once in a blizzard he came in all frozen up, but he had outdistanced his Indian guide--you couldn't freeze him to stay--he was too much alive. He once traveled the seventy-five miles from Traverse to St. Paul in...", "...read the paper together; we laughed over it till we cried. \"It would be lots funnier if it wasn't my mother who was making such a holy show of herself,\" Blakely said. \"Do you know, my dear--\" He was silent for a moment.

Good-by, dear.\" Chapter Nine At a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to four I received a note from Blakely saying it would be impossible for him to come in to tea as he had planned. It was the first time he had ever broken an engagement with me, and I was a wee bit unhappy over it, though I knew, of course, there must be some good reason why he couldn't come. Still, his absence rather put me out of humor with tea, so I sent Valentine for a box of chocolates.

When the raft was attacked by some of these creatures it was in a part where there was no place for them to flee to. Here it is quite different.

CORN.--The principal insect enemies of corn are the chinch bug, corn-root worm (_Diabrotica longicornis_), bill bug, wire worm, boll-worm or ear-worm, cut-worm, army worm, stalk worm, grasshopper, and plant lice, in all a total of about fifty important species! Several of these pests work secretly. At husking time the wretched ear-worm that ruins the terminal <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> or fifth of an immense number of ears, is painfully in evidence. The root-worms work insidiously, and the moles and shrews are supposed to attack them and destroy them. The corn-root worm is charged with causing an annual loss of two per cent of the corn crop, or $20,000,000; the chinch bug another two per cent; the boll or ear-worm two per cent more. The remaining insect pests are charged with two per cent, which makes eight per cent in all, or a total of $80,000,000 lost each...", "...about 50 lodges were erected for the occupancy of gardeners and keepers. They were of Steetley stone, all similarly planned and pleasing to the eye, what there was of them above ground; but the Duke had subterranean kitchens made at the side and lighted them with bulls'-eyes at the top. He spent about 100,000l. a year in the development of his plans, and employed as many as 1,500 workpeople in helping him to gratify his hobby. When it is remembered that his reign as Duke lasted a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, from 1854 to 1879, it will be seen that artisans of all descriptions found Welbeck a veritable gold-mine. Even so late as November, 1878, a Nottingham newspaper correspondent, on visiting Welbeck, was impressed with its appearance as that of the premises of \"some great contractor who had an order for the building of a big village.\" There was the buzz of machinery, large areas were covered with bricklayers', masons' and joiners' sheds, wherein any new mechanical...", "...told him the right catalogues to cite. He offers us a strange hodgepodge consisting of one early eighteenth-century catalogue (the _Duboisiana_), a handbook of bibliography, several nineteenth-century catalogues of private libraries, and a few dealers' catalogues. The _Duboisiana_, Michael Denis's _Einleitung in die Buecherkunde_, and Part II of the Libri catalogue (1861) are not hard to justify, but the remaining titles appear to be a random selection. Inasmuch as he devotes almost one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the space to a full-length citation of a part of the Libri catalogue, he should have taken the trouble to find the other parts. Although Petzholdt's list of catalogues interesting to bibliographers has the merit of being more international in scope than most of his lists for special disciplines, he overlooked many large and admirable polymathic catalogues. He does not mention the Thott and Heber catalogues or the _Firmiana_, to name no others. Petzholdt's abundant...", "...surrender; but this enemy had no thought of surrendering. The consequences of a blunder committed so long before as the 18th of November were felt here. General White's attack upon the Hillabees when they had submitted and asked for peace had taught these men to expect nothing but cruellest treachery at the hands of Jackson, whom they confidently believed to be the author of that most unfortunate occurrence. Having no faith in his word, the Creeks believed that he and his men offered <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> only to save themselves the work of killing warriors who could yet fight. They believed that to surrender was only to spare their enemies, who, as soon as the prisoners could be disarmed, would butcher them in cold blood, paying no recompense in the death of any of their own number. Convinced of this, the men at the Horse Shoe simply refused to be taken prisoners, either in a body or singly; they would yield only to death, not to their enemies. They fought for every inch of...", "...to the bad sanitation--of poverty. Though the disease is often confined exclusively to soldiers in the midst of a civil population, examples are not wanting of an exclusive selection of civilians or of an indiscriminate attack in every direction. Lastly, dysentery is a disease which may recur repeatedly in the same individual, one attack rather predisposing to than preventing another. ETIOLOGY.--Dysentery is an omnipresent disease. \"Wherever man is,\" Ayres observed of it nearly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century ago, \"there will some of its forms appear.\" But the character of the form, and more especially the extent and severity of the disease, vary in extreme degree with the conditions surrounding the abode of man. No one of these conditions affects the disease so markedly as the climate. It is the testimony of Hirsch, based upon the study of seven hundred epidemics of the disease, that no other disease is so dependent upon the influence of the climate. The home of...", "...is the reward of him who first names it. The doors are then thrown open; and the lucky clodpole receives the titbit as a recompense.

Well to bear, pockets full, hats full, Pecks full, bushel-bags full,\"-- is another version of the address used on these occasions, preserved by Brand.

Such a man is the \"revolutionist\" which Beaconsfield claimed himself to be. But what shall we say of the President of the country that has attained the highest place in industrial progress among the nations, whose whole history is a verification of the truth of the dialectic and who can still appeal to \"individualism\" as a guiding principle of political action?

Perched on the perilous brink of that curving wall of rocks, with its low, irregular, patched and weather-beaten roof, and its rough-boarded and storm-beaten walls half hidden in a tangle of vines and bushes, the little hut looks, from a distance, as though it might once have been the strange habitation of some gigantic winged creature of prehistoric ages. The place may be reached from a seldom-used road that leads along the steep hillside, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile back from the edge of the precipice, but the principal connecting link between the queer habitation and the world is that flight of rickety wooden steps. Taking advantage of an irregularity in the line of cliffs, the upper landing of the stairway is placed at the side of the hut. In the rear, a small garden is protected from the uncultivated life of the hillside by a fence of close-set pickets.

After this he returned to the heart of the town and passed through a number of small and lonely streets, glancing eagerly, but askance, at the signs as he passed onward in his agitation. An hour had certainly elapsed in this bootless wandering, when he entered a narrow lane in the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of Saint Andre and uttered a sudden cry of joy as he caught a glimpse of the object for which he was in search. His eye lighted on a sign which bore the simple but ominous inscription--\"SWORN PAWNBROKER.\" He passed by the door and walked rapidly to the end of the lane; then, turning hastily, he retraced his steps, hastening or lingering as he noticed any one passing in his neighborhood, till at length he crept along the wall to the door, and, seeing the thoroughfare almost...", "...There was a crowd gathering, and everybody was as excited as could be.

Fortunately, these did her much good, and inside of half an hour she was considerably better. \"I thought I heard you coming a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour before you did,\" remarked Mrs. Nelson, presently. \"I certainly heard somebody walking in the dooryard.\" Ralph was interested at once. \"I heard footsteps, too,\" he said. \"Somebody must have been prowling about.

The station-master, however, was there himself, with an inspector in attendance. A dark, thick-set man, wearing a long travelling ulster and a Homburg hat, and carrying in his hand a brown leather dressing-case, across which was painted in black letters the name MR. JOHN P.

And so Carlos and Melie walked with us till we were in the midst of the village; and there we shook hands as we parted, and again waved a goodbye, as we moved out of view, numbers of curious blacks looking on. When we had gone a mile or more seaward, we turned aside; and from a screen of brush, we watched the path for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, for possible followers. \"Do you think there were any of the voodoo, there?\" questioned Robert at last. \"Perhaps not,\" I answered, \"but they'll soon hear of our going.\" We picked a suitable spot in the brush, and set up our dressing room. Forth came the kinky, black wigs, and paints given us by Jules Sevier. We worked on one another, turn about. At the end of twenty minutes I set the wig on Robert's head. The result was satisfactory. His color was a dusky...", "...The fate of the latter was buried in obscurity. It was even a mystery to his family. He was, it was said, a youth of much promise, and of gentle manners; who, having made an imprudent match, from jealousy, or some other motive, deserted his wife, and fled his country. Various reasons were assigned for his conduct. Amongst others, it was stated that the object of Alan's jealous suspicions was his elder brother, Reginald; and that it was the discovery of his wife's infidelity in this <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> which occasioned his sudden disappearance with his infant daughter. Some said he died abroad. Others, that he had appeared again for a brief space at the hall. But all now concurred in a belief of his decease. Of his child nothing was known. His inconstant wife, after enduring for some years the agonies of remorse, abandoned by Sir Reginald, and neglected by her own relatives, put an end to her existence by poison. This is all that could be gathered of the story, or the...", "...and soon after dinner the road under Heriot's study windows began to resound with the tramp of boys on their way in twos and threes to see the start from Burston Beeches. A spell of hard weather had broken in sunshine and clear skies; the afternoon was brilliantly fine; and by half-past two the scene in the paddock under the noble beeches, with the grey tower of Burston church rising behind the leafless branches, was worthy of the day. Practically all the school was there, and quite a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of it in flannels and jerseys red or white, trimmed or starred with the colour of some fifteen. Off go the two hares--gigantic gentlemen with their football colours thick upon them. Hounds and mere boys in plain clothes crowd to the gate to see the last of them and their bulging bags of scent. The twelve minutes' law allowed them seems much more like half-an-hour; but at last time is up, the gates are opened, and the motley pack pours through with plenty of plain clothes after...", "...left. Round we all went; very slowly, with the greatest difficulty, shoved, trampled on, knocked about; with our arms pinned to our sides, and hardly able to breathe, we fought our way, street by street, to the little square by the bridge of St. Angelo. The bridge itself was crammed with people; beyond it, there were more crowds, which seemed to stretch all the way to St. Peter's. The right bank of the Tiber swarmed like an ant-hill. Crossing the bridge was a hard job; it took us over a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour. The poor devils on each side, in their fear of being pushed over the edge, clutched the parapet madly, and shouted with terror; I believe there were several accidents. \"Well, at last we got across. All the streets leading to the Piazza of St. Peter were choked with human beings. When we reached the foot of one of the two streets that run straight to St. Peter's we heard a great roar, like the noise of the sea in a gale; it seemed to come to us in gusts, now near...", "...the roots of his hair as he pulled up the window and sat down in his corner, feeling quite certain every one of his fellow-travellers must be secretly smiling at his expense. He wished his mother would have whispered that last sentence. It wasn't fair to him.

It is decidedly awkward to get dust in your eye when you want to figure as a hero, for the eyes will water, and must be wiped, and that looks particularly like weeping. Stephen refrained from using his handkerchief as long as he could; but it was no use; he must wipe his eye in the presence of his fellow-passengers. However, if he whistled a tune while doing so, no one could suspect him of...", "...a nursery governess; you are a nice, presentable-looking girl, my dear.\" Primrose flushed, and the tears, wrung from great pain, came into her eyes. \"There is just one thing,\" she said, in a tremulous voice; \"whatever happens, we three girls won't be parted. On that point I have quite firmly made up my mind.\" Mr. Danesfield again knit his brows, and this time he fidgeted uneasily on his chair. \"Look here, Primrose,\" he said: \"I am an old bachelor, and I don't know half nor a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> the ways in which a woman may earn her living.

We wound along the path, or rather track, that the blacks had made, with the greatest difficulty. It was all very well for the troopers, who had stripped, but our clothes hitched up on a thorn at every other step. One of our most provoking enemies was the lawyer vine, a kind of rattan enclosed in a rough husk, covered with thousands of crooked prickles. These, with their outer covering, are about an inch and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> in diameter, and extend to an enormous distance, running up to the tops of lofty trees, and from thence either descending or pushing onward, or festooning themselves from stem to stem in graceful curves of indescribable beauty.

The men did as he desired. They broiled a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the mutton for themselves, and gave another to the king and his attendant. They were obliged to eat it without bread or salt; but, as they were very hungry, they were glad to get food in any shape, and partook of it heartily. 25. \"Then so heavy a drowsiness fell on King Robert that he greatly desired to sleep.

Its fall would sooner or later necessarily draw after it that of all Brabant, and the preponderance of power in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> would decide the whole dispute in favor of the king. Determined by these grave considerations, the Duke of Parma drew his forces together in July, 1584, and advanced from his position at Dornick to the neighborhood of Antwerp, with the intention of investing it.

To the king it was of infinite advantage that no delay should occur. Nevertheless, it was Charles who opened active hostilities on July 15th, with soldiers who had not broken their fast that day. Armed since early dawn, wearied by a forced march with a July sun beating down upon their heads, their movements hampered by standing wheat and rye, the men were at a tremendous disadvantage when they were led to the attack. It was a hot assault. No <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was given, many fled. At length, Louis found himself abandoned by all save his body-guard. Pressed against the hill that bounded the grain fields, the king at last retreated up its slope into a castle on its summit. Charles rode impetuously after the retreating royalists. Separated from his men, he fell among the royal guard at the gate of the castle. There was a vehement assault resisted as vehemently by his meagre escort.

Now and then a sea would strike so that my very headland seemed to tremble, and burst as with a thunder clap at my very feet. Advancing, retiring, returning, breaking, the wildly sportive waves were for a long time quite admirably regular in their movements. But on a sudden this regularity was at an end.

A second or two later the lights swung around the bend in the road a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile above Hart's Tavern, and down came the car at a high rate of speed. It dashed past the tavern with a great roar and rattle and shot off into the darkness beyond. As it rushed through the dim circle of light in front of the tavern, Barnes succeeded in obtaining a brief but convincing view of the car. That glance was enough, however.

A genuine, unprompted natural effort, it is merely a slip of pine, 4 inches long, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch broad and flat, upon which are cut spiral intersecting grooves. George's birthplace is Cooktown, and his message-stick resembles in design that brought by Mattie from Bo'sun of Cooktown for Mickie of the Palms.

The man ducked his head as he neared, and greeted him, \"Hello, Brother Teller.\" Jasper seemed startled; gave the \"Oh! Oh, how are you!\" of sudden recognition; and mumbled, \"Looking after a little bank property.\" \"Always on the job, eh!\" The man passed on. Jasper got into his car and drove back to the street that would take him out to the suburb of Rosebank. As he left Fandall Avenue he peered at his watch. It was five minutes of seven. At a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past seven he passed through the main street of Rosebank, and turned into a lane that was but little changed since the time when it had been a country road. A few jerry-built villas of freckled paint did shoulder upon it, but for the most part it ran through swamps spotted with willow groves, the spongy ground covered with scatterings of dry leaves and bark. Opening on this lane was a dim-rutted grassy private road, which disappeared into one of the willow groves.

Crossing seemed at first likely to be no easy matter.

He almost fell from the nest with amazement, but he would not give in--\"No, never, die first!\" he thought, so he rushed on, and was among the foremost to enter the cells where the young pupae were carefully walled in, and tearing them from their cosy cradles, the ants proceeded to devour them. [Illustration: \"SALUTING HIS COMMANDER\" (_p. 209_).] However, though the nests were large, and the grubs many in number, there were not half or <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> enough for the army. More and more ants came trooping up the tree, trying to squeeze into the places where there was no room for them, and mournfully calling out that they also were very hungry.

At this point, Pierce Butler and Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina insisted that slaves were part of the population, and as such must be counted in ascertaining the basis of representation.

The South Carolina proposal suggested a uniform rule, but it was one that would scarcely alter the political weight of the north, while it would vastly increase the weight of the south; and it would increase it most in just the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where slavery was most deeply rooted. The power of South Carolina, as a member of the Union, would be doubled by such a measure. Hence the northern delegates maintained that slaves, as chattels, ought no more to be reckoned as part of the population than houses or ships. \"Has a man in Virginia,\" exclaimed Paterson, \"a number of votes in proportion to the number of his slaves?

During this period, she more than once had Lacedaemon at her mercy and did not begin to descend the stony path of ruin and defeat until after the disastrous expedition to Sicily, in which, carried away by her rhetoricians and bitten with inconceivable folly, she hurled all her fleet, all her soldiers and all her wealth into a remote, unprofitable, unknown and desperate adventure. She resisted the...", "...but they met a worse one, for it is an actual fact that the water around the ship was literally at a boiling heat. The escape of my vessel was miraculous.

It struck me that her father's dwelling must be near the criminal prison; and this was in the squalid <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the town where I had first encountered her. Thither I sped--into the dark streets, so perilous after dusk, I plunged; and at length I overtook the object of my affection, just as she was skirting the very wall of the prison.

But the sister hastened to tell the king that she could not aspire to a greater honour. The king locked them up again in the pavilion and went away, but in less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour St. Quentin came to fetch them, placed the young girl in an apartment under the care of a female attendant, and with the sister he went to meet at the hotel the German artist to whom he gave fifty Louis for the portrait, and nothing to Morphi.

Not long after, Malhortie, encouraged by this success, crept up to the Burgundian camp, fell upon the sleepers, and captured a goodly number of horses.

But the duke persisted in being oblivious to what was passing under his eyes.

At the close of the last session it was anticipated that the progressive diminution of the public revenue in 1819 and 1820, which had been the result of the languid state of our foreign commerce in those years, had in the latter year reached its extreme point of depression. It has, however, been ascertained that that point was reached only at the termination of the first <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the present year. From that time until the 30th of September last the duties secured have exceeded those of the corresponding quarters of the last year $1,172,000, whilst the amount of debentures issued during the three first quarters of this year is $952,000 less than that of the same quarters of the last year.

Corse de Leon was looking at him with a slight smile when he turned round; but, in a few minutes after, the brigand rose, left the room, and returned with the two young men whom Bernard de Rohan had seen before. They were now loaded, however, with various kinds of arms and habiliments of different sorts, which seemed to have been gathered from many a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the earth. These were spread out, some upon the table and some on the floor; and this being performed without a word, those who bore them retired, only appearing again to furnish the chamber with a light.

I turned my eyes in that direction, but saw nothing. \"Some bird,\" said I; \"an owl, perhaps;\" and once more I fell into meditation; my mind wandered from one thing to another--musing now on the structure of the Roman tongue--now on the rise and fall of the Persian power--and now on the powers vested in recorders at <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> sessions. I was thinking what a fine thing it must be to be a recorder of the peace, when, lifting up my eyes, I saw right opposite, not a culprit at the bar, but, staring at me through a gap in the bush, a face wild and strange, half covered with grey hair; I only saw it a moment, the next it had disappeared.

When Atahualpa knew what had happened, from the messengers of Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz, he ordered one of his relations named Cusi Yupanqui to go to Cuzco, and not to leave a relation or friend of Huascar alive. This Cusi Yupanqui arrived at Cuzco, and Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz delivered the prisoners to him. He made inquiries touching all that Atahualpa had ordered.

Next he brought out of the prison all the wives of Huascar, including those pregnant or lately delivered. He ordered them to be hung to these poles with their children, and he ordered the pregnant to be cut open, and the stillborn to be hung with them. Then he caused the sons of Huascar to be brought out and hung to the poles. Among the sons of Huayna Ccapac who were prisoners there was one named Paullu Tupac.

'That means that you would have to pay sevenpence per year if we had a halfpenny rate. Wouldn't it be worth sevenpence a year to you to know that there were no starving children in the town?' 'Why should I 'ave to 'elp to keep the children of a man who's too lazy to work, or spends all 'is money on drink?' shouted Crass. ''Ow are yer goin' to make out about the likes o' them?'

In vain Casteno and I worked and edged and wriggled. All of the men round the table spoke so low and so earnestly that we could not catch a single word of what they were saying, and we might just as well have gone back to the hotel, and there awaited the hunchback's return, as have prowled so uneasily on the far side of those doors for all the good we did to our cause, until I had an idea which I put immediately into effect. \"Look here,\" I whispered suddenly...", "...a great loss of life. The forts are of three kinds. They are best described as the forts, the block houses and the little forts. A big fort consists of two stories, with a cellar below and a watch tower above. It is made of stone and adobe, and is painted a glaring white. One of these is placed at intervals of every half mile along the trocha, and on a clear day the sentry in the watch tower of each can see three forts on either side. Midway between the big forts, at a distance of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile from each, is a block house of two stories with the upper story of wood, overhanging the lower foundation of mud. These are placed at right angles to the railroad, instead of facing it, as do the forts. Between each block house and each fort are three little forts of mud and planks, surrounded by a ditch. They look something like a farmer's ice house as we see it at home, and they are about as hot inside as the other is cold. They hold five men, and are within...", "...between 1761 and 1766. C. Heydinger, of the Strand, was a German bookseller who issued catalogues from 1771 to 1773, and who died in distressed circumstances about 1778. Henry Lasher Gardner, who died at a very advanced age in 1808, was a venerable bookseller, whose shop was opposite St. Clement's Church, Strand; he published catalogues between 1786 and 1793. William Otridge, at first alone, and afterwards in partnership with his son, issued catalogues from the Strand during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the last century. In 1796 Joseph Pote was selling books at the Golden Door, over against Suffolk Street, Charing Cross. John Nourse (died 1780), bookseller to his Majesty, was another celebrated bibliopole of the Strand, and is described by John Nichols as 'a man of science, particularly in the mathematical line.' Francis Wingrave succeeded Nourse. One of the most celebrated booksellers of this neighbourhood during the last half of the eighteenth century was Tom Davies,...", "...imagined, pernicious to England, had been chiefly managed by an association of Huguenot refugees, residing in London. Whole fleets of boats with illicit cargoes had been passing and repassing between Kent and Picardy. The loading and unloading had taken place sometimes in Romney Marsh, sometimes on the beach under the cliffs between Dover and Folkstone. All the inhabitants of the south eastern coast were in the plot. It was a common saying among them that, if a gallows were set up every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile along the coast, the trade would still go on briskly. It had been discovered, some years before, that the vessels and the hiding places which were necessary to the business of the smuggler had frequently afforded accommodation to the traitor. The report contained fresh evidence upon this point. It was proved that one of the contrabandists had provided the vessel in which the ruffian O'Brien had carried Scum Goodman over to France.

He was just come home from work, and was surprised when Jem showed him the half-crown, saying, \"Look what I got for the stones; you are to have half, you know.\" \"No,\" said the man, when he had heard his story, \"I shall not take half of that; it was given to you.

Young girls are not allowed to chew betel, which stains badly, and have white, pearly teeth, but these are considered like the teeth of animals. The teeth are filed down to a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of their natural length by means of a hard Sumatran stone, or fine steel file.

As yet Broken Tooth was the recognized leader in the colony. No other beaver had grown to his size and strength. His thick body was fully three feet long. He weighed at least sixty pounds. His tail was fourteen inches in length and five in width, and on a still night he could strike the water a blow that could be heard a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away. His webbed hindfeet were twice as large as his mate's and he was easily the swiftest swimmer in the colony. Following the afternoon when Gray Wolf and Kazan struck into the north came the clear still night when Broken Tooth climbed to the top of the dam, shook himself, and looked down to see that his army was behind him. The starlit water of the big pond rippled and flashed with the movement of many bodies. A few of the older beavers clambered up after Broken...", "...their aprons.

When they imagined that he had entered Florent's room they again exchanged furtive glances. La Sarriette laughed nervously. All at once they fancied they could see the window curtains moving, and this led them to believe that a struggle was taking place. But the house-front remained as tranquil as ever in the sunshine; and another <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour of unbroken quietness passed away, during which the three women's nervous excitement became more and more intense. They were beginning to feel quite faint when a man hurriedly came out of the passage and ran off to get a cab. Five minutes later Gavard appeared, followed by two police officers. Lisa, who had stepped out on to the footway on observing the cab, hastily hurried back into the shop. Gavard was very pale. The police had searched him upstairs, and had...", "...chill woods.

Above them, along the ridge top, was moving an army. It made no noise on the soft, moist road, artillery wheel and horse's hoof quiet alike. It seemed to wish to move quietly, without voice. The <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the sky above the ridge was coldly violet, palely luminous.

Had you any reason to suppose that you did not get the same weight in a boll from the store that you got anywhere else?-I made an objection to that, and I was told there was a little deduction made when I got 32 lbs. for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> boll instead of 35 lbs, but what that difference was I never knew. 5303. Who told you that?-Gilbert Irvine, the factor. 5304. Did he tell you that he only gave you 32 lbs. for a quarter boll?-I saw the weight myself. What we call a quarter boll is 35 lbs, and what is called a lispund is 32 lbs.; so that there should be a difference between what we call boll weight, and 32 lbs. for the quarter boll. 5305. Then you suspect or believe that you only got a lispund instead...", "...of heaven, while every few minutes a cold, cheerless wind swept across the water. So chilly indeed was it that before we had gone very far I began to wish I had added an overcoat to my other disguises.

His Lordship seems to have entertained a particular attachment for the locality where he had founded this hospital, where he resided, in order to rent his Mountain Hill Palace to Intendant Talon, and thus save the expense of a chaplain. The General Hospital was the third asylum for the infirm which the Bishop had founded. Subsequently, came the Intendant de Meules, who, toward 1684, endowed the eastern portion of the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> with an edifice (the Intendant's Palace) remarkable for its dimensions, its magnificence and its ornate gardens. Where Talon (a former Intendant) had left a brewery in a state of ruin and about seventeen acres of land unoccupied, Louis XIV., by the advice of his Intendant de Meules, lavished vast sums of money in the erection of a sumptuous palace, in which French justice was administered, and in which, at a later period, under Bigot, it was _purchasable_.

In this state of things Marcellus fortunately discovered a part of the walls more accessible than the rest; and, having prepared scaling ladders, effected an entrance at this point during the night which followed a great festival, and thus made himself master of Epipolae. The two quarters called Tyche and Neapolis were now at his mercy, and were given up to plunder; but Epicydes still held the island-citadel and the important <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of Achradina, which formed two separate and strong fortresses. Marcellus, however, made himself master of the fort of Euryalus, and had closely invested Achradina, when the Carthaginian army under Himilco and Hippocrates advanced to the relief of the city. Their efforts were, however, in vain; all their attacks on the camp of Marcellus were repulsed, and they were unable to effect a junction with Epicydes and the Syracusan garrison.

Nicky had to send for the doctor, give the news to Marjorie, parry Jim's questionings; and when at last he went upstairs again it was to find Ishmael, in a deep sleep, slipped forward in his chair as though he had never left it, his head against the edge of the bed, so that the outflung dead hand of Archelaus almost touched his white hair.

Ishmael went down to the four-acre with Nicky to see the men at work, and Jim, who for days had been on the tiptoe of excitement over the advent of \"the machine,\" as the binder was always called, ran in front of them. The men had cleared a path some five feet wide all round the field with their scythes, and now the clattering thing, crimson painted, blatant, was going on with the work, and the great square of oats and barley stood up...", "...steps I pass out of Yosemite shadows. AN AFFAIR OF THE MISTY CITY I. WHAT THE MOON SHONE ON She was a smallish moon, looking very chaste and chilly and she peered vaguely through folds of scurrying fog. She shone upon a silent street that ran up a moderate hill between far-scattered corporation gas-lamps--a street that having reached the hill top seemed to saunter leisurely across a height which had once been the most aristocratic quarter of the Misty City; the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was still pathetically respectable, and for three squares at least its handsome residences stared destiny in the face and stood in the midst of flower-bordered lawns, unmindful of decay. Its fountains no longer played; even its once pampered children had grown up, and the young of the present generation were of a different cast; but the street seemed not to heed these changes; indeed it was growing a little careless of itself and needed replanking. Was it a realization of this...", "...a large number of its adverbs, are well preserved in the Icelandic. And had we no history to trace our national origin, the body of philological testimony, which can be appealed to, would be conclusive of the general question. [1] Forster. Does Asia offer similar proofs of the original identity, or parentage of its languages with America? This cannot be positively asserted. But while there is but little analogy in the sounds of the lexicography, so far as known, it is in this <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the globe, that we perceive resemblances in some words of the Shemitic group of languages, positive coincidences in the features of its syntax, and in its unwieldy personal and polysyllabical and aggregated forms; and the inquiry is one, which may be expected to produce auspicious results. On the assumption of their Asiatic origin, therefore, it is evident that the Indian tribes are of far greater antiquity than the Anglo Saxon. Not only so, but they appear on philological...", "...inconvenience, except that in a short time a few adventurous mosquitoes--probably sea-faring ones--came down out of the woods and attacked their bare bodies so vigorously that they were fain to hurry on their clothes again before they were quite dry. The clouds began to clear away soon after they landed, and the brilliant light of the southern constellations revealed to them dimly the appearance of the coast. It was a low sandy beach skirting the sea and extending back for about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile in the form of a grassy plain, dotted here and there with scrubby underwood. Beyond this was a dark line of forest. The light was not sufficient to enable them to ascertain the appearance of the interior. Barney and Martin now cast about in their minds how they were to spend the night. \"Ye see,\" said the Irishman, \"it's of no use goin' to look for houses, because there's maybe none at all on this coast; an' there's no sayin' but we may fall in with savages--for them...", "...down the lower Colorado River, from Needles to the head of the Gulf of California. This had been in comparatively quiet water all the way, with nothing much to look out for save the tidal bore at the lower end. As I had never been above the Dalles on the lower Columbia, I had very little idea of what I would encounter in the way of rapids. I knew that there were locks by which the Dalles and Cascades could be passed, but as the combined fall at these points accounted for only about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of that between the Snake and tide-water, it was certain there must still be some very swift rapids to run. That there had at times been a steamer service maintained from the Snake down meant that there must be some sort of a rock-free channel through all of the riffles; but it did not necessarily mean that these were runnable in a small boat. A properly handled stern-wheeler can be drifted down and (by means of line and capstan) hauled up rapids where not even a high-powered...", "...white dog and held him close. \"Good-bye, Patch,\" she whispered. \"Good-bye.\" She kissed the rough white head and put him down tenderly.

In reviewing the situation, they have had no reason to regret their course, feeling that their determination to push their cause, and accept help from whatever <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> it was proffered, aroused lukewarm friends to action, who, though hostile at first to the help of Democrats, soon came to appreciate the difficulty of carrying on a movement with the press, pulpit, politicians, and philanthropists all in the opposition.

After an hour of this work he was relieved by one of the other men, and took his turn of the lighter work of keeping back the cows.

So the work went on until the herd had all passed through the yard, and the calves been branded. Then there was a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour's rest while another herd was driven up, and the work recommenced. By nightfall some nine thousand animals had passed through the yard, and nearly four thousand calves had been branded.

But he didn't. He said fish. No doubt Thomas Trotter was in a bad humour also. He was a very sensible young man, and there was no reason why he should be jealous of Stuyvesant Smith-Parvis. He had it from Miss Emsdale herself that she loathed and despised the fellow. And yet he saw red when she passed him a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour before with Stuyvesant at her side. For some time he had been harassed by the thought that if she had not caught sight of him as she left the car, the young man's offer of assistance might not have been spurned. In any event, there certainly was something queer afoot. Why was she driving about with Mrs. Smith-Parvis,--_and_ Stuyvesant,--as if she were one of the family and not a paid employe?

Something else caught my eye. Just beyond the horses, at the edge of some timber, was a large body of objects advancing vaguely in the dusky dawn toward our stock and in the direction of Adobe Walls. Though keen of vision, I could not make out what the objects were, even by...", "...time we had landed and found the sheikh waiting for us near his white-domed well, they came running back--the whole crowd of them--every man with a rifle and a bag of cartridges.

In the year 1898 there was a similar riot in Wilmington, N. C., and several thousand Negroes were either ejected or left afterwards in terror. The trouble here began in excitement over the elections. By far the most serious of these occurrences was the so-called race riot at Atlanta, September 22, 1906, caused primarily by that intense hostility to the Negroes which is to be found among town youths; and secondarily by...", "...junior by a year, Mrs. Norton (1808-1876), were both writers of facile and elegant verse, with the Irish note of easy melody.

In 1999, Sudan began exporting crude oil and in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of 1999 recorded its first trade surplus, which, along with monetary policy, has stabilized the exchange rate. Increased oil production, revived light industry, and expanded export processing zones helped sustain GDP growth at 6.1% in 2003 and 7% in 2004.

They met the king's daughter, who asked one of the masons to stay, the one who appeared to be the eldest, and asked him whether he could make so small a hole in the tower that a plate of food and a bottle of wine could be passed through, and which could not be noticed by any one. \"To be sure,\" said the grey old mason, \"I can and I will make it.\" The hole was ready in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour; the king's daughter paid the mason handsomely and hurried home. At sunset, among a large crowd of people, the secret-keeping lad was conducted into the stone structure, and after all his misdeeds had been once more enumerated he was walled in. But the king's daughter did not allow him to suffer either hunger or thirst, she visited her sweetheart three times every day; and brought him books for which he asked. The king sent every third day his secretary to look...", "...\"It'll take a bigger one than that for me,\" he said. \"To-night's Friday--they'll be havin' the funeral on Sunday.\" At the corner he dropped the letter into the box on the lamp-post, just as there came a weird shriek from an impatient tug in the river far behind him. While he was waiting for a cable-car a lame newsboy limped up to him and proffered the evening papers with a beseeching look. Malone felt in his pocket and found only two coins, a nickel and a quarter. He gave the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to the newsboy. Then he lifted himself painfully on the rear platform of a cable-car, and handed the nickel to the impatient conductor. The car clanged forward again; and soon the halo about its colored lamp faded away in the murky distance. (1895.)

The old-fashioned keelman began his week on Saturday afternoon. He washed himself thoroughly, and then appeared dressed in a white flannel coat with horn buttons, loose knee-breeches, and blue worsted stockings. He it was, and not the pitman, who had a chaste fancy in the matter of bulldogs, and he rather liked seeing those interesting animals fight. He himself liked fighting too, and the keelmen's <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> on a Saturday night used to be a very warlike region; for champions from the various streets fought for the honour of their respective districts, and the women encouraged the combatants with much energy and enthusiasm. When the new police-force was organized, it was as much as a constable's life was worth to venture alone into Sandgate on a Saturday evening; but the place is more civilized now. After the Saturday's drinking bout and incidental combat the keelman had Sunday in...", "...tendency is to aggravate it, that it increases wealth with the one hand, but increases want with the other, so that civilization has developed into a purely upper-class feast, where the rich are grossly overfilled with good things, and the poor are sent always emptier and emptier away.

Each and all of these things have excited hopes of introducing an era of popular improvement, and each and all of them have left these hopes unfulfilled.

The second entry is \"profits and issues of the manor,\" and is headed \"account of the manor for 83 days,\" but the similarity of the figure with that of the earlier date makes it hard to believe that the \"profits\" relate to less than one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the year.

This was confirmed by many more of the officers there, with whom I had a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour's conversation, and they all estimated the number of the slain at above six thousand, which may probably be accounted for in the following manner, but a demonstration is impossible. Some assert that there were eight hundred Swiss soldiers in the _chateau_ of the _Tuileries_; others but five hundred: let us take the medium of six hundred and fifty.

It has, however, in addition, two tubes, an inch and a quarter long and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch in diameter, running parallel to the floor of the inhaler. These tubes, being placed above and to the sides of the inspiring valve, admit two small streams of fresh air, which to a great extent are inspired unmixed with the vapour of the anodyne.

The meeting was then organized, and waited till <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past seven, when it was moved to adjourn to Tammany Hall. There it was again organized, and a gentleman was about to address the crowd, when a man stepped forward to the president, and stated that the meeting announced to be held in Clinton Hall was at that moment under full headway in Chatham Street Chapel.

They included canned vegetables, potatoes, hominy, rhubarb, pemmican, tea, and coffee. Strange to say, after the lapse of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, many of these supplies were still in good condition, and some of them were eaten with relish by various members of our party.

The best and most agreeable way to reach Clonmacnois is from Athlone. It is twelve English miles from Athlone by road, and ten by river. By river is not only the cheapest way but the most interesting. Sails can be used on this part of the Shannon almost as well as on Loch Ree, for the banks are so low that every breeze that blows can be fully utilised; and the river is so crooked, that no matter from what <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> the wind comes it can sometimes fill the sail. The Shannon here is no tiny stream like the Liffey, but a wide river, never less than from 150 to 200 yards in breadth, and generally deep enough to float a small ocean steamer. The current is, however, not rapid. The first thing that strikes the stranger who sees Clonmacnois for the first time is the extraordinary view from it over the largest extent of callow meadows to be seen in any part of Ireland.

They indemnified themselves for their exertions to keep order, which was not kept, by the extortion which they practised in the name of the government which they represented; and thus deservedly made the English rule more than ever detested. Instead of receiving payment, they were allowed while deputies what was called \"coyne and livery\"; that is to say, they were allowed to levy military service, and to <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> their followers on the farmers and poor gentlemen of the pale; or else to raise fines in composition, under pretence that they were engaged in the service of the crown. The entire cost of this system was estimated at the enormous sum of a hundred pounds a day.[296] The exactions might have been tolerated if the people had been repaid by protection; but forced as they were to pay black mail at the same time to the Irish borderers, the double burdens had the effect of driving...", "...blade.

In fact, rumors were current that Yan Kazimir had set out from Lvoff with the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> soldiers and the Tartars. But Karl's reckonings deceived him. Yan Kazimir preferred to await the junction of the armies and the arrival of the Lithuanians under Sapyeha. Delay was his best ally; for he was growing daily in strength, while Karl was becoming weaker. \"That is not the march of troops nor of an army, but a funeral procession!\" said old warriors in Yan Kazimir's suite. Many Swedish officers shared this opinion. Karl Gustav however repeated still that he was...", "...should be chosen for drying when possible, as sweet apples and early varieties are not so well adapted to the purpose. The Northern Spy, the Baldwin and the Ben Davis give a good-flavored dried product. Most early varieties lack sufficient firmness of texture for the best results. On the other hand, some comparatively early kinds, such as Gravenstein and Porter, are considerably prized in some sections. To prepare them for drying, apples are peeled, cored, trimmed and sliced one <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch thick. Be sure to cut out all worm holes, decayed spots and other blemishes. Defects are easily cut out with an ordinary straight-back, sharp-pointed knife having a blade two and a half to three inches long.

After all the apples are prepared, remove surplus moisture and put on trays, water-bath drier or whatever...", "...and maybe known by the land on the sea-coast, which is nearly level, and of a moderate height; in general higher than it is farther inland, with steep rocky cliffs next the sea, which have the appearance of a long island lying close under the shore.

To sail into it the southern shore should be kept on board, till the ship is within a small bare island, which lies close under the north shore; within this island the deepest water on that side is seven fathom, shallowing to five a good way up. At a considerable distance from the south shore there is a shoal, reaching from the innersouth point quite to the head of the harbour; But over towards the north and north-west shore there is a...", "...'Thank you.

A new assistant of mine--stupid fellow--I am going to get rid of him at once. Thank you, thank you.' Notwithstanding that half-crown the incident was, of course, talked of through the house before a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour had elapsed. Next day it was the gossip of the suburbs; and the day after the city itself heard the story. People were alarmed and scandalised. Why, such a chemist was a public danger! One lady declared that he ought at once to be 'struck off the roll!' And so in a sense he was. Another month and the flowery, bowery little suburb knew him no more. He hid himself in a great town, living on the wreck of his fortune whilst he sought a place as an assistant. A leaky...", "...cool, and cautious too; Like the good men of the north.

He then tells us that the alarm has been caused by a German detachment attacking suddenly the Spanish troops in the city, and that the Spaniards are running away. In a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour the noise has ceased, and quiet is entirely re-established. The advocate complimented me upon my coolness, got into bed again, and was soon asleep. As for me, I was careful not to close my eyes, and as soon as I saw daylight I got up in order to perform certain ablutions and to change my shirt; it was an absolute necessity.

At a quarter to seven the troops went over the top. The barrage went first, a dense gray veil. Then came twelve French tanks. Just behind the tanks stalked the doughboys.

The market value of land, also, had increased, even as early as 1888, on the average of five or sixfold.

I know where the blow comes from. The new town hates us.\" She guessed rightly. The sudden unpopularity of the Rougons was the work of a group of lawyers who were very much annoyed at the importance acquired by an old illiterate oil-dealer, whose house had been on the verge of bankruptcy. The Saint-Marc quarter had shown no sign of life for the last two days. The inhabitants of the old <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and the new town alone remained in presence, and the latter had taken advantage of the panic to injure the yellow drawing-room in the minds of the tradespeople and working-classes. Roudier and Granoux were said to be excellent men, honourable citizens, who had been led away by the Rougons' intrigues. Their eyes ought to be opened to it.

His conscience pricked him slightly on account of the exaggeration in which he had mischievously indulged, but he told himself that Roger would be far better off in the city and his mother's consent would make his going much less difficult. He also realised that if Roger were there to amuse Barbara, Eloise might have more spare time than she would otherwise. He stopped long enough to give the druggist a bad <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, and then went back to the beach.

But the guns were being steadily served with terrible effect; the few poor wretches who reached the deck were bayoneted, and in how long or how short a time I cannot tell, for everything seemed to be swept away in the excitement; we steamed away out of the smoke into the ruddy sunset, and there I saw in one place a mass of tangled bamboo and matting, with men clustering upon it, and crowding one over the other like bees in a swarm. There was another mass about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away, and I looked in vain for the third junk; but a number of her crew clinging to bamboos, sweeps, spars, and what looked to be wicker crates, showed where she had been.

Animals used to running at pasture when transferred to stables with hard, dry floors are more liable to quarter cracks than those accustomed to stables.

A predisposition to <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> cracks exists in contracted feet, and in those where the toe turns out or the inside quarter turns under.

Two minutes of this and the thing was done. Or was it? Drawing one long deep breath, Johnny placed the film in the microscope-like affair, then started the mechanism.

Then he exclaimed, \"Hot diggity dog!\" After that, for a full fifteen minutes his thoughts were focussed upon the thing before him. In that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> hour he ran the film through three times. \"Nothing,\" he murmured as at last he sank into a chair, \"nothing could be half so marvelous!\" And indeed it _was_ marvelous for there, stripped of all the backwardness and timidity that so often hamper the speech of old men, were recorded the golden thoughts of one grand old man as he dreamed of the glorious pioneer days that are gone forever. \"I'll copy it,\" Johnny told himself, \"then I'll have it printed in the _Sentinel_....", "...It was very cold.

Frederick could tell Mrs. Courland little more than he had already told her; and she was impatient to reach the place of meeting that she might know what those wicked people really intended to do, and what other secrets they had to communicate; for she felt that this suspense and uncertainty were worse than the reality, whatever that might be.

It may be mentioned that the charge in the accumulators, when the experiments were commenced, was equal in amount to that at their termination.

The work transmitted from the steam-engine was measured every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour by a Siemens dynamometer; at the same time the intensity of the electromotive force given out by the machine, as well as the number of the revolutions it was making, was noted. It resulted that for a mean development of 4 mechanical horse power, the dynamometer gave into the accumulators to be stored up 2.28 electrical horse power, or 57 per cent. The intensity varied between 25.03 and 23.51 amperes during the whole time of charging. Of this amount stored up in the...", "...us with statistics which prove that the birth rate in any quarter of Paris is in inverse ratio to its degree of affluence,\" says G.

For 1,000 women from the age of fifteen to that of fifty, a very poor <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> gives 157 births; a rich quarter gives 47 births.\" And so it is the world over. The very word \"proletarian,\" as Hardy points out, means \"producer of children.\" The children thus carelessly produced undermine the health of the mother, deepen the family's poverty, destroy the happiness of the home, and dishearten the father; all this in addition to being future competitors in the labor market.

But the little cry and the subsequent scuffle sent him quickly in that direction. He saw Pansy struggling vainly to get away from a short, thick-set man with a red face and fishy eyes, who held her by one bare arm.

Who can doubt, for example, that if England were the colony of France, the latter country would be benefited by a heavy bounty paid by England on the exportation of corn, cloth, or any other commodities? In examining the question of bounties, on the supposition of corn being at 4_l._ per <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> in this country, we saw, that with a bounty of 10_s._ per quarter, on exportation in England, corn would have been reduced to 3_l._ 10_s._ in France. Now, if corn had previously been at 3_l._ 15_s._ per quarter in France, the French consumers would have been benefited by 5_s._ per quarter on all imported corn; if the natural price of corn in France were before 4_l._, they would have gained the whole bounty of 10_s._ per quarter.

I made an effort, and asked her if she would be the same when we were in bed.

Clara is the daughter of a retired Royal Navy Captain, who owns a large yacht, a cutter. She can take a large number of guests to sea, even more than the cutter in Marryat's \"The Three Cutters\". They use the yacht as a means of getting to a picnic spot on a beach, where they are met by even more people, including the new incumbent of the local parish, the family who own the presentation to the living, and a couple of Roman priests...", "...of men and manners in Rouen from the thirteenth century onwards. And I can close my tale of the most brilliant portion of Rouen's history in no better way than by suggesting to you something of the interest and the excitement created by a processional ceremony, which may itself be taken as typical of the people's life. From the earliest hour at the breaking of the dawn of Ascension Day, the whole of Rouen was thinking and talking of nothing else except the prisoner, and in every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city the interest in him took a different form. All the countryside of Vexin and of Caux had trooped into the town with women and children in their Sunday best. From the attic windows of the Rue de l'Epicerie girls in flapping white head-dresses leant across the road and screamed their good fortune to the neighbours opposite; for these were some of the best places to see the ceremony, and in 1504 the crowd who scrambled for them was so great that the roofs fell in.

It will be seen that the eye end of the opera glass is placed against the lens-board, one eye-piece in a slight depression around the hole through the centre, and by a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> turn the brace between the two barrels passes behind a projecting arm on the board, the focusing barrel resting in a slot in this arm, where it is firmly held in position by friction alone.

The concessions related principally to Church reform. The disunion of the Cabinet being thus exhibited, it was clear the Government could not go on without some material alteration in its composition. The King urged this and asked Melbourne from what <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> the necessary accession of strength was to be procured, and whether he could hope for it from the Conservative interest. He owned that nothing was to be expected from that quarter. It remained, then, that it was only from the more extreme party that their ranks could be recruited. To this the King would not consent, and he therefore imparted to him his resolution of placing the Government in other hands.[1] [1] [This account of the transaction is confirmed in...", "...with her face brightening at the idea. \"I presume it would.

With ringing shouts, on the third day of this butchery, the allied armies advanced in massive columns to storm Napoleon's last position. Under the eye of their beloved chief, the Old Guard fought with desperation, but it was all to no purpose; the great conqueror was defeated. A deep and rapid stream (the Elster) was behind him, with but one bridge. The Allies, who had carried the ramparts of Leipsic with a frightful slaughter, were now _pell-mell_ after the foe. No <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was given or taken. Thousands on both sides succumbed to the deadly thrust of the bayonet. The Allies, we must remember, were flushed with victory after victory. They had twenty years of cruel bondage to avenge.

The prison is situated in the southeastern <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city, near the river, and is surrounded by a high wall.

The jury retired to consider, and in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour returned with their verdict. The chancellor, after receiving it, put the usual question, what the prisoner could say in arrest of judgment. More replied, but replied with a plea which it was impossible to recognise, by denouncing the statute under which he was tried, and insisting on the obligation of obedience to the see of Rome.

Seven years later, when he was eighty-five years old, this last request of Daniel Boone was granted. Missouri, however, was not to be the final resting-place of the famous old scout and his wife.

From this point the journey was continued round the head of the Gulf. Numerous rivers were crossed, some of which had been long before discovered by exploring navigators, and others were now for the first time brought to light. Among the latter were the Gilbert and the Roper, both receiving names in honour of members of the expedition....", "...its maximum at the moment of the battle of Flanders, in which more than fifty army corps out of sixty-nine were pitted against the French, British, and Belgian Armies. Here also the method followed by Germany is easily comprehensible. At the end of October the Russian danger was beginning to become pressing, and it was necessary to win a decisive victory in the western theatre of the war. It was imperative to give international opinion the impression that Germany remained in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> mistress of operations. Finally, it behooved her by this victory to gain the freedom to transport a large number of army corps to Poland. We have seen that the battle of Flanders, instead of being a success for Germany, was a marked defeat. This defeat was fraught with results, and it dominates the present position of the German Army. The plans above described of the German mobilization, which had their justification in view of a prompt victory, were calculated to become...", "...never tire of even when it began to be told over again.\" XCIV BEGINNING \"TOM SAWYER\" The Clemens household went to Quarry Farm in April, leaving the new house once more in the hands of the architect and builders. It was costing a vast sum of money, and there was a financial stress upon land. Mrs. Clemens, always prudent, became a little uneasy at times, though without warrant in those days, for her business statement showed that her holdings were only a little less than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a million in her own right, while her husband's books and lectures had been highly remunerative, and would be more so. They were justified in living in ample, even luxurious comfort, and how free from financial worries they could have lived for the rest of their days!

This forecast attracted great attention, and has since been made the subject of very much bitter controversy, especially since the fall in prices was much more rapid than I then thought it could be, and was carried to a much lower point than any one could have then anticipated.

About a quarter of a mile from the western side of the whole abyss is a small conical mountain, about 1,000 feet high, which looks as if it had once stood free but were now nearly smothered by the petrifaction of the overflowing water. It rises above the level top of the cliffs, and has about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile of abyss on one side, which is only 300 feet in depth, and half a mile on the other. It is all wooded. The larger side and the upper plain is called Derbat, and the smaller Merbat or Merga.

The windows, of which those on the north have been restored, have already been described. The end windows, which are of great size, are of later date; that to the east has a look of Transition work about it. The building was finished in 1349, and the east window was inserted by Bishop Barnet, _circa_ 1373. For a possible explanation of the insertion of this window, only a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century after the completion of the chapel, see _ante_, p. 52.

He believes every shot from the tee to the hole ought to be of equal importance, but in the case of the majority of the courses this is not so. Despite the fact that on the tee the man has everything in his favour, a perfect stance and a teed-up ball, he is given more space to play into and a greater margin for inaccuracy than in the case of any other shot.

One of the most characteristic sights of Charleston is to be seen between six and nine o'clock in the morning, in and about market Hall, in Meeting street, near the Bay. The Hall is a fine building in temple form, with a lofty portico in front, and a row of long, low sheds in the rear. There is nothing picturesque in the country around about Charleston. On the contrary, it is low, flat and uninteresting. Looking across the Ashley River, which is more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile wide here, there is on the opposite side a long, low line of nearly dead level, with occasional sparse pine forests, interspersed with fields of open sand. There are no palmettoes, but here and there are gigantic oaks, hung with pendants of gray Spanish moss, and occasional green spikes of the Spanish bayonet. The view across the Cooper is very similar. Large extents of country in the neighborhood of Charleston, especially that lying along the streams, and stretching...", "...on his legs. This condition was attributed to his fatigues and exposure in a hard climate, and to his habit of drinking warm barley-water in the morning.

But the young gentlemen were all so merry and the watch was so cold that it consented to taste the punch and presently left Dunquerque in the hands of the Allies and marched off warmer in mind and body to a quieter <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the ancient borough of Curtain Wells. I am sorry to add that, in passing the door of the Great House, they so far forgot their standing orders as to cry with enormous fervour the hour and the weather exactly underneath Mr. Ripple's window. With the departure of the watch, peace fell upon the company for a while; a dice box was produced and some packs of cards, but play lasted a very short time and was voted too confoundedly dull for so joyful an evening. So more songs...", "...literally poured into the boat. After several narrow shaves we regained Galata Bridge, but instead of returning to the same jetty, I decided to cross under the bridge, and disembark the other side. This we did without mishap. Rendered bold by disaster, we were rash to the point of recklessness, and I set out to get a carriage, leaving the others by the quay. This I did by haranguing an Armenian driver in broken Turkish and German. He was to drive us back to the Arc Serai, a military <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> not far from Psamatia. The others clambered in with me. We left Castell to do as he liked with the boat. Short of encumbering our English friends there was nowhere to go, although we had been assured there would be when we started, and we all realized only too well the double difficulty of making the opportunity of getting out of the house coincide with that of getting right away. We thanked Castell and said \"good-bye.\" I first took the precaution to indicate the line of...", "...pools, free of vegetation, and of varying dimensions. They might have an area of a couple or a couple of dozen yards. The frog was swished out into these open spaces, and if a bass was there, well and good. The fish was not allowed more than five minutes to make up his mind, and if nothing happened the bait was withdrawn and hurled elsewhere.

But after a quarter of an hour with the frog, Ben pronounced the absolute uselessness of remaining any longer. While he was operating I had fixed up my most useful portmanteau-rod with its fly-fishing tops, and with a sea-trout collar, and a small, silver-bodied salmon fly cast over the open spaces. This was no more successful than the frog, and we, as a matter of fact, caught nothing at all that evening. These...", "...on to the spot where Dick had seen the thing squatting.

The imprints somewhat resembled those of a thick-toed bird, but were immensely larger than the spoor of any known bird, measuring exactly three feet nine and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> inches from the back of the heel to the front of the middle claw--which seemed to be some six inches longer than the two others--and two feet two inches across from one outer claw to the other; the indent showing that the middle claw was fourteen inches long. \"Gosh!\" exclaimed Earle excitedly, as he rose to his full height after having made a careful figured drawing of the impression in his pocket-book--\"what would I not give for enough plaster of paris to make a cast of...", "...and east half of southwest quarter of section 16; north half, north half of southeast quarter and north half of southwest quarter of section 21; west half of section 28; east half of section 29; north half of northeast quarter of section 32; and north half of northwest quarter of section 33. _In Township 34 North, Range 5 West._ East half, east half of northwest quarter and south half of southwest quarter of section 12; east half of northeast quarter, northwest quarter of northeast <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and west half of northwest quarter of section 13; east half of northeast quarter of section 14; west half of section 25; south half of northeast quarter, southeast quarter and east half of southwest quarter of section 26; and east half of section 35. _In Township 32 North, Range 7 West._ West half of northwest quarter, west half of southeast quarter, and southwest quarter of section 3; all of section 4; east half of northeast quarter and east half of southeast quarter of...", "...afternoon, every day, three divisions were at liberty to go on shore and remain until half-past seven the next morning.

FERDINAND FREILIGRATH (1810-1876) [Illustration: FERDINAND FREILIGRATH] In times of political degradation the poets of Germany, turning from their own surroundings, have sought poetical material either in the glories of a dim past or in the exotic splendors of remote lands. Goethe, disquieted by the French Revolution, took up Chinese and Persian studies; the romantic poets revivified the picturesqueness of the Middle Ages; and during the second <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of this century the Orient began to exercise a potent charm. Platen wrote his beautiful 'Gaselen,' Rueckert sang in Persian measure and translated the Indian 'Sakuntala,' and Bodenstedt fashioned the dainty songs of \"Mirza-Schaffy.\" Freiligrath too, a child of his time, entered upon his literary career with poems which took their themes from distant climes. Among his earliest verses after 'Moosthee' (Iceland-Moss Tea), written at the age of sixteen, were 'Africa,' 'Der Scheik...", "...Tholomyes!\" exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine. And they burst out laughing. Fantine laughed with the rest. An hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It was her first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to this Tholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.

This cook-shop was kept by some people named Thenardier, husband and wife. It was situated in Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke,...", "...and that a cannon would not waken them; you know that Madame's bell can be heard at the bridge of Blois, and that consequently I shall hear it when my services are required by Madame.

The fair girl at length became quite angry; she tore the sheet of paper on which, in fact, the words \"Monsieur Raoul\" were...", "...was not all net. There was a constant ebb as well as flow, many returning to their native land, whether to enjoy the fortune they had gained or to lament that the golden pavements they had heard of were nowhere to be seen. The exodus of native-born to the United States did not wholly cease, though it fell off notably and was far more than offset by the northward flow. After all deductions, the population of Canada during this period grew from barely over five to seven {227} and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> millions, showing a rate of increase for the last decade (1901-11) unequalled elsewhere in the world. Closely connected with the immigration campaign was the Government's land policy. The old system of giving free homesteads to all comers was continued, but with a simplified procedure, lower fees, and greater privileges to the settler. No more land was tied up in railway grants, and in 1908 the odd sections, previously reserved for railway grants and sales, were opened to...", "...whisky before retiring;-- In the isles of the South, and on the firm land, where COTTON was king, and JEFFERSON, whose surname was DAVIS, was his prophet; where BENJAMIN, the finder of stray watches and spoons, and FLOYD, the spoiler, were priests--Oh, my soul, enter thou not into their counsels!-- Lo! it came to pass that there arose a great cry from among the people; A great and vehement cry, a wailing and roaring as of many of the chivalry when they burn with strong drink at <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> races, or smite with bowie-knives in a free fight around the court-house: The cry of many women and children, to say nothing of editors, politicians, dirt-eaters, and negro auctioneers: Saying, 'Lo! these many days have we been closed up by the Yankees, even like unto a pint of Bourbon in an exceedingly tight-corked bottle, so that nothing may go out or in, and who shall say what may be the end thereof?

The boiling stops; and the upper three-fourths of the flask are full of vapor. Squirt a jet of ice-cold water upon the flask, above where the water is, and the water below will instantly begin to boil. The reason why, is this. The vapor in the flask presses on the surface of the hot water. The cold condenses the vapor--turns it back to water. That takes off the pressure for the time; and then the hot water directly flies into vapor, and boils,...", "...by the Association. When such funds are in the treasury the Treasurer shall be bonded.

Even the natives are decimated at certain seasons by the most virulent fevers and dysentery. These diseases generally prevail to the greatest extent during the dry season. This district is particularly subject to severe droughts; months pass away without a drop of rain or a cloud upon the sky.

As Faith took her seat at the table she put her question. \"When did you come in, Mr. Linden?\" \"About a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour before you did.\" \"By which way?\" \"Why!--by the door. It is simpler than the window.\" The next few seconds seemed to be employed by Faith in buttering bread and eating it, but in reality they were used for carrying on a somewhat hurried calculation of minutes and distances which brought the colour in her cheeks to a hue of pretty richness. \"Did I run over anybody in my way?\" asked Mr. Linden. \"What gives the question its interest?\" \"I had thought you were...", "...oak plank and corkwood; carries forty-four guns, four of which are 100-pounders, quarter-deck and forcastle guns, 44-pounders; and further, to annoy an enemy attempting to board, can discharge one hundred gallons of boiling water in a minute, and by mechanism brandishes three hundred cutlasses, with the utmost regularity, over her gunwales; works also an equal number of heavy iron pikes of great length, darting them from her sides with prodigious force, and withdrawing them every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a minute!\" Fulton followed up the \"Clermont,\" in 1807, with a larger boat, called the \"Car of Neptune,\" which was placed on the Albany route as soon as completed.

Free government is government by consent; and consent is conveyed by the choice constituencies make of their representatives. In a local and circumscribed, not imperial question, legislation must, as a rule, depend on the consent of those concerned, as represented in Parliament. This argument is not conclusive against Coercion, because the Land League has not even an Irish majority on its side. But it might apply to the three <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> vote.[82] In a purely Irish question the {69} whole Irish representation might be swamped and silenced by half the House. I think the Irish might make some play here by insisting on the distinction between wanton obstruction--stoppage of imperial measures and paralysis of the House--and obstruction on their own exclusive ground.

The charge was a monstrous one; the accused had ample means to indulge every wish, and nothing short of lunacy (of which she never showed the slightest sign) could have induced her to commit so petty a theft. Her high character and the absence of motive combined to render it incredible, and, had she been capable of such a deed, she would not have courted detection by walking quietly past the shop, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour later, with the parcel in her hand. There were also strong reasons for thinking that the accusation was the result of a deep-laid plot. Gye, the printer, who lived in the market-place, was believed to be the chief instigator. His character was indifferent, and he had money invested in Gregory's shop; and the business was in so bad a way that there was a temptation to seek for some large haul by way of blackmail.

With one or two exceptions, my proposal met with general approbation. This said, Mr. Perry made a long speech, calling upon the company to sustain their character for loyalty, and to declare themselves church and king men; and he urged them not to tolerate any thing like republican or free principles.

They urged us to have a hunt in the morning, promising to get all done, so that we might be on the journey again by nine instead of seven.

Their whole population amounted at the time we have reached to about 1,200,000 whites and a quarter of a million of negroes; and this amounted to nearly a fourth of that of the mother country. Its increase indeed was amazing. The inhabitants of Virginia were doubling in every twenty-one years, while Massachusetts saw five-and-twenty new towns spring into existence in a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century. The wealth of the colonists was growing even faster than their numbers. As yet the southern colonies were the more productive. Virginia boasted of its tobacco plantations, Georgia and the Carolinas of their maize and rice and indigo crops, while New York and Pennsylvania, with, the colonies of New England, were restricted to their whale and cod fisheries, their corn-harvests, and their timber trade. The distinction indeed between the northern and southern colonies...", "...with hollows between them extended on all sides. The greatest elevation lay to the south in the form of a lofty, arched ridge, which we took to be about 500 feet high on the horizon.

Recovery was upended in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of 2000 with the outbreak of violence, which triggered tight Israeli closures of Palestinian self-rule areas and severely disrupted trade and labor movements.

In the meantime our main fleet continued to work in shore under a press of sail, and the French main fleet also gradually approached the detached ships. In about an hour we closed so near, that the French frigates made sail and commenced firing. We reserved our fire until within a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, when we poured our broadside into the headmost frigate, exchanging with her on opposite tacks. The _Sea-horse_, who followed, also gave her a broadside. In this way we exchanged broadsides with the whole four, and we had the best of it, they could not load so fast as we could. We were both ready again for the frigates as they passed us, but they were not ready with their broadside, for the _Sea-horse_, who followed us very closely, so that they had two broadsides...", "...but what is more deadly still, I was a gorilla and an assassin. And the next day I was elected. CHAPTER XXXIX. PUTTING JAZZ INTO THE CAMPAIGN I will go back and relate more details of my race for office. Having won the nomination, I thrilled with pleasure and excitement, but I was at a loss as to how to begin my campaign for election. Should I hope for support among the white-collar classes in the \"swell\" end of town, among the merchants and mill owners or only in the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where the workers lived? The first act of a candidate is to have cards printed and pass them out to every one he meets. My cards bore my name and my slogan: \"Play the game square.\" I argued that the workers should take part in the city government. I quit the tin mill and went around making speeches. And as there were no movies, and the men had nothing to do evenings but listen to speeches, it was no trouble at all to find an audience. I learned that a politician or an orator...", "...and a long time before an adequate supply can be had, as it must be admitted, however reluctantly by those desirous it should be otherwise, that the African, as has been justly said by a Manchester merchant, has in all ages, in all parts of the world, been sought to raise cotton wherever it has been produced. Serious Contingencies and Uncertainty in American Cotton Supply In America there are several serious contingencies which must always render a supply of cotton from that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> problematical and doubtful, and always expensive and subject to sudden, unexpected and unjust advances in prices. In the first place, the land is purchased at large prices; secondly, the people to work it; thirdly, the expense of supporting the people, with the contingencies of sickness and death; fourthly, the uncertainty of climate and contingencies of frost, and a backward season and consequent late or unmatured crop; fifthly, insubordination on the part of the slaves, which...", "...inventors of it, two Germans, Herren Lutz and Markgraf.

These posts are made fast to a rectangular iron frame at the top, from the four corners of which are chains supporting a plank about an inch and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> thick, all in full view of the audience. Curtains hang from the framework to about a foot below the level of the board; these curtains can be opened or closed by sliding them back and forth on the frame, rings being sewed on them to allow of this being done easily.

The conductor noticed me gazing at the portly form of the engine-driver, who had just jumped off. \"That is Hell Fire Jack.

Well, you see we had four stops to make in that 160 miles, and he didn't make 'em.

It has a pair of fore-wheels (the arms) and a pair of hind-wheels (the legs), though these have been reduced to only one spoke each, and swing only about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the way around and back again when running, instead of round and round.

As extra hand on deck I had to stand by and pay out the painter. In the middle of it came the skipper sliding down from the mast-head. \"Drop astern, boat and dory,\" he called out, and himself leaped over the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and onto the pile of netting as into the Johnnie's boiling wake they went. The thirty-eight-foot seine-boat was checked up a dozen fathoms astern, and the dory just astern of that. The two men in the dory had to fend off desperately as they slid by the seine-boat.

My surprise at recognizing an old acquaintance in the leader of one of these caravans may be easily imagined. He was a Shirazer, in whose society I had two years before visited the ruins of Persepolis, Nakshi Rustam, and that fair city which was the birthplace of the poet Hafiz. To have travelled a long time with a man is in Asia looked upon as a sort of relationship. The gossiping Shirazer was delighted to see me.

FORE QUARTER.--The fore quarter, as shown in Fig. 1, is composed of the neck, chuck, shoulder, fore shank, breast, and ribs. Frequently, no distinction is made between the neck and the chuck, both of these pieces and the fore shank being used for soups and stews. The shoulder is cut from the ribs lying underneath, and it is generally used for roasting, often with stuffing rolled inside of it. The breast, which is the under part of the fore <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> and corresponds to the plate in beef, is suitable for either roasting or stewing. When the rib bones are removed from it, a pocket that will hold stuffing can be cut into this piece. The ribs between the shoulder and the loin are called the _rack_; they may be cut into chops or used as one piece for roasting. 5.

For forty years lasted the war whose happy termination was not to bless the dying eye of Philip; which destroyed one paradise in Europe, to form a new one out of its shattered fragments; which destroyed the choicest flower of military youth, and while it enriched more than a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the globe, impoverished the possessor of the golden Peru. This monarch, who could expend nine hundred tons of gold without oppressing his subjects, and by tyrannical measure extorted far more, heaped moreover on his exhausted people a debt of one hundred and forty millions of ducats. An implacable hatred of liberty swallowed up all these treasures, and consumed on the fruitless task the labor of a royal life.

My Father maintained, however, the practicability of a boat being fitted out, in a manner sufficient for efficiency, in the course of a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour; and, when the idea was unhesitatingly objected to as an _impossibility_, he undertook to prove his assertion. A boat then hanging at the larboard quarter, empty, except as to oars, he selected for an experiment, and undertook, with the help only of the watch upon deck,--about sixteen hands,--to have that boat ready for active service within the space of fifteen minutes. To the due apprehending of this unprecedented undertaking, it will be proper to describe what...", "...COAST BETWEEN WESSEL'S ISLANDS AND CLARENCE STRAIT. In the sea that separates the land of New Guinea and the islands of Timor Laut and Arroo from the north coast of Australia, the winds are periodical, and are called the east and west monsoons, for such is their direction in the mid-sea. Near the Coast of New Holland the regularity of these winds is partly suspended by the rarefied state of the atmosphere; this produces land and sea-breezes, but the former are principally from the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> from which the winds are blowing in the mid sea. The usual course of the winds near the coast in the months of April, May, and June, is as follows: after a calm night, the land-wind springs up at daylight from South or South-South-East; it then usually freshens, but, as the sun gets higher, and the land becomes heated, gradually decreases. At noon the sea-wind rushes in towards the land, and generally blows fresh from East; at sunset it veers to the North-East, and falls calm,...", "...to some of us, that strange scene in which the dying man is far fuller of energy and vigour than the young king, and takes the upper hand of him, giving him a series of curt, authoritative commands, each of which he punctiliously obeys.

Then the prophet lays his wasted hand for a moment on the strong, young hand, and having thus either in symbol or reality--never mind which--communicated power, he says to him, 'Fling open the casement towards the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where the enemy's territory lies,' and he flings it open. 'Now, shoot,' and he shoots. Then the old man gathers himself up on his bed, and with a triumphant shout exclaims, 'The Lord's arrow of victory!... Thou shalt smite the Syrians till they be consumed.' That is not all. There is a second stage. The promise is given; the possibility is opened before the king, and now all depends on the question whether he will rise to the height of the occasion.

They passed out through the Needles passage together, 'Livonia' leading by about a cable's length. Outside there was more wind, with a good deal of sea, which did not seem to suit the 'Livonia,' for the 'Aline' slowly but steadily gained, and tried to pass her to windward, but this was denied. After a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour's jockeying the 'Aline' suddenly eased her sheets a trifle, put her helm up, and shot through the other's lee.

Had it been a less tolerable place, its vicinity to Sir Charles's house, from which it was but a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile distant, would have made it a very delightful abode to her, and she soon repaired thither. Great was the joy of the two friends at meeting. Miss Melvyn's situation at home was rendered as irksome as possible by Lady Melvyn's behaviour both to her and Sir Charles who, notwithstanding her ill treatment, was extremely fond of, and totally guided by her.

'Canary' possessed its own especial charac-ter, as Jonathan says. If it developed none of the highest qualities of its successful rivals, it became, after eight to twelve years' keeping, a tolerable wine, which many in England have drunk, paying for good madeira. The shorter period sufficed to mature it, and it was usually shipped when three to four years old. It kept to advantage in wood for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, and in bottle it improved faster. My belief is that the properest use of Tenerife was to 'lengthen out' the finer growths. I found Canary bearing the same relation to madeira as marsala bears to sherry: the best specimens almost equalled the second- or third-rate madeiras. Moreover, these wines are even more heady and spirituous than those of the northern island; and there will be greater difficulty in converting them to the category _vino de pasto_, a light...", "...minute is said to exist in the archives of repairs to the clock and figures in 1418. It is Mr. Roe's opinion that the defensive armour on the quarter jacks dates from the first half of the fifteenth century, the plain oviform breastplates and basinets, as well as the continuation of the tassets round the hips, being very characteristic features of this period. The halberds in the hands of the figures are evidently restorations of a later time. It may be mentioned that in 1907, when the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> jacks were painted, it was discovered that though the figures themselves were carved out of solid blocks of oak hard as iron, the arms were of elm bolted and braced thereon. Though such instances of combined materials are common enough among antiquities of medieval times, it may yet be surmised that the jar caused by incessant striking may in time have necessitated repairs to the upper limbs. The arms are immovable, as the figures turn on pivots to strike.

Four ounces of uncooked beans or six ounces of baked beans are as much as can conveniently be combined in the dietary, and these will furnish a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the protein of the ration.

On the side towards Craythew there was a gate with a patent lock, to which Lady Maud had a key. Mr. Van Torp was at the meeting-place at least a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour before the appointed time.

It was a splendid fight, but a losing one. Filmore was massing all its weight, wind and brawn, and Gridley lost the ball on downs. An involuntary groan went up from the Gridley spectators. Five and a half minutes left, and the ball in the enemy's hands! That settled the game.

The bounty of five shillings per <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> on exported wheat had given a great impulse to corn-growing, so that the acreage of wheat sown was much more than the country in an ordinary year required, partly, no doubt, because the bread of the poorer classes was largely made from the coarser cereals.

For about two hours, from half past one to a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past three, we both work away faithfully on our basket-making; and then as I finish off my last bottom I turn to my partner. \"Well, old man, the time will be here pretty soon; and I may as well get ready for it. I think I'll go over and wash up.\" So I raise my hand for permission; and upon seeing the Captain nod, as I suppose, I take Jack's soap and towel which we still use in common and go to the sink. On my way back, as I pass the Captain's desk, he stops me. \"Brown, don't...", "...locked up will, letter, power of attorney, and all.

Moreover, old Lindstrand's will was perfectly unequivocal, and contained none of those ill-natured restrictions about marrying or not marrying, or assuming the testator's name, or anything which could put the legatee to the slightest inconvenience.

Great was his consternation to hear the harsh voice of his equine friend in his ear. A whisper to Kage meant a roar to the crowd--\"Naruhodo! The stench of these humans excels even that of the stable. One is as much confined here as there. His lordship has now departed. Deign, Kakunai San, to indulge in amusement. Let's be off--to the Kwannon of Asakusa, to the Yoshiwara. Here there is naught but press and riot. In the pleasure <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> both convey diversion. Deign so to regard it.\" With wide open mouths those around turned to the quarter whence came these uncomplimentary terms. Kakunai was sweating with fear--\"Shut up!... Rude? Then deign to be silent. Great the press. To withdraw is difficult; to desert his lordship impossible. Silence is the part of the inferior.\" At this exercise of authority the horse grumbled loudly--\"Away from the stinking stable one feels gay and at ease.

The last accounts of him, after this, were too vague and too contradictory to be depended on. At one time it was reported that he had returned to the United States. Not long afterwards unaccountable paragraphs appeared in newspapers declaring, at one and the same time, that he was living among bad company in Paris, and that he was hiding disreputably in an ill famed <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the city of Dublin, called \"the Liberties.\" In any case there was good reason to fear that Irish-American desperadoes had entangled the wild lord in the network of political conspiracy.

Not a soul was in the place, not even a policeman. Presently a poor woman with a shawl over her head hurried past in the falling rain, and afterwards came the postman, who, very fortunately, had no letters for the door where I stood concealed in the shadow. The place seemed dark, mysterious, almost ghostly, in the dead silence of the night. The <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> chimed, but no person lingered at the gateway. Perhaps the advertisement had not been seen; or, more likely, \"White Feather\" was absent from London. At last, however, I heard the rattle of a four-wheeled cab outside the gateway. I saw it stop, and a man alighted. Then the vehicle moved on slowly, and again stopped, as though awaiting him. A dark figure in black overcoat and low felt hat loomed up in the darkness of the gateway, and entering the Yard glanced eagerly...", "...cries with laughter; they betrayed us to the Cossacks, those Greek Christians within our gates--the Zaporogians dressed themselves like Poles--we open the gates--the gutters run blood--oh, the agonies of the tortured!--oh! father!\" They hushed her cries.

The one we chose lies towards the south-east end of the island, bearing North 76 degrees West (true) twelve miles and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> from Fremantle gaol.

The following, likewise from Eumenes, exhibits the king as a party in the feud between the priest of Pessinus and his brother Aiorix. Beyond doubt both acts of Eumenes were included among those which were reported at Rome in 590 et seq. as attempts on his part to interfere further in Gallic affairs, and to support his partisans in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> (Polyb. xxxi. 6, 9; xxxii. 3, 5). On the other hand it is plain from one of the letters of his successor Attalus that the times had changed and his wishes had lowered their tone. The priest Attis appears to have at a conference at Apamea obtained once more from Attalus the promise of armed assistance; but afterwards the king writes to him that in a state council held for the purpose, at which Athenaeus (certainly the known brother of the king), Sosander, Menogenes, Chlorus,...", "...everybody scrambled aft into the elevated stern sheets.

Has your Grace decided? We come for your answer.\" \"Yes,\" said Lindsay, pushing aside Ruthven, who stood in his way, and advancing to the table,--\"yes, an answer, clear, precise, positive, and without dissimulation.\" \"You are exacting, my lord,\" said the queen: \"you would scarcely have the right to...", "...about them as exercise. Socrates, in particular, would have made quite a reputation for himself out of a three months' subscription to a telephone. Myself, I am, perhaps, too sensitive. I once lived for a month in an office with a telephone, if one could call it life. I was told that if I had stuck to the thing for two or three months longer, I should have got used to it. I know friends of mine, men once fearless and high-spirited, who now stand in front of their own telephone for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour at a time, and never so much as answer it back. They tell me that at first they used to swear and shout at it as I did; but now their spirit seems crushed. That is what happens: you either break the telephone, or the telephone breaks you.

Spinnakers were at once hauled out on the starboard side, both setting balloon jib-topsails and lowering foresails. Bowsprit spinnakers are more correctly to be termed balloon jib-topsails, the difference being that the balloon jib-topsail is hanked on the stay. 'Vigilant' drew ahead, and at 12.25 was a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile in front. 'Vigilant,' a quarter of a mile to the eastward, got a streak of wind and increased her lead, her balloon jib-topsail drawing well. At 1.30 'Vigilant' was nearly a mile ahead; she tacked round the mark 1 hr. 50 mins. 30 secs., 'Valkyrie' following at 1.59, when she was bothered by a small steamer. The 15 miles took 2-1/2 hrs. to accomplish, but on the return there was no beating to windward, a close haul with jib-topsails set. The windward work was again...", "...for two weeks this scene was enacted, to the vast delight of a simple, childish people. This is the reason why most clocks of the period had only an hour hand and stressed events of the calendar rather than pointing the flight of the minutes.\" \"It seems funny to think of clocks without minute hands, doesn't it?\" Christopher mused. \"Not so funny when you consider what life was at that time and how poorly equipped the public was in arithmetic. Many of them knew nothing of hours or <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> hours.

About 1724-1728 Dahomey, having become a powerful state, invaded and conquered successively Allada and Whydah. The Whydahs made several attempts to recover their freedom, but without success; while on the other hand the Dahomeyans failed in all their expeditions against Grand Popo, a town founded by refugee Whydahs on a lagoon to the west. It is related that the repulses they met with in that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> led to the order that no Dahomeyan warrior was to enter a canoe. Porto Novo at the beginning of the 19th century became tributary to Dahomey. Such was the state of affairs at the accession of King Gezo about the year 1818. This monarch, who reigned forty years, raised the power of Dahomey to its highest pitch, extending greatly the border of his kingdom to the north. He boasted of having first organized the Amazons, a force of women to whom he attributed his successes.

Being well mounted, and with superior weapons, they had a great advantage; but the Indians were inspired with a courage I little expected to witness. They rushed in upon them, cut their bridles, and dashed their spears in their faces; and seizing them by their clothes, hung on them, in spite of the cuts and thrusts of their swords, till they dragged them from their saddles. No <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> was given; the instant a robber was unhorsed he was speared; and before the tide of the fight had rolled on many yards, not one was left alive. Many of our party had fallen. Indeed I was surprised to observe, nor could I account for it, that the Indians took no pains to preserve the lives of the Spanish travellers, though they did their utmost to protect the Indian guides. The padre and two or three others alone escaped. The road below me indeed presented a sad spectacle;...", "...the Pope for the third time and forced the Romans to withdraw their claims. [Sidenote: Frederick and heresy.] Pope and Emperor also pursued a common policy against heretics. The Lateran Council of 1215 issued a series of ordinances against heretics, making it the duty of the secular power to punish them under pain of excommunication. But each country and even each city issued its own regulations for giving effect to the injunctions of the Council. Only gradually in the second <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the century was the old episcopal jurisdiction over heresy superseded by the establishment of the papal Inquisition. Meanwhile, in 1220 at his imperial coronation Frederick put out in his own name an edict for the secular suppression of heresy, which had been dictated to him from Rome. In 1231 this edict was enforced in Rome itself when Gregory IX established the Inquisition there and made it the business of the Senator, the head of the civic commune, to execute the...", "...A number of the men immediately went to his assistance and took them off the wagon and led them across to the sand bar. President Young went over in the boat and took the loading out of the carriage into the boat. The carriage was drawn to the sand bar by men with a long rope.

President Young then ordered that no more wagons should go over that way, but move up the river about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile and camp until morning. The camp was formed about 5:30 p.m. The river is not more than two feet deep, but there are a great many beds of quicksand which are dangerous to teams, and calculated to shake a wagon to pieces.

Many of the girls had heard of the newly discovered relationship between her and Madame Du Launy, and in the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> hour before school, the story of the discovery, with a few slight variations from accuracy, had been talked over very freely. When Miss South did not appear to take charge of the English class, most of her pupils assumed that she was no longer to be a teacher at Miss Crawdon's. They were therefore astonished when she entered the room, as ready to assume her school duties as if she had had no change of fortune. Yet, as I have said, Miss South looked a little worried, and her...", "...Illustrations. London: Routledge & Co. 1857.

The sea will not show its treasures in a quarter of an hour, or be made a sight of for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a dollar. An aquarium is not to be exhausted in a day, but, if favorably placed where it may have sufficient direct sunshine, and well stocked with various creatures, day after day developes within it new beauties and unexpected sights. It becomes like a secret cave in the ocean, where the processes of Nature go on in wonderful and silent progression, and the coy sea displays its rarer beauties of life, of color, and of form before the watching eyes.

Without speaking Thomas equipped himself and walked a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile to the lodgings of a married friend of his--a clerk chronically out of work, and too often in liquor. The wife received him with tears. After eight weeks without earning a penny, her husband had obtained the job of addressing five hundred envelopes, to be done at home and speedily. Tempted forth by an acquaintance 'for half a minute' as he sat down to the task, he had been absent for three hours, and would certainly return unfit for work.

Let's take our horses back to the next ravine, and come up here and watch the deer. They'll likely work this way before very long.\" After they had left their horses, Hugh took Jack up to the crest of the hill and pointed out the deer to him. They were feeding on a hillside, a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away, but their heads were pointed toward the Hole, and Hugh felt sure that with a little patience they would get a shot. They sat there waiting, for more than an hour, while the deer fed about, almost in the same place. At last the biggest of them raised his head and took a long look down the ravine, and then one to either side; then he started, walking slowly toward the Hole. The other two did not seem to pay any attention to him, but after the leader had gone fifty...", "...we had before tasted, and that we attributed this excellence to the dry method of cultivating it.

One of them was brought to us at Atooi, measuring eleven inches and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> in circumference, and having fourteen feet eatable. At Oneeheow they brought us several large roots of a brown colour, shaped like a yam, and from six to ten pounds in weight. The juice, which it yields in great abundance, is very sweet, and of a pleasant taste, and was found to be an excellent substitute for sugar. The natives are very fond of it, and use it as an article of their common diet; and our people also found it very palatable and wholesome. We could not learn to...", "...pools. I was, however, saved the pain of witnessing the sufferings of the animals; and I determined, if possible, to find an easier path down again.

All, then, was likely to be well.

I need scarcely describe how Manley and my fair young sister met, but it was very evident that they were not sorry to see each other. Rachel came out, beaming with smiles; and in a short time Pat Sperry appeared, followed by another person whom I was truly glad to see--Gideon Tuttle. The latter had joined Uncle Jeff some days before. Although desperately wounded, he had managed to make his escape, and had lain in...", "...nine fathoms long.

The lot was divided from the street by a low picket fence, and admission to the enclosure was gained by means of a small gate.

After this I felt that it would be unsafe for me to venture into that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the town again, and a few days later, finding that even in other sections of the city I was regarded with evident suspicion and dislike, I decided to leave the place and return to Pekin.

Their elephants of war were also to be all given up, and they were to be bound not to train any more. They were not to appear at all as a military power in any other <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the world but Africa, and they were not to make war in Africa except by previously making known the occasion for it to the Roman people, and obtaining their permission. They were also to pay to the Romans a very large annual tribute for fifty years. There was great distress and perplexity in the Carthaginian councils while they were debating these cruel terms.

Her husband often scolded her for it; but \"what's bred in the bone will come out in the flesh!\" At the jingling of the bell, and the somersault performed by her husband, Hildegarde, bewildered, and realizing that she had not time to replace the bottle of brandy in the cupboard, hastily put it on the floor between her feet, and then sat down, thus having her dear bottle in the place where the open air tradeswomen put their...", "...an hour at least; melted butter, sack and sugar is sauce for it; stick blanch'd almonds and candid orange-peel on the top, so serve it up. 145. _To make_ PLUMB PORRIDGE.

A few moments later Muller was in the street. He left the notebook with the commissioner. It was snowing heavily, and an icy north wind was howling through the streets. Muller turned up the collar of his coat and walked on quickly. It was just striking a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to twelve when he reached Cathedral Lane. As he walked slowly along the moonlit side of the pavement, a man stepped out of the shadow to meet him. It was the policeman who had been sent to watch the house. Like Muller, he wore plain clothes. \"Well?\" the latter asked. \"Nothing new. Mr. Fellner has been ill in bed several days, quite seriously ill, they tell me. The janitor seems very fond of him. \"Hm--we'll see what sort of a man he is.

And Rachel listened with languid curiosity; but that was all. She had put herself in this man's hands; resistance was at an end, and a reckless indifference to her fate the new attitude of a soul as utterly overtaxed and exhausted as its tired tenement of clay. \"Brook Street,\" said Steel, after a moment's pause--\"and double-quick for a double fare.

There was an iron chest, and two shelves filled with giant books; and there was nothing else in the room but a stillness, and a mouldiness of smell, that hung upon his spirits like pounds of lead, dragging them down, and freezing them. Yet, cold as were his spirits, the perspiration that oozed from the pores of his skin was profuse and steady during the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour that elapsed whilst he waited for the arrival of the worthy principal. During those memorable fifteen minutes--the most unpleasant of his life--Augustus, for two seconds together, could neither sit, stand nor walk with comfort. He knew nothing of the affairs of his house; he was not in a condition to answer the most trivial business question; he had heard that his firm was on the eve of bankruptcy, (and, judging from the part he had taken in its affairs, he could...", "...Italy. Silence that was something more than the wonted soundlessness of night; the haunting oblivion of a time long past, a melancholy brooding voiceless upon the desolate home of forgotten generations.

He speedily made arrangements for his night's lodging, saw his room, and went to the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the inn where dinner was already in progress. This was a building to itself, at one side of the garden. Through the doorway he stepped immediately into a low-roofed hall, where a number of persons sat at table.

We were wandering under the gloomy arches of the vast bazaar one day, and had reached the <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> where the Spanish Jews have their shops and collect their wonderful mass of valuables, chiefly antiquities, offering them for sale in their little dens, and ever hungry for a bargain. We strolled along, smoking and chatting as we went, when a Jew named Marchetto, with whom I had had dealings in former days and who knew me very well, came suddenly out into the broad covered way, and invited us into his shop.

There was a king named Glorious, and he deserved the name. His bravery kept the world from being overflowed, like the shore of the sea. In this king's city lived a great merchant, who had a daughter named Passion. Everyone who saw her fell in love and went mad with passion. When she grew to be a young woman, the virtuous merchant went to King Glorious and said: \"Your Majesty, I have a daughter, the gem of the three...", "...heel, \"I have _not_; I repeat, that other and more innocent hands than mine have done this deed.

Great architectural improvements were then in progress, which gave employment to a vast number of men theretofore leading a precarious life.

The Grand Opera-House arose over the _debris_ of the demolished houses,--the most magnificent theatre erected in modern times. Paris presented a spectacle of perpetual fetes, reviews of troops, and illuminations, which both amused and distracted the people. The Louvre was joined to the Tuileries by a grand gallery devoted chiefly to works of art. The Champs Elysees and the Bois de Boulogne were ornamented with new avenues, fountains, gardens,...", "...and laid it away with an air of finality which plainly said that she had found other and more pressing work to do.

Percy was already there, and paid us both many nonsensical compliments. Lady Desborough soon came down, and also expressed herself highly pleased with our appearance. She fully endorsed what Ada had said as to the value of the cross, and said that it was worth more than Ada had put it at, perhaps nearly twice as much. \"Now,\" she said, when Percy had gone out of the room to fetch something he had forgotten, \"I wish to give you a last piece of advice.

Now get busy.\" \"Oh, you're one of the mighty Stonewell's pets,\" muttered Bligh to Harry Blunt. \"Your bootlicking begins to draw interest.\" This uncalled for and unexpected insult was too much for Harry Blunt's uncertain temper; full of rage he jumped at Bligh and struck him...", "...the language in so short a time, I felt secure, and took to the paths that led to the Stone Age as a Dante without a love-affair to guide him.

Besides this, Siemens' electro-dynamometer and Ayrton's voltmeter were used to check the results; but there was no practical difference discovered. During the period of charging the accumulators, the intensity of the current and the electromotive force was measured every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour, and thence the energy stored up in the battery was deduced. It may be mentioned that the charge in the accumulators, when the experiments were commenced, was equal in amount to that at their termination. An experiment was made on 21st October to ascertain, as a practical question, what was the work absorbed by the Gramme machine in charging the accumulators. The work transmitted from the steam-engine was measured every quarter of an hour by a Siemens dynamometer;...", "...turning to the captain, \"I cannot advise; I am a man of peace, and unfit to hold a place in a council of war.

From his little camp in a neighboring garden, Hastings sent a party to arrest the sovereign. He sent on this daring mission a couple of hundred native soldiers sepoys --under command of three young English lieutenants. The Rajah submitted without a word. The incident lights up the Indian situation electrically, and gives one a vivid sense of the strides which the English had made and the mastership they had acquired in the land since the date of Clive's great victory. In a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century, from being nobodies, and feared by none, they were become confessed lords and masters, feared by all, sovereigns included, and served by all, sovereigns included. It makes the fairy tales sound true. The English had not been afraid to enlist native soldiers to fight against their own people and keep them obedient. And now Hastings was not afraid to come away out to this remote place with a handful of such soldiers and send them to arrest a native sovereign....", "...it would have been best to get her back to Red Willow County without waking her, and regretted having suggested the concert. From the time we entered the concert hall, however, she was a trifle less passive and inert, and for the first time seemed to perceive her surroundings. I had felt some trepidation lest she might become aware of the absurdities of her attire, or might experience some painful embarrassment at stepping suddenly into the world to which she had been dead for a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a century. But, again, I found how superficially I had judged her. She sat looking about her with eyes as impersonal, almost as stony, as those with which the granite Rameses in a museum watches the froth and fret that ebbs and flows about his pedestal-separated from it by the lonely stretch of centuries.

Certain of the accessory scroll-bearing figures, which keep, as it were, ornamental guard between the pictures, might possibly have been designed by Holbein, who is reported to have had a hand in the scheme; but they are at least as likely to be the handiwork of men unknown to fame. But, no matter who designed the glass, it is on a grand scale, and largely designed. It is not, however, a model of the fit treatment of glass, though it belongs to the second <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the sixteenth century. For the designers have been more than half afraid to use leading enough to bind the glass well together, and have been at quite unnecessary pains to do without lead lines. The windows vary, too, in merit; and they bear evidence, if only in the repetition of sundry stock figures, of haste in production. Still, they have fine qualities of design and colour, and they are, on the whole, glass-like as well as delightful pictures. We have nothing to compare...", "...eyes and nose. Badly used as he was, I must confess that the captain proved too generous to retaliate on that portion of his spouse where female charms are most bewitching and visible; still, I am much mistaken if the sound spanking she received did not elsewhere leave marks of physical vigor that would have been creditable to a pugilist. It was remarkable that these human tornados were as violent and brief as those which scourge tropical lands as well as tropical characters. In a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour there was a dead calm. The silence of the night, on those still and star-lit waters, was only broken by a sort of chirrup, that might have been mistaken for a cricket, but which I think was _a kiss_. Indeed, I was rapidly going off again to sleep, when I was called to give the key of the spirit-locker,--a glorious resource that never failed as a solemn seal of reconciliation and bliss. Next morning, before I awoke, the captain went ashore, and when his wife, at...", "...to grow, as I had noted formerly, they took care to have generally very much larger and taller than those which I had planted, and placed them so very thick and close, that when they had been three or four years grown there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the plantation. As for that part which I had planted, the trees were grown as thick as a man's thigh; and among them they placed so many other short ones, and so thick, that, in a word, it stood like a palisado a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to penetrate it but with a little army to cut it all down; for a little dog could hardly get between the trees, they stood so close. But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground to the right hand, and to the left, and round even to the top of the hill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves to come out, but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then lifted up and placed again from the first...", "...by, permitting the inmates of the prison to converse with and entertain their friends? They had hardly passed the prison before three horses, sleekly curried, and with ribbons tied to their manes and tails, were led past them.

This road was about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile in length, quite level, and lined on both sides with fine old elm-trees, giving goodly shade; it was used as a race-course; and the three horses were going down to run a _Carriera_ or race. Four horses were to run bare-backed, their riders being well used to dispense with saddles, and managing to guide them with a rope halter in lieu of bridle. The purse was four scudi, (four dollars.) Two horses were to run at a time, and the race was then to be run off by the two...", "...a dime novel. Three lone women who, for purposes of intensification, may be called enemies, staring with white faces at a wall of dirt, and trying to realise that a minute before it had been a black hole. And at the other end of that hole now were two men horribly imprisoned in a rock-walled tomb without air or food, perhaps dead. We could not tell how much of a cave-in it was.

I dashed up the hill a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile to awaken the night shift, who were in their cabin sleeping.

And it dawned on Archie that here was a little <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the world where he was wanted, where he was made to feel at home, where that gap in his life made no difference. It was a small quarter, covering scarcely more than a dozen blocks. It was filled with miserable buildings, painted garishly and blazing with light; there was ever the music of pianos and orchestras, and in the saloons that were half theaters, bands blared out rapid tunes. And here was swarming life; here, in the midst of death. But it was an important quarter...", "...she said calmly. The conventions are fairly strict in Maldivia.

Underneath the passion he was hard. He is the cruellest of men.\" \"I will see you...", "...the country we sought would be found. But for obvious reasons, how long precisely we might continue to float out of sight of land, it was impossible to say. Calms, light breezes, and currents made every thing uncertain. Nor had we any method of estimating our due westward progress, except by what is called Dead Reckoning,--the computation of the knots run hourly; allowances' being made for the supposed deviations from our course, by reason of the ocean streams; which at times in this <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the Pacific run with very great velocity.

Then he was off in pursuit, straight as a line for the river. There the hare made its first turn, Murphy being twenty yards in rear. He was running mute now, and both hare and dog were settling to their work--the one to escape if it could, the other to catch, if so it might be. They were through the far fence a moment later, and disappeared, only, however, quickly to return and take a line straight down this thirty-acre piece. It was a stretch of nearly a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile, and ere they reached the further fence Murphy was gaining ground. The hare doubled at the boundary, and then doubled again, making the figure of a giant eight on the glittering golden surface of the snow. Was the dog really gaining? It was a fine course. The hare was evidently a late leveret of the previous season; the dog was scarcely more than seven months old. How would it end? The Over-Lord stood and watched, determined that none should interfere. There should...", "...Moors are seen chasing the wild boar, while Spanish knights are in pursuit of the lion and the bear. In another part of the composition the huntsmen are seen returning and offering the spoils of the chase to their ladies. The Moor greets his sultana with a benign and condescending air, the Christian on his knees offers his prize to his lady. In the next picture is another hunting scene, with a page, with sword and shield, leaning against a tree, awaiting his master's return. In another <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of the picture his master (presumably) is rescuing a distressed damsel from a wild-looking creature who is quite undismayed by the tame lion accompanying his captive. Further on, the same knight is unhorsed and overthrown by a Moorish huntsman, two ladies from a castle in the background most ungratefully applauding the Christian's discomfiture. The pictures evidently were intended to record the incidents of a border warfare not dissimilar to those commemorated in our ballad of...", "...They passed log cabins and here and there pretentious frame houses standing back from the road in the shelter of oak and locust groves. Their passing was watched by curious women and children in dooryards and porches, while from the fields men waved greeting and farewell with the single sweep of a hat.

She did not seem either angry or astonished, but as far as I could judge was lost in thought.

I was referred to a fine old New England farm-house shining white through the trees a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of a mile away. There I met an ancient couple, a typical New England farmer and his wife; the old man, lean, chin-bearded, with keen gray eyes flickering occasionally with a shrewd humor, the old lady with a kindly old face of the withered-apple type and ruddy. They were evidently prosperous people, but their minds--for some reason I could not at the moment divine--seemed to be divided between their New England desire to drive a hard bargain and their disinclination to let the...", "...glances at the sea.

There, however--if we are to accept the generally received emendation of the text mentioned in the margin of the Revised Version--they found a bit of wall that had escaped destruction, and also probably the \"Ephraim Gate,\" which is not named here, although it existed in the days of Nehemiah.[176] Inasmuch as the invasions had come from the north, and the recent Samaritan raid had also...", "...Ratisbon in Bavaria, Bamberg, Middlebourg, Hall, Brunswick, &c. &c.

Clorinda, she confided to him, was the name of the injured heroine. The major, I imagine, had never read a work of fiction in his life, but he knew by hearsay that Madame Blumenthal's literature, when put forth in pink covers, was subversive of several respectable institutions.

That the great mass had become unmanageable, and was carried along by the impetuosity of the current, was plain enough, not only from the zigzag course it took, but from the wild cries and frantic gestures of the men on board.

It was raining in torrents when Father Hla['c]a, wet to the skin, arrived at his village on the 11th at seven o'clock in the evening. As he suffers from several chronic ailments--which was known to the lieutenant--this bad weather had a grave effect upon him. When he reached his house he went to bed at once with a very high temperature. After about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour the lieutenant appeared with two carabinieri and shouted at him that he must get up. This draconian injunction had to be obeyed, the more so as the lieutenant was labouring under great excitement. He looked at the priest's permit which allowed him to come back to the village, and said, \"If I were in your shoes I wouldn't venture to come back here.\" These words gave Father Hla['c]a an impression that his life was in danger. The lieutenant then ordered him not to go...", "...Culligore's feet sank deep into costly rugs as he moved about the office, peeping behind chairs, desks, and cabinets, and occasionally sounding the walls for hollow spaces. After an hour of intense and patient effort, he was forced to admit that he had exerted himself needlessly and that his impressions while standing in the basement could have been nothing but figments of his fancy. Finally he sat down in the luxuriously upholstered chair beside Starr's desk. His watch showed a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> past eleven, and he tried to reconcile himself to the thought that the only thing he could do was to go home and sleep. He was disappointed, for he had hoped that his search would yield some tangible results. He scowled a little as his gaze roamed idly over the orderly piles of papers on the desk. The ink stand, the paper cutter, and the pens were all of ornamental design. The only plain and undecorative objects in the room were the two telephones standing at one side of the...", "...forgot his wedding anniversary! He freed the half-choked puppy, and told his son what he thought. But Jacky, glaring up at the big man who interfered with his joys, told his father what _he_ thought: \"If I was seven years old, I'd lick the tar out of you! But I'm six, going on seven.\" Maurice, looking down on this miniature self, was, to his astonishment, quite diverted. \"You need a licking yourself, young man! Is your mother at home?\" Jacky wouldn't answer. Maurice took a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> out of his pocket and held it up. \"Know what that is?\" Jacky, advancing slowly, looked at the coin, but made no response. \"Come back to the house and find your mother, and I'll give it to you.\" Jacky, keeping at a displeased distance behind the visitor, followed him to his own gate, then darted into the house, yelled, \"Maw!\" returned, and held out his hand. Maurice gave him the quarter and went into the parlor, where the south window was full of plants, and the...", "...In the Baptistery we find what I may term a third essay in color, by weaving in rich, dark, and glowing colors on figures and bold sinuous forms of ornament in such a skillful and judicious manner that the whole dome seems to be alive with harmonies, although they are mostly primaries. As you know, rules for the disposition of color are futile, yet some details that struck me as eminently satisfactory may interest you. In all cases the tesserae are of small dimensions, about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an inch square. The stucco joints are large and open, surfaces far from level, but undulating considerably. The tesserae stick up in parts, brilliant edges showing. Absence of flatness gives play to the light. The gray of the stucco joints brings the whole composition together, serving as cool grays in a picture to give tender unity. Gold, apart from backgrounds and large surfaces, is used very cleverly in small pieces in borders of garments, and more especially in thin...", "...to live in a simpler style I don't see what business we have to try to stop it. As to the disposition of the parsonage, that is a matter of business which rests with the church to arrange.\" The nervous, irritable little man who had spoken oftenest rose to his feet and exclaimed, \"You can count me out of all this, then! I wash my hands of the whole affair!\" and he went out of the room, leaving the rest of the Board somewhat surprised at his sudden departure. They remained about a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> of an hour longer, discussing the matter, and finally, at Mr. Winter's suggestion, a committee was appointed to go and see the minister the next evening and see if he could not be persuaded to modify or change his proposition made in the morning sermon. The rest of the trustees insisted that Mr. Winter himself should act as chairman of the committee, and after some remonstrance he finally, with great reluctance, agreed to do so. So Philip next evening, as he sat in his study...", "...in his army, to be equally united in the Empire. Rebellion would then be the only punishable crime; loyalty, and especially the loyalty of his own officers, the only virtue to be rewarded. [Sidenote: Sec. 3.

The League demanded that Wallenstein should support his army upon supplies taken from the Protestants alone. Wallenstein asserted his right, as the Emperor's general, to <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> his men where he would, and to levy contributions for their maintenance even on the territories of the League. [Sidenote: Sec. 4. Wallenstein could not found unity.] For the first time for many a long year, a friendly voice had been heard urging the Emperor in the only wise direction. Ferdinand, turning aside from the promotion of a sectional policy, was, if he would listen to Wallenstein, to place the unity of the Empire above the interests of the princes, by resting it...", "...cover the potatos. Next, add another layer of mashed potatos, evenly and thickly spread. Then, more thin slices of beef, and then more potatos.

Now look at the pointed end, and you will see several deep scratches running lengthwise, and...", "...had accused him and Dan of hooking fried pies, it occurred to him that this was a vast improvement on being snubbed by strangers in the smoking-room of a hired liner. He was a recognised part of the scheme of things on the \"We're Here\"; had his place at the table and among the bunks; and could hold his own in the long talks on stormy days, when the others were always ready to listen to what they called his \"fairy-tales\" of his life ashore. It did not take him more than two days and a <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> to feel that if he spoke of his own life--it seemed very far away--no one except Dan (and even Dan's belief was sorely tried) credited him. So he invented a friend, a boy he had heard of, who drove a miniature four-pony drag in Toledo, Ohio, and ordered five suits of clothes at a time, and led things called \"germans\" at parties where the oldest girl was not quite fifteen, but all the presents were solid silver.

No father in all England could have behaved more generously to a son who had rebelled against him, and had died without even confessing he was wrong. As for himself, he had sworn never to speak to that woman, or to recognise her as his son's wife. \"And that's what I will stick to till the last day of my life,\" he concluded, with an oath. There was no hope from that <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> then. The widow must live on her slender pittance, or on such aid as Joseph could give her.

But the stars could be seen, and the only appearance of clouds was immediately above the circle of light. In a very few minutes the terrible truth flashed upon the mind of Glenn. The dim light along the horizon was changed to an approaching flame! Columns of smoke could be seen rolling upwards, while the fire beneath imparted a lurid glare to them. The wind blew more fiercely, and the fire approached from almost every <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> with the swiftness of a race horse. The darkened vault above became gradually illuminated with a crimson reflection, and the young man shuddered with the horrid apprehension of being burnt alive!

Harried by a sniping fire from the Sioux, the 2,200 soldiers, on <span class=\"clocktext\">quarter</span> rations because of insufficient supplies, and burdened with an immigrant train of 600 people and 120 oxcarts, had sweltered through a hot August day. Just as darkness was closing over the Badlands they discovered a spring on the northeastern slope of Flat Top Butte, only to have Sitting Bull, who realized their need of the water, suddenly pour in a heavy fire from the nearby hills.
