As the years went on and their little sect were permitted to indulge their peculiar notions, and the props of the State were not weakened nor the purity of religion vitally assailed, the Rogerines contributed their mite towards convincing mankind, and the Connecticut people in particular, that brethren of different creeds and religious practices might live together in security and harmony without danger to the civil peace. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years that Governor Talcott held office, 1724-41, the life of the colony was marked by its notable expansion through the settlement of new towns, [f] and by the dexterity with which its foreign affairs--its relations to England and its boundary disputes with its neighbors--were conducted. The last dragged on for years, calling for several expensive commissions and causing much confusion. The Massachusetts line was determined in 1713; that of Rhode Island in 1728; and that of...", "...seventeen of the fifty before 21. These last are thoroughly youthful in formula. We all go through the old familiar cycle, and Brooke did not take his youth at second hand. Socialism, vegetarianism, bathing by moonlight in the Cam, sleeping out of doors, walking barefoot on the crisp English turf, channel crossings and what not--it is all a part of the grand game. We can only ask that the man really see what he says he sees, and report it with what grace he can muster. And so of the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> earliest poems there need not be fulsome praise. Few of us are immortal poets by twenty-one. But even Brooke's undergraduate verses refused to fall entirely into the usual grooves of sophomore song. So unerring a critic as Professor Woodberry (his introduction to the \"Collected Poems\" is so good that lesser hands may well pause) finds in them \"more of the intoxication of the god\" than in the later rounder work. They include the dreaming tenderness of _Day That I Have Loved_;...", "...issued by the Company, inviting emigrants to settle upon the lands between the Hudson and the Delaware, attracted much attention in Europe. Committees were sent to examine the lands which it was proposed thus to colonize. The region between New Amstel and Cape Henlopen, being quite unoccupied, attracted much attention. A company, the members of which may be truly called a peculiar people, decided to settle there. An extraordinary document was drawn up, consisting of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> articles for the government of the association. In this singular agreement it is written: \"The associates are to be either married men or single men twenty-four years old, who are free from debt.

From that time the work has been increasing more and more, till it came to what it is at present. Now, suppose I had said, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years ago, looking at matters according to natural reason, \"the two Charity Schools are enough, I must not go any further;\" then the work would have stopped there. Or, if I had had a little more trust in my exertions or my friends, I might have taken at the utmost one or two steps further.

By careful rationing, he could probably stretch his food out to more than a month. His drinking water--kept separate from the water in the reactor--might conceivably last just as long.

Four days reserve--plus one is five--plus sixteen days normal supply equals twenty-one days to live.

O'Sullivan knew this. \"I'll take you on,\" said he to Mr. Butterfield. And so he did.

It carried passengers for $2.50 for the round trip. Few Northern New York folk along the road...", "...and when she did so, she accepted their proposal at once.

It was the property of her hosts, who owned, besides, about fifty acres of ground--a large farm in that locality, where ground is very valuable. The family consisted of her host, a fine specimen of the small Italian _proprietario;_ his wife, a cheery, talkative woman of about forty; and three daughters, from <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> to twenty-one, all lively, hearty girls, even more talkative than their mother. Here Sophy and her child took up their abode. She had studied Italian for the four years that she had had this journey in anticipation, and could write and speak it grammatically, although, of course, her accent was very imperfect. At first she was unable to follow the rapid conversation around her, but before long she was quite at home at it, and could talk away as fast as themselves.

To understand this latter part of the condition of affairs, it must be explained that, what in a wooden ship would be called the ribs, are, in an iron one, called the \"angle-irons.\" They are, in fact, strong angular bars, extending up and down the ship's sides like ribs, having a flat surface, to which the plates of iron are bolted.

Peter, for his part, was a good boy, and did his work faithfully. He staid with his master after his time was out. When Peter was about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years old, this good master died. He left to Peter about six hundred dollars in money for being a good boy.

Fully ninety-four per cent have struggled for land and failed, and half of them sit in hopeless serfdom. For these there is one other avenue of escape toward which they have turned in increasing numbers, namely, migration to town. A glance at the distribution of land among the black owners curiously reveals this fact. In 1898 the holdings were as follows: Under forty acres, forty-nine families; forty to two hundred and fifty acres, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> families; two hundred and fifty to one thousand acres, thirteen families; one thousand or more acres, two families. Now in 1890 there were forty-four holdings, but only nine of these were under forty acres.

After consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intact--that is to say, they believed they were lost. I asked if they did not KNOW it? No, they said, they COULDN'T absolutely know whether they were lost or not, because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before. They had a strong instinct that they were lost, but they had no proofs--except that they did not know where they were. They had...", "...plain, sweep away to the south, and melt into the \"Red Hills\" visited on our first excursion.

By one o'clock in the afternoon they had covered <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles and were within a mile and a half of their objective point. Suddenly in their front they heard the sharp reports of muskets; the firing grew in intensity: the advance-guard was evidently in contact with a considerable body of Indians.

The _Sirius_ started out with ninety-four passengers, on the fourth of April, 1838, and reached New York on the twenty-first, a passage of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days. The _Great Western_, also with a full complement of passengers, left three days after the _Sirius_, sailing from Bristol, and swung into New York harbor on the twenty-third, making her passage in two days' less time than her rival. Both were hailed in New York with \"immense acclamation.\" They sailed on their homeward voyage in May, six days apart, and made the return passage respectively in sixteen and fourteen days. The _Great Western_ on her second homeward voyage...", "...said his father, \"a swarm is so large that after hundreds of cart loads are taken from it, it seems no smaller.

He resumed the subject on the 15th May; and having discovered his former error, he recognised with transport the absolute truth of a principle which for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years had been the object of his incessant labours.

THE DESTRUCTION OF CARTHAGE.--It is impossible for us here to give the circumstances of the siege of Carthage. For four years the city held out against the Roman army. At length the consul Scipio AEmilianus succeeded in taking it by storm. When resistance ceased, only 50,000 men, women, and children, out of a population of 700,000, remained to be made prisoners. The city was fired, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days the space within the walls was a sea of flames. Every trace of building which the fire could not destroy was levelled, a plough was driven over the site, and a dreadful curse invoked upon any one who should dare attempt to rebuild the city. Such was the hard fate of Carthage. It is said that Scipio, as he gazed upon the smouldering ruins, seemed to read in them the fate of Rome, and, bursting into tears, sadly repeated the lines of Homer: \"The day shall come in...", "...were talking to --although maybe you've heard enough of me, though you never saw me till now.\" \"Without having that pleasure even yet,\" said I, \"it would grieve me to think you should be ill in the coach.\" \"May be it might,\" briefly replied the unknown, with a species of meaning in his words I could not then understand. \"Did ye never hear tell of Barney Doyle?\" said he. \"Not to my recollection.\" \"Then I'm Barney,\" said he; \"that's in all the newspapers in the metropolis; I'm <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> weeks in Jervis-street hospital, and four in the Lunatic, and the devil a better after all; you must be a stranger, I'm thinking, or you'd know me now.\" \"Why I do confess, I've only been a few hours in Ireland for the last six months.\" \"Ay, that's the reason; I knew you would not be fond of travelling with me, if you knew who it was.\" \"Why, really,\" said I, beginning at the moment to fathom some of the hints of my companion, \"I did not anticipate the pleasure of...", "...well as near within the round of existence.

BY JOHN HARFORD It was in the month of December, 1872, when I with <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> others left our good old port of Bristol bound for one of the West African oil rivers on a trading voyage. It was a splendid morning for the time of year: bright, fine, and clear, when we were towed through our old lock gates, with the hearty cheers, good-byes, and God-speed-yous from our friends ringing in the air; and although there were some of us made sad by the parting kiss, which to many was the last on this earth, there was one whose heart felt so glad that he has...", "...sent for a year to him. This led to Mr. Mayers being invited to dinner at our house. There he formed an attachment to Sarah, to whom he was married the following year, 1824. \"In the midsummer holidays, 1825, I went to pay a visit to Walter and Sarah, and it was then I first made acquaintance with John and Frank Newman. The latter was spending the Long Vacation with Mr. Mayers to assist him in teaching the young men, though he was only nineteen. Among these pupils was Charles Baring, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years old, afterwards Bishop of (the Palatinate see) Durham. \"John Newman walked over from Oxford to breakfast one morning: he was then twenty-four, and a most interesting young man; but him I only saw then once, whereas his brother (Frank) was our daily companion, and took great pains in instructing Sarah (Mrs. Walter Mayers) and myself in Political Economy. His talents and piety attracted my admiration, for I had never seen such young men before.

At that moment (it was <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> minutes past one in the morning) Lieutenant Bronsfield was preparing to leave the watch and return to his cabin, when his attention was attracted by a distant hissing noise.

They had not time to question each other before the hissing became frightfully intense, and suddenly there...", "...a hard time explaining why.

Some one remarked that \"certain beauties of Mozart's music had become stale with age.\" Another agreed, and added, \"I defy any one to listen to 'Don Giovanni' after the fourth act of 'Les Huguenots'!\" This vulgar compliment enraged Meyerbeer. \"So much the worse then for the fourth act of 'The Huguenots'!\" he shouted. Of all his own work this Jewish composer loved \"L'Africaine\" the best, and he made and remade it during a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years. In this he was the best judge of his own work; though some persons believe that \"Le Prophete\" is greater. Among Meyerbeer's eccentricities was one that cannot be labelled erratic.

His love of poetry as a thing apart from life is indicated by the fact that in old age, to forget the grief occasioned by the death of his wife, he gave the greater part of six years to a metrical translation of the Greek poet Homer.

To these they add several smaller vessels, that our fleet might be terrified by numbers: they man them with a great number of archers and of the Albici, of whom mention has been already made, and these they incited by rewards and promises. Domitius required certain ships for his own use, which he manned with colonists and shepherds, whom he had brought along with him.

The greatest part of the Moorish people fled to the mountains and the Sierra de Bernia, and resisted the arms of Charles, until the month of August, when they surrendered, after obtaining an amnesty.

The monks of Canterbury were still more luxurious, for they had at least <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> dishes every day besides a dessert; and these dishes were dressed with spices and sauces which excited the appetite as well as pleased the taste.

The Inquisition merely advised him and his companions to dress in a less extraordinary manner and to go shod. Four months later he was suddenly cast into prison; and, after <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days, he learnt that he was falsely accused of sending two noble ladies on a pilgrimage to Jaen. During their absence, from the 21st of April 1527 to the 1st of June, he remained in prison, and was then set free with a prohibition against instructing others until he had spent four years in study.

One is apt to expect little from a fat man; but that is often a mistake. Mr. Jacquetot weighed <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> stone, but he was eminently intelligent.

Murray had purchased for his master four score of sheep at the Falkirk Tryst, but having occasion to stop another day, and confident in the faithfulness and sagacity of his colley, which was a female, he committed the drove to her care, with orders to drive them home,--a distance of about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles. The poor animal, when a few miles on the road, dropped two whelps, but, faithful to her charge, she drove the sheep on a mile or two further--then, allowing them to stop, returned for her pups, which she carried for about two miles in advance of the sheep. Leaving her pups, the colley again returned for the sheep, and drove them onwards a few miles.

The cardinals, on appointing this Pope, bound him over to many urgent duties and stipulations, but he threw off these incumbrances as he would put off his cloak. He spent most of his energies in seeking and buying alliances in Germany and in selling offices. He also entertained the Emperor on a visit of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days, and showed him all the jewels. One day Paul II. was found dead in his bed in 1471, the popular belief being that he had been killed by a devil, which he was said to carry locked up in a signet ring; and this solution was entirely satisfactory. HOW POPE LEO X. WAS ELECTED (A.D. 1513). John de Medicis was elected Pope in 1513, and took the title of Leo X. He had been made cardinal at fourteen.

The 10th of the same month was to have witnessed the execution of the Prince of Conde, condemned as traitor and heretic.

She wrung her hands. Her tears fell unheeded to the floor. Mrs. Harland gazed at her both open-mouthed and open-eyed. Before she had recovered her presence of mind sufficiently to enable her to understand the cause of her visitor's emotion the door opened, and there entered unannounced--a magnificent woman! She was very tall, and very stately, and very fat. She weighed <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> stone if she weighed an ounce. Her costume was very different to that of the dowdy Jane. She was attired from head to foot in red. She had on a red stuff dress with a train. A scarlet mantle accentuated with its splendours the upper portion of her person. She wore a red hat, adorned with a red feather. And her face--as far as hue was concerned, her face matched her attire. She surveyed Mrs. Harland through a pair of _pince-nez_. \"Mrs. Harland!

A big, well-developed boy of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> was Lenny, dearest of all her children to his mother, her son and her latest-born, and the secret hope of his father's heart. \"Say--I'm awful sorry to be so late. Gosh! I ran all the way home. I thought you'd be on the late train, Pa, and I waited to walk up with you!\" said Lenny, falling upon cooling mutton, boiled potatoes glazed and sticky, and canned corn. \"Where did you wait?\" his father asked, laying one of his endless traps for an untruth. \"Bonestell's,\" Lenny...", "...Nicholson because of what he had done.

Winter's Tale. Our narration is now about to make a large stride, and omit a space of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years; during which nothing occurred of any particular consequence with respect to the story we have undertaken to tell. The gap is a wide one; yet if the reader's experience in life enables him to look back on so many years, the space will scarce appear longer in his recollection than the time consumed in turning these pages. It was, then, in the month of November, about seventeen years after the catastrophe related in the last chapter, that, during a cold and stormy...", "...This 'silk-cotton-tree' differs greatly in shape from its congener in Eastern Africa. The bole bears sharp, broad-based thorns; the wings or flying buttresses are larger; several trunks rarely anastomose; the branches seldom stand out horizontally, nor are the leaves disposed in distinct festoons. It is, however, a noble growth, useful for shade and supplying a soft wood for canoes and stuffing for pillows.

Now the unwholesome site has been abandoned. The island and station of St. Mary, Bathurst, of old a graveyard, now start up to starboard. The site was chosen apparently for its superior development of mud and mangrove, miasma and malaria. It is an island within an island. St. Mary the Greater is the northernmost of that mass of riverine holms and continental islands which, formed by the...", "...within this area, and were also concentrated in that half of the zone which extends along the Atlantic.\" On reference to a map, it will be seen that in the western continent the so-called zone is simply confined to the United States--the most densely inhabited portion of America. In like manner the eastern zone leaves out the whole of desert Africa, Lapland, Finland, the chief part of Russia, with an average of thirty-two inhabitants to each square mile; Sweden and Norway, with only <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> per mile; whilst it embraces all the well-peopled districts of central Europe, most of which, like England, are able to count between three and four hundred persons to every mile of their territory. In fact, Professor Shepard's statement may almost be resolved into a plain question of population, for were an aerolite to fall in the midst of a desert, or in a thinly peopled district, it is needless to point out how few the chances are of its descent being ever noticed or...", "...may not be possible for mortal man to teach truths as sublime as did the Christ, but if it be true that \"from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,\" then that father possessed a pure heart, certainly the daughter to whom the precious admonition was given was a worthy child; and the diligent practice of those celestial ideals made Tamar B. Young a lovable mother and a peerless wife. In conclusion, I will say that each of those three wives bore me seven children, making in all <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> sons and four daughters. They were all strong and healthy children; not a weakling among them. Moreover they have all made honorable and virtuous men and women. One of my sons, upon learning of the death of his mother, wrote: \"Oh, how thankful I am for my parentage; for the noble souls who gave me life! How I love them for the clean, uncontaminated body with which they blessed my spirit.

The high-spirited citizens, on being challenged in their walks, could not keep their temper; the roughs, here as in every place, would have their say; and the coarse British soldier could not be restrained by discipline; yet in all the brawls, for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> months, not a gun was fired in an affray. Fist had been met with fist, and club with club; and not unfrequently these quarrels were settled in the courts. The nature of such emergency as would justify the troops in firing on the people was acutely discussed in the newspapers, and undoubtedly the subject was talked about in private circles and in the political clubs. \"What shall I say?\" runs an article in the \"Gazette.\" \"I shudder at the thought. Surely no provincial...", "...dark, the Ramsgate lifeboat also arrived, and seeing the other two lifeboats alongside they anchored outside the sands. And the Kingsdown lifeboat, manned only by her coxswain and seven of her crew, was sheered off about two hundred fathoms, to lay out a kedge anchor, with a view to preventing the vessel drifting farther, as the tide rose, into the shallower parts of the sands, and in the hope of warping her into deeper water. Naturally the presence of the lifeboats and a company of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> or eighteen stalwart lifeboatmen, all thoroughly up to their work, infused fresh courage into the captain and crew of the Sorrento. They felt that all was not lost, and dividing themselves into different gangs of men, all hands worked with a will, throwing the cargo overboard to lighten the vessel, and pumping with all their energies--their shouts ringing out bravely as they worked to get out the water.

And how out of the same number four British only were stranded, while there were twelve American? Not a fourth part of the casualties amongst the British that there were amongst the United States ships; yet the Americans are an experienced, gallant, and well-conducted race of seamen.

Ten children had already been born to him, and four, including his two eldest boys, were in the grave. Thomas was now the future heir, and then came George.

George had been born on December 8th, 1608, and was now nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years old. He grew up a handsome lusty boy, and from his earliest years his daring and spirit had destined him to be a soldier. It was the career of all younger sons of metal, and few can have looked forward to it more ardently than George Monk. It was the tradition of his family. His uncle Richard had died a captain; his uncle Arthur had fallen in 1602 at the glorious defence of Ostend by that renowned captain, Sir Francis Vere. His great-uncle, Captain Francis Monk, had...", "...us pay the bill he grew half angry, and said, 'Do you think I am going to take money from your father's daughter?' and then I felt more willing to take it for papa's sake.

I used to watch the men and women going in and out, and envy them, thinking how sure they were of their wages; and yet it never crossed my mind that I could do the same thing. I am afraid it was unconscious pride which prevented my thinking of it. \"But the day came. It was in the early spring.

Count Theobald issued an order condemning the entire Jewish congregation at Blois to death by fire. When they were brought out to a wooden tower, and the fagots around them were about to be kindled, the priest begged them to acknowledge Christianity, and thus preserve their lives. They nevertheless remained steadfast to their faith, and were first tortured, and then dragged to the stake.

In 1882, when Mr Henry Fawcett, then in office, examined the subject, he found that the average number of policies of insurance granted annually during the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years which had elapsed was under 400--less, in fact, than during the first twelve months of the system. The purchase of annuities had increased slightly, but the business was transacted chiefly in immediate annuities, and hardly indicated any progress in provision for old age by means of early savings.

Of the outworks, the strongest were the grand battery at Lighthouse Point, at the mouth of the harbour; and that on Goat Island, a rocky islet at its entrance. The strongest front of the works was on the land side, across the base of the triangular peninsula on which the town stood. This front, twelve hundred yards in extent, reached from the sea, on the left, to the harbour on the right, and consisted...", "...I think they were executed just before his rupture with the Pope was known.

The manager, with the obstinacy of a conscientious man who had become obsessed with the pervading note of security, excused himself from discussing abstract methods of fraud.

It came, to be precise, on a certain Friday morning, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days after his first visit to \"The Safe.\" Returning late on the Thursday night, he was informed that a man giving the name of Draycott had called to see him. Apparently the matter had been of some importance to the visitor for he had returned three hours later on the chance of finding Mr. Carrados in. Disappointed in this, he had left a note. Carrados cut open the envelope and ran a finger along the following words:-- \"_Dear Sir_,--I have to-day consulted Mr. Louis...", "...Zeppelin crews killed a number of their own countrymen--the survivors of the sinking _Bluecher_--mistaking them for Englishmen.

On one occasion a Zeppelin hovered over a fleet of the latter craft which were lying in wait watching their deadly nets off the Shipwash. The Zeppelin dropped about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> bombs, some of which fell very close to the vessels, exploding violently and throwing up huge columns of water; but not a single hit was made and no damage was done. But the mines amid which their duties took them daily were a very real peril.

When, then, I reassert the opinion, heretofore expressed by me, that as the result of the superiority of free over slave labor, our wealth in 1870, and especially in each succeeding decade, as a consequence of the entire abolition of Slavery in the United States, will be far greater, notwithstanding the debt, than if the rebellion had never occurred, there is here presented conclusive...", "...that the wools are fallen from their stated values', so that export was prohibited entirely; and 13 and 14 Car. II, c. 18, declared the export of wool a felony, though 7 and 8 Will. III, c. 28, says this did not deter people from exporting it, so that the law was made more stringent on the subject, and export continued to be forbidden until 1825.[721] In a letter written in 1677 the fall of rents in England, which had caused the value of estates to sink from twenty-one to sixteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years' purchase, is ascribed mainly to the low price of wool,[722] owing to the prohibition of export and increased imports from Ireland and Spain. It was now, said the writer, worth 7d. instead of 12d., and a great quantity of Spanish wool was being sold in England at low rates. These 'low rates' were 2s. and 2s. 2d. a lb. for the best wool, whereas in 1660 the best Spanish wool was 4s. and 4s. 2d. a lb. We have seen[723] that Spanish wool was imported into England in the...", "...Earl of Inchiquin and his son were eventually ransomed for L1500, and Charles showed his weakness by indulging in the unfortunately widespread habit of trying to conciliate the \"Turks\" by presents of arms and ammunition, which everyone knew would be used against our own ships and men. From about this time forward the Turkish pirates seem to have generally kept farther out in the Atlantic. They were especially on the look-out for our Newfoundland ships. In 1677 six corsairs destroyed <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> of these, but one of the Turks was terribly mauled by a small English frigate, and only escaped by the aid of a dark and stormy night. Our watch-dogs were settling down to their work at last. The _Concord_ merchantman bound for America had a stiff fight with a Turkish squadron in 1678, 120 leagues from the Land's End.

At last, under direction from the captain, the lieutenant gave this order through the speaking tube: \"Have the men slide a torpedo into one of the forward tubes.\" Eager to witness this operation, Irving sprang to the stairway and was soon down on the lower deck. There he saw several members of the crew remove the safety attachment from the nose of a sixteen-foot phosphor-bronze torpedo, which was <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> or eighteen inches in diameter, and slide it into a tunnel-like hole in the midst of a maze of operating machinery. A minute or two later the order was given to \"shoot,\" and out it went, under initial propulsion from a compressed air engine.

But they are obviously not compelled so to remain together, provided that one of the pair on his final move does not break the condition of entering a cell already occupied. After the acute solver has noticed this point, it is for him to determine which method is the better one--for the two to be together at the count or to separate. As a matter of fact, the puzzle can be solved in <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> moves if the men are to remain together; but if they separate at the end, they may actually save a move and perform the feat in sixteen!

The encouragement of home industries by tariffs was definitely aimed at after the war with England during the Napoleonic struggles, and although a sensible reduction of duties was experienced after 1845 the reaction to protection that followed the Civil War was never significantly departed from except by the single act of 1883.

Slight reductions some <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years later were followed in the early 'forties by a tariff of 30%. Diminutions were succeeded by oscillations, though at no point was a low level touched.

The professional politicians foamed at the mouth. The yellow press shrieked and lied. The saloon-keepers and the sharers of their illicit profits wriggled and squirmed. But the saloons were closed. The law was enforced without fear or favor. The Sunday sale of liquor disappeared from the city, until a complaisant judge, ruling upon the provision of the law which permitted drink to be sold with a meal, decreed that one pretzel, even when accompanied by <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> beers, made a \"meal.\" No amount of honesty and fearlessness in the enforcement of the law could prevail against such judicial aid and comfort to the cause of nullification. The main purpose of Roosevelt's fight for Sunday closing, the stopping of blackmail, was, however, achieved.

Most of these have failed, but a canal from Porcal to Aranjuez, of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles and a half, is in working order. The canal of Cabarrus brings the waters of the Lozoya to Madrid. But the great enterprise of the canal of irrigation from the Henares, constructed by the same English company which made the canal of the Esla, and which was to have been twenty-eight miles in length, and to have irrigated 30,000 acres, is suspended by lawsuits as to the ownership of the waters.

Indeed, her very suavity and sweetness of manner was assumed, because it was so much more comfortable and effective to be agreeable than otherwise. She was now past <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years of age, tall and well formed, with a delicate and attractive face which, without being beautiful, was considered pleasant and winning.

The weekly bills are, indeed, as eloquent a testimony as any detailed description could have been; and as they are the most complete of the kind for a provincial town, I have transcribed them from the manuscript record in full. The small number of deaths from ordinary causes points to the emptiness of the better quarters of the town; the total deaths in <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> months, 5345, including 4817 plague-deaths and 528 from other causes, must have meant an enormous clearance of the poorer classes. Colchester was then a place of considerable wealth, with a thriving Dutch trade and a considerable Dutch colony.

As a rule they limited themselves to one pipe at night, while five years ago travellers complained that a long halt at noon was demanded by the smokers.

To this Mr. Wilson agreed, and in the beginning of September a Commission composed of delegates from both countries came together. The Commission suggested that both Mexico and the United States should work together to patrol the frontiers, and safeguard them from further raids. But to...", "...it may be the old story of the tortoise and the hare over again. As regards the first class of submarines, the present submarine boats engaged in the continental war consist of vessels only a few of which have a surface speed exceeding twelve knots, or a submerged speed exceeding ten knots for one hour or eight knots for three hours. There may be a few in commission that exceed these speeds, but very few. Some are in course of construction that are expected to give a surface speed of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> and eighteen knots for forty hours and about eleven knots submerged for one hour, or a slower speed for a greater number of hours. Governments are asking for bids for submarines of greater speed, and some have been designed which are expected to make twenty knots on the surface; but they are not in service as yet. One reason that higher surface speeds have not been reached is the difficulty of securing a perfectly satisfactory high-power, heavy-oil, internal-combustion...", "...the beautiful stone-work of the Schools Quadrangle outside. It was in these noble surroundings that, with far too little, I fear, of positive reading, and with much undisciplined wandering from shelf to shelf and subject to subject, there yet sank deep into me the sense of history, and of that vast ocean of the recorded past from which the generations rise and into which they fall back. And that in itself was a great boon--almost, one might say, a training, of a kind. But a girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> is not always thinking of books, especially in the Oxford summer term. In _Miss Bretherton_, my earliest novel, and in _Lady Connie_, so far my latest,[1] will be found, by those who care to look for it, the reflection of that other life of Oxford, the life which takes its shape, not from age, but from youth, not from the past which created Oxford, but from the lively, laughing present which every day renews it.

Throughout his life Professor Tuomey bore the impress of the culture imbibed in those early days, and the earnestness of the instruction given by loved ones was a perpetual propelling force in all his subsequent studies and investigations. His precocity was evidently taken advantage of by these affectionate instructors, for at the early age of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> we find him associated with a friend in teaching at Yorkshire, England. The young genius, for such he was, girded by the panoply of a sacred association and thorough drill of mind, marked out for himself a course of scientific study into which his natural bent bore him, and his early training, as well.

Perhaps the appellation refers not to the boom of the bell, but to those deep, sweet hummings which follow after the peal, wave upon wave. [29] This semi appears to be chiefly known in Shikoku. III JAPANESE poems on semi are usually very brief; and my collection chiefly consists of _hokku_,--compositions of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> syllables. Most of these _hokku_ relate to the sound made by the semi,--or, rather, to the sensation which the sound produced within the poet's mind.

About the time of his death his admirers declared he would supersede Scott or Dickens; but the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years since his death have seen many changes in literary reputations. Stevenson has held his own remarkably well. As a man the interest in him is still keen, but of his works only a few are widely read. Among these the first place must be given to _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, partly because of the profound impression made upon the public mind by the dramatization of this tale, and partly because it appeals strongly to the sense of the mystery of conflicting personality.

Such was the state of affairs political, religious and economical when in the year 1555 the Emperor Charles V, prematurely aged by the heavy burden of forty years of world-wide sovereignty, worn out by constant campaigns and weary of the cares of state, announced his intention of abdicating and retiring into a monastery. On October 25, 1555, the act of abdication was solemnly and with impressive ceremonial carried out in the presence of the representatives of the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> provinces of the Netherlands specially summoned to meet their sovereign for the last time in the Great Hall of the Palace at Brussels. Charles took an affecting farewell of his Netherland subjects and concluded by asking them to exhibit the same regard and loyalty to his son Philip as they had always displayed to himself. Much feeling was shown, for Charles, despite the many and varied calls and duties which had prevented him from residing for any length of time in the...", "...his plays and that he never composed a detailed scenario. He thought of only one piece at a time, brooding over it for long months sometimes, and then throwing it on paper almost at white heat, if it dealt with passion. If, on the other hand, it was a comedy of character, a study of social conditions, the actual composition was necessarily more leisurely and protracted. He had carried in mind for six or seven years the theme of 'Monsieur Alphonse;' and he had actually put it on paper in <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days. He had written the 'Princesse Georges' in three weeks and the 'Etrangere' in a month; and the second act of the 'Dame aux Camelias' had been penned in a single session of four hours.

The object in dispute, \"two _SAR_ of land,\" is occasionally given; or the court is named \"the temple of Shamash,\" or \"at the gate of Shamash.\" The whole text is too fragmentary to be translated, but we may note that some lady or other is always a party to the suit. If we could find the tablets referring to the...", "...\"The other day some one had had out one of my books and returned it upside down.

He bought it partly because of what he had heard during his last term at school of Don Juan, partly because he had picked up the idea that it was rather a fine thing to read poetry; and he kept it and read it in great secrecy because his mother (to whom he mentioned his intention) told him that Byron ought not to be read and that her father, in her girlhood, had picked...", "...and he made of the fact a text for a sermon. He said that this was a rich country and that the people liked to pay two hundred per cent on the value of a thing. They could afford it. He said that the Government imposed a protective duty of from ten to seventy per cent on foreign-made articles, and that the American manufacturer consequently could sell his goods for a healthy sum. Thus an imported hat would, with duty, cost two guineas. The American manufacturer would make a hat for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> shillings and sell it for one pound fifteen. In these things, he said, lay the greatness of America and the effeteness of England. Competition between factory and factory kept the prices down to decent limits, but I was never to forget that this people were a rich people, not like the pauper Continentals, and that they enjoyed paying duties. To my weak intellect this seemed rather like juggling with counters. Everything that I have yet purchased costs about twice as much as...", "...by the Professorship of Modern History at Oxford.

When they returned Steelman went straight to the room he occupied with Smith. \"How much stuff have we got, Smith?\" \"Nine pounds <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> and threepence.\" Steelman gave an exclamation of disapproval with that state of financial affairs. He thought a second. \"I know the barman here, and I think he knows me.

Mr. Petersen having volunteered his services to drive my dogs,--an offer too valuable to be declined--managed my dog-sledge throughout. Our five starveling puppies were harnessed, for the first time in their lives, to a small sledge which I drove myself, intending to sell them to the Esquimaux, if I could get them to drag their own supply of provisions so far. The procession looked imposing--it certainly was deeply interesting; there were five sledges, twelve men, and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> dogs, the latter of all sizes and shapes. The ship hoisted the Royal Harwich Yacht flag, and our sledges displayed their gay silk banners; mine was a very beautiful one, given me by Lady Franklin; it bears her name in white letters upon a red ground, and is margined with white embroidery; it was worked by the sisters of Captain Collinson. {EQUIPMENT OF SLEDGE-PARTIES.} The equipment of my sledge-party and the weights were as follows: those of Hobson and Young were almost...", "...Hydroporus, Hydrobius (two species), Notaphus, Cynucus, Adimonia, and Scarabaeus. At first I thought that these insects had been blown from the shore; but upon reflecting that out of the eight species four were aquatic, and two others partly so in their habits, it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the sea by a small stream which drains a lake near Cape Corrientes. On any supposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects swimming in the open ocean <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles from the nearest point of land. There are several accounts of insects having been blown off the Patagonian shore. Captain Cook observed it, as did more lately Captain King of the Adventure. The cause probably is due to the want of shelter, both of trees and hills, so that an insect on the wing with an off-shore breeze, would be very apt to be blown out to sea. The most remarkable instance I have known of an insect being caught far from the land, was that of a large...", "...the wife's funeral benefit of twenty-five dollars and fifty dollars to members in good standing for six months and one year, respectively, costs each member about fifteen cents annually. The cost of the seventy-five dollar wife's funeral benefit in the Tailors' Union ran in the first year as high as eighty-six and two thirds cents. At the time the benefit was abolished the amount paid was practically the same as that now paid by the Carpenters and the per capita cost had fallen to about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> cents in 1896. It may fairly be concluded that a wife's funeral benefit of twenty-five dollars will cost each member of the union about fifteen cents annually. The consideration of the cost of the death benefit has been deferred until an examination of the cost of the disability benefit and of the wife's funeral benefit had been made, since the member's death benefit, the disability benefit and the wife's funeral benefit are regarded in the unions with the most highly...", "...the city at once and, encouraged by the business activity of the place, he made it his permanent abode. He found employment with Hieronymus Holper, and soon married his master's comely daughter, Barbara. They resided in a little house which was a sort of appendage to the great house of Pirkheimer. A few months after a much longed for son came to bless the Pirkheimers, a little boy was born in the goldsmith's house whom they named, for his father, Albrecht Durer. As the years went by, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> other children came to the Durer home. Three only of all these children grew to maturity. With such a family to support we can easily imagine that the father's life was a hard one. He was a pious and industrious man whom his illustrious son never tires of praising. In one place he says of him, \"He had a great reputation with many who knew him, for he led an honorable Christian life, was a patient man, gentle, in peace with everyone and always thankful to God. He had no...", "...Between the workhouse and the river is a stretch of land used by market-gardeners. It was by the riverside that Brandenburg House, built by Sir Nicholas Crispe in the beginning of Charles I.'s reign, was situated. General Fairfax quartered himself here in 1647 during the Civil War, and his troops afterwards plundered the house; but at the close of the war Sir Nicholas returned and restored his property to its former state. After his death in 1666 it descended to his nephew, who sold it <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years later to Prince Rupert, who gave it to Margaret Hughes. It passed through the possession of various owners. One of these, George Dodington, afterwards Lord Melcombe, repaired and modernized it, altering the name to La Trappe. In 1792 it became the property of the Margrave of Brandenburg-Anspach and Bayreuth, and at his death the Margravine, formerly Lady Craven, continued to live there.

(M878) This ended the Hannibalic war, which had lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years, and which gave to Rome the undisputed sovereignty of Italy, the conversion of Spain into two Roman provinces, the union of Syracuse with the Roman province of Sicily, the establishment of a Roman protectorate over the Numidian chiefs, and the reduction of Carthage to a defenseless mercantile city.

These results were great, but were obtained by the loss of one quarter of the burgesses of...", "...of life's luxuries, Anna Podd made her way in the world with unfaltering determination. The tragedy of her life was perhaps her ambition, but who could blame her for wishing to better herself? She had nothing--nothing but her beauty. What a woman's beauty can do for herself and her country is amply portrayed in the kaleidoscopic pageant of Anna Podd's life. The only existing picture of her (here reproduced) was discovered in Moscow after Ivan Buminoff's well-remembered siege, lasting <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years. Poor Anna! Destiny seemed ruthlessly determined to lead her so far and no further.

They were very hospitable, and pleased at the interest they excited. We made from fourteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> ounces of gold dust a day for some weeks, working our two cradles something like eight hours a day. With gold at the then current rate of fourteen dollars an ounce this was a good return, and we were quite happy. Besides, we were always hoping for a big strike.

The latter dismounted and entered the hotel. In two minutes he reappeared and spoke to the other, who also dismounted, and after a word or two with one of the men belonging to the hotel, and a short conversation with the leader of the party of civil guards, advanced to the table at which Hugh and Royce were sitting.

Her draught of water would be only four feet, and she would lie very low in the water, but her lines are those of a good sea boat. She had one mast, forty feet high, to carry a crossyard and a square sail, and she had thirty-two oars, sixteen on each side.

The Grateful Dead and their thousands of Deadhead devotees are radical Bohemians. This much is widely understood. Exactly what this implies in the 1990s is rather more problematic. The Grateful Dead are among the world's most popular and wealthy entertainers: number 20, according to Forbes magazine, right between M.C. Hammer and Sean Connery. In 1990, this jeans-clad group of purported raffish outcasts earned <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> million dollars. They have been earning sums much along this line for quite some time now. And while the Dead are not investment bankers or three-piece-suit tax specialists--they are, in point of fact, hippie musicians-- this money has not been squandered in senseless Bohemian excess. The Dead have been quietly active for many years, funding various worthy activities in their extensive and widespread cultural community. The Grateful Dead are not conventional players in...", "...recognized me. As she left the stage she stopped at the wings and made a sign to me with her fan to come and speak to her. I went out with a beating heart, though I could not explain my perturbation, for I did not feel guilty in any way towards Therese, save in that I had not answered the last letter she had written me from Naples, thirteen years ago. I went round the theatre, feeling a greater curiosity as to the results of our interview than to know what had befallen her during the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years which seemed an age to me. I came to the stage-door, and I saw Therese standing at the top of the stair. She told the door-keeper to let me pass; I went up and we stood face to face.

Hearing the carriage and horses approaching, he became frightened, and walked in the direction of the approaching danger. Mr. Lincoln quickly observed this, and shouted to the coachman to rein in his horses, which he did as they were about to run over the unfortunate youth. He had been shot through the left side of the upper part of the face, and the ball, passing from one side to the other, had put out both his eyes. He could not have been over sixteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years of age, and, aside from his blindness, he had a very beautiful face. Mr. Lincoln extended his hand to him, and while he held it he asked him, with a voice trembling with emotion, his name, his regiment, and where he lived. The young man answered these questions and stated that he lived in Michigan; and then Mr. Lincoln made himself known to the blind soldier, and with a look that was a benediction in itself, spoke to him a few words of sympathy and bade him good-by.

All that is necessary for the reader to note is, that the amount returned is at least in equity not to be _less_ than the amount given. The abstract idea, then, of just or due wages, as respects the labourer, is that they will consist in a sum of money which will at any time procure for him at least as much labour as he has given, rather more than less.

However, if the Niger _has_ a sensible outlet, I have no doubt of its proving the Congo, knowing all the rivers between Cape Palmas and Cape Lopes to be inadequate to the purpose; nor need the immense course of such a river surprise us, when we know that the river St. Lawrence, contemptible in size when compared with the Congo, encompasses the whole of North America, issuing through a chain of lakes. But instead of seven or eight lakes, the Congo may be supposed to pass through <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> or eighteen; which will solve any difficulty as to the floods of the Niger not immediately affecting the Congo. I believe that our information of the Niger losing itself in the Desert rests wholly upon the authority of the Romans, a people whose pursuits never led them to trace the course of rivers with a view to traffic or civilization. If we may credit the accounts of travellers in crossing the deserts, we find that, where-ever they get water for refreshment, there are...", "...these love-feasts, these appellations of brother and sister, which drew on the Christians, while little known, those imputations of debauchery bestowed upon them by the priests of Jupiter and the priestesses of Vesta. We read in Petronius and in other authors, that the dissolute called one another brother and sister; and it was thought, that among Christians the same licentiousness was intended. They innocently gave occasion for the scandal upon themselves. In the commencement, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> different Christian societies existed, as there had been nine among the Jews, including the two kinds of Samaritans. Those bodies which considered themselves the most orthodox accused the others of inconceivable impurities.

There were in all some <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hundred regiments of infantry, over two hundred and seventy regiments of cavalry, and more than nine hundred batteries of artillery. These numbers are without parallel in the military history of the world.

Whilst Charlotte was always on the look-out for some _preux chevalier_, who was to be at her feet and vow eternal devotion, Joyce had as yet no such airy castles. Her education had been widely different from her cousin's, and home and home interests had so filled her <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years with their joys and pleasures, that she had no time to dream over \"keepsakes,\" and read Miss Burney's romances, or steep herself in the unreality of sentimental verses, which Wordsworth was beginning to break down and send into the shadows, by bringing out the beauties of creation into the strong light, which his genius threw around them.

The egg was poached--and even so she was afraid to ask him when the time was ripe to boil it again. It made her miserable; but he never spoke of it. Of course all that was old history.

This power of inspiring confidence was now badly needed. Everything in Canada was still provisional. Owing to the war the Quebec Act of 1774 had never been thoroughly enforced.

The next constitution, the Canada Act of 1791, was of a very different character. During the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years between these two constitutions all that could be done was to make the best of a very confusing state of flux. Not that the Quebec Act was a dead letter--far from it--but simply that it could not go beyond restoring the privileges of the French-Canadian priests and seigneurs within the area then effectively occupied by the French-Canadian race.

Her rash, ill-assorted marriage with Woodford had been hastily contracted when she was barely <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years of age, in consequence of a jealous pique which she, for some silly reason or other, had conceived regarding Henry Mason, an intelligent, young seafaring man, of fair prospects in life, and frank disposition, with whom she had for some time previously, as the west-country phrase has it, \"kept company,\" and who was, moreover, tenderly attached to her. Esther's married life was one long repentance of the rash act; and the severance of the tie which bound her to an...", "...act he put in force in the interval of Congress; and under it an expedition was set on foot, which began its march on the 30th of September from Fort Washington (which stood on the site of the present city of Cincinnati).

After a march of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days, they approached the principal village of the Miamis. The Indians did not await an attack, but set fire to the village and fled to the woods. The destruction of the place, with that of large quantities of provisions, was completed. An Indian trail being discovered, Colonel Hardin, a continental officer who commanded the Kentucky militia, was detached to follow it, at the head of one hundred and fifty of his men, and about thirty regulars, under Captain Armstrong and...", "...sir, did you bring me these miniatures?\" \"That you might see two bright and beautiful faces whose owners are bound to you by the strongest ties of blood.\" \"Do you know, sir,--have you ever heard,--how their father, by his wilfulness, by his folly, by his heartless denial of my right to influence him, ruined the fortune that cost my life of struggle and labor to create?\" The doctor shook his head, and the other continued: \"Then I will tell it to you, sir.

During her early youth, William Penn visited the house of her father, and greatly amused her by describing his adventures with the Indians.

To provision an army, campaigning against so formidable a foe through such a country, from wagons alone seemed almost impossible. System and discipline were both essential to its accomplishment. The Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments, though four of them in the West had been concentrated into a single military division. The Army of the Potomac was a separate command and had no territorial limits. There were thus <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> distinct commanders. Before this time these various armies had acted separately and independently of each other, giving the enemy an opportunity often of depleting one command, not pressed, to reinforce another more actively engaged. I determined to stop this. To this end I regarded the Army of the Potomac as the centre, and all west to Memphis along the line described as our position at the time, and north of it, the right wing; the Army of the James, under General Butler,...", "...site of part of the present Grosvenor Place, in order that the garden which he was then making might not be overlooked.

In the northern colonies the puritan element was strong, and the chief sources of wealth were commerce and farming.

'But what were you doing in Mississippi?' I inquired. For the first time Tom hesitated; and he answered, with an uneasy expression and a furtive glancing about of his keen hazel eye, that he had been an overseer on a plantation. 'The devil!'

In my earliest knowledge of _that_ place, I was a youth, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years grown, and my memory tells me that when first I waked, or came, as it might be said, to myself, in that Future, I stood in one of the embrasures of the Last Redoubt--that great Pyramid of grey metal which held the last millions of this world from the Powers of the Slayers.

The cousins lived in the town of Bloomsbury, a thriving place situated on the southern shore of Sunrise Lake, which was a magnificent body of water, said to be nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles long by three wide, in places. This lake having hilly shores that were heavily wooded in spots, and with numerous fine coves, afforded grand sport to the young people of Bloomsbury, both winter and summer. The railroad skirted one shore and then passed through the town. Some miles off arose a lofty peak known as Old Thundertop, which had a road running part way up its side. The summit was believed to be utterly inaccessible to mortal man until one day the Bird boys...", "...hill on the eastern side of the strait, bearing South 59 degrees East.

Nothing but the prospect of growing rich rapidly would persuade a white man, unless he were a missionary, to live in any of those countries, and a European woman was almost unknown there. One of the first white women to risk the dangers of the Yoruba climate was Anna Hinderer, to whom belongs the honour of being the first of her colour to visit Ibadan. It was not, however, a mere visit that she paid to this unhealthy West African town; for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years she lived there with her husband, devoting herself almost entirely to educating the native children. Her mother died when she was five years old, and it was probably owing to her own childhood being sad and lonely that Anna Martin, afterwards Mrs. Hinderer, early in life began to take an interest in the welfare of poor and neglected children. In 1839, when only twelve years of age, she went to live with her grandfather at Lowestoft, and soon made two lifelong...", "...be made a permanent one for travel during all the seasons of the year.

This was the quickest time for horseback riding, considering the distance made, ever accomplished in this or any other country.

The Iron Banks,[052] <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles below the mouth of the Ohio, have been thought by some an eligible position for the extensive business, {36} which, it is admitted by all, must centre in this neighbourhood.

The good fortune of the French was now neutralized by the same languor which had marked the movements of Philip after the victory of Saint Quentin. The time, which might have been usefully employed in following up his success, was now wasted by the Duke in trivial business, or in absolute torpor.

Within the great encompassing arch, on each side, is a cluster of three more square pedestals similarly decorated. The arch itself has <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> medallions upon each pillar, the top five on each side being cut in half by a moulding. Beyond the arch to right and left are two other pedestals with the same five ornaments on their two faces. Thus, if you count the smaller pillars only, there are twenty-four rows of five, or 120 medallions, and adding those on the arch, you get a total of 154.

The paper (I have already explained) had a real value of one per cent; and cost, and could be sold for, currency.

In the latter cases, however, when a fish was taken, one of the larger vessels was usually employed to take the creature into the Bight. In this way was the oil obtained, which went to make up a cargo for the Henlopen. The governor had his doubts about sending this brig on so distant a voyage, the vessel being so slow; but there was no choice, since she must go, or the cargo must remain a long time where it was. The brig was accordingly filled up, taking in <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hundred barrels; and she sailed for Hamburgh, under the command of a young man named Thomas. Walker remained behind, preferring to superintend the whaling affairs at home. So high did the fever run, by this time, that it was determined to build a couple of vessels, each to measure about a hundred and eighty tons, with the sole object of using them to take the whale. Six months after laying their keels, these little brigs were launched; and lucky it was that the governor had...", "...people of the different States.

Then as to punishments: death, it was true, had been decreed for mutiny and desertion; but there was no punishment for cowardice; for holding correspondence with the enemy; for quitting, or sleeping on one's post; all capital offences, according to the military codes of Europe. Neither were there provisions for quartering or billeting soldiers, or impressing wagons and other conveyances, in times of exigency. To crown all, no court-martial could sit out of...", "...wicked.

Delbruck, head of the imperial chancery, had held this position since 1868; in 1877 Bulow, secretary of state for foreign affairs, was appointed Prussian minister, and this has become the ordinary practice.

The tendency, when you are appealing to the \"working class,\" is to fix your attention on two or three million more or less confirmed trade unionists, and treat them as Labor; the other <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> or eighteen million, who might qualify statistically, are tacitly endowed with the point of view ascribed to the organized nucleus. How very misleading it was to impute to the British working class in 1918-1921 the point of view expressed in the resolutions of the Trades Union Congress or in the pamphlets written by intellectuals. The stereotype of Labor as Emancipator selects the evidence which supports itself and rejects the other. And so parallel with the real movements...", "...in the foreground lay the lake.

His daughter Maria, who was <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years old, undertook all the contralto _roles_, while his wife and Mme. Barbieri were the soprani. He himself was, naturally, _primo tenore_, being assisted by the younger Crivelli as the _secondo_. The latter artist, the son of Gaetano, one of the best Italian tenors, had first met the Garcia family in Naples, where he had spent some years in vocal study under Millico and Zingarelli. During the last year of Garcia's stay in Italy Crivelli had written an opera, which was...", "...decorated with the bright garments of women. Boys and girls, brilliant handkerchiefs bound around their heads, and shaking decorated gourds with pebbles in them, had danced before the captives to the great delight of the spectators.

One hundred and fifty-three white beans and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> black beans were placed in a bowl, and every prisoner, blindfolded, was forced to draw one. The seventeen who drew the black beans were promptly shot, and the others were compelled to march on.

It was in this year of his life that he is said to have written the 'Culex.' There are many difficulties which prevent the belief that Virgil is the author of the poem which has come down to us under that name.

The late Dr. Ashbel P. Grinnell, for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years dean of the Vermont Medical College, studied this phase of the subject, gathering interesting statistics. After Vermont's adoption of prohibitory legislation, he sent out to wholesale and retail drug stores, general stores, and groceries that carried drugs as a part of their stock a letter in which were inclosed blanks calling for specific information concerning the sale of habit-forming drugs.

Nevertheless, before the re-inhumation was proceeded with, he recorded the fact that the skeletons were those of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> individuals of both sexes. In addition to these skeletons, there were also found in the cave a number of little discs, or flat rings, formed of the shell of a species of cockle (_cardium_).

It has become a very popular thing to send daily petitions to the King, and to appropriate one day out of seven for the especial purpose of sending in their petitions. The same petitions are frequently sent a great number of times. It is very unpopular however for any one to expect the King to make any reply to any petitions sent in. Any one pretending to have received a reply would be counted a base impostor; for, say they, the King has spoken to no one for the last <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hundred years; no one has heard from him since he conversed with his servant John on the Isle of Patmos. The King conversed very freely with his subjects in the early and middle ages; and some think it very strange that he has been silent so long. They have expended millions in building many costly and magnificent churches in honor of his name; but yet he has not deigned to grace one of them with a visit, neither has he condescended to send any tidings to them by a messenger...", "...distance from the ground, are three stones which we measured, and made them about seventy feet long each, and about fifteen feet wide.

In 1632 a memorial is presented before the municipal council of Manila by one of its regidors, representing the injuries and losses arising from the trade which has been commenced there by the Portuguese of Macao. It seems that they have absorbed the trade formerly carried on by the Chinese with Manila, and have so increased the prices of goods that the citizens cannot make a profit on the goods that they send to Nueva Espana. Navada presents <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> considerations and arguments regarding this condition of affairs. He states that in earlier years the authorities of Manila forbade the Portuguese to come to Manila, for the same reasons that are now so urgent; that investments of capital are now seldom made by citizens of the Philippines, for lack of returns thereon; and that the royal revenues are defrauded by the enormous losses in the proceeds from the customs duties on the goods brought by the Portuguese, as compared...", "...annexed diagram is an outline, was one of those constructed by Mr. Handcock.

With this carriage, Mr. Handcock stated he accomplished one mile up hill at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles an hour.

This direct inoculation having been practised on <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> animals, transmitted the disease to them all in the course of a few days. The English physicians having been made acquainted with these experiments, applied them to a more practical purpose, no longer to discover whether the disease could thus be transmitted (for that had been proved), but to find out (what was far more important) whether this fearful distemper could be prevented and kept off.

At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> he entered a sculptor's studio in Cincinnati. Here he gained reputation as a painter of portraits. From this city he went to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and soon after to Florence, Italy. In the later years of his life, he divided his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome. His complete poetical works fill three volumes. Several of his most stirring poems relate to the Revolutionary War, and to the late Civil War in America. Many of his poems are marked by...", "...and a brownish complexion, and 'in his good-natured and benevolent countenance he had all the features of an honest English face.'

He also told them he was married to a woman much older than himself, one of those who had come with his father from Otaheite.

Emily was fair and pretty, girlish and diffident--blue eyes and light hair.

She said: \"I will go to St. Louis, too, sir. I will find a way to get there. I will make a way. And I will find a way to help myself along, and do what I...", "...says I'm a foreigner.

This is a record of personal gifts to which we know no parallel. It reminds us of the career of John Wesley, whose simplicity and frugality of habits enabled him not only to limit his own expenditure to a very small sum, but whose Christian liberality and unselfishness prompted him to give all that he could thus save to purely benevolent objects.

It was not unnatural that such a mood should occasionally overtake him, since he had reached apparently a straight and monotonous tract of road, which would have looked interminable to the eyes of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> had not his household companions been now all declining folk, whose presence brought under his constant observation the last stages of \"a long journey in December gone.\" Half a century or so of smithy work, even with some unlicensed doctoring and illicit distilling thrown in, was not by any means the future that he would have liked his oracle to predict for him.

That village is just on the northeast border of the great Boulsworth moors, where my hut was pitched. At the time of my encampment there Charlotte Bront\u00eb had been dead about eighteen months. She was hardly a contemporary of mine, as she was born <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years before me, and died so prematurely; still, when I think that \"Jane Eyre\" was written within a very few miles of Hollins, [Footnote: I have not access to an ordnance map, but believe that the distance was hardly more than eight miles across the moors.

Of the Itchen valley, with its rich meadows and tranquil stream, William Cobbett was an enthusiastic admirer. \"There are few spots in England\", he exclaims, \"more fertile, or more pleasant, none, I believe, more healthy. The fertility of this vale and of the surrounding country is best proved by the fact that, besides the town of Alresford, and that of Southampton, there are <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> villages, each having its parish church, upon its borders. When we consider these things, we are not surprised that a spot situated about halfway down this vale should have been chosen for the building of a city, or that that city should have been for a great number of years the place of residence for the kings of England.\" To-day the beautiful river winds in and out of the ancient streets, and among the meadow lands, much as it did when Cobbett penned his _Rural Rides_,...", "...were almost at Mombasa. The theoretical stage of the lion hunt was nearly over and it was now a matter of only a few days until we should be up against the \"real thing.\" I sometimes wondered how I should act with a hostile lion in front of me--whether I would become panic-stricken or whether my nerve would hold true. There is lots of food for reverie when one is going against big game for the first time. [Drawing: _Chalking the Pig's Eye_] We landed at Mombasa September sixteenth, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days out from Naples. Mombasa is a little island about two by three miles in extent. It is riotous with brilliant vegetation, and, as seen after a long sea voyage through the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, it looks heavenly except for the heat. Hundreds of great baobab trees with huge, bottle-like trunks and hundreds of broad spreading mango trees give an effect of tropical luxuriance that is hardly to be excelled in beauty anywhere in the East.

The jovial Matsusaki threw his arms about the Commodore's neck, crushing in his tipsy embrace a pair of new epaulettes, and repeating, in Japanese, with maudlin affection, these words, as interpreted into English: \"Nippon and America, all the same heart.\" He then went toddling into his boat, supported by some of his more steady companions, and soon all the happy party had left the ships and were making rapidly for the shore. The Saratoga fired the salute of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> guns as the last boat pulled off from the Powhatan, and the squadron was once more left in the usual quiet of ordinary ship's duty. The following day the Commodore landed to have a conference in regard to the remaining points of the treaty, previous to signing. He was met at the treaty-house by the commissioners. As soon as the Commodore had taken his seat, a letter was handed to him, which the Japanese said they had just received from Simoda. It was from Commander Pope,...", "...poisoning, and her innocence of theft, firmly. Her answers, it is needless to say, availed her nothing.

On our return two more horses were brought ashore, reducing the number on board to one-half. 20th May. We succeeded in landing six more horses during the day; the great distance they had to be swam ashore made the process very slow and fatiguing, some of the horses being scarcely able to stand for some time after landing. This morning I made a rough survey of the cove and surrounding hills, and while so employed observed <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> natives pass across the shoals at low water, carrying nets but no weapons; they did not appear to fear us, or inclined to come up to the camp; nor did we offer them any encouragement, as in the present exposed state of our camp they would have been very troublesome.

Except where the canopies are so insignificant as not to count, a Perpendicular window presents, as a rule, a screen of silvery-white, on which the pictures form so many panels of more or less jewelled colour.

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL.] The enormous East window at York Minster, which belongs to the very early years of the fifteenth century, contains, apart from its tracery, no less than a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> subjects in its twenty-seven lights; but the canopies dividing them are so narrow that they scarcely answer the purpose of frames to the separate subjects. The design is inextricably confused, and the subjects are very difficult to read; but the effect is still as of a mass of jewels caught in a network of white. In fact, the progress towards light is such that, whereas in the last century the problem was how to get more and more white glass into a coloured window, it seems...", "...struggling for political freedom. In many of the villages wives cast the votes for their husbands when the latter are away; women have some suffrage for the zemstvos, local governing bodies; the Duma has tried to enlarge their franchise rights, but at present these are submerged in the general chaos. In Poland an active League for Woman's Rights is cooperating with the Democratic party of men. A very strong movement for woman suffrage is proceeding against great difficulties in the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> provinces of Austria, where almost as many languages are spoken and the bitterest racial feuds exist. Women are not allowed to form political associations or hold public meetings, but 4,000 have paraded the streets of Vienna demanding the suffrage. In Bohemia since 1864 women have had a vote for members of the Diet and are eligible to sit in it. In all the municipalities outside of Prague and Liberic, women taxpayers and those of the learned professions may vote by proxy....", "...Pitcher has got a slight touch of scurvy; his gums are inflamed; and now it comes out that he dislikes preserved meats, and has not eaten any since he has been in the ship! He has lived upon salt meat and preserved vegetables, except for the very short periods in summer when birds could be obtained. He is rather a \"used-up\" old fellow, too much so for our severe sledge-work, therefore is one of the few who will remain to take care of the ship. That he should have retained his health for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> months, under the circumstances, speaks well for the wholesomeness and quality of our provisions, and the ventilation and cleanliness of the ship. _10th._--Extremely cold, with dense mists from the open water.

I.K. Brunel adopted this principle for the Saltash bridge near Plymouth, built soon after the Britannia bridge. It has two spans of 455 ft. and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> smaller spans, the roadway being 100 ft. above high water. The top boom of each girder is an elliptical wrought iron tube 17 ft. wide by 12 ft. deep. The lower boom is a pair of chains, of wrought-iron links, 14 in each chain, of 7 in. by 1 in. section, the links being connected by pins. The suspending rods and cross bracing are very light. The depth of the girder at the centre is about one-eighth of the span.

When they were fairly near, when in little time the foremost would bring to, down sail and drop anchor, Juan Lepe, gathering his belongings together, bidding the lizard farewell and taking the parrot with him on shoulder, left cavern and...", "...we became panic-stricken, and we all broke. I saw several officers belonging to the Queen's Own and the Thirteenth attempting to rally the men. I saw Lieut.-Col. Booker attempting to rally the men, telling them to get into the bush on each side of the road, about four or six hundred yards from where they commenced to retreat. He got the bugler to sound the \"halt\" several times, and I heard the bugler say he was tired sounding the \"halt.\" The men continued to retreat, except sixteen or <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> of us, who got over the fence into the bush on our left, but had to leave because the main body continued their retreat towards Ridgeway.

The sport generally improved up to about the fifth round, while the inhabitants of the stream were gradually becoming aware of the feast spread for them at easy distances all down the river.

Then, while the Indians waited this return of the chief, the camp was broken up and the band set out again on a westward course, hoping to reach the Pacific coast, whose distance they did not dream. Months more passed by in hopeless wandering, then back to the great river they came and spent six months more in building boats, as their last hope of escape. On the 2d of July, 1543, the scanty remnant of the once powerful band embarked on the waters of the great river, and for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days floated downward, while the Indians on the bank poured arrows on them incessantly as they passed.

On these points the testimony of General Grant is too direct, too conclusive and too valuable to be omitted here, or to be given otherwise than in his own carefully chosen words. On page 237 _et seq._ of the \"Memoirs\" he writes: General Buell had left Corinth about the tenth of June to march upon Chattanooga. Bragg, who had succeeded Beauregard in command, sent one division from Tupelo on the twenty-seventh of June for the same place. This gave Buell about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days' start. If he had not been required to repair the railroad as he advanced, the march could have been made in eighteen days at the outside, and Chattanooga must have been reached by the national forces before the rebels could have possibly got there.

He then checked up his computations to be sure they were right. \"Almost twenty times as much phosphorus!\" he said to himself. \"Is it possible? And more than forty times as much calcium! Let me see! It takes one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> pounds of calcium for four tons of clover hay. The total amount in the plowed soil of the Leonardtown loam would not be sufficient for eight such crops; and six crops of corn such as we raised one year on our sixteen acres would take more phosphorus from the land than is now left in the plowed soil of this Leonardtown loam.

There he lay for a little while, staring at the fence and panting with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. Then an idea came into his head so suddenly as to make him forget all caution; and the next moment he was sliding full tilt down the railing of the front-door steps.

A talk between the two had much to do with directing Mrs. Lamb's thought into historical lines, and led to her publishing, some <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years later, her _History of New York_, and to her assuming, in 1883, the editorship of the _Magazine of American History_. Mary L. Booth used to tell very amusingly how she had once met Samuel G.

There is one more feature of this _Domesday Book_ which we cannot pass over. The number of parish churches in England in the eleventh century will, in some degree, furnish an indication of the amount of religious instruction. By some most extraordinary exaggeration, the number of these churches has been stated to be above forty-five thousand. In _Domesday_ the number enumerated is a little above <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hundred. No doubt this enumeration is extremely imperfect. Very nearly half of all the churches put down are found in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. The _Register_, in some cases, gives the amount of land with which the church was endowed.

She was such a tender-hearted little creature that she was full of compassion for Fred's sufferings. Now pity is a bridge that often leads to the beautiful meadows stretched on the other side of it full of rose-bushes and jasmine-hedges, which are as attractive to a maiden of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> as cherries to a bird, and who knows whether Louisa might not have been induced to wander in those pleasant groves, had she not been restrained by the thought of Fred riding amongst the roses on the old sorrel-horse, holding a great slice of bread and butter in one hand and a bottle of beer in the other. In spite of her compassion for him she could not help laughing, and so remained safely on this side of the bridge; she liked best to watch Fred from a distance, for the...", "...I am not to be so dismissed,\" I blurted out. \"I am Mistress Graves' nephew, Vavasour.\" \"What effrontery!\" cried the parson. \"The young gentleman is dead and buried.\" \"But I am he, I tell you. I have been immured in Melwood Priory, and only escaped this morning.\" \"If that be so,\" answered the parson, who evidently did not believe a word of it, \"you should appeal to the magistrates.\" \"Such is my intention. But all my belongings are here. I sent them to my aunt's care <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days ago.

Julia and I have both introduced ourselves to him in a pretty light, but it's just like me--however, I'll not say another word tonight!\" The little incident of the coffee pot gave Mr. Wilmot something of an insight into the character and disposition of the two girls. And surely nothing could have been more unlike than their personal appearance, as they sat side by side at the supper table. Julia was about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years of age and was called very handsome, for there was something peculiarly fascinating in the ever-varying expression of her large black eyes. She was a brunette, but there was on her cheek so rich and changeable a color that one forgot in looking at her, whether she were dark or light. Her disposition was something like her complexion--dark and variable. Her father was a native of South Carolina, and from him she inherited a quick, passionate temper. At times she was as...", "...came forward with a willing mind and a liberal spirit, and raised upwards of L40, which, with some other donations, was sufficient to prevent any remaining debt.\" \"There is,\" he observes, \"no record of members prior to the time of Mr. Pickering being settled, who, numbering himself one, entered all those that were in fellowship; and from that time a record has been kept.

It seemed to Scotty ghastly to speak about that event, for it was the death of his father.

One of the most important transactions of the Pony Express was the transmittal of President Buchanan's last message, in December, 1860, from the Missouri River to Sacramento, over two thousand miles, in eight days and a few hours, and the next in importance was the carrying of President Lincoln's message, his inaugural of March 4, 1861, over the same route in seven days and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hours. This was the quickest time for horseback riding, considering the distance made, ever accomplished in this or any other country. In the spring of 1860 Bolivar Roberts, superintendent of the western division of the Pony Express, came to Carson City, Nevada, to engage riders and station-agents for the Pony Express route across the Great Plains. In a few days fifty or sixty were engaged--men noted for their lithe, wiry physiques, bravery and coolness in moments of...", "...had lost none of their keen clearness; the voice was as full and steady, the carriage just as energetic as formerly.

Two points are noticeable in Plato's treatment of gymnastic:--First, that the time of training is entirely separated from the time of literary education. He seems to have thought that two things of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the same time. Here we can hardly agree with him; and, if we may judge by experience, the effect of spending three years between the ages of fourteen and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> in mere bodily exercise would be far from improving to the intellect. Secondly, he affirms that music and gymnastic are not, as common opinion is apt to imagine, intended, the one for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body, but that they are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind. The body, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the subjection of the lower to the higher is for the advantage of both. And doubtless the mind may exercise a very...", "...the nation reposed in him, gave him substantial claims in default of a real title of citizenship. The military force of the Low Countries consisted, in its full complement, of three thousand horse. At present it did not much exceed two thousand, and was divided into fourteen squadrons, over which, besides the governors of the provinces, the Duke of Arschot, the Counts of Hoogstraten, Bossu, Roeux, and Brederode held the chief command. This cavalry, which was scattered through all the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> provinces, was only to be called out on sudden emergencies. Insufficient as it was for any great undertaking, it was, nevertheless, fully adequate for the maintenance of internal order. Its courage had been approved in former wars, and the fame of its valor was diffused through the whole of Europe. In addition to this cavalry it was also proposed to levy a body of infantry, but hitherto the states had refused their consent to it. Of foreign troops there were still some German...", "...guns, and powder, and bullets; we gathered a heap of wealth, of fine cloth and beads. Of the cloth, and beads, the guns, and powder, and lead, I have given half to Olimali, the King of the Warori. Then each Mtuta warrior received his due, six cloths to each man; the Watuta chiefs received their due, and Ferodia took a share. Fifty slaves died on the road to Ututa, two Arab slaves died, and one white Arab ran away to die in the forest.

Thinking it useless, I resumed my course and proceeded to the Island of Old Providence, where we arrived after a passage of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days, and opened my trade as usual. The Traverse arrived four days after, having sprung her mast near the deck. The next day we hauled the Traverse along side of the Price, raised her masts with the schooner's purchases, sawed off the broken part, about five feet, took her sails on shore and shortened them to fit the mast, put them in good order for sea, exchanged part of her goods and gave her a suitable cargo to retail along the coast.

On November 14th, 1725, he took the _Perry_ galley (Captain King, commander), three days out from Barbadoes, and the following day a French sloop, and carried both prizes to a small island called Aruba, near Curacao, where they plundered them and divided the spoil amongst the crew. The crews of the two prizes were kept on the island by Cooper for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days, and would have starved if the pirate's doctor had not taken compassion on them and procured them food.

This amounts to but 2.10 foot pounds per second, but if we assume that the air was rising at the rate of seven miles per hour (10.26 feet per second), at which the pressure with the Langley coefficient would be 0.16 pounds per square foot, we have on...", "...siege. For the moment, the party in favour of peace among the Irish had been silenced by the news that twenty large ships of war, with a great number of transport and store ships, were being pushed forward at Brest and other French ports to come to their assistance. Ginckle occupied the same ground which William's army had taken up in the first siege, but directed his attacks chiefly upon the English town. As before, the Irish communication was open with the county of Clare, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> regiments of Irish horse were encamped on the Clare side of the river. Ginckle pushed on his works with great vigour, and the duty in the trenches was so severe, that the cavalry were compelled to take their turn with the infantry; but, notwithstanding that the siege artillery was much more powerful than that which William had at his disposal, but little progress was made. The town was set on fire several times; but the flames were speedily extinguished, and, as the...", "...the leading agent in all the mischief that followed. Mary Walcot was seventeen years of age. Her father was Jonathan Walcot (vol. i. p. 225). His first wife, Mary Sibley, to whom he was married in 1664, had died in 1683. She was the mother of Mary. It is a singular fact, and indicates the estimation in which Captain Walcot was held, that, although not a church-member, he filled the office of deacon of the parish for several years before the formation of the church. Mercy Lewis was also <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years of age. When quite young, she was, for a time, in the family of the Rev. George Burroughs: and, in 1692, was living as a servant in the family of Thomas Putnam; although, occasionally, she seems to have lived, in the same capacity, with that of John Putnam, Jr., the constable of the village. He was a son of Nathaniel, and resided in the neighborhood of Thomas and Deacon Edward Putnam. Mercy Lewis performed a leading part in the proceedings, had great energy of purpose...", "...were crowned with a full measure of success. My father wrote and wired to me continually. \"You are to exercise your own judgment, Loudon,\" he would say. \"All that I do is to give you the figures; but whatever operation you take up must be upon your own responsibility, and whatever you earn will be entirely due to your own dash and forethought.\" For all that, it was always clear what he intended me to do, and I was always careful to do it.

The paper (I have already explained) had a real value of one per cent.; and cost, and could be sold for, currency.

For, finding that all his efforts were ineffectual and believing that the chief object of the war was attained by the capture of Fort Duquesne, and the final defeat of the French on the Ohio, the young hero retired after five years of arduous and ill-requited service, in the words of a great writer of our own land and time: The youthful idol of his countrymen, but without so much as a civil word from the fountain of honor.

In 1726 he fixed the standard of the currency and secured the credit of the government by the regular payment thenceforward of the interest on the debt. By exacting forced labour from the peasants he gave France admirable roads, though at the cost of rousing angry discontent.

In 1817 Cooper and his young family started for a few month's visit to Heathcote Hill, and later in this year he lost his mother. As the stone house, then building at Fenimore, burned down in 1823, the land was sold later, and the few months' expected absence grew into <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years.

In fact, I have put fifty pounds into my pocket-book and into my purse five sovereigns and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> shillings. This sum ought to last me a year; but I dare say inexperience will do me out of it in a month, so we will count it as nothing.

They were young men of from <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> and eighteen to twenty-three and -four years of age, and bore the unmistakable stamp of the hoodlum class.

Some light is shed on the subject in a report prepared by the Chicago municipal markets--not so much on the influence of good roads as on the reduction in haulage costs, which is effected by self-propelled vehicles running on fine pavements. It appears that it costs eleven and one-quarter cents to carry one ton a mile by motor in the city of Chicago, and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> and three-quarter cents by horse. The average cost of delivering a package by the department stores, grocery stores, and meat markets of the city is approximately eight cents by motor and sixteen cents by horse for each mile. \"Apply these figures to the cities of the entire country, and consider further that motor-trucks can deliver goods directly from the farm to the city retailer, and it seems not unreasonable to expect that the cost of living must at least be held...", "...(1668-1751), English philanthropist, was born at Lyme Regis, Dorset. He began life as a seaman, and rose to the position of merchant captain. He settled at Taunton, Massachusetts, for several years engaging there in farming and boat-building, and in 1703 returned to England.

Would it be so much as one half?-No. Larch is about 14s. per 100 feet of planking, and the timber they use would be from 8s. to 10s. 16,901. I suppose boat-builders' wages are considerably less in Shetland and Caithness than here?-Yes; they are from 6s. to 8s. a week less, at any rate. I pay 24s. here, and I should think that 16s. would be about their figure there. 16,902. How long will one of your boats last?-From <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> to twenty years. 16,903. Is that the ordinary calculation as to the life of a boat?-It depends a great deal upon the kind of work they are put to. In some cases they do not last so long; but if they are preserved from accident, they may last for that time. 16,904.

To Newman's mind the theory of Vegetarianism was proved. He published some _Essays on Diet_; and was always an exponent of its rational claims on mankind. Since the days when he wrote up the subject, many people have come over to his way of thinking, and the way is made easy for those who...", "...of Mr. Mountjoy's children, and the baby and pet of all. Her mother died when she was about five years old, and since then she had always done exactly as she pleased; her father would not control her, and her eldest sister, who took charge of the family in her mother's place, could not. It was well that the girl had no evil tendencies and was, upon the whole, well-principled, warm-hearted, and good-natured, or she might have gone very grievously astray. As it was, she was now at <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> a bright butterfly, flitting from one to another of the flowers of life, and sipping as much honey as she could from each. She was fond of all sorts of bright, pretty things, handsome clothes and jewelry included. She liked to sing and she liked to dance, to go to parties when there were any, and to attend concerts and theatres when she went to town; in a word, she was fond of \"having a good time,\" as Americans express it, whenever and wherever she could get a chance. Nor...", "...service, in spite of the severity of the season, he took cold on leaving the church, which in a short time led to a fatal result. He expired in the arms of his wife, the sister of M. Erard, the celebrated pianist. He was in the seventy-second year of his age. The life of this unfortunate _Maestro_, says the _Athenaeum_, would be a curious rather than a pleasing story, were it thoroughly written. He was educated at the _Conservatorio de la Pieta_ of Naples, and began his career when <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years of age, as the composer of an opera, _I Puntigli delle Donne_. To this succeeded some sixteen operas, produced within six years, for the theatres of Italy and Sicily, not a note of which has survived. In 1803, Spontini went to Paris, in which capital again he produced some half-a-dozen operas and an oratorio,--all of which have perished. It would seem, however, as if there must have been something of grace in either _Maestro_ or music, since Spontini was appointed...", "...FENN. CHAPTER ONE. HOW THEY DECIDED TO RUN THE RISK. \"Well, Joses,\" said Dr Lascelles, \"if you feel afraid, you had better go back to the city.\" There was a dead silence here, and the little party grouped about between a small umbrella-shaped tent and the dying embers of the fire, at which a meal of savoury antelope steaks had lately been cooked, carefully avoided glancing one at the other. Just inside the entrance of the tent, a pretty, slightly-made girl of about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> was seated, busily plying her needle in the repair of some rents in a pair of ornamented loose leather leggings that had evidently been making acquaintance with some of the thorns of the rugged land. She was very simply dressed, and, though wearing the high comb and depending veil of a Spanish woman, her complexion, tanned is it was, and features, suggested that she was English, as did also the speech of the fine athletic middle-aged man who had just been speaking. His...", "...your idea of a half-holiday was to take the children for a walk and buy them some sweets. I told my brother of this and he said--Emma out for a half-holiday! why, you might as well give a mule a holiday. The phrase was brutal, but it was admirably descriptive of you. Yes, you are a mule, there is no sense in you; you are a beast of burden, a drudge too horrible for anything but work; and I suppose, all things considered, that the fat landlady with a dozen children did well to work you <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hours a day, and cheat you out of your miserable wages. You had no friends; you could not have a friend unless it were some forlorn cat or dog; but you once spoke to me of your brother, who worked in a potato store, and I was astonished, and I wondered if he were as awful as you. Poor Emma! I shall never forget your kind heart and your unfailing good humour; you were born beautifully good as a rose is born with perfect perfume; you were as unconscious of your goodness as the...", "...the capital gave him nearly twenty pounds a year, and, with the annuity already granted by the Marquis of Exeter, about thirty-five. Dr. Bell, by dint of restless exertions, managed to add another ten pounds to this yearly income. He wrote to Earl Spencer, temporarily residing at Naples, and obtained the promise of his lordship to grant Clare ten pounds per annum for life. So that altogether the poet now was endowed with a regular income of forty-five pounds a year, or rather more than <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> shillings a week. It was far above the average of what he had ever earned before as a labourer, and, properly regulated, might have been sufficient to make his future career comparatively free from the cares and anxieties of daily subsistence. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and the very aid intended to smoothen his road through life led, almost directly, to his ruin. The autumn of 1820, together with many gratifying gifts, brought Clare some little mortification. A...", "...the kind--my dear love to him--God bless him. I'm sure--here's my cab.

Peculiar honour is due to those who lead the way in whatever advances human happiness. And, surely, our just admiration of the character of the _reformers_ must be not a little enhanced, when we consider what they did for letters as well as for the church. Learning does not consist in useless jargon, in a multitude of mere words, or in acute speculations remote from practice; else the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> folios of St. Thomas Aquinas, the angelical doctor of the thirteenth century, and the profound disputations of his great rival, Duns Scotus the subtle, for which they were revered in their own age, had not gained them the contempt of all posterity. From such learning the lucid reasoning of the reformers delivered the halls of instruction.

RULES FOR THE IMPERIAL COURT AND COURT NOBLES In the same month of the same year there was promulgated a body of laws called the \"Rules of the Imperial Court, and the Court Nobles\" (Kinchu narabi ni Kugeshu Sho-hatto). This enactment bore the signatures of the kwampaku and the shogun and had the Imperial sanction. It consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> articles, but only five of them had any special importance: \"(1) Learning is the most essential of all accomplishments. Not to study is to be ignorant of the doctrines of the ancient sages, and an ignorant ruler has never governed a nation peacefully.\" This specious precept was not intended to be literally obeyed. The shoguns had no desire for an erudite Emperor.

Since 1846 no single year has passed without bringing its tribute of asteroidal discovery. In the last of the seventies alone, a full score of miniature planets were distinguished from the thronging stars amid which they seem to move; 1875 brought <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> such recognitions; their number touched a minimum of one in 1881; it rose in 1882, and again in 1886, to eleven; dropped to six in 1889, and sprang up with the aid of photography to twenty-seven in 1892. That high level has since, on an average, been maintained; and on January 1, 1902, nearly 500 asteroids were recognised as revolving between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Of these, considerably more than one hundred are claimed by one investigator alone--Dr. Max Wolf of...", "...on his own happiness!

This went on for <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days, and it appears that nearly one half of the brain was thrown out, mixed with the matter, yet the man retained all his intellectual faculties to the very last moment of his dissolution, and through the whole course of the disease, his mind maintained uniform tranquillity.

So long as children are sent to the public school at four and six years of age, there will continue to grow up a precocious race with active brains in feeble bodies.[7] This injurious result is largely brought about by the direct interference of premature brain-development with the complex intestinal processes of digestion and absorption.

The hardy Afghan mountaineers climbed with the agility of goats over the hill-sides, occupying hundreds of points which the soldiers could not reach. It was a carnival of slaughter. Nothing remained for the helpless fugitives but to push forward with all speed through that frightful mountain-pass and gain as soon as possible the open ground beyond. Few gained it. On the fourth day from Cabul there were but two hundred and seventy soldiers left. The fifth day found the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> thousand fugitives reduced to five thousand. A day more, and these five thousand were nearly all slain. Only twenty men remained of the great body of fugitives which had left Cabul less than a week before.

The capture and holding of Ramadie Ridge by British and Indian infantry was a difficult achievement. This low pebbly rise is perfectly smooth, a long and gentle gradient barely <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> feet above the plain level. It offered no cover of any kind, and the British infantry became visible to the Turks a full 200 yards before they reached the top of the rise. As soon as they came into view the Turks opened concentrated rifle and machine-gun fire on the British front and right flank, while their guns opened intense enfilade fire from the batteries on the left. The British and Indian soldiers hung on to their positions and at night dug themselves in. Their action...", "...size, the result being not only longer vocal cords and a correspondingly lower range of voice, but an absolute breaking down of the habits of singing that have been established, and frequently a temporary but almost total loss of control of the vocal organs. These changes sometimes take place as early as the thirteenth year, but on the other hand are frequently not noticeable until the boy is fifteen or sixteen, and there are on record instances of boys singing soprano in choirs until <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> or even eighteen. The loss of control that accompanies the change of voice (with which we are all familiar because of having heard the queer alternations of squeaking and grumbling in which the adolescent boy so frequently indulges), is due to the fact that the larynx, vocal cords, _et cetera_, increase in size more rapidly than the muscles develop strength to manipulate them, and this rapid increase in the size of the parts (in boys a practical doubling in the length of the...", "...no reason, however, to complain of Fortune, for she had been lavish in her gifts to me, and I in my turn had always abused them. In my state of distress the learned Abbe Pinzi introduced me to a Genoese bookseller, named Carrado, a thoroughly honest man, who seemed to have been created that the knavery of most of the Genoese might be pardoned. To him I brought my watch and snuff-box, but the worthy Carrado not only refused to buy them, but would not take them in pledge. He gave me <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hundred francs with no other security than my word that I would repay him if I were ever able to do so. Unhappily I have never been able to repay this debt, unless my gratitude be accounted repayment.

Assuming that amount to have been the annual difference between the coinage and commercial value of silver for the five years preceding 1878, we must add to the $88,885,000 the sum of $40,402,220, making a total of $129,287,220 as the amount which the silver miners, not of Nevada but of the whole United States in the <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years ending 1889, lost by the demonetization of silver. Having thus demonstrated in dollars and cents the degree of selfishness which, as is charged, is the motive of the miners in advocating the remonetization of silver, let us glance at the degree of selfishness which may be said to impel other classes of the community to advocate the same cause.

You will make a hit with him if you quote a detail from one of his own ads and say, \"I have a <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> jewel movement,\" and then particularize that number of good points about yourself. Such a reference preceding a specification of your qualities would be adaptive originality. _It would be an expression exactly fitted to the way this prospect thinks._ So it would be more effective than an ordinary answer to the objection.

If the borrower lived for five years the loan would be paid out of the income. In the event of his death, it would be paid by means of the insurance money. Another example: a child aged <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> is entitled to a fortune, large or small, at the age of twenty-one, but meanwhile is wholly depen- dent on its mother who has only an annuity for her life. Should the mother die before the child becomes of age the latter would be left without the means of subsistence. In such a case the prudent mother would insure her own life for the four years which must elapse before the child could come into the fortune, for such a sum as would keep it from want, so that in case the...", "...not gain so rapidly at first?_ It takes a few weeks for the stomach to become accustomed to cow's milk, and until this is accomplished it is necessary to make the milk very weak or the child's digestion will be upset. _For a child of average weight at birth (seven to seven and a half pounds) what should be the weight at the different periods during the first year?_ At three months it should be twelve to thirteen pounds; at six months, fifteen to sixteen pounds; at nine months, <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> to eighteen pounds; at one year, twenty to twenty-two pounds. At five months a healthy child will usually double its weight, and at twelve months it will nearly treble its weight. _Do all healthy infants gain steadily in weight during the first year?_ As a rule they do; yet it is seldom the case that one gains every week for the entire year. With most infants there are from time to time periods of a few weeks in which no gain is made.

Then, again, there are the comets, which, though but few are visible to us at once, are even more numerous than the stars; there are the nebulae, and the countless minor bodies circulating in space, and occasionally visible as meteors.

It also states an instance in which twenty-five colored citizens, belonging to Massachusetts, were confined at one time in a southern jail, and another instance in which 75 free colored persons from different free States were confined, all preparatory to their sale as slaves according to law.

From the six millions of privileged men, we must exclude three millions of old men and children. It will be affirmed by some one that this subtraction leaves a remainder of four millions in the case of women. This difference at first sight seems singular, but is easily accounted for. The average age at which women are married is twenty years and at forty they cease to belong to the world of love. Now a young bachelor of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> is apt to make deep cuts with his penknife in the parchment of contracts, as the chronicles of scandal will tell you.

They could not dig them larger, because of the order of the magistrates confining them to leave no bodies within six feet of the surface. Besides, the water coming on at about <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> or eighteen feet, they could not well put more in one pit. But now at the beginning of September, the plague being at its height, and the number of burials in our parish increasing to more than were ever buried in any parish about London of no larger extent, they ordered this dreadful gulf to be dug, for such it was, rather than a pit.

That night he went furtively through an alley to the back room of the bookmaker. \"Let me have <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> hundred, Spider, for three days, and I'll give you my note for two thousand,\" he whispered nervously. \"What security?\" asked the Spider, craft and money-lust swimming in his small, greenish-yellow eye. \"My signature's enough,\" said Rollie, bluffing weakly. \"Nothin' doin',\" quoth the Spider decisively.

When the Spaniards returned the next day to renew their traffic, they found the Indians relapsed into hostility, sounding their drums and shells, and rushing forward to attack the boats.

In all the great mass of student poetry that you collected for me, I found only seventeen pieces that I could call poetry,--and on submitting those <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> pieces to higher tests, I found that nearly all were reflections of thoughts and feelings from older poets. As for the book that you translated, I could find no true poetry in it at all, and scarcely anything original. And now let me tell you my honest opinion about this whole matter. The _refined_ poetry of this era, and most of the poetry that you collected for me of other eras, is of little or no value.

Perhaps, after all, worthy Mrs. Hume was, in the highest sense, right.

But no--he must needs turn aside for \"success\": and verily he had his reward; but not the crown he might have won. In 1740, Hume seems to have made an acquaintance which rapidly ripened into a life long friendship. Adam Smith was, at that time, a boy student of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> at the University of Glasgow; and Hume sends a copy of the _Treatise_ to \"Mr. Smith,\" apparently on the recommendation of the well-known Hutcheson, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the university. It is a remarkable evidence of Adam Smith's early intellectual development, that a youth of his age should be thought worthy of such a present.

The revelation containing the prophecy was given on the 25th of December, 1832. The first shot fired in the great American Civil War was fired early on the morning of April 12th, 1861. Hence the prediction preceded the commencement of its fulfillment by twenty-eight years, three months and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days. Ten years before the war began, the prophecy was published in England and circulated both in that country and in the United States. There can be no question, therefore, as to the prophecy preceding the event.

Finding him gazing tearfully in the direction of home, she promises to supply him with the means to build a raft which, thanks to the gods, will enable him to reach Ithaca. After a copious repast and a night's rest, Ulysses fells twenty trees and constructs a raft, in which, after it has been provisioned by Calypso, he sets sail.

They consist of two huge blocks of marble, the largest of which is <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> feet in length, ornamented with mouldings of the usual Corinthian character, and with a frieze beautifully decorated with festoons of foliage enclosing birds and genii. The style is of a late epoch, and might very probably belong to the Constantinian age. CHAPTER V. THE VELABRUM AND THE CIRCUS FLAMINIUS. [Sidenote: Janus Quadrifrons.] The church of S.

Their farms contain 29 acres, of which 25 are improved. The total value of the land is $23,300, and the appurtenant buildings are worth $390; live stock to the value of $489; and farm incomes for 1899 amounting to $4,244. Ten farms, aggregating 258 acres, are operated by Negroes as cash tenants.

Hence the applicability of the invention to baths, brewing, &c.----At the late meeting of the British Association, Major Rawlinson, after enumerating many interesting particulars of the progress of Assyrian discoveries,...", "...bringing up the rear, and fairly staring the polar monsters out of countenance, who remained grimly regarding them, and ramping about the cross. The sailors got into their boat with much deliberation, and escaped to the ship, \"glad enough,\" said De Veer, \"that they were alive to tell the story, and that they had got out of the cat-dance so fortunately.\" Next day they took the sun, and found their latitude 76 deg. 15', and the variation of the needle twenty-six degrees. For <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> days more they were tossing about in mist and raging snow-storms, and amidst tremendous icebergs, some of them rising in steeples and pinnacles to a hundred feet above the sea, some grounded and stationary, others drifting fearfully around in all directions, threatening to crush them at any moment or close in about them and imprison them for ever. They made fast by their bower anchor on the evening of 7th August to a vast iceberg which was aground, but just as they had eaten...", "...one had gone into the Fusiliers and been speared at Suakim; the other had broken his neck on a hunting-field in Warwickshire. The old man lived alone, and hugged his money-bags. They were the one thing left for which he seemed to retain any human affection. So, when he read Dolly's card, being by nature suspicious, he felt sure the child had called to see what she could get out of him. But when he descended to the consulting-room with stern set face, and saw a beautiful girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> awaiting him,--a tall sunny-haired girl, with Alan's own smile and Alan's own eyes,--he grew suddenly aware of an unexpected interest. The sun went back on the dial of his life for thirty years or thereabouts, and Alan himself seemed to stand before him. Alan, as he used to burst in for his holidays from Winchester! After all, this pink rosebud was his eldest son's only daughter. Chestnut hair, pearly teeth, she was Alan all over. Sir Anthony bowed his most respectful...", "...stationed everywhere on the confines, and Tepeaca itself was strongly garrisoned. Maxixcatzin and the elder Xicotencatl were well aware of this, and, consequently, not without their fears. Notwithstanding all this, we commenced our march thither, but without either cannon or matchlocks, for we had lost all these in our flight from Mexico: though we had saved a few of the latter, we could make no use of them as we had not a grain of powder left. Our small army now consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> horse, six crossbow-men, and 420 Spaniards, most of whom were only armed with swords and shields, and 4000 Tlascallans. We merely took a single day's provision with us, as the provinces we were going to invade were very populous, and contained quantities of maise, fowls, and musk swine. We observed our usual good custom of sending out a few scouts in advance, and we quartered ourselves for the first night about twelve miles from Tepeaca. The inhabitants, upon the news of our...", "...etcetera. \"Illustrious Senor. \"On the fourth day of this present month I arrived at the city of Nombre de Dios upon a mission the purpose of which was to secure the release of seventeen Englishmen who were last year made prisoners in the course of a treacherous and unjustifiable attack upon the fleet of Admiral Hawkins while, in pursuance of an agreement between himself and His Excellency Don Martin Enriquez, the Viceroy of Mexico, he was refitting his ships. \"I have traced those <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> prisoners in the first instance from San Juan de Ulua to Nombre de Dios; and upon my arrival at Nombre I was informed by His Excellency Don Sebastian de Albareda, the Governor of the city, that they had been dispatched to Panama. Whereupon, at my request, Don Sebastian was so obliging as to address a letter to Your Excellency, informing you of the purpose of my visit, and requesting you to take whatever steps might be necessary to secure the immediate release of those...", "...interests there. In January 1804 we had on the Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies stations, both together, six sail of the line, three smaller two-deckers, six frigates, and six sloops, or twenty-one ships of war in all. This would have been sufficient to repel a raiding attack made in some strength. By the beginning of 1805 our East Indies force had been increased; and in the year 1805 itself we raised it to a strength of forty-one ships in all, of which nine were of the line and <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> were frigates. Had, therefore, any of the hostile ships managed to get to the East Indies from the Atlantic or the Mediterranean ports, in which they were being watched by our navy, their chances of succeeding in their object would have been small indeed. When we enter the domain of tactics strictly so-called, that is to say, when we discuss the proceedings of naval forces--whether single ships, squadrons, or fleets--in hostile contact with one another, we find the time of...", "...of the Eighth Earl of Airlie, who was killed at Diamond Hill in 1900. When he sailed from our shores for South Africa, almost his last words were: \"Remember, if I am killed in action, whatever memorial you put for me, that you say on it I had died as I wished.\" And, in confirmation of this, after Magersfontein: \"I like the Boers, and am very proud to be fighting against them.... I am very happy.\" A sentiment which we, in later years, can parallel with the fact that Botha's son (aged <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> years) has enlisted to fight for Britain--a step approved by his heroic father. It was the old 73rd (now the 2nd Battalion Black Watch) which, under General Wauchope, their former colonel, fought so heroically in the Boer War, losing their brave commander at Magersfontein. The 73rd was, from 1809 to 1881, an ordinary line regiment, the Scottish dress and kilt having been abandoned. As such it fought at Waterloo, which, among others, it gives as an \"honour\" to the Black...", "...of an army of one hundred thousand men with their artillery and enormous trains of supplies across the mud-scarred marshy Peninsula. Five thousand wagons loaded to their utmost capacity, their wheels sinking in the springy earth, had to be guarded and transported. His siege guns, so heavy it was impossible to hitch enough horses to move them over roads in which they sank to the hubs, had to be saved. Three thousand cattle were there, to be guarded and driven, and it was more than <span class=\"clocktext\">seventeen</span> miles to the shelter of his gunboats on the James. During the night his wagon trains and heavy guns were moved across the Chickahominy toward his new base on the James. The morning of the 27th dawned cool and serene. Under the cover of the night the silent grey army had followed the retiring one in blue. The Southerners lay in the dense wood above Gaines Mill dozing and waiting orders. A balloon slowly rose from the Federal lines and hung in the scarlet clouds that..."]
