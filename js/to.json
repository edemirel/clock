I did the same as I went on, to avoid discovery, until I had passed by them, when I continued my route to where the canoes had been left. I arrived in safety at the outskirts of the wood close to the beach, and perceived the canoes still lying at the rocks, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> which they had been taken; but the moon shone bright, and I hesitated to walk out in the light, until I ascertained whether there were any islanders on the beach. As I waited a short time in the dark shade of the trees, close to one of the springs of fresh water, I heard a moan close to me, and looking in that direction I perceived a body on the ground. I went towards it, and could distinguish very plainly that it was one of the women who had swam on shore. She was nearly...", "...I laid me down; and it having been a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was surprised with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man call me by the name of \"Governor!

This wheel of spikes is carried round with the hour-hand, which in these clocks is generally a twenty-four hour one.

Taken unexpectedly, Caesar divides his cavalry also into three bodies, and opposes them <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the enemy. The combat engages on all sides; the column of the Roman army halts; the legions are brought into line, and the baggage placed in the intervals. This order, in which the legions were, no doubt, in column of three deep, was easy to execute, and presented the advantages of a square. Wherever the cavalry gives way or is too hotly pressed, Caesar sends to its support the cohorts, which he draws from the main body to range them in order of battle.[517] By this manoeuvre he...", "...The children must be saved if the nation is to prosper.

When my son told her he was her father, she was transported with joy, fancying that she was the daughter of Seri and sister to the Chevalier; she thought, too, that she would be legitimated immediately. When my son told her that could not be done, and that she was Desmarets' daughter, she wept excessively. Her mother had never been permitted to see her in the convent; the nuns would not have allowed it, and her presence would have been injurious <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the child. From the time she was born, her mother had not seen her until the present year (1719), when she saw her in a box at the theatre, and wept for joy. My son married this girl to the Marquis de Segur.

And thought proper consists in this affirmation of the object by the subject. Now, the subject, that is, man, must be as free in the affirmation of his thought, by which he thinks something, as he must be free in every one of his actions in order that his action be truly his, and really human.

Boyton had been told about the Hotspur by his agent who was on the other steamers and so, despite all the efforts of the captain and pilots of that boat, Paul kept the Idlewild and Mayflower between himself and her, in such a way that the people aboard of her could see nothing. For an hour or more, this amusing dance around the two steamers continued, until the Hotspur's captain, swearing and tramping his decks in a rage, ordered the boat back <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Evansville, and to make matters worse with him, he could not collect a cent from the people he had inveigled aboard, having lost his sunshade during the night, his eyes were almost blinded and his face scorched by the intense heat.

At first, however, he was concealed from them by a curtain wrought with pearls. But the grand vizier thrice prostrated himself <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the ground; and, as he did so, the traverse was drawn aside, and the caliph appeared arrayed in gorgeous robes, seated on a throne of gold, and surrounded by his eunuchs, who seemed both surprised and grieved to see Christians in that place and presence.

It led directly toward the claim of Peter Kaden, although the homestead lay beyond the creek. By following it, one could reach Kaden's house in about two-thirds the distance if going by trail. A few minutes later Jean Baptiste was speedily following the route that led <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the creek. He paused at intervals and upon listening could hear the hoof beats along the trail in the inevitable direction. He reached the creek in a short time, found his way across it, and once on the other side, he hurried through a school section to Kaden's cabin that was joined with this on the south. He crossed the school section quickly, and in the night air he could smell, and presently came to see, the smoke curling from the chimney. He approached the house cautiously.

If this apotheosis, moreover, were an actual future event, something every man and animal was some day to experience, evolution might really have a final goal, and might lead to a new and presumably better sort of existence--existence in the eternal. Somewhat in this fashion evolution is understood by the party that wish <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> combine it with a refreshed patristic theology. [Sidenote: The radical one.] There is an esoteric way, however, of taking these matters which is more in sympathy both with natural evolution and with transcendental philosophy. If we assert that evolution is infinite, no substantive goal can be set to it. The goal will be the process itself, if we could only open our eyes upon its beauty and necessity. The apotheosis will be retroactive, nay, it has already taken place. The...", "...every one else, and wonderful plans for the morrow. Mr. Merival always gave a packet of tea and sugar to some of the old women in the village on Christmas Eve, and all of these had been to the Vicarage that morning to fetch it, except one. She was a poor old body, who lived about a mile away, at the end of a wood, and was often too ill with rheumatism to venture out of doors.

Take it before dark.' 'All right, father; I'll do it when'--and Sibyl's voice was lost in the distance as she bounded out of doors. 'Little giddy-pate!' ejaculated her father; then, turning to Jean, he said,-- 'See that some one takes that tea to poor old Grannie, little one. I would not have her feel neglected for anything.' So saying, he departed, leaving the little girl in the hall.

Jack and Terence carried the survivors up to Kingston. Except that they uttered a few expressions of regret at the sad fate of their shipmates, the men seemed very little concerned, or grateful <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Heaven for their own preservation; and immediately on landing they went into a grog-shop, where they probably soon forgot all about the matter. Such is the force of habit. Jack and Terence were not enchanted with the silent, half-deserted streets of Kingston, through which, having lost their way, they paraded for half an hour or more; but after eating a pink-coloured shaddock, and half-a-dozen juicy oranges, obtained from a smiling-faced negress market-woman, their spirits...", "...\"if we can't buy one of them, we'll have to steal one, that's all.

All that remained <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be discussed was which player should be kidnapped, and there were various opinions on this point.

Now, do you think them gentlemen, who I've heard, was real respectable men, though it was rather a comedown to take to preaching, ever sported such an infernal broadbrim as that, or turned out a tail as broad as yours?\" The Quaker gentleman, who, at the commencement of the young scamp's speech, as if frightened at the prospect of a colloquy he had provoked, had betrayed a desire to escape from the crowd, seemed, as the other proceeded, to have changed his mind, and listened <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> him with the utmost calmness and imperturbable good humor. When the boy had got through with his impertinences, which he ran over with great volubility, garnishing them with many epithets we have omitted, and, at the close, had received the applause of those like him, who stood around, and, now, seemed waiting for a reply, the Quaker, with great sweetness, answered-- \"My young friend, it would ill become me to return a harsh word for thy rather rude address, nor will my feelings...", "...this deed that is open: and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. 32:15.

In 1845, largely by the agency of Mr. _Calhoun_, Texas, by an Act of Congress, was annexed to the United States.

The measure was strenuously opposed in the North as a scheme by which it was intended to strengthen the influence of the slaveholding States in Congress.

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES =1. Uncooked cheese.=--Serve a cream cheese with a salad of lettuce, and the imported cheeses with crackers and fruit for dessert. American cheese may be thinly sliced and used in sandwiches. A small piece of cheese with apple pie or pudding is an old-fashioned combination that is always agreeable, but sometimes difficult of digestion. =2. Cottage cheese.= Use sour milk that has set. Other ingredients: salt <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> taste, cayenne pepper or paprika, if liked. Quality and flavor are improved by the addition of a tablespoonful of butter or two tablespoonfuls of cream to a pint of the curd, but these are not necessary. Warm the milk slowly, until the whey begins to separate from the curd. If this process is continued too long, and the milk becomes hot, the curd will be tough.

This last you can keep by throwing a few spadefuls of soil over; let it pass out over the edges of your holes at least one foot. I have no doubt that the best time to plant is the fall, as, if left till spring, the trees are too far advanced before the frost is put of the ground; and by fall planting the soil gets settled about the roots, and they go on with the season. Trees cut like poles have another great advantage. For the first season they require no stakes <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> guard against the wind shaking them, which is a necessity with a top; for depend upon it, if your tree is allowed to sway with the wind, your roots will take very little hold that season, and may die, often the second year, from this very cause. All who try this system will find out that they will get a much prettier headed tree, and much sooner see a tree of beauty than by any other, as, when your roots have plenty of fibrous roots, and are in vigorous health, three years will...", "...that the advance of civilization depends on two conditions: first, that the course of evolution be accelerated, that the time allowed to the successive stages be shortened; and, secondly, that the unworthy and degrading elements which entered into the process of evolution in the past, and at the time were inseparable from it, be now eliminated.

Damp winds blowing against the cold mountains are chilled and the vapor is condensed. If one climbs through such a cloud, as thousands of people have done when climbing mountains, he often seems to pass through nothing but a fog, for really many clouds are only fogs high in the air. (Fig. 14). But very often rain falls from these clouds that cling to the mountain sides. The reason for this is easy <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> understand. As the air comes against the cold mountains so much vapor is condensed that some of the tiny fog particles grow larger and larger until they become mist particles, which are too heavy to float in the air. They then begin to settle; and as one particle strikes against another, the two unite, and this continues until perhaps a dozen have joined together so as to form a good-sized drop, which is so heavy that it is obliged to fall to the ground as rain.

The liking had ripened into an attachment, firm and lasting--a child's attachment: but Florence grew into a woman, and it could not remain such. Thrown much together, the feeling had changed, and love mutually arose: they fell into it unconsciously. Was it quite prudent of Mr. Hunter <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> sanction, nay, to court the frequent presence at his house of Austin Clay? Did he overlook the obvious fact, that he was one who possessed attractions, both of mind and person, and that Florence was now a woman grown?

His version was slavishly literal, following the Hebrew idiom even where it is contrary <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> that of the Greek.

Your readers may be curious to see a list of the persons composing the domestic establishment (as it may be called) of Queen Elizabeth in the middle of her reign, and an account of the sums of money severally allowed to them out of the privy purse of the sovereign. The payments will seem remarkably small, even allowing for the great difference in the value of money then and now. What that difference may be, I am not prepared <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> say; and I will venture here to put it as a \"Query,\" to be answered by some competent person who may read this \"Note.\" I have seen it stated by more than one writer, that the difference in the value of money at the end of Elizabeth's reign was at least five times, i.e. that one pound then would go as far as five pounds now; but I am not aware of the _data_ upon which the calculation was made. I apprehend, besides, that the difference was greater in 1582, to which what follows...", "...bulwarks, and moved by paddle-wheels turned by a crank, now arrived at Zoetermeer, and was soon followed by the whole fleet.

Without further impediment, the armada proceeded <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> North Aa; the enemy retreating from this position also, and flying to Zoeterwoude, a strongly fortified village but a mile and three quarters from the city walls. It was now swarming with troops, for the bulk of the besieging army had gradually been driven into a narrow circle of forts, within the immediate neighbourhood of Leyden. Besides Zoeterwoude, the two posts where they were principally established were Lammen and Leyderdorp, each within three hundred rods of the town.

He said that if the past could be pardoned, his tribe was ready not only to relinquish all acts of hostility, but to take up arms against King Philip. Captain Church promised to meet them again in two days at Richmond's Farm, upon this long neck of land. He then hastened <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Rhode Island, procured an interview with the governor, and endeavored to obtain authority to enter into a treaty with these Indians. The governor would not give his consent, affirming that it was an act of madness in Captain Church to trust himself among the Saconets.

It is this ingredient in fox-hunting--viz: the consciousness of having <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> do with a foe worthy of him, which brings men of all ages, sorts, kinds, intellects, characters, and professions to the covert side, uniting together occasionally as odd an assemblage as ever went into the ark.

The games which attract so many thousands to the Alps in winter are in no cases peculiar <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Switzerland, and are rarely indigenous. Tobogganing and ski-ing, like mountain-climbing (as a pleasure), have been introduced to Switzerland by visitors. Even skating does not seem to have been much favoured by the Swiss until there came the great modern incursion of tourists, seeking not an asylum from religious or political persecution, nor the pleasure of seeing Voltaire or Madame de Stael, but ice sports under a bright sun in mid-winter. The Swiss National Sports make a short...", "...Though the morning was chill, Mrs. Galland, in a heavy coat, was seated outside the tower door, beatifically calm and smiling; for she would miss rejoicing over no detail of the spectacle. The battle's sounds were sweet music--symphony of retribution. Oh, if her husband and her father could only be with her to see the ancient enemy in flight! Her cheeks were rosy with the happy thrumming of her heart; a delirious beat was in her temples. She wanted to sing and cheer and give thanks <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the Almighty. The advancing bursts of billowy shrapnel down the slopes were a heavenly nimbus to her eyes. She breathed a silent blessing on a manoeuvring Brown dirigible. They were coming! The soldiers of her people were coming to take back their own from the robber hosts and restore her hearth to her.

And then she became quite sure of what she had suspected from the beginning. She understood into what company she had been inveigled by the concierge's wife. She had, however, sufficient self-control <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> finish the quadrille.

The most trying ordeal that I was forced to endure as a slave boy, however, was the wearing of a flax shirt. In the portion of Virginia where I lived it was common to use flax as part of the clothing for the slaves.

I can scarcely imagine any torture, except, perhaps, the pulling of a tooth, that is equal <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> that caused by putting on a new flax shirt for the first time. It is almost equal to the feeling that one would experience if he had a dozen or more chestnut burrs, or a hundred small pinpoints in contact with his flesh. Even to this day, I can recall accurately the tortures that I underwent when putting on one of these garments. The fact that my flesh was soft and tender added to the pain. But I had no choice.

The first observation which must strike the mind of every thinker is the fact that the primary analysis--the main classification which has been adopted of studies which ought to be framed <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> fit the students for \"complete living\"--is one of \"words,\" _i. e._, the tools of knowledge, instead of knowledge itself. Or in the words of the Report: \"There are two courses of studies--ancient and modern--differing only in the languages studied.\" On examining the course for the introductory and freshman classes, a feeling of astonishment must fill the mind at the marked want of wisdom by which it was dictated, but which at the same time affords a sufficient explanation for the...", "...luminaries, when the dawn was already grown strong enough to show me, and to suffer me to recognise, a solitary figure standing by the piles.

By such means only could the disorderly force of popular movements be controlled and restrained within fixed limits. The Civil Government of the Roman States required <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be entirely reorganized. To this task also the minister diligently applied, impressed with the conviction that good laws are at once the strongest bulwark of liberty, and the most efficient check to arbitrary power.

Coryon saw it too, and, with a shout, and many threats, urged the other man to push out the plank; but, instead, he started back in terror, and only just in time to escape a second bullet that came singing past his ears and wounded a soldier standing near. Coryon, mad with rage and disappointed malice, snatched a spear from a soldier beside him, and ordered others in front of him <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> seize the plank and push it out, prodding at them with the spear to force obedience; but one, who stepped forward at his bidding, fell before he could reach the plank.

But the conclusions of composure were the same as those of excitement.

He was a prisoner, whose only privilege was a larger but most uncertain liberty. And that liberty was becoming penetratingly uncomfortable. An hour had passed, the ground on which he sat was wet and cold, and the misty air was assuming a distressing kinship with departed winter and was making shivering assaults upon his bones. At the best, he realized, he could not hope to remain secure in this cultivated wilderness beyond daylight.

The old party names of Whig and Tory had been dropped and the two parties had assumed their present appellations of Conservatives and Liberals. Both parties had, however, learned that there was no rest for any ruling party except a popular basis, and the Conservative party had the good sense to strengthen itself in 1867 by carrying through Mr. Disraeli's bill, which gave the franchise in boroughs <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> all householders paying rates, and in counties to all occupiers of property rated at fifteen pounds a year. This broadening of the suffrage places the power irrevocably in the hands of the people, against whose judgment neither crown nor ministry can venture on any important step.

Palaeoliths had often been obtained from the same stratum as that which yielded the human teeth. Dr Weiss referred it to the first, i.e. the earlier of two inter-glacial periods judged to have occurred in this region. The associated fauna includes _Elephas antiquus_, _Rhinoceros merckii_, _Bison priscus_, with Cervidae and representatives of swine, beaver and a bear. The similarity of this assemblage <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> that of the Mauer Sands has been noted already. The hippopotamus however does not seem to have been recorded in either locality. Nevertheless, the general aspect of the mammalian fauna is 'southern' (_faune chaude_ of French writers).

Mohammed Ali had constantly expressed a desire to halt, but his guide would not allow him to dismount, except at certain places, saying, \"I am commander here;\" and <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> this Mohammed Ali had willingly consented, for he well knew that a refusal to do as he was told by the sheikh of the desert, in that awful wilderness, might have been followed by very serious results.

Stone in the bladder may be discovered, and the condition and movements of the heart and lungs ascertained. This new kind of light ray was discovered November 8, 1895, by Prof. W. C.

As before stated, a peculiar quality of the X-Rays is that they are not visible to the eye. A beam of X-Rays, thrown into a dark chamber through an aluminum window, would produce no illumination whatever in the room, but such rays would still penetrate the room, and if a fluorescing screen were placed in their path it would instantly light up. It is not surprising, therefore, that these subtle rays should have so long eluded the observation of...", "...hit in the body but it is all right for a head shot. It makes slightly more noise than a .22 pistol but it is a soft noise and does not travel far.

After all, hitting the bird at forty or fifty yards off with a pistol takes some doing, whereas with a telescopic sighted rifle the shot would be a certainty. The pistol is very little used for what seems to me <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be a very useful function. When shooting big game there are many occasions when another shot has to be fired at wounded game unable to get away. Say a wild boar for instance is brought to bay by the first shot. He cannot be approached with safety to use the knife, he is killing the dogs, he has to be shot again.

We could see the Dutchmen, match in hand, at their guns on the sea side, and very much surprised were they <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> find us in their rear, knocking them down right and left, before they had time to fire a shot. They cried for quarter, and we had sixty of them prisoners in a few minutes.

The admission of Missouri to statehood and the independence of Mexico mark the beginning of real commercial relations between St. Louis and Santa Fe. In 1822 Captain William Becknell organized the first wagon train which left the Missouri (at Franklin, near Independence) for the long dangerous journey to the Arkansas and on to Santa Fe. In the following year two expeditions set forth, carrying out cottons and other drygoods <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> exchange for horses, mules, furs, and silver. Despite the handicaps of Indian opposition and Mexican tariffs, the Santa Fe trade became an important factor in the growth of St. Louis and the Missouri River steamboat lines. In 1825 the pathway was \"surveyed\" from Franklin to San Fernando, then in Mexico. This Santa Fe trade grew from fifteen thousand pounds of freight in 1822 to nearly half a million pounds twenty years later. By 1826 steamboat traffic up the Missouri began to...", "...one capacious pocket was filled with them, and those just made lay in a neat heap for hasty collection.

The scheme that eventually took shape was Colonel Hunter's. His idea was to have three \"blocking hospitals\" in the north of Serbia, which, when the planned autumn offensive of the Serbs took place, would keep all infectious diseases from spreading throughout the country.

It was only after many glorious victories that they yielded <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> a crushingly superior force. They accumulated a store of fame and national consciousness which makes them, though conquered, a power to be reckoned with.

Naturally there is an increasing vagueness as one recedes farther into the past, and for the earlier history of Chaldaea there is great uncertainty. Nevertheless, the Assyriologist speaks with a good deal of confidence of dates as remote as 3800 B.C., the time ascribed to King Sargon, who was once regarded as a mythical person, but is now known <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have been an actual monarch. Indeed, there are tablets in the British Museum labelled 4500 B.C.; and later researches, particularly those of the expedition of the University of Pennsylvania at Nippur, have brought us evidence which, interpreted with the aid of estimates as to the average rate of accumulation of dust deposits, leads to the inference that a high state of civilization had been attained in Mesopotamia at least 9000 years ago.

According to Purchas, Mr Edward Terry was master of arts, and a student of Christ Church in Oxford, and went out <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> India as chaplain to Sir Thomas Roe. In the first subdivision of this narrative, we have combined the observations of Captain Alexander Childe, who was commander of the ship James, during the same voyage, under Captain Benjamin Joseph, of the ship Charles, who was slain in a sea-fight with a Portuguese carack, off one of the Komoro islands. The notes extracted by Purchas from the journal of Captain Childe,[223] are so short and unsatisfactory, that we have been induced to suppress...", "...disgraced. As soon as he was gone, M. de Vendome wrote to the King, saying, that he was sure of preventing the enemy from passing the Escaut--that he answered for it on his head. With such a guarantee from a man in such favour at Court, who could doubt? Yet, shortly after, Marlborough crossed the Escaut in four places, and Vendome actually wrote to the King, begging him to remember that he had always declared the defence of the Escaut to be, impossible! The cabal made a great noise <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> cover this monstrous audacity, and endeavoured to renew the attack against the Duc de Bourgogne. We shall see what success attended their efforts. The army was at Soissons, near Tournai, in a profound tranquillity, the opium of which had gained the Duc de Bourgogne when news of the approach of the enemy was brought. M. de Vendome advanced in that direction, and sent word to the Duke, that he thought he ought to advance on the morrow with all his army. The Duke was going to bed when...", "...just now. Gilberte has never been so nice as this. She never is out of humor, never gets angry. I feel that she loves me; until now I was not sure of it.\" Julien also seemed changed, no longer impatient, as though the friendship between the two families had brought peace and happiness to both. The spring was singularly early and mild. Everything seemed to be coming to life beneath the quickening rays of the sun. Jeanne was vaguely troubled at this awakening of nature. Memories came <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> her of the early days of her love. Not that her love for Julien was renewed; that was over, over forever. But all her being, caressed by the breeze, filled with the fragrance of spring, was disturbed as though in response to some invisible and tender appeal. She loved to be alone, to give herself up in the sunlight to all kinds of vague and calm enjoyment which did not necessitate thinking. One morning as she was in a reverie a vision came to her, a swift vision of the sunlit...", "...way around his wrist. Then he took it off carefully, dropped it on the floor with the others, and at once went to work whittling a new one. \"Let's see the article,\" said Winthrop. Harley handed it to him and he read it carefully. \"A fine piece of work,\" he said; \"who wrote it--you or Redfield?\" \"Oh, we did it together,\" replied Harley with a smile of appreciation. Redfield uttered a denial, but it was too late. \"A fine piece of work,\" repeated Winthrop, \"admirably adapted <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the kindling of fires. Unfortunately my fire is already kindled, but it can help on the good cause.\" With that he cast the paper into the stove. Harley uttered an oath. \"What do you mean?\" he cried. \"I mean that you can't use my paper to gratify your private revenge. If you want to do that sort of thing you must get a newspaper of your own.\" \"I think you are infernally impertinent.\" \"And I think, Vincent Harley, that you are a damned fool. You want a duel with the man...", "...effect at the end. For instance, in \"A Woman Of No Importance\" Lord Illingworth's casual remark--\"Oh, no one--a woman of no importance,\" which brings down the curtain on the first act, is used with a slight alteration at the end of the play in Mrs Arbuthnot's reply to Gerald's inquiry as to who her visitor has been, \"Ah, no one--a man of no importance.\" In the same way Salome's reiterated cry, \"I will kiss the mouth of Jokanaan,\" in her scene with the prophet gives added strength <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> her bitterly triumphant cry as, holding the severed head in her hands, she repeats at three different intervals, \"I have kissed thy mouth, Jokanaan.\" Apart from all questions of stage technique, Wilde had the incomparable gift of finding _le mot juste_, of conveying a portrait in half-a-dozen words. Could anything give one a more distinct portrait of Herod than Salome's description of his \"mole's eyes under his shaking eyelids,\" or would it be possible to explain Herod's passion...", "...on the floor of the Senate as his thinking organs. You broke down in your great speech, did you? Yes, your grandfather had an attack of dyspepsia in '82, after working too hard on his famous Election Sermon. All this does not touch the main fact: our scholars come chiefly from a privileged order, just as our best fruits come from well-known grafts, though now and then a seedling apple, like the Northern Spy, or a seedling pear, like the Seckel, springs from a nameless ancestry and grows <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be the pride of all the gardens in the land. Let me introduce you to a young man who belongs to the Brahmin caste of New England. CHAPTER II. THE STUDENT AND HIS CERTIFICATE. Bernard C. Langdon, a young man attending Medical Lectures at the school connected with one of our principal colleges, remained after the Lecture one day and wished to speak with the Professor. He was a student of mark,--first favorite of his year, as they say of the Derby colts. There are in...", "...famine would soon pounce on its victims. Fortunately, the indefatigable Pedrito had an idea which he communicated to Major Bloomfield. He had a hundred and fifty loaves worked up with arsenic, water, and vitriol mingled with twenty barrels of spirits; the whole loaded on mules, was placed under the escort of Pedrito and his two brothers. The bomberos approached the Patagonian earthworks with this frugal stock of provisions. The Indians, who are passionately fond of firewater, rushed <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> meet the caravan, and seize the barrels. Pedrito and his brothers left their burden lying on the sand, and returned to the town at a gallop with the mules, which were intended to support the besieged, if the Patagonians did not make the assault. There was a high holiday in the camp. The loaves were cut up; the heads of the barrels stove in, and nothing was left. This orgy cost the Indians six thousand men, who died in atrocious tortures. The others, struck with horror, began...", "...end of his four-year term. This would permit a continuous policy and an unbroken line of action which, according to his view, would make for the efficiency of the operating force. In speaking of this phase of the matter, he stated that were a new man chosen at the end of the four-year term of his predecessor--a man who had had no previous experience on the Isthmus--there would always be a tendency to make radical changes. He would have on the governor's staff a doctor from the Army <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have charge of the work of sanitation on the Canal Zone, who would report directly to the governor. The quarantine officer, in his opinion, should be under the Public Health Service of the United States. Under the plan as adopted in the permanent canal law, any officer of the Army or of the Navy chosen to fill a position in the canal operating force will be paid the same salary as a civilian, with the exception that he would get only the difference between his regular Army or Navy...", "...sigh of relief was heard but misunderstood. He might be saved after all. The stock had started to go down and there seemed no reason why it should stop. As he intended to purchase no more it was fair to assume that the backbone was at the breaking point. The crash was bound to come. He could hardly restrain a cry of joy. Even while he stood at the ticker the little instrument began to tell of a further decline. As the price went down his hopes went up. The bystanders were beginning <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be disgusted. \"It was only a fluke after all,\" they said to each other. Colonel Drew was appealed to urge Monty to save himself, and he was on the point of remonstrance when the message came that the threatened strike was off, and that the men were willing to arbitrate. Almost before one could draw breath this startling news began to make itself felt. The certainty of a great strike was one of the things that had made Brewster sure that the price could not hold. With this danger...", "...TEST OF FRIENDSHIP. BRIGHTEST shine the stars above When the night is darkest round us; Those the friends we dearest love Who were near when sorrow bound us. When no clouds o'ercast our sky, When no evil doth attend us, Then will many gather nigh, Ever ready to befriend us. But when darkness shades our path, When misfortune hath its hour, When we lie beneath its wrath, Some will leave us <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> its power. Often have we seen at night, When the clouds have gathered o'er us, One lone star send forth its light, Marking out the path before us. Like that star some friendly eye Will beam on us in our sorrow; And, though clouded be our sky, We know there'll be a better morrow. We know that all will not depart, That some will, gather round to cheer us: Know we, in our inmost heart, Tried and faithful...", "...sink all internal differences, and give his best support to the Government of his country.

The voyage might last three years; and I should be legally a man, my own master, and Lucy a young woman of near nineteen, by that time. Terrible ages in perspective were these, and which seemed to us pregnant with as many changes as the life of a man. \"Rupert will be admitted to the bar, when I get back,\" I casually remarked, as we talked the matter over. \"He will, indeed,\" the dear girl answered. \"Now you _are_ to go, Miles, I almost regret my brother is not <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be in the ship; you have known each other so long, love each other so much, and have already gone through such frightful trials in company.\" \"Oh! I shall do well enough--there'll be Neb; and as for Rupert, I think he will be better satisfied ashore than at sea. Rupert is a sort of a natural lawyer.\" By this I merely meant he was good at a subterfuge, and could tell his own story. \"Yes, but Neb is not Rupert, Miles,\" Lucy answered, quick as thought, and, I fancied, a little...", "...Mrs. Mainwaring soothed her as well as she could, but she refused to hear comfort, and having desired Alley Mahon to prepare their slight luggage, she took an affectionate and tearful leave of Mrs. Mainwaring, bade _adieu_ to her husband, and was about to get into the chaise, which had been ordered from the inn in Wicklow, when Mrs. Mainwaring said: \"Now, my dear Lucy, if your father should recover, and have recourse to any abuse of his authority, by attempting again <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> force your inclinations and consummate your misery, remember that my door, my arms, my heart, shall ever be open to you. I do not, you will observe, suggest any act of disobedience on your part; on the contrary, I am of opinion that you should suffer everything short of the last resort, by which I mean this hateful marriage with Dunroe, sooner than abandon your father's roof. This union is a subject on which I must see him again.

After the feast the story, and after the story the song.\" Hermes seemed to have \"explained everything\" quite fully; for when Gerald and Jimmy in marble whiteness arrived, each clinging to one of the god's winged feet, and so borne through the air, they were certainly quite at ease. They made their best bows <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the goddesses and took their places as unembarrassed as though they had had Olympian suppers every night of their lives. Hebe had woven wreaths of roses ready for them, and as Kathleen watched them eating and drinking, perfectly at home in their marble, she was very glad that amid the welling springs of immortal peach-juice she had not forgotten her brothers. \"And now,\" said Hera, when the boys had been supplied with everything they could possibly desire, and more than they could...", "...that since life like a river is flowing, I care not how fast it rolls on, ma'am, on, while such purl on the bank still is growing, and such eyes light the waves as they run.

The Marchioness nodded. \"Ha!\" said Mr. Swiveller with a portentous frown. \"'Tis well, Marchioness!--but no matter. Some wine there. Ho!\" He illustrated these...", "...who was lost. \"If you seek me, Laban, I am here,\" replied Merapi, speaking from the shadow of the cloak. \"What do you there alone with an Egyptian, Merapi?\" he said fiercely. What followed I do not know for they spoke so quickly in their unfamiliar tongue that I could not understand them. At length Merapi turned to the Prince, saying: \"Lord, this is Laban my affianced, who commands me to descend from the chariot and accompany him as best I can.\" \"And I, Lady, command you <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> stay in it. Laban your affianced can accompany us.\" Now at this Laban grew angry, as I could see he was prone to do, and stretched out his hand as though to push Seti aside and seize Merapi. \"Have a care, man,' said the Prince, while I, throwing down the straw, drew my sword and sprang between them, crying: \"Slave, would you lay hands upon the Prince of Egypt?\" \"Prince of Egypt!\" he said, drawing back astonished, then added sullenly, \"Well what does the Prince of Egypt with...", "...and, from a practical point of view, it coincides with the fact that such a large amount of energy can be stored in our most intense explosives such as dynamite, the explanation being that hydrogen is attached to carbon distant from oxygen in the same molecule, and that only the characteristic resistance of the carbon linkage prevents the hydrogen from burning, which is the main occurrence in the explosion of dynamite. The possession of this peculiar property by carbon seems <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be related to its high valency, amounting to four; and, generally, when we consider the most primitive expression of isomerism, viz. the allotropy of elements, we meet this increasing resistance with increasing valency. The monovalent iodine, for instance, is transformed by heating into an allotropic form, corresponding to the formula I, whereas ordinary iodine answers to I2. Now these modifications show hardly any tendency to persist, the one stable at high temperatures being...", "...the fourteenth day being such a black one, we must all make the most of the few hours that come before it. At nine o'clock of that miserable morning the packing of our lads into the train will commence, but until then they are making merry, bless them! They are true Hungarians, you know! They will dance, and they will sing, they will listen to gipsy music and kiss the girls so long as there is breath in their body, so long as they are free to do it. At nine o'clock to-day they cease <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be free men, they are under the orders of corporals and sergeants and officers who will command them to go \"Vorwaerts\" and \"Rechts\" and \"Links\" and all that God-forsaken gibberish, and put them in irons and on bread and water if they do not obey.

The like pretension is put forward by Plato in the Philebus[128] on behalf of dialectic; which he designates as the science of all real, permanent, unchangeable, Entia. Taking Dialectic as the maximum or Verissimum, Plato classifies other sciences or cognitions according as they approach closer <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> it in truth or exactness--according as they contain more of precise measurement and less of conjecture. Sciences or cognitions are thus classified according as they are more or less true and pure. But because this principle of classification is fairly applicable to cognitions, Plato conceives that it may be made applicable to Pleasures also. One characteristic feature of the Philebus is the attempt to apply the predicates, _true_ or _false_, to pleasures and pains, as they are...", "...not an umbrella but a cobra's hood. Even after it had ceased to be the exclusive appanage of the king, the umbrella was a sign of noble rank, and not permitted to the commonalty.

Again: such an explanation of the motive for embalming cannot be correct, because in the hieroglyphic representations of the passage to the judgment the separate soul is often depicted as hovering over the body, 6 or as kneeling before the judges, or as pursuing its adventures through the various realms of the creation. \"When the body is represented,\" Champollion says, \"it is as an aid <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the spectator, and not as teaching a bodily resurrection.

The young lady rested at the public house; while the Professor walked with Toney and his companions to the river, where they hired canoes to convey them <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Chagres. While they were bargaining with the negroes who were to row them down the river, the Professor uttered a number of jokes, which satisfied Tom that he was going to be an agreeable fellow again.

Celia could scarcely refrain from singing; she walked quickly, and sometimes, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Roddy's delight, she ran races with him.

Through the lewdness of the _Mimis_ and _mimas_ in Pantomime, their dress, or rather lack of dress, Pantomimes were denounced, not only by the early Christian writers, but also by some of the Pagan writers, like Juvenal, as being very prejudicial to morality.

Prior to this ceremony he went through a special purificatory rite, immersing himself in the sea, an act <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> which the Greeks attributed great virtue. He had to be exemplary in his moral conduct, and was regarded by the people as being particularly holy.

But it is supposed to lie in the nature of the man who utters, as also in the circumstance in which it is uttered: for Bishop Blougram was suggested by Cardinal Wiseman;[57] and the literary hack, Gigadibs, is the kind of critic by whom a Cardinal Wiseman is most likely to be assailed: a man young, shallow, and untried; unused to any but paper warfare; blind <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the deeper issues of both conformity and dissent, and as much alive to the distinction of dining in a bishop's palace as Bishop Blougram himself. The monologue is spoken on such an occasion, and includes everything which Mr. Gigadibs says, or might say, on his own side of the question. We must therefore treat it as a conversation. Mr. Gigadibs' reasoning resolves itself into this: \"_he_ does not believe in dogmas, and he says so.

The writer himself still carries a lively impression of a fight carried on with these missiles. The scene of this skirmish, which took place when he was a boy, was near the seashore of a village on the Bosphorus, where he and one or two English boys met a squad of Turkish children. The latter took refuge behind a row of Turkish houses, and stones were thrown by both parties over the roofs.

Madam Bowker seated herself with much ceremony. \"Now!\" said she. \"We will rearrange the room.

Nevertheless he had rightly chosen this difficult form in which to express his inner self.

He had fought his fight and suffered defeat, and had then withdrawn himself silently from the field <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> die.

He was a handsome young knight, much in favour with his sovereign, in whose court he had a mistress, whom he loved with infinite tenderness, and who was the daughter of Monsieur de Montmorency, a lord whose domains bordered upon those of the house of l'Ile Adam. To this penniless cadet the king had given certain missions <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the duchy of Milan, of which he had acquitted himself so well that he was sent to Rome to advance the negotiations concerning which historians have written so much in their books.

In this frontier town, the reports of bands of hostile Indians coming to raid and kill were not uncommon. The single man, active, mounted, armed with weapons as familiar to him as his right hand, had no fear of not being able to outwit or escape the enemy, wily as the redskins were. In fact, the Indians themselves were well aware of the ability of the plainsmen <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> cope with them when unhampered by women and children, so they practically never began hostilities until they could get their white enemies at a disadvantage. The few families were, therefore, their especial point of attack. It was their helplessness that tempted the onslaught and aroused the savage instincts of these marauders.

In an instant the child was in his mother's arms; and when her passionate caresses had expressed her joy, she waved with a graceful salutation to the Englishman, and bent <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the ground in token of gratitude. Then she looked at the beads, and her white teeth glittered as she smiled a sunny smile of delight and admiration at what seemed to her such priceless treasures. Rodolph drew from the pouch which hung at his leathern belt a string of beads more brilliant still, and held them towards the woman. She gazed at them, and then at the frank and open countenance of the stranger; and fear gave way to the desire of possessing the offered gift. She slowly...", "...wondered vaguely.

This is probably due to several causes, but principally to the fact that during active exertion of the body the brain cannot be employed intensely, and therefore has secured to it a state of repose which even sleep is not always competent to supply.

When Mr. Hummel should enter his garden on his birthday he should find the round bed changed into a blooming circle of roses. This thought occasioned Mr. Hahn happy hours, and raised him a little from the depth of his sorrows. He carried the roses into a concealed corner, arranged them in rank and file according <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> their size and color, and wrote their numbers with chalk on the pots. The park-keeper, whose house stood at the extreme limit of the city by the river, had a little boat; this Mr. Hahn borrowed secretly for a few hours in the night.

The 1,500 pounds of gold are now also equal to only 15,000 pounds of silver, and _vice versa_. I would put very important limitations to this assertion. Even a moderate depreciation of gold would drive out the silver from all those countries which had a mixed coinage made up of the two metals; and hence the supply of silver would be increased in the other countries. And so it is quite possible, up <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> a certain point, that the larger silver coin should be replaced by small gold ones, ten and five franc pieces etc. Rau is certainly right in his surmise that a general rise in the price of commodities as compared with coin, the result of a great increase of gold, would go farthest in countries in which the gold is the medium of circulation, begin later in those which had a mixed circulation, and continue for the the shortest time in those countries which, by force of law, had a...", "...angry with Sybil, and determined to write to her before the day ended.

He revered her as one sacred <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> heaven, upon whom death had already set the seal of eternity, and, far from weeping over her early grave, he exulted at her triumphant flight to the judgment-seat of God. Two long years crept by, and the imperialists were still before Rome.

There can be no doubt, however, that such adulteration has now long ceased to be practised to any extent. Nevertheless, it may be of use to draw attention to one or two of the tests by means of which some of the commoner forms of adulteration may be detected. One or two are extremely easily detected--as, for example, adulteration with sand or other mineral substances. In such a case, the percentage of ash left on burning a small portion of the guano will be found <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be excessive. The percentage of ash in a sample of genuine Peruvian guano should not exceed from 50 to 60 per cent. The colour of the ash is another important point, and may serve as a further indication of adulteration. In the case of genuine guano, this should be whitish or greyish. Red-coloured ash generally points to the adulteration of the guano with some mineral substance containing iron--such, _e.g._, as Redonda phosphate, a mineral phosphate of iron and alumina.

He also spied among these some pieces of velvet, satin, and damask. This made him ask the new-comers whither and <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> whom they were going to carry those dainty goods.

THE MASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY (Aug. 24, 1572).--Before the festivities which followed the nuptial ceremonies were over, the world was shocked by one of the most awful crimes of which history has to tell,--the massacre of the Huguenots in Paris on St. Bartholomew's Day. The circumstances which led <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> this fearful tragedy were as follows: Among the Protestant nobles who came up to Paris to attend the wedding was the Admiral Coligny. Upon coming in contact with Charles IX., the Admiral secured almost immediately an entire ascendency over his mind. This influence Coligny used to draw the king away from the queen-mother and the Guises. Fearing the loss of her influence over her son, Catherine resolved upon the death of the Admiral. The attempt miscarried, Coligny receiving only a...", "...however, that he had learned to feel that a man's final duty here on earth is his duty to other men.

There is a charming passage, in which we are told not to devote the rich things of the earth to the gods. Gold and silver will create impure desire.

It is love which is constructive; hate destroys even the very object that evokes and {27} sustains it.

Where the motive of life thus freely expresses itself, there are no natural enemies. I count it to be important thus <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> trace morality back to the original love of life, since only so is it possible to understand its urgency, and its continuity with every organic impulse. It is because morality is without warrant dislocated from the natural life, that it is accused of being barren and formal.

With the free growth of his natural humour he has attained a power of self-appreciation which is unerring.

This, she thought, could best be effected by women improving their work--ceasing <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be amateurs. But it was one of the most distinctly marked traits in her character that she particularly disliked everything generally associated with the idea of a \"masculine woman.\" She was, and as a woman she wished to be, above all things, feminine--\"so delicate with her needle, and an admirable musician.\" She was proud, too, of being an excellent housekeeper--an excellence attained from knowing how things ought to be done, from her early...", "...of the Church, rejuvenated by the Council of Trent, gave birth to new forces in theology. The mighty tomes of men like _Suarez_, _Lugo_, _Gregory of Valencia_, _Ruiz_, _Banez_, _Billuart_, and others joined the volumes of their predecessors and continued their work. At the same time the various departments of the science were branching off more and more, and became independent. _M. Canus_ created the theory of theological cognition as an introduction <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> dogmatics, _Bellarmin_ and _Th. Stapleton_ founded the newer controversial theology. Moral Theology became in the sixteenth century a separate science and was developed by men like _Lugo_, _Laymann_, _Busembaum_, _Alphons of Liguori_. Similarly a new period of research began in the biblical sciences. Not that the first foundations were laid at that time; there had been _Origines_, who had become the founder of biblical text criticism by his \"Hexapla\"; the...", "...he affixed his own name for the first time. \"The Lily's Quest\" had appeared, January 19, 1839. in \"The Southern Rose,\" published at Charleston, South Carolina.

Here he had written, in 1835, \"In this dismal chamber fame was won.\" A dismal sort of fame he thought it then. It was on returning <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> it in 1840 that he penned the well-known passage:-- \"Here I sit in my old, accustomed chamber, where I used to sit in days gone by.... Here I have written many tales,--many that have been burned to ashes, many that doubtless deserved the same fate.

It may therefore be said that every commanding officer ought to know the divisions and brigades of his enemy. The strength of a brigade is fairly estimated from the average of our own, for in people of similar race and education, the models of organization are essentially the same, and subject <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the same causes of diminution during a campaign. Such considerations as these leave no escape from the conclusion that McClellan's estimates of Lee's army were absolutely destructive of all chances of success, and made it impossible for the President or for General Halleck to deal with the military problem before them. That he had continued this erroneous counting for more than a year, and through an active campaign in the field, destroyed every hope of correcting it.

Of that I felt absolutely convinced. But what discovery did she dread? While we were bending, examining the contents of one of the drawers, which was full of papers relating <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the Colonel's duty as a justice of the peace--for it was here that he performed his judicial work--his widow stood behind me, and, with a quick movement, sidled up to her stepson.

He said huskily, \"Something's very queer about them.... Wait. I've _got_ to take a look.\" Qanya glanced at him in quick alarm as he started wriggling <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the crest of the sandhill.

This Whiteside letter put Paine, and through him Monroe, on a false scent by suggesting that the difficulty of his case lay in a _bona fide_ question of citizenship, whereas there never had been really any such question.

There were thus more delays, inexplicable alike to Monroe and <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Paine, eliciting from the latter some heartbroken letters, not hitherto printed, which I add at the end of the Memorial. To add to the difficulties and dangers, Paris was beginning to be agitated by well-founded rumors of Jay's injurious negotiations in England, and a coldness towards Monroe was setting in.

She had been frightened out of her life and still felt cruelly shaken, but her quick sense of the ridiculous protested against this deference paid to her when she wasn't really hurt and it was all her own fault.

To that chapter the reader who desires <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> recall the information given on the subject, is referred. Here, after a brief account of the additions made to the Theodosian walls, in subsequent times, we shall consider the historical importance of the landward walls as a whole, and glance at some of the scenes enacted before them.

THAT was what came of my intended self-justification and plea for mercy! THAT was the only answer that I had to return <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> my chief! The sequel I shudder to relate. At once his Excellency's attention became drawn to my figure and costume. I remembered what I had seen in the mirror, and hastened to pursue the button.

The goldsmith recognized the silver chain as one he had recently sold to a lady, and his suspicions were aroused. On reference <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> her she denounced Day as a swindler, who had cheated her out of a large sum of money. Day was forthwith arrested and sent to Newgate. At his trial he declared that he meant to pay for everything he had ordered, that he owned an estate in Durham worth L1200 a year, but that it was heavily mortgaged.

Today the prescribed days of fast for the whole Church are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday (these are also days of abstinence). However the Church today says that the meaning of the law of fasting during Lent remains, although the extent of the obligation has been changed. In other words, Lent remains as a season of penance in the Church, but how it is to be observed is greatly up <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the individual, though no one may think himself excused from all penance whatsoever, and those who are in the fasting age group should still practice the Church's form of fasting, since fasting is a primary and very efficacious form of penance.

Tarquin being universally detested for his tyranny and cruelty, was expelled the city, with his wife and family, on account of the violence offered by his son Sextus <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Lucretia, a noble lady, the wife of Collatinus. This revolution was brought about chiefly by means of Lucius Junius Brutus. The haughtiness and cruelty of Tarquin inspired the Romans with the greatest aversion to regal government, which they retained ever after. In the two hundred and forty-fourth year from the building of the city, they elected two magistrates, of equal authority, and gave them the name of consuls.

Goethe, the great genius of Germany, declared in his eighty-first year that it was his delight at the age of twenty, that it had in a manner formed a part of his education, influencing his taste and feelings throughout life, and that he had recently read it again from beginning to end--with renewed delight, and with a grateful sense of the early benefit derived from it. It is needless to expatiate upon the qualities of a work which has thus passed from country <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> country, and language to language, until it is now known throughout the whole reading world, and is become a household book in every hand. The secret of its universal and enduring popularity is undoubtedly its truth to nature, but to nature of the most amiable kind; to nature such as Goldsmith saw it.

Further proof of Sun Tzu's antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be extended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected thereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the 13 chapters <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> belong to the early part of the fifth century.

She took Fanny's two hands and pressed them warmly between her own; then led her into the house with an arm passed about her waist. She shook hands with Hosmer, and stood for a while in cheerful conversation, before leaving them. The cottage was fully equipped for their reception, with Minervy in possession of the kitchen and the formerly reluctant Suze as housemaid: though Therese had been silent as <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the methods which she had employed to prevail with these unwilling damsels. Hosmer then went out to look after their baggage, and when he returned, Fanny sat with her head pillowed on the sofa, sobbing bitterly. He knelt beside her, putting his arm around her, and asked the cause of her distress. \"Oh it's so lonesome, and dreadful, I don't believe I can stand it,\" she answered haltingly through her tears.

The second performance, the following year, was much less unfortunate. Of the work itself Berlioz writes: \"It is new, fresh, grand, sweet, tender, surprising.\" It is a pity composers do not tell us more often what they think of their own works. I mean in autobiographies and signed articles, of course; not, as has sometimes happened, in inspired articles written by their friends, or in anonymous ones written by themselves. To come <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the work itself, Berlioz incorporated it in his _Lelio_, or _The Return to Life_ (lyric melodrama). This is one of the most extraordinary hotchpotches in all music. It begins with a ballad by Goethe, then there is a long apostrophe to Shakespeare, then a brigand's song and {144} chorus, then a song of bliss; finally, the composer, Lelio or Berlioz, decides to write a fantasia on _The Tempest_, and calls on Shakespeare to stand by him. The orchestra and chorus then perform the...", "...oftener he thought of them the more bitterly he resented his up-tilted, horse-killing fields, and his complaining words sank so deep into the minds of his sons that for years thereafter they were unable to look upon any rise of ground as an object to be admired.

He no more thought of going east than a liberated eagle dreams of returning to its narrow cage. He loved to talk of Boston, to boast of its splendor, but to live there, to earn his bread there, was unthinkable.

Without doubt, this interpretation of hysteria, which I have myself contributed to extend, must never be exaggerated, and it must not be concluded from this that every neuropathic accident always and solely depends on some remembrance or some emotion.

Without doubt it seems to me exaggerated to-day <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> see in neuroses those psychological disorders alone, whereas the disorders of the circulation, the disorders of internal secretions, the disorders of the functions of the sympathetic which will be spoken of just here must also have a great importance.

Notwithstanding his trust in Mr. Farebrother's generosity, notwithstanding what Mary had said to him, Fred could not help feeling that he had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he objected to it extremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary for her good, being ready rather to fight for her with any man whatsoever. But the fighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a metaphorical kind, which was much more difficult <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Fred than the muscular. Certainly this experience was a discipline for Fred hardly less sharp than his disappointment about his uncle's will. The iron had not entered into his soul, but he had begun to imagine what the sharp edge would be. It did not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth might be mistaken about Mr. Farebrother, but he suspected that she might be wrong about Mary.

It was no easy matter to get the boat <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> this point, and had it required any more water to float it, it would have been impossible. As soon as Isabel was in the boat a joyful shout was raised by the party on shore. The return to land was slow, as the great exertion he had been forced to use was beginning to tell upon Everard.

From one to the other of the party the bishop glanced, as he said, \"How glad, how unutterably glad, I am <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be again among you!\" Turning his eyes towards Miss Raybold, he stopped. That young lady had put down the letter she was reading, and was gazing at him through her spectacles with calm intensity. \"This lady,\" said the bishop, turning towards Raybold, \"is your sister, I presume?

According to some, the change was decided upon in order to afford the Emperor the opportunity of distinguishing himself; the \"armee du Rhin\" was to revive the glories of the \"grande armee;\" there was to be a second edition of the Napoleonic epic. After the first startling successes, the Emperor was to return to the capital, and Marshal Niel's plan was, if practicable, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be taken up once more,--that is, the French troops, having established a foothold in the enemy's country, were to be divided again under so many Klebers, Soults, and Neys. According to others, the Emperor, who until then had been living in a fool's paradise with regard to the quantity, if not with regard to the quality, of the forces at his disposal, suddenly had his eyes opened to the real state of affairs. The six hundred and fifty thousand troops supposed to be at his disposal...", "...bird to fly off a dollar and scratch a guy, did you?\" \"I want to make money--that's why I came up to this God-forsaken place--but--when your uncle's draft arrives you cash it.\" \"Ain't you the champeen bone-dome?\" muttered Bill. Such an attitude seemed to him both senseless and quixotic, for he had never attached the least sentiment to money. Money was an elemental necessity, therefore he looked upon it with practical, unromantic eyes, and helped himself to it as he helped himself <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> such elemental necessities as air or water. Most of life's necessaries had fallen into monopolistic hands and were used to wring tribute from unfortunate mortals who had arrived too late to share in the graft, as witness, for instance, Standard Oil.

I replied, \"If you know that I can, it shall be done;\" and then almost unconsciously I rebuked the devil, and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> depart from him; when immediately Newel spoke out and said that he saw the devil leave him and vanish from his sight.

It now became the duty of the new republic to seek out the man to preside over it, and George Washington seems to have had no rivals. He rather reluctantly left his home at Mount Vernon, where he was engaged in trying the rotation of crops, and solemnly took the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, which had been adopted September 17, 1787. His trip in April, 1789, from Mount Vernon <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the seat of government in New York was a simple but beautiful ovation. Everybody tried to make it pleasant for him.

The good woman commenced by reminding the strategus how he had visited her and her brother Polus to question them as to the doings of the Babylonish carpet merchant, and how it had seemed plain <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> them that Glaucon was nothing less than a traitor. Next she proceeded to relate how her husband had enabled the criminal to fly by sea, and her own part therein--for she loudly accused herself of treason in possessing a guilty knowledge of the outlaw's manner of escape. As for Bias, he had just now gone on a message to Megara, but Democrates would surely castigate his own slave. \"Still,\" wound up Lampaxo, \"the traitor seemed drowned, and his treason locked up in Phorcys's strong...", "...told my men who were about me to take off my feathers, and my dress and boots, that my enemies might not have my skull: they did so, and I crawled into the bush to die.

The doctrine that the chief good of man is good will easily wins acceptance from honest men. For common-sense employs a juster psychology than either of the theories just mentioned. By will, common-sense understands something practical and moving. It understands the body of habits, of active dispositions which makes a man do what he does. Will is thus not something opposed <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> consequences or severed from them. It is a _cause_ of consequences; it is causation in its personal aspect, the aspect immediately preceding action. It hardly seems conceivable to practical sense that by will is meant something which can be complete without reference to deeds prompted and results occasioned. Even the sophisticated specialist cannot prevent relapses from such an absurdity back into common-sense. Kant, who went the limit in excluding consequences from moral value, was...", "...nothing but the supreme authority of conscience. CHAPTER XVII THE CALL LOST IN THE VOID The ears of the people were deaf. Rolland's work seemed to have been fruitless. Not one of the dramas was played for more than a few nights. Most of them were buried after a single performance, slain by the hostility of the critics and the indifference of the crowd. Futile, too, had been the struggles of Rolland and his friends on behalf of the people's theater. The government <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> which they had addressed an appeal for the founding of a popular theater in Paris, paid little attention. M. Adrien Bernheim was dispatched to Berlin to make inquiries. He reported. Further reports were made. The matter was discussed for a while, but was ultimately shelved. Rostand and Bernstein continued to triumph in the boulevards; the great call to idealism had remained unheard. Where could the author look for help in the completion of his splendid program? To what nation...", "...She was the ghost herself; she was the shadow of bygone days--the poor, yearning, broken-hearted ghost.

She had caused Friedrich Ludwig <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> fall ill, for great emotions must perforce shatter so frail a being as he was, and she had tortured him, tempted him. One day two travelling coaches rolled into Freudenthal--the Sittmann tribe arrived. It was but ill received by the Graevenitz. Why had they come? she asked.

He contended, that although the enemy had made the most formidable preparations for an invasion, which would probably be attempted within a few weeks, the effective force of the navy, from line-of-battle ships down to hired armed vessels, was at that moment inferior, and less adequate to the exigency of the danger, than at any former period. Notwithstanding it was so evidently necessary to oppose <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the enemy's flotilla a force of a similar description, capable of acting in shallow water, the Admiralty had ordered only twenty-three gun-vessels to be built, of which five were to be completed in three, and the remainder in six months, though the necessity for them was immediate and urgent. He condemned the Admiralty for giving up the former approved plan of building line-of-battle ships by contract in private yards.

At last she attributed her condition to the greatly honoured priest. Her father was astonished but he was also glad that his daughter was in the favour of so eminent a man. So he went to the priest and said that he brought him good tidings: the girl whom he had deigned to notice was about <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have a child. The father went on to express at length his sense of obligation to the priest for the honour done to his family. All the priest said in reply was, _So desuka_? (Is that so?) Soon after the birth of the child the girl besought her father to marry her to a certain young farmer. The father, proud of the association with the priest, refused. Finally the girl told her parent that it was not the priest but the young farmer who was the father of her child.

But as the circumstances of the family rendered it necessary that she should be brought up <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> business, she was very early employed in it, and incapable of receiving that polite and learned education which she often regretted the loss of, and which she afterwards endeavoured to repair by diligently reading, and carefully studying the best modern writers, and as many as she could of the antient ones, especially the poets, as far as the best translations could assist her. Amongst these, Horace was her favourite; and how just her sentiments were of that elegant writer, will...", "...She consented. We were to be married on the next morning. By good luck, her brother-in-law was absent from home, and I knew her sister possessed rather a romantic turn of mind. The devil lent me cunning and eloquence, and I persuaded her it was the only way to save Alice's life and mine. To bring this about, I had, without premeditation, to invent plans which should have the appearance of having been well-digested. I told her 'that I came authorized from my father to bring Alice <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> his house, if I could do so as my wife.' I then showed her the wealth that I possessed--for beside my own money, Collins, on starting, had constituted me his banker--and the whole story was so well got up, that she seemed delighted with the novelty of the scheme.

If an Indian has discovered that a friend is in danger of being intercepted and cut off by one to whom he has rendered himself obnoxious, he does not inform him in plain and explicit terms of the danger he runs by pursuing the track near which the enemy lies in wait for him, but he drily asks him which way he is going that day, and, having received his answer, with the same indifference tells him that he has been informed that a dog lies near...", "...be executed, and the warrant withdrawn, before he should be detained by his other creditors; and, lastly, he conjured the barrister to spare himself the guilt and the charge of suborning evidence for the destruction of an unhappy man, whose misfortune was his only fault.

There is great burning pain, extending from the mouth to the stomach; vomiting of a liquid of a dark coffee-colour, often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood; the skin inside the mouth is taken off; and the exposed surface is at first white, and after a time becomes brownish. There are sometimes spots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck, caused by drops of the acid falling on these parts. There is great difficulty of breathing, owing <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the swelling at the back part of the mouth. After a time there is much depression of strength, with a quick, weak pulse, and cold, clammy skin. The face is pale, and has a very anxious look. When the acid swallowed has been greatly diluted in water, the same kind of symptoms occur, only in a milder degree.--_Treatment_.

Walter Wyron had made a whole Lecture on it--Lecture No. II, \"_Types and Tact_,\" and Walter had barely touched the fringe of the subject. Amory wanted to go a little deeper than that. But she also wanted to get away from those vulgarized words and ready-made conclusions, and to have each case considered on its merits. Surely it ought <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be possible to say that the presence of a person affected you pleasantly, or unpleasantly, without sniggering inferences of a _liaison_ in the one case or of a rupture in the other! Therefore it was once more just a little irritating that Mr. Strong, instead of telling her what type he did admire, should merely laugh and say, \"Well--not Mrs. Tasker.\" If Amory had a criticism at all to make of Mr. Strong it was this habit of his of negatives, that sometimes almost justified the...", "...of my infatuation and my ruin?

Utterly inexperienced as I was, every word of his was a cannon shot that breached the fortress of my honour; every tear was a fire in which my virtue was consumed; every sigh was a rushing wind that fanned the destructive flame.

There are all sorts of plays requiring great acumen and patient application, as for example the game of chess; and no one has the right <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> prevent any individual from pursuing such games. But the player for his part must not demand special regard for his activity. By using his energies for his personal pleasure and not for a social purpose, that is, for a general human purpose, he loses every claim to the social encouragement of his activity, and must be content if only his individual rights are respected; and that, too, only so long as the social interests do not suffer by it. =3.

George was good-natured, but hasty and passionate; and though Mrs. Wardour took great pains to impress upon his youthful mind the danger he was continually in, from not being able <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> control his temper, she never succeeded in teaching him that mildness so much admired in her own son. But in every other respect he was truly amiable; and if, in his passion, he was ever led into any serious error, he never failed to beg pardon of those whom he had offended, and always made every amends in his power. By this failing in George's temper, Henry was too frequently a sufferer; for he was always obliged to give up whatever play-things the other wished for, which he...", "...Conquest is where the deceased has acquired the land otherwise than as heir, and corresponds to the English term purchase in the technical sense explained.

And when the brothers are younger than the deceased, both conquest and heritage go <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the brother (or his issue) next in order of age. But when the deceased leaves an elder and a younger brother (or their issues), the elder brother takes the conquest, the younger takes the heritage.

But why Rodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son to a university a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his own door, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he did so. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas Gonzalez, that he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a Miguel de Cervantes. This does not appear <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have been ever seen again; but even if it had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove nothing, as there were at least two other Miguels born about the middle of the century; one of them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a source of great embarrassment to the biographers. That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcala is best proved by his own works.

One day, when Celia was talking in her usual kind manner to Rosalind, saying: 'I pray you, Rosalind, my sweet cousin, be merry,' a messenger entered from the duke, to tell them that if they wished to see a...", "...favor to _me,_ you must take some refreshment.

After the campaign he returned to the Emperor, his breast covered with decorations, bearing a letter from the King of Wurtemburg to his Majesty, who, after reading it, said to Vandamme: \"General, never forget that, if I admire the brave, I do not admire those who sleep while I await them.\" He pressed the general's hand, and invited him <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> breakfast, in company with General Chardon, who was as much gratified by this return to favor as was his friend. On the journey to Augsburg, the Emperor, who had set out in advance, made such speed that his household could not keep up with him; and consequently he passed the night, without attendants or baggage, in the best house of a very poor village.

He could not get into bed; and he did not like to tell his wife why. \"That,\" he said, \"was the devil worritin' me.\" His wife...", "...unwrapped this, regarded the weapon doubtfully, and rubbed his fat thumb over the butt. \"Huh!\" ejaculated Byram, contemptuously, \"he's got a repeatin'-rifle; he can cut a pa'tridge's head off from here to that butternut 'cross the creek!\" \"I'm goin' to git into his ice-house all the same,\" said the warden, without much enthusiasm. \"An' I'm bound to git my road-tax,\" said Byram, \"but jest how I'm to operate I dunno.\" \"Me neither,\" added the warden, musingly. \"God knows I hate <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> shoot people.\" What he really meant was that he hated to be shot at. A young girl in a faded pink sunbonnet passed along the road, followed by a dog. She returned the road-master's awkward salutation with shy composure. A few moments later the game-warden saw her crossing the creek on the stepping-stones; her golden-haired collie dog splashed after her. \"That's a slick girl,\" he said, twisting his heavy black mustache into two greasy points. Byram glanced at him with a...", "...day. The three Native Infantry regiments and the battery of Artillery stationed at Delhi were prepared to join the insurgent troopers from Meerut directly they arrived. The magazine, with its vast stores of war material, was in the hands of the King, and the 150,000 inhabitants of the city were ready to assist in the massacre of the white men and women, and the destruction of their property. After careful consideration of all the circumstances of the revolt at Meerut, I have come <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the conclusion that it would have been futile to have sent the small body of mounted troops available in pursuit of the mutineers on the night of the 10th May, and that, considering the state of feeling throughout the Native Army, no action, however prompt, on the part of the Meerut authorities could have arrested the Mutiny. The sepoys had determined to throw off their allegiance to the British Government, and the when and the how were merely questions of time and opportunity....", "...shall die if I stay in this furnace.

The cell is the parent of every living thing on the globe; and if it is unthinkable that the material and irrational forces of inert matter could produce it, then mechanics and chemistry must play second fiddle in all that whirl and dance of the atoms that make up life.

Those of us who wanted to breathe or to drink, found a bayonet before our noses, and charitable souls were forbidden to give us a glass of water.

In \"dry-farming\" localities, the central idea is to save all the water that Nature supplies, to prevent the moisture from evaporating, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> protect it from the robber winds. Forests greatly check evaporation, and Professor L. G. Carpenter, the celebrated irrigation engineer, says that forests are absolutely necessary for the interests of irrigated agriculture.

Read what The _Christian Advocate_ says about it: \"How <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Get Married Although a Woman,\" by a young widow, comes from the J. S.

The woman anxious to get married, but unable to do so, will find an immense amount of advice and assistance in this little volume, and will learn what manner of woman is liked and what disliked by men, the reasons of success and failure in the race matrimonial, some unfailing methods of catching a husband, why it is that a plain widow can come into a...", "...we won't--will we, Marie?\" said Madame de Lescure. \"Pray, Charles, pray do not send us away.

By this time she was bursting with mischievous glee. Wouldn't John and Charles Stuart be good and mad when they found her following them? She knew exactly how to do it. The only way was <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> dog their footsteps, keeping safely out of sight until they were too far from home to send her back alone. Of course she would have to endure innuendoes all day regarding \"Copy cats,\" but that was nothing to the anguish of being left at home.

I know not how it was, but, from my earliest recollection, my foster-mother, and others as well as she, set me down for his wife; and, strangely enough, I fancied myself so. Yet could it be nothing more than a sister's love that I bore him. Much he used to make of me. His pastime--even his studies--were regulated by my will. Being older than I, he let me play the fool to the very height of my caprice, which cost me many a chiding,--but not from him, though he had <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> bear the greater portion of the consequences.

Of course, from winter beets, the entire stem should be removed, as it will be dried up. Scrub beets of either variety carefully with a vegetable brush until entirely free from dirt. Then, whether they are old or young, put them to cook in boiling water without removing their skins. Allow them to cook until they are soft enough to be pierced with a fork. This is the best way in which <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> determine when the beets are done, for as the length of time required to cook them depends entirely on their age, no definite time can be stated.

No body of men rejoiced over this prospect more heartily than Republican senators and representatives, for if it should prove true they would have cause of gratulation both as patriots and partisans.

Elberich's gift of a small round stone, which he bade him thrust into his cheek, conferred upon Otnit the gift of language, and enabled him to impersonate a rich merchant with so much success that his ship was allowed <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> drop anchor in the harbour. When dusk had fallen, and all was quiet, the Emperor disembarked, encamping with his troops among the rock-hewn burial places of the ancient Phoenicians, which abounded on that coast.

Before Mr. Tappitt came home for the evening,--which he did not do on that day till past ten, having been detained, by business, in the bar of the Dragon Inn,--they had all resolved that the combined ease and dignity of a thousand a year should be accepted. Mr. Tappitt was still perturbed in spirit when he took himself to the marital chamber. What had been the nature of the business which had detained him at the bar of the Dragon he did not condescend <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> say, but it seemed to have been of a nature not well adapted to smooth his temper. Mrs. Tappitt perhaps guessed what that business had been; but if so, she said nothing of the subject in direct words. One little remark she did make, which may perhaps have had allusion to that business. \"Bah!\" she exclaimed, as Mr. Tappitt came near her; \"if you must smoke at all, I wish to goodness you'd smoke good tobacco.\" \"So I do,\" said Tappitt, turning round at her sharply. \"It's best...", "...But now his eyes were glued upon the high walled pen in which Nicodemus was confined.

But as he tried <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> read the texts by help of Anquetil's translation, he was surprised to find that this was not the clue he had expected. He saw that two causes had misled Anquetil: on the one hand, his teachers, the Parsi dasturs, either knew little themselves or taught him imperfectly, not only the Zend, but even the Pahlavi intended to explain the meaning of the Zend; so that the tradition on which his work rested, being incorrect in itself, corrupted it from the very beginning; on the other hand,...", "...stalled car, hoping he might see the flashing up of the lights on it, which would tell of the power being turned on, Sid turned and made off toward the distant railroad station.

But who could possibly cry in such a very large room, that unwound itself and escaped at the corners, whenever she tried to seek comfort in tucking the walls close about her like an eiderdown quilt. She could have cried in a little room, quite easily; but this regal apartment was Second Empire--somebody important had slept here once. Nicole knocked and entered: \"It is time for Mademoiselle <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> dress. Is Mademoiselle completely rested?\" beaming, she exhibited an elaborate bouquet, white lilac and lilies of the valley, that had just been sent by a middle-aged admirer from the Legation. Madame des Essarts trailed in, to discuss in what costume Merle would shine to the best advantage, at the dinner-party given in her honour that evening. \"The apricot ninon?

The school under Mr. Prout was called the \"Columbian Institute,\" the name being suggested by John McLeod, the famous Irish school-master, who was a warm friend of this institution after visiting and commending the scholars and teachers, and who named his new building, in 1835, the Columbian Academy. The days of thick darkness <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the Colored people were approaching. The Nat. Turner insurrection in Southampton County, Virginia, which occurred in August, 1831, spread terror everywhere in slave communities. In this district, immediately upon that terrible occurrence, the Colored children, who had in very large numbers been received into the Sabbath-schools in the white churches, were all turned out of those schools. This event, though seeming to be a fiery affliction, proved a blessing in disguise. It aroused...", "...and the elders and the scribes?\" they thought. But the flight passed over Jerusalem. It floated out over the hill country of Bethlehem; the throng of silent angels holding close together, as if perplexed and doubtful; the child-angel darting on far in advance, as one who knew the way through the darkness. The villages were all still: the very houses seemed asleep; but in one place there was a low sound of talking in a stable, near to an inn--a sound as of a mother soothing her baby <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> rest. All over the pastures on the hillsides a light film of snow had fallen, delicate as the veil of a bride adorned for the marriage; and as the child-angel passed over them, alone in the swiftness of his flight, the pure fields sparkled round him, giving back his radiance. And there were in that country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night. And lo! the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and...", "...paintings, executed for the Counts Bonaccorsi, Dal Sole went to Macerata, where he conducted a few works for the church of the Vergini, and for the house of the said nobles. I am uncertain if he derived from this visit that style of colouring, more attractive than natural, such as we find it in some of his smaller pictures, and in some Bolognese artists who succeeded him.

So long as it has seen no barn except that on its father's farm, the word _barn_ means to it only that particular object. But when it discovers that one of the neighbors has a similar building called a barn, it learns to put these different objects under one head, and the general notion _barn_ as a building for horses, cattle, and feed, gradually rises in the mind. Long before the child is six years old (school age) it may have seen enough of such barns for the general notion <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be distinctly formed. By observing different objects, by comparing and grouping similar things together, it has formed a general notion in a regular process of induction, and that without any help from teachers. At two and three years of age, or as soon as a child begins to recognize and name new objects (because of their resemblance to things previously seen) this tendency to concept-building is manifest. Another illustration: The child has seen the family horse several times...", "...followed by the roar of her guns and a salvo of shots. \"It's no use, boys,\" said the submarine commander to his officers. \"They have us trapped. Unless we surrender here we are going to be blown out of the water in short order.

With her diving rudders inclined, the ship was tilted now until her bow pointed downward and her stern reared up out of the water. She was shipping ballast in her tanks rapidly, but the process was necessarily slow and, even with her improved equipment, it must be one and a half to two minutes before the hull could be submerged, let alone the conning tower. \"Hold her right there!\" suddenly shouted the young lieutenant to his navigating officer. The latter was for a...", "...gazed languidly round. The room looked old and prison-like to-day; it appeared unfamiliar to him, like some room in a strange house, where he was only a visitor. He looked with indifference at his library, and the drawer where lay his beloved manuscripts.

He wondered whether they would take the road the young lady took when going <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> and fro between town and her father's estate. Perhaps they might meet her. His eye beamed; he confidently believed that they should meet her. She would sit queen-like in her carriage, her veil flying round her blooming face; she would raise her white hand and wave it to him--nay, she would recognize him; she would know that he had rendered her father a service; she would stop and inquire how he was.

Almost the whole of the space amidships was covered by huge tarpaulins, leaving a narrow gangway on either side.

Note the resolute calmness, the Spartan brevity, the clear sight of the possible fatal issue, the absolute submission. No higher strain has ever come from human lips. This womanly soul was of the same stock as a Miriam, a Deborah, Jephthah's daughter; and the same fire burned in her,--utter devotion <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Israel because entire consecration to Israel's God.

But all the while he has remained on the outside. Not for a moment has he become a party <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the play. He brings to it nothing of his own feeling and power of response. There has been no union of his spirit with the artist's spirit,--that union in which a work of art achieves its consummation.

When a man wishes to close his hand, he Wills that it be closed, and sends a current of this Finer Force of the Mind along the nerve to the muscle, and the latter contracts and the hand is closed. A similar process is used in every muscular action. _What is the Force used?_ Science admits the existence of this Force, and calls it \"Nervous Energy,\" or \"Nerve Force.\" It holds that it must be something like Electricity, and some even go so far as <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> say that it _is_ Electricity. They base their ideas upon the fact that when Electricity is applied to the muscle of living or dead animals, they contract just as they do when this \"Nerve Force\" is applied, and every movement of the muscles may be so produced by Electricity, which becomes a counterfeit Nerve Force.

Paul gives utterance to a very singular doctrine when he says that even nature teaches that it is a shame for a man to wear long hair, but the glory for a woman, because nature gave it <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> her for a covering. (See 1 Cor. xi. 14.) He was certainly not much of a philosopher, or he would have made the discovery that nature promotes the growth of the hair upon the heads of men and women exactly alike. If nature did not permit any hair to grow upon the head of man, or did not allow it to grow more than an inch in length, there might be some plausibility in the assertion. But, as the case stands, it is the shears, and not nature, which teaches that it is a shame for a man...", "...even if admitted for the sake of argument, it could not establish the identity, inasmuch as the statements in Gal. ii. 1 ff. imply a much longer period of missionary activity amongst the Gentiles than Paul could possibly have had at that time, about which epoch, indeed, Barnabas is said to have sought him in Tarsus, apparently for the purpose of first commencing such a career;a certainly the account of his active ministry begins in the Acts only in Ch. xiii.

The father then asked them if any of them wished to go out into the world and seek fortune again; but they all agreed that there was nothing <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be gained by the move, and that though there were positions which at first sight seemed more brilliant and more delectable than their own, yet that each had its compensatory trials, and that they were best where God had placed them.

Having got together some money, and having made other preparations, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza one dark night stole out of the village without a word to any one, and began their adventures. Don Quixote rode \"Rozinante;\" Sancho Panza was mounted on an ass. That his squire should ride an ass at first troubled the Knight not a little, for in none of his books could he remember <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have read of any squire being so mounted. However, he gave Sancho leave to bring the ass, thinking that in no great time a better mount would surely be found for him. As they rode along in the cool of the morning, Sancho Panza spoke to his master about their journey, and asked him to be sure not to forget his promise about the governorship of the island. \"It may even happen,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that I may by some strange chance conquer a kingdom.

And yet he could not but admit--and at this he sat bolt upright in his seat--that even according <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> his own high standards both St. George and Harry had measured up to them! Rather than touch another penny of his uncle's money Harry had become an exile; rather than accept a penny from his enemy, St. George had become a pauper.

The idea of the movement is its soul; the practical working is no more than the body. But body and soul alike are subject <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> growth, and so it has been in the present case. The English University Extension Movement was in no sense a carefully planned scheme, put forward as a feat of institutional symmetry; it was the product of a simple purpose pursued through many years, amid varying external conditions, in which each modification was suggested by circumstances and tested by experience.

He was only conscious that it gave him a great pleasure <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> leave the village behind, and to get once more upon the open prairie, which was glorified by the tints and shadows of the setting sun. The fields of maize, with their tassels growing brown and already too ripe and stiff to wave freely, and with their long blades becoming harsh and dry, so that the summer rustle had changed to a characteristic autumnal rattling, seemed to greet him like old friends who had visibly aged in his absence. Tom found his mind, from sheer strain and...", "...and 33' of longitude to the east of Annamooka. Between them are a great many small islands, sand-banks, and breakers; so, that, the safest way to arrive at Hepaee, is either by the course I held, or round by the north, according to the situation of the ship bound thither. Lefooga, off which we anchored, is the most fertile isle of those that are called Hepaee, and consequently is the best inhabited. There is anchorage along the north-west side of this island; but it will be necessary <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> examine the ground well before you moor. For, although the lead may bring up fine sand, there are nevertheless some sharp coral rocks, that would soon destroy the cables. What has been here omitted concerning the geography of these islands, will be found in the narrative of my last voyage. To that narrative I must also refer, for such particulars concerning the inhabitants, their manners, and arts, as I had observed then, and about which I saw no reason to change my judgment.

But how changed now was the scene! Then the country was excited by the deepest anxiety and alarm, and the spectacle on the field was that of one immense mass of squalid poverty and wretchedness, of misery reduced by hopeless suffering to recklessness and despair. Now all was gayety and splendor in the spectacle, and the whole country was excited <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the highest pitch of exultation and joy. At Blackheath the grand cavalcade was formed for passing through London. Splendid preparations had been made in London to receive the bride, and to do honor to her passage through the city. Many of these preparations were similar to those which had been made on the occasion of the king's coronation. There was a castle and tower, with young girls at the top throwing down a shower of golden snow, and fountains at the sides flowing with wine,...", "...leave my horse. I bargained for the price of food and saw Aguador comfortably stalled; then made my way to the Nekropolis where lived my host. There are many churches in Carmona, and into one of these I entered; it had nothing of great interest, but to a certain degree it was rich, rich in its gilded woodwork and in the brocade that adorned the pillars; and I felt that these Spanish churches lent a certain dignity to life: for all the careless flippancy of Andalusia they still remained <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> strike a nobler note. I forgot willingly that the land was priest-ridden and superstitious, so that a Spaniard could tell me bitterly that there were but two professions open to his countrymen, the priesthood and the bull-ring.

This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent: to Moses from His father and mother, to Christ from His mother's line; also to Muhammad and the Bab, and to all the Prophets and the Holy Manifestations of Israel. Hence it is evident that inherited character also exists, and to such a degree that if the characters are not in conformity with their origin, although they belong physically <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> that lineage, spiritually they are not considered members of the family; like Canaan, who is not reckoned as being of the race of Noah.

Rodney, knowing the aim to be Jamaica, had little doubt of overtaking in any case, if started promptly.

Buildings of this insular type arose, year by year, all over our land, but it never came into vogue on the Continent, where the more floreated styles of architecture, known as Flamboyant, became prevalent; while in England there was a reaction in the opposite direction in favour of less ornate tracery.

Let us, for instance, stand outside the Minster at the east end, and we shall have before our eyes specimens of all these four great styles of Gothic architecture.

Nor were the Dacians by any means despicable opponents. Although many of them fought bareheaded and clothed in a light tunic, they were well acquainted with the use of armour, and possessed standards, shields, helmets, breast-plates, and even chain and plate mail, fighting with bows and arrows, spears, javelins, and a short curved sword somewhat resembling a sickle.[80] They fought on horseback as well as on foot, and it is said that they sent showers of poisoned...", "...essential to the proper conducting of worship. The Presbyterian ministers were more amenable to the changes, yet their ideals were of the parishes they had known in Scotland--a church, a manse, a glebe, tiends, and a titled patron.

I look back with distress to the bitter controversy which went on from year <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> year over the possession of the revenue from the clergy reserves. The cause of strife was not altogether the money, but the proof of superiority the possession of the fund would give. With many it was as much pride as covetousness. When we recall the energy that characterized the agitation over the clergy reserves, I think of what the same effort would have accomplished had it been directed to evangelize the province. Another agitation, less prolonged but fiercer while it lasted,...", "...would be rendered all the more arduous as he would not only have the smugglers to deal with, but their accomplices, the fisher-folk and farmers. After a few weeks' experience, it was quite obvious that the squire was right, and in view of this, Thomas Turnbull sent for his wife and six children, and settled down to his work in real earnest. The intimation that the new-comer was a religious man, and could preach and pray, soon spread through the villages, and large numbers flocked <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> see and hear him. Many came out of pure curiosity, and some to mock and jeer, but these seldom succeeded in setting at defiance the great power that was behind the preacher. He was of commanding presence; his face, as some of the villagers used to say, was good to look at, and the message that he delivered to his audience came with irresistible force, which broke the spirit of some of the most determined obstructers, and turned many into friends, and a few even into saints.

He outlived all his colleagues, and eventually became the last bishop of the Bohemian Brethren. On receipt of the news of his election, Komensky started for Lissa, but not until he had forwarded to Sweden some of the school-books which he had been commissioned to write. The year 1648 brought a great blow <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the members of the Unity and to the Bohemian Protestants generally. The Treaty of Westphalia was signed in that year, and no stipulations in favour of the Bohemian exiles were contained in it. At the risk of prolonging the war, the Austrian Government maintained its principle that no one who did not profess the creed of Rome should be allowed to reside in Bohemia or Moravia; to Silesia slight concessions were granted.

But after it came to be exercised upon base and villainous fellows, they desisted from it; Hyperbolus, being the last whom they banished by the ostracism. The cause of Hyperbolus's banishment is said to have been this. Alcibiades and Nicias, men that bore the greatest sway in the city, were of different factions. As the people, therefore, were about to vote the ostracism, and obviously <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> decree it against one of them, consulting together and uniting their parties, they contrived the banishment of Hyperbolus. Upon which the people, being offended, as if some contempt or affront was put upon the thing, left off and quite abolished it. It was performed, to be short, in this manner.

Of course this is what might be expected. Anyone who reads the Papal decree can see at once that it has nothing to do with, or say about, chemistry or chemical investigation. Since, however, an aspersion has been cast upon the progress of chemistry during the Middle Ages, and since it will surely be thought by many people that, if chemistry did not happen <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> interest mankind at that time, it must have been because the Pope was opposed to it (for such seems to be the curious chain of reasoning of certain scholars), it has seemed well to review briefly the story of chemistry during the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

None the less was he sure that some one was now standing in the middle of the floor, within a yard or two of his place of confinement. His ears, strained <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the utmost, caught the sound of hurried breathing close to him, and besides he had that ill-defined sense of another's presence which we are all apt to feel. Terrified as he was, he still clung desperately to the idea that it was Gridley, and he called the man's name again, his voice shaking with fear.

They certainly signified the atrophy of the war-torn North Chinese capitals as the political power in China.

We incite them to do all sorts of good, so as thereby <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> magnify God the more. Thus the Psalmist said to his brethren, _O magnify the Lord with me, and let us extol His name together_.[1] This same ardour incites and presses us also (_urget_ is the word used by St. Paul) to do our utmost to aid our neighbour to rise from sin, which renders him displeasing to God, and to prevent sin by which the Divine Goodness is offended.

They are treated only in the _Metaphysische Anfangsgruende_. They belong to the relatively, not to the absolutely, pure science of nature. The source of the confusion Vaihinger again traces <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> Kant's failure to hold fast to the important distinction between immanent and transcendent metaphysics.[285] His so-called pure or universal natural science (nature, as above noted, signifying for Kant \"all that is\") is really _immanent metaphysics_, and the propositions in regard to substance and causality ought therefore to be classed as metaphysical.

She regarded marriage rather as an abstract thing; she was familiar with the idea that it was a matter of social arrangement and necessity, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be looked upon as a part of life. She had, it is true, some vaguely sentimental notion that love was a necessity, and being persuaded that the match before her was a desirable one, was persuaded also that she was in love with Stanford.

Something in the shape of that mouth suggested the shadowy events of last night <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> his mind, and brought with them the vague recollection of a girl's face looking curiously down at him, and the pleasurable sensation of being supported by two firm, soft hands. He rather liked dwelling on that part of last night's adventures, until a real twinge of pain in his leg recalled also the less pleasant episodes, and he shuddered as he remembered the horrors of his transit from the chalk pit to the Rectory. \"I hate being in pain; it is so vulgar,\" he muttered...", "...was thrown in, it could only respond with a loud, discordant whirring.

That country had broken loose in large measure from the rule of Turkey during the reign of the able and ambitious Mehemet Ali, who was made viceroy in 1840. In 1876 the independence of Egypt was much increased, and its rulers were given the title of khedive, or king. The powers of the khedives steadily increased, and in 1874-75 Ismail Pasha greatly extended the Egyptian territory, annexing the Soudan as far as Darfur, and finally <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the shores of the lately discovered Victoria Nyanza. Egypt thus embraced the valley of the Nile practically to its source, presenting an aspect of immense length and great narrowness. Soon after, the finances of the country became so involved that they were placed under European control, and the growth of English and French influence led to the revolt of Arabi Pasha. This was repressed by Great Britain, which bombarded Alexandria and defeated the Egyptians, France taking no part....", "...as we were moving down the aisle, I believe, to get him to the aisle that divided the two sections.

Some fancied they should, by adoration or sacrifice, pay the same honour to angels as is due to God, and were prevented from doing so by the angels themselves, and ordered to render it to Him to whom alone they know it to be due. And the holy angels have in this been imitated by holy men of God. For Paul and Barnabas, when they had wrought a miracle of healing in Lycaonia, were thought to be gods, and the Lycaonians desired to sacrifice <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> them, and they humbly and piously declined this honour, and announced to them the God in whom they should believe. And those deceitful and proud spirits, who exact worship, do so simply because they know it to be due to the true God.

They have, in fact, plenty odours on all hands, and if they wished more, they could provide them for themselves.

We were fast losing sight of the hills, whose loftier summits alone were visible, yet we now saw fresh peaks <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the north, which satisfied me that they continued in that direction far beyond the most distant one we had seen. From this circumstance I was led to hope that we might fall on another creek, and so gradually, but surely, work our way to the N.W.

Shortly afterwards, on breaking through a low scrub, we crossed a ridge of sand, on which numerous Pine-trees...", "...abstraction makes,--an abstraction that attains simplicity without destroying the concrete reality, an abstraction that attains as its result only a higher history,--a new and more intelligible reading of it,--a solution of it--that which is fixed and constant and accounts for it,--an abstraction whose apex of unity is the highest, the universal history, that which accounts for all,--the equivalent,--the scientific equivalent of it. But whatever it be, it is something that is going <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> take the place of the unscientific abstractions, both in theory and practice; it is something that is going to supplant ultimately the vain indolent speculation, the inert because unscientific speculation, that seeks to bind the human life in the misery of an enforced and sanctioned ignorance, sealing up with its dogmas to an eternal collision with the universal laws of God and nature,--laws that no dogma or conceit can alter,--all the unreckoned generations of the life of man....", "...constitution stood in the way of this political paradise, so Joseph resolved that the Hungarian constitution must be sacrificed. Refusing to be crowned, or even to take the usual oaths of observance, he simply announced his accession to the Hungarian counties, and then deliberately proceeded to break down all the ancient Magyar institutions. In 1784 the Language Edict made German the official language of the common state. The same year he ordered a census and a land-survey to be taken, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> enable him to tax every one irrespective of birth or wealth. Protests came in from every quarter and a dangerous rebellion broke out in Transylvania; but opposition only made Joseph more obstinate, and he endeavoured to anticipate any further resistance by abolishing the ancient county assemblies and dividing the kingdom into two districts administered by German officials. In taking this course Joseph made the capital mistake of neglecting the Machiavellian maxim that in changing...", "...A foremost need was that of able and suitable helpers, which only God could supply. In order fully to carry out his plans, Mr. Muller felt that he must have men and women like-minded, who would naturally care for the state of the orphans and of the work.

No step was therefore hastily taken. He had patiently waited on God hitherto, and he now waited to receive at His hands His own chosen servants to join in this service and give to it unity of plan and spirit.

At the time we bore away, the land extended from E. by S. 1/2 S. to S.S.W., four leagues distant. The longitude by the time-keeper was 191 deg. 17', and the latitude 53 deg. 38'.

I couldn't stop there, either; the stillness and the loneliness half maddened me and set me to thinking...", "...hold its secret rooms for many years to come, for these adobe dwellings are practically fire-proof and are built to defy time.\" \"But about Mildred's fortune,\" cried Patsy. \"Don't you suppose it is hidden, after all, some place in the wall?\" \"From what I have heard of Cristoval,\" said Arthur in a reflective tone, \"he was not considered a dishonest man, but rather miserly and grasping.\" \"My father,\" explained Mildred, \"trusted him fully until we went away and could get no answer <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> his letters. The old Spaniard was very fond of me, also, and he would hold me in his arms and say that one day I would be a rich lady, for my father and he were both making my fortune. I was very young, as you know, but I never forgot that statement.\" \"Suppose,\" suggested the major, \"we make another and more thorough search of those secret rooms.\" \"We will do that,\" replied Arthur promptly. \"It is too late to undertake the task to-night, but we will begin it right after...", "...these injuries too valuable to be wasted, and at once invented a new game to make use of them. He pretended that he was a wounded soldier returning from the wars, and gave himself up to such limps and groans as seemed to fit the fancy. He dragged himself up to the back door of his home, and after satisfying himself that the kitchen was empty, fell prostrate on the threshold, gasping: \"Water!--Water!--I must rinse these awful wounds!\" With an exaggerated effort he pulled himself <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> his feet and reeled across the kitchen, only to fall in an imaginary swoon at the foot of the back stairs. But hearing footsteps he revived sufficiently to crawl upstairs dragging a bullet-pierced leg lifelessly behind. He had reached the room occupied jointly by himself and his brother Henry, where he had indulged in several additional swoons (in the performance of which he had now become quite an expert) when he was suddenly reminded of the accident to his clothes. He took them...", "...him in the way, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. THE VISIT TO ZACCHAEUS. And he entered and was passing through Jericho. And behold, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature. And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the place, he looked up, and said unto him, \"Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to-day I must abide at thy house.\" And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, \"He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner.\" And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, \"Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man, I restore fourfold.\" And Jesus said...", "...of God. I had an idea that he loved me on account of Calvary and Gethsemane, on account of certain historical facts; but I came, little by little, through glimpses and occasional appreciations, to that which is now a continuous, unbroken certainty, namely, a sense of the EVERLASTING NEED OF GOD, IN CHRIST, TO LOVE. I began to interpret the meaning of love, not by contemplating a few historical facts, but by running through my mind human faculties, exalting them, and imagining them <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have infinite scope in the divine mind. I began to apply our ideas of infinity and almightiness to the attributes of God, and to form some conception of what affection must be in a Being who had created, who had sustained in the past, and who was to sustain throughout the endless future, a race of intelligent creatures such as peopled the earth. In that direction my mind grew, and in that direction it grows. And from the inward and everlasting nature of God to love, I have derived...", "...of nothing but her ladyship's virtues. As Tom said, he made you feel that the ball had been given expressly for her benefit, and not at all for the Soldiers' Widows and Orphans. Of course, the Vane-Corduroys were not present, and there was an alarming rumour at one time that Mr. Vane-Corduroy was bleeding to death. Everybody came up to Lady Beatrice, and congratulated her on her narrow escape. In fact, at supper the Mayor quite drew tears to the Taunton people's eyes when he referred <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> it. Lady Beatrice tried to look unconcerned, as if she deprecated the Mayor's fine compliments, but when in a faltering voice he declared how the whole countryside would miss \"good, honest, steady old Jock, who had for so many years drawn her ladyship about on her errands of mercy,\" Lady Beatrice burst into tears, and the Mayor became so affected at the havoc he had wrought, that he wished \"the bullet of the London mushroom\" (poor Mr. Vane-Corduroy bleeding to death at Shotover!)...", "...right of his wife Sophia, as the rest of the children of the Elector of the Palatinate have abjured Protestantism, and are therefore excluded.

If Anne comes to the throne at William's death, it will, I think, postpone our hopes, for Anne is a Stuart, and is a favourite with the nation, in spite of her undutiful conduct to her father. Still, it will be felt that for Stuart <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> fight against Stuart, brother against sister, would be contrary to nature. Foreigners are always unpopular, and, as against William, every Jacobite is ready to take up arms. But I think that nothing will be done during Anne's reign. The Elector of Hanover would be as unpopular, among Englishmen in general, as is William of Orange, and, should he come to the throne, there will assuredly ere long be a rising to bring back the Stuarts.\" Charles shook his head. \"I don't want to...", "...refusal he had added, that, if by that time I had a well-established position in the world, he might consent to our wedding. That answer struck me as most cruel, and in the despair in which it threw me I was not astonished when the same night I found the door by which I used to gain admittance to C---- C---- closed and locked inside. I returned home more dead than alive, and lost twenty-four hours in that fearful perplexity in which a man is often thrown when he feels himself bound <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> take a decision without knowing what to decide. I thought of carrying her off, but a thousand difficulties combined to prevent the execution of that scheme, and her brother was in prison. I saw how difficult it would be to contrive a correspondence with my wife, for I considered C---- C---- as such, much more than if our marriage had received the sanction of the priest's blessing or of the notary's legal contract.

That dark and cruel frown, which marks Aurelian, grew above and around his eyes. 'I never,' he continued, 'forgive a traitor to his country.'

Although, however, he adds that at this point he suspended his religious inquiries, \"acquiescing with implicit belief in the tenets and mysteries which are adopted by the general consent of Catholics and Protestants,\" his readers will probably do him no great injustice if they assume that even then it was rather to the negations than <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the affirmations of Protestantism that he most heartily assented. With all his devotion to study at Lausanne[2] (he read ten or twelve hours a day), he still found some time for the acquisition of some of the lighter accomplishments, such as riding, dancing, drawing, and also for mingling in such society as the place had to offer. In September 1755 he writes to his aunt: \"I find a great many agreeable people here, see them sometimes, and can say upon the whole, without vanity,...", "...in his room at the fort one day in February or March, 1848, a knock was heard at his door, and he called out, \"Come in.\" In walked Marshall, who was a half-crazy man at best, but then looked strangely wild. \"What is the matter, Marshall!\" Marshall inquired if any one was within hearing, and began to peer about the room, and look under the bed, when Sutter, fearing that some calamity had befallen the party up at the saw-mill, and that Marshall was really crazy, began to make his way <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the door, demanding of Marshall to explain what was the matter. At last he revealed his discovery, and laid before Captain Sutter the pellicles of gold he had picked up in the ditch. At first, Sutter attached little or no importance to the discovery, and told Marshall to go back to the mill, and say nothing of what he had seen to Mr. Wimmer, or any one else. Yet, as it might add value to the location, he dispatched to our headquarters at Monterey, as I have already related, the...", "...affair than that weary heterogeneous mob at The Oxford. At the Orient there was an unity of effect, an individuality, and a conscious equipment. At The Oxford the whole business had resembled a suburban parade. Here was a real exposition of vice like the jetty of Alexandria in olden days. Indeed, so cynical was the function of the Orient Promenade that the frankness almost defeated its object, and the frequenters instead of profiting by the facilities for commerce allowed themselves <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be drugged into perpetual meditation upon an attractive contingency. Seen from this secluded corner, the Promenade resembled a well-filled tank in an aquarium. The upholstery of shimmering green plush, the dim foreground, the splash of light from the bar in one corner, the gliding circumambient throng among the pillars and, displayed along the barrier, the bright-hued ladies like sea-anemones--there was nothing that spoiled the comparison. Moreover, the longer Michael looked, the...", "...the table. The man who had gotten hastily out of his chair came back. The game went on as the others were going, silently and swiftly.

Then, a little impudently, as was his way, he shoved his pile to the centre of the table. \"See that or drop out,\" he said curtly. The nervous man dropped out. Two men saw it. They both lost <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the Kid's full hand. He swept up the gold and silver and slipped it into his pocket, his hand going very close to his gun during the process but never hesitating. Then he got to his feet. \"Let's go outside,\" he said, turning toward Thornton. He led the way, swinging about so that the broad of his back was to the man who followed him and the man whom he had sworn to kill. Walking so, a few paces between them, they passed by the bar, through the clutter of men about the door...", "...with that with which they have no real concern, draw themselves up in dignified reserve, as the witnesses of wrongs of all sorts, that every honest man is bound to oppose? I will go further, and ask if a man does happen to step forth to vindicate the right, to assert truth, to defend the weak and to punish the wrong-doer, if that man be not usually the one who meddles least in the more ordinary and minor transactions of life--the man who troubles his neighbors least, and has the least <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> say about their private affairs? Does it not happen that the very individual who will stand by and see his neighbor wronged, on account of his indisposition to meddle with that which does not belong to him, will occupy a large portion of his own time, in discussing, throwing out hints, and otherwise commenting on the private affairs of that very neighbor?

For elegance of narrative combined with clearness and vividness of description, I know no writing in the whole of scientific literature superior, or, indeed, perhaps equal to his. There can be no doubt that this literary gift, appealing as it did to so wide a circle of readers, formed a chief source of the influence which he exerted among his contemporaries. It was this that enabled him <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> spread so widely a curiosity to know something of geological science, and an interest in the progress of geological discovery. I do not think that the debt which geology owes to him for these services, in deepening the popular estimation of the science, and in increasing the number of its devotees, has ever been sufficiently acknowledged.

The real point of attack he anticipated would be Niagara, and he suspected an American force to be concealed in boats around the point on which Fort Niagara stood, ready <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> cross over as soon as the coast was clear. He determined, therefore, to ascertain personally the nature of the attack before withdrawing the garrison. With his two aides, he galloped eagerly to the scene of the action.

General Strachey introduced slide rules into the Meteorological Office for performing special calculations. At some blast furnaces a slide rule has been used for determining the amount of coke and flux required for any weight of ore.

A load of ore is put on the scales, and the first index of the slide is put <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the number giving the weight, when the second and third point to the weights of coke and flux required. By placing a number of slides side by side, drawn if need be to different scales of length, more complicated calculations may be performed. It is then convenient to make the scales circular.

Although we have referred <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> this before, yet, as it is of considerable importance not only to the children but to those around them, it may not be amiss to take up a little more of the reader's time, and to state the different plans that have been devised, in order to make the children as clean as possible. In one case, a trough was erected, and a pipe provided to convey the water into it; but before it had been up a month, it was found, that instead of answering the end intended, it had quite a contrary...", "...of the Supreme Court. These well bestowed encomiums, (as I think they are called,) so elated my wife that she speedily took to giving tea parties, to which all the majors and generals of the town were invited.

Have you come here to torment us before the time?\" 30 Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them. 31 And the demons begged him, \"If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.\" 32 And he said <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> them, \"Go.\" So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the water. 33 Then those who kept them fled, and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus.

Originally sacrifice did not bear a piacular significance, but it would be unsafe to argue from this that no substitutionary value was attached to the Levitical sacrifices by these priestly lawyers; indeed the only safe conclusion seems to be that the priests adopted these sacrifices, which were time-honoured, as the proper ritual for the approach <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> God, without any definite inquiry as to their meaning. But taking the Levitical system as a whole there seems to underlie it the theory of symbolical, although not piacular substitution. God owns man entirely, and that by right: his time, possessions, flocks, and lands; and demands from him the completest recognition of this ownership. Now in practice, this absolute demand can only be recognised by substitute and proxy; and so we have the recognition of God's claims by the...", "...a mighty good turn at dancin', and give some of these fellers what think they know it all, a few points.\" \"Step out and let me see what you can do.\" Jet was by no means bashful; in a few seconds he was dancing as spiritedly as if such discomforts as hunger and fatigue were unknown. \"You'll do,\" the stranger said, approvingly, when the boy ceased his efforts. \"I'll take you along, and pay a little something if you'll do a turn.\" \"You can bet your life I will, but I don't want <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> go any farther than Cooperstown Junction.\" \"Very well, there'll be plenty of time to talk about that part of the business, for we shall make three stands between here and there.

A negro can no more than any other person support remedies upon bad food, and still less upon a spare diet; but the quantity must be proportioned to the state of the patient, and the nature of the distemper. Besides, good food makes the best part of the remedy to those who in common are but poorly fed. The negro who taught me these two remedies, observing the great care I took of both the negro men and negro women, taught me likewise the cure of all the distempers <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> which the women are subject; for the negro women are as liable to diseases as the white women. {361} SECTION II. _Of the Manner of governing the Negroes._ When a negro man or woman comes home to you, it is proper to caress them, to give them something good to eat, with a glass of brandy; it is best to dress them the same day, to give them something to sleep on, and a covering.

The Supreme Court has described two aspects of these limits. First, when officials conduct a search, they must use only measures that are reasonably related <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the purpose of the search; second, the search may not be excessively intrusive in light of the age or sex of the student. For example, if a teacher believes she has seen one student passing a marijuana cigarette to another student, she might reasonably search the students and any nearby belongings in which the students might have tried to hide the drug. If it turns out that what the teacher saw was a stick of gum, she would have no justification for any further search for drugs....", "...In any venture it is the same; capital is necessary--why not let me capitalize yours?

Napoleon was in no situation to manoeuvre leisurely, with all Europe on the march against him. His engrossing aim was to gain immediate victory over his adversaries in Belgium before the Russians and Austrians should close in around him. His expectation was that Bluecher would offer battle about Fleurus and be overwhelmed before the Anglo-Dutch army could come to the support of its Prussian ally. To make sure of preventing that junction the Emperor's intention was <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> detail Ney with the left wing to reach and hold Quatre Bras. The Prussians thoroughly beaten, drifting rearward toward their base, and reduced to a condition of comparative inoffensiveness, he would then turn on Wellington and force him to give battle.

If confirmation of this view be needed, it will be found in the fact that, as soon as the Archbishop was confined to a sick-room, Mary of Guise, the Queen Mother, supported by her brothers in France and by the Catholic party at home, began to undermine the Regent's position by intrigue, and ultimately, partly by coaxing, partly by threats, won from him a promise to...", "...(or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns.

By Miss Edith Leonard. The last busy days of the school year are over. We have gathered the first fruits of our work; we hope there will be a greater harvest in years to come. At the communion service, on June 7, three of our pupils were received into the church. The next Thursday came the evening of declamations, recitations, and music, for which the pupils had been preparing. During the last four weeks it was a common thing to find a boy declaiming <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> an imaginary audience in the schoolroom, or to find a girl reciting in some secluded spot in the yard, or on the hills in the pasture. In most schools that is nothing worthy of remark, but to us it shows that the young people are beginning to feel that their success depends on their own efforts. When the evening came we had an enjoyable entertainment. The house was decorated with the tall, graceful stems of the Solomon's Seal, and the platform had a rug and potted plants upon it,...", "...enough he is apt to sing his own swan song, for a farewell perch on the electric chair at Sing Sing!\" Then he lit a cigarette and packed up the phonograph.

The \"blasphemous headship\" over the church of Christ, as viewed and designated by his persecuted disciples in the British empire, may tend to illustrate this part of the beast's history. King Henry VIII. of England, upon renouncing the civil and ecclesiastical headship of the Pope, proceeded <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> usurp an ecclesiastical headship within his own dominions; and all his royal successors till the present day have asserted a similar dominion over the faith of the Lord's people. As an \"inherent right of the crown,\" the sovereign of Britain, male or female, is declared to be \"supreme judge in all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil!\" The rest of the horns are no less blasphemous in their haughty pretensions.

He demanded instantly to see the duchess, and after tearing the placard to shreds in her presence, declared that nothing would induce him <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> subject her to such indignities; consequently he would remain at the schloss with the rats. The duchess glared at him, and in her turn cuffed a saucy page that laughed behind his hand; and from that hour she was his enemy.

Only, when they were at last in the train, she threw back her veil and smiled at Dosia, with a clear, triumphant relief in the smile, a sweetness, a lightness of expression that was almost roguish, and that communicated a similar lightness of heart to Dosia. \"He will lend me the money,\" said Lois, with a grateful, touching confidence that seemed to shut out every conventional, every worldly...", "...her an ugly look; his face slowly reddened. \"So you're the path-master?\" he said. \"Yes.\" \"And you expect to get money out of me?\" She flushed painfully. \"You can't get it,\" he said, harshly; \"I'm dog poor; I haven't enough to buy two loads for my rifle. So I'll buy one,\" he added, with a sneer. She was silent. He chewed the mint-leaf between his teeth and stared at her dog. \"If you are so poor--\" she began. \"Poor!\" he cut in, with a mirthless laugh; \"it's only a word <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> you, I suppose.\" He had forgotten her ragged and outgrown clothing, her shabby shoes, in the fresh beauty of her face. In every pulse-beat that stirred her white throat, in every calm breath that faintly swelled the faded pink calico over her breast, he felt that he had proved his own vulgarity in the presence of his betters. A sullen resentment arose in his soul against her. \"I don't know what you mean,\" she said; \"I also am terribly poor.

But Lord Timothy spells <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> suit himself, and in place of employing punctuation as it is commonly used, prints a separate page of periods, colons, semicolons, commas, notes of interrogation and of admiration, with which the reader is requested to \"peper and soolt\" the book as he pleases.

Apparently it was as brilliantly illuminated as when the company had separated there for the night, and he pushed across the foyer hall that separated the billiard-room from the drawing-zoom and library. He entered the drawing- room, and in the depths of the library, relieved against the rows of books in their glass cases, he startled Miss Shirley from a pose which she seemed <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> be taking there alone.

She would become a little candy merchant. She felt sure she could find purchasers enough, if her merchandise only looked clean and good. It was a great deal better than begging, and she thought her mother would consent <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> her making and selling the candy. What a glorious idea! If she could only make money enough to support her mother and herself, how happy she should be! Full of enthusiasm at the idea of accomplishing such a vast project, she scarcely heeded the crowds of people that thronged the street and rudely jostled her. If she saw them at all, it was only to regard them as so many purchasers of molasses candy.

April had at first been too shy to pronounce the actual word \"kiss.\" She had evaded it, and later, when she had come to use it, it had been for a long while accompanied by a blush.

She was of a quiet and sunny nature, kind, serene, and smiling. She ignored evil, was exquisitely artless, and never understood a great deal of the realities of life, because she did not see them.

Four hundred French vessels now yearly come <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> reap the harvest of the sea; in and out among the fantastic rocks of Gaspe, pierced and pillared and scooped into caves by the wave wash, where fisher boats reap other kind of harvest, richer than the silver harvest of the sea,--harvest of beaver, and otter, and marten; up the dim amber waters of the Saguenay, within the shadow of the somber gorge, trafficking baubles of bead and red print for furs, precious furs. Pontgrave, merchant prince, comes out with fifty men in 1600, and...", "...But there are points at which we seem to hear the voice of Elihu interrupting the flow of the ode as no poet would check his muse. At chap, xxxvii. 14 the sentence is interjected, like an aside of the writer drawing attention to the words he is quoting,--\"_Hearken unto this, O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of God._\" Again (vv. 19, 20), between the description of the burnished mirror of the sky and that of the clearness after the sweeping wind, without any reference <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the train of thought, the ejaculation is introduced,--\"_Teach us what we shall say unto Him, for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. Shall it be told Him that I speak? If a man speak surely he shall be swallowed up._\" The final verses also seem to be in the manner of Elihu. But the ode as a whole, though it has the fault of endeavouring to forestall what is put into the mouth of the Almighty speaking from the storm, is one of the fine passages of the book. We pass...", "...I believe, by either M'Kay or Sinclair, guides and steersmen with the expeditions under Sir G.

After leaving Norway House our progress was slow, the water being very shallow, and our boat rather a heavy drag, for a single crew, over the portages. Two Indians who were engaged, the one to go as far as Oxford House, and the other all the way <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> York Factory, stipulated that they should do no work on Sunday; to which I readily agreed, thinking that they acted conscientiously; and this I really believe to have been the case with one; but I had some doubts about the sincerity of the other, when I learned that, before leaving us, he had stolen a shirt and blanket from one of the boat's crew. We arrived at York Factory on the 8th October, during a strong gale of north-east wind with heavy rain and sleet, which had thoroughly...", "...ne me permet pas de dire qu'elle se rencontre un fois sur trois, ni sur cinq, ni meme sur dix, mais bien seulement sur quinze a vingt.\" Monro (Obs. on Crural Hernia) states this condition of the obturator artery to be as 1 in 20-30. Mr. Quain (Anatomy of the Arteries) gives, as the result of his observations, the proportion to be as 1 in 3-1/2, and in this estimate he agrees to a great extent with the observations of Cloquet and Hesselbach. Numerical tables have also been drawn up <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> show the relative frequency in which the obturator descends on the outer and inner borders of the crural ring and neck of the sac. Sir A. Cooper never met with an example where the vessel passed on the inner side of the sac, and from this alone it may be inferred that such a position of the vessel is very rare. It is generally admitted that the obturator artery, when derived from the epigastric, passes down much more frequently between the iliac vein and outer border of the ring....", "...he passed, he knew the traditions and tales of each locality; hence in his company every mile of the road had some point of deep interest. Roger Mowry's Tavern was the first one established in the town of Providence. It escaped destruction in King Philip's War, when nearly all the town was burned, and stood till the present day. When a coach started out from that old tavern, it passed the burying ground and a dense growth of barberry bushes which grew along the roadside. There seems <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> have been, in many places, a suspicion of uncanny reputation connected with barberry bushes. In one spot a dense group of bushes was said to harbor a vast snake; in another it shaded an Indian's grave; a third concealed a ghost. The barberry was not a native of America; it is an immigrant, and has the further ill name of blasting any wheat near which it is planted. The grewsome growth of barberry bushes near Mowry's Tavern was the scene of the first serious crime of the settlement...", "...the Burnt Sacrifice. 'This name,' he says, 'records a circumstance which took place in the nineteenth century, but which, it is to be hoped, was never customary in the Isle of Man. A farmer, who had lost a number of his sheep and cattle by murrain, burned a calf as a propitiatory offering to the Deity on this spot, where a chapel was afterwards built. Hence the name.' Particulars, I may say, of time, place, and person could be easily added to Mr. Moore's statement, excepting, perhaps as <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the deity in question; on that point I have never been informed, but Mr. Moore is probably right in the use of the capital _d_, as the sacrificer is, according to all accounts, a highly devout Christian. One more instance: an octogenarian woman, born in the parish of Bride, and now living at Kirk Andreas, saw, when she was a 'lump of a girl' of ten or fifteen years of age, a live sheep being burnt in a field in the parish of Andreas, on May-day, whereby she meant the first of May...", "...was the grave of Abraham. We now rode for hours over flats, hills, and ridges of sand and loose stones; and this day's journey was as fatiguing as that of our arrival at Damascus. From twelve o'clock at noon until about five in the evening we continued our journey through this wilderness, suffering lamentably from the heat. But now the wilderness was passed; and suddenly a picture so lovely and grand unfolded itself before our gaze, that we could have fancied ourselves transported <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the romantic vales of Switzerland. A valley enriched with every charm of nature, and shut in by gigantic rocks of marvellous and fantastic forms, opened at our feet. A mountain torrent gushed from rock to rock, foaming and chafing among mighty blocks of stone, which, hurled from above, had here found their resting-place. A natural rocky bridge led across the roaring flood. Many a friendly hut, the inhabitants of which looked forth with stealthy curiosity upon the strange...", "...in fat money vaults, this assumption that prosperity is greater than sacrifice, that these young men of whom I have told have gone out to be wounded and to die. This mockery of the \"blackened page\" and \"blood-smeared pages\" of Europe has stung many thousands of Americans into action. The record of their service is a protest against such gloating. These fighters and rescuers and workers would not have served Germany with an equal zest. Neutrality between France and Germany is impossible <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> them. Those who fail to see the difference between France and Germany in this war are not of our historic American tradition. Meanwhile our friends at home, very sincere and gifted men, but mistaken, I believe, in their attitude toward nationality, are summoning America to an artistic rebirth, so that \"the new forces in our arts may advance.\" They write: \"The soldier falls under the compulsion of the herd-instinct and is devoted by his passion to a vision out of which destruction...", "...but rather to have been produced from the occasion. It is true, the boldness of the figures is to be hidden sometimes by the address of the poet; that they may work their effect upon the mind, without discovering the art which caused it. And therefore they are principally to be used in passion; when we speak more warmly, and with more precipitation than at other times: For then, _Si vis me flere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi;_ the poet must put on the passion he endeavours <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> represent: A man in such an occasion is not cool enough, either to reason rightly, or to talk calmly. Aggravations are then in their proper places; interrogations, exclamations, hyperbata, or a disordered connection of discourse, are graceful there, because they are natural. The sum of all depends on what before I hinted, that this boldness of expression is not to be blamed, if it be managed by the coolness and discretion which is necessary to a poet. Yet before I leave this...", "...For there shall be mourning and lamentation in thine own house; and against thy people shall be stirred up many cities. And now, my child, lead me home, and let this man rage against them that are younger than I.\" So the prophet departed, and the old men were sore afraid, and said: \"He hath spoken terrible things, O King; nor ever since these gray hairs were black have we known him say that which was false.\" \"Even so,\" said the King, \"and I am troubled in heart, and yet am loath <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> depart from my purpose.\" \"King Creon,\" said the old men, \"thou needest good counsel.\" \"What, then, would ye have done?\" \"Set free the maiden from the sepulchre, and give this dead man burial.\" Then the King cried to his people that they should bring bars wherewith to loosen the doors of the sepulchre, and hastened with them to the place. But coming on their way to the body of Prince Polynices, they took it up, and washed it, and buried that which remained of it, and raised...", "...away with her. Returning to her dressing-room, she found that Evan had faithfully kept his engagement; he was on the exact spot where she had left him. Caroline came to him swiftly, and put her hand to his forehead that she might the better peruse his features, saying, in her mellow caressing voice: 'What is this, dear Van, that you will do? Why do you look so wretched?' 'Has not Louisa told you?' 'She has told me something, dear, but I don't know what it is. That you are going <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> expose us? What further exposure do we need? I'm sure, Van, my pride--what I had--is gone. I have none left!' Evan kissed her brows warmly. An explanation, full of the Countess's passionate outcries of justification, necessity, and innocence in higher than fleshly eyes, was given, and then the three were silent.

While, however, the work connected with the trust did not interfere with other obligations or with the promotion of the welfare of others, no one, I imagine, would censure the trustee for continuing to perform it, to his own inconvenience or disadvantage, if he chose to do so.

Three years ago Christians were being massacred in the streets of Sale, the pirate town across the river from Rabat, and two years ago no European had been allowed <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> enter the Sacred City of Moulay Idriss, the burial-place of the lawful descendant of Ali, founder of the Idrissite dynasty. Now, thanks to the energy and the imagination of one of the greatest of colonial administrators, the country, at least in the French zone, is as safe and open as the opposite shore of Spain. All that remains is to tell the traveller how to find his way about it. Ten years ago there was not a wheeled vehicle in Morocco, now its thousands of miles of trail, and...", "...to declare at the Moscow Congress that \"Never in history had any Czarist Government been as generous and prodigal as the Government of Revolutionary Russia,\" and that \"the new Revolutionary regime is much more expensive than the old one.\" Suffice it to quote a few \"astronomic\" figures in order to gauge the insuperable obstacles in the way of a reasonable Budget. The decline of production and the excessive rise in wages resulted in the necessity of enormous expenditure for subsidies <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> expiring concerns and for overpayments for means of production. These over-payments in the Donetz Basin alone amounted to 1,200,000,000 roubles; the increase in the soldiers' pay, 500,000,000 roubles; railwaymen's pay, 350,000,000 roubles; Post Office employees, 60,000,000 roubles. After a month the latter demanded another 105,000,000 roubles, while the entire revenue of the Posts and Telegraphs was 60,000,000 roubles.

[Illustration] Keats was the martyr of poetry, but Shelley was the martyr of opinion. Keats dared to write in a new vein, to disregard all the old canons of criticism, to pour out his heart, and all his fancies, in that way only which seemed naturally <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> belong to them, and this was cause enough to bring down upon him the vengeance of all the rule-and-line men of literature. But besides this, Keats kept suspicious company. Hunt and Shelley were notorious Radicals; and Hunt and Shelley were his friends. \"Tell me what company you keep, and I will tell you what you are,\" is an old proverb, and was, in John Keats' case, most promptly applied. But Shelley was perhaps the most daring, as he was the most splendid offender of modern times....", "...had tempted them, greater humiliations, greater persecutions followed, until the horrors of the inquisition chamber and death at the stake were welcomed by the poor wretches as a relief from mental torment still more terrible.\" So they talked, the mighty ruler and the humble Rabbi, while those in the ante-room waited impatiently for an audience. Finally the Governor arose. \"I will not exact a definite answer at present,\" he said. \"Discuss the matter with your friends and come <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> see me again in the course of a week or two.

He broke up the siege in spite of the urgent advice of his chancellor Thomas; and for nearly forty years the quarrel lingered on with the French monarchy, till the question was settled in 1196 by the marriage of Henry's daughter Joanna to Count Raymond VI.

Madonna Paola--following her inclinations--withdrew to the Convent of Santa Caterina, there to pursue in peace the studies for which she had a taste, whilst her splendid, profligate brother became the ornament--the arbiter elegantiarum--of our court. Thus were they left undisturbed; for in the cauldron of Borgia politics a stew was simmering that demanded all that family's attention, and of whose import we guessed something when we heard that...", "...I'm dead.

But, as land was taken up, the squatter obtained a particular run for a term of years. He subdivided it by fences into paddocks, and so reduced his number of herds and conducted his operations more scientifically. When a new run is taken up, it is pretty sure, in the first instance, to be stocked with cattle.

At this point attention must be called <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> the fundamental difficulty with which all negotiations at that time, and subsequently, were confronted, and necessarily confronted. In Germany it was seen very clearly from the start that the probability of a combined French-Russian attack, for which influential political groups in St. Petersburg, as well as in Paris, were working, was very slight, so long as England's entrance into this anti-German combination could be left out of consideration.

If the people who shut me up at Montrouge, at the gates of Bicetre, like a paralytic, had had the good sense to furnish me with the money <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> start in business--\" At that point Risler succeeded in silencing him, and thereafter only snatches of the conversation could be heard: \"a more convenient shop--high ceilings--better air--future plans--enormous business--I will speak when the time comes--many people will be astonished.\" As he caught these fragments of sentences, Delobelle became more and more absorbed in his estimates, presenting the eloquent back of the man who is not listening.

Among the reasons for which this study is so worthy of commendation--in addition to its own excellence and to the homage which we owe to God's word--the chief reason of all is the manifold benefit of which it is the source. This we know will flow therefrom on the most certain testimony of the Holy Ghost Himself, who says: \"All Scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice, that the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.\" That such was the purpose of God in giving the Scriptures to men is shown by the example of Christ our Lord and of His Apostles. He who obtained authority by miracles, merited belief by authority, and by belief drew to Himself the multitude, was accustomed in the exercise of His Divine Mission to appeal to the Scriptures. He uses them at times to prove that He was sent...", "...often of the greenstick variety, or, if complete, is transverse and sub-periosteal, and as it is accompanied by few symptoms and but little deformity, is liable to be overlooked. When there is displacement, the deformity is similar to that in adults, and the treatment is carried out on the same lines. In young children the nursing is greatly facilitated by applying vertical extension to one or both lower extremities (Fig. 79). If the fracture is transverse and shows little tendency <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> displacement, the local Gooch splints may be dispensed with; in any case, massage should be employed from the first. The patient may be allowed out of bed in from three to four weeks, wearing a retentive apparatus. The shaft of the femur is sometimes fractured _during delivery_, particularly in breech cases. The simplest and most efficient means of controlling the fracture is by extension strapping fixed to the lower end of a Thomas' knee splint.

For the former, evolution is a process that is accomplished quite unconsciously, and is determined exclusively by the condition at any time of the elements forming the aggregate, and their varying relations. The Idealist also likes to talk of an evolution of society, but since this is only the evolution of an idea, there can be no contradiction, and it is only right and fair for him <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> demand that this evolution should be accomplished in the direction of other and (as he thinks) higher ideas, the realisation of which is the object of society. So he comes to demand that society should realise the ideas of Freedom, Equality, and the like. A society which does not wish, or is unfitted to do this, can and must be overthrown and annihilated.

Later, when we are incapable, although it is hard to rise, we need not fall.

One obvious criticism of this evidence is that it seems to prove too much, for it is difficult to believe that a change produced in individuals would show so much hereditary effect in their immediate offspring. Two other methods are conceivable by which the influence of somatic hormones might be evident. One of these is to graft ovaries or testes from one animal into another which possesses a certain somatic character, and then <span class=\"clocktext\">to</span> see if the offspring produced from these gonads shows any trace of the character of the foreign soma in which it was nourished. C. C. Guthrie [Footnote: _Journ. Exper. Zool._ (1908), v.] claimed to have done this in his experiments on hens. He grafted the ovaries of two Black Leghorn pullets into two White pullets of the same breed, and vice versa. The black and the white birds bred true when mated to cocks of their own colour.
