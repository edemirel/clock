He assisted his father on the farm until 1867, when he was visited by F. B. Barber, an army comrade, a homesteader in northwestern Nebraska. His accounts of the new country were so attractive that Mr. Roscoe, who had long desired a farm of his own, decided to go west. He started in March, 1867, was delayed in Chicago by a snow blockade, but arrived in Omaha in due time.

At last he broke loose--the flesh and blood of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old revolted. At twelve o'clock one night he found himself locked out and, as the first bold peal of the bell elicited no reply, he never again applied for admittance, but with four pounds in his pockets and a good saleable watch, launched his little skiff upon the great, wide world.

The year of absence had left a profound impression upon her character. Her mind and heart had undergone a rapid development.

Many a story of suffering and death the men skilled in the lore of the Banks could tell, but most eloquent of all stories are those told by the figures of the men lost from the fishing ports of New England.

In fifty years this little town gave to the hungry sea two thousand two hundred men, and vessels valued at nearly two million, dollars.

But it was forced to give way, like its neighbors. The opening of Corea was due to Japan. In 1876 the Japanese did to this secluded kingdom what Commodore Perry had done to Japan <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years before. They sent a fleet to Seoul, the Corean capital, and by threat of war forced the government to open to trade the port of Fusan. In 1880 Chemulpo was made an open port. Later on the United States sent a fleet there which obtained similar privileges. Soon afterwards most of the nations of Europe were admitted to trade, and the isolation of the Hermit Nation was at an end.

I pushed on with the usual rapidity, entering every relay station on time, and accomplished the round trip of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles back to Red Buttes without a single mishap and on time.

For the most part, however, the invention of the plot, the delineation of character, and the poetic imagery of his plays were due to the Greek dramatists whose works he presented in Latin form. To Ennius himself belong the skillful...", "...discovery. Though it bears neither name nor date, there is internal evidence that it was written in the year 1660, after the return of Charles II., by Samuel Maverick, afterwards one of the king's commissioners. Maverick, when Winthrop and his company arrived, was settled at Noddle's Island, now East Boston, and was known to have been here some years before. The date of his arrival in New England has hitherto been unknown. This manuscript gives it as 1624. Maverick was then about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old. An account of New England by one of the first white men who ever settled on the shores of Massachusetts Bay, one of the \"old planters\" whom Gov. Winthrop found here, is certainly of extraordinary interest to all students of our colonial history. Its fortunate discovery emphasizes in the strongest manner the great importance of the work which Mr. Waters is doing for us in England. This paper clears up many obscurities in our early New England history, and...", "...we had lately had much rain it was hoped that there would be a sufficiency in the springs for our use. (*Footnote.

The bank on which the anchor was dropped was so steep that, although the anchor was in twelve fathoms, the vessel was, at the length of forty fathoms of cable, in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> fathoms. As we were bringing up, two muskets were fired from the shore, and a white flag, or rather a rag, was suspended to a pole, around which a group of people had collected. This flag gave us no very favourable idea of the respectability of the place, and the meaning of the muskets we could not divine, nor indeed ever did discover, unless it was that we had anchored on bad ground: the boat was then hoisted out and I went on shore, accompanied by Messrs.

The next summer Nicholson returned with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> men, crossed the river at the same place, and cut a road through to the Winnebago agency at Long Prairie. Returning the same year to the crossing, he found Wm. Aiken had made a claim and was building a hotel and store on the east bank of the river.

This would make the aggregate length of the bones of the leg about ten feet. The ball is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> inches in circumference, and the bone lower down, of course, much larger. From the part of the skeleton secured, it is estimated that the hight of the animal was twelve and a half feet, and the skeleton entire much larger than the specimen now in the British Museum.

Alexander Wilmot was a tall, handsome young man, very powerful in frame, and very partial to all athletic exercises; he was the best rower and the best cricketer at Oxford, very fond of horses and hunting, and an excellent shot; in character and disposition he was generous and amiable, frank in his manner, and obliging to his inferiors.

There were thirty-two of these barges, each of them sixty-two feet in length and twelve in breadth, the spaces between each couple being <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet wide, and all being bound together, stem, stern, and midships, by quadruple hawsers and chains. Each boat was anchored at stem and stern with loose cables. Strong timbers, with cross rafters, were placed upon the boats, upon which heavy frame-work the planked pathway was laid down. A thick parapet of closely-fitting beams was erected along both the outer edges of the whole fabric. Thus a continuous and well-fortified bridge, two thousand four hundred feet in length, was...", "...Far from it.

He had grown gray in the service and had performed feat after feat of heroism; but his complete lack of political backing had kept him from further promotion. In <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years on the force he had saved some twenty-five persons from drowning, to say nothing of rescuing several from burning buildings. Twice Congress had passed special acts to permit the Secretary of the Treasury to give him a medal for distinguished gallantry in saving life.

The officers of the Bear reasoned that the sender of the message was a member of the Napoleon's crew who had found refuge with the natives to the southwest of Cape Navarin and was now anxiously awaiting rescue.

The Government viewed it in that light, and ordered commissions to be issued forthwith for the enrolment of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> regiments for general service (from the 79th to the 100th), sixteen of which were subsequently made permanent, and added to the establishment. Other bodies were also raised for home services, known as \"Fencibles.\" Now was the time for Alan to bestir himself.

Our aggregate loss, made up from official statements, shows seventeen hundred killed, seven thousand four hundred and ninety-five wounded, and three thousand and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> prisoners; aggregate, twelve thousand two hundred and seventeen, of which twenty-one hundred and sixty-seven were in Buell's army, leaving for that of Grant ten thousand and fifty.

A month later the affairs of Jamaica came up for discussion, for the Government found itself forced, by the action of the House of Assembly in refusing to adopt the Prisons Act which had been passed by the Imperial Legislature, to ask Parliament to suspend the Constitution of the colony for a period of five years; and on a division they gained their point by a majority of only five votes. The Jamaica Bill was an autocratic measure, which served still further to...", "...others, the doctor and Ruggles, the waiters and porters gathered in the hall, heard.

They followed him so closely, and in such numbers, for holy counsels, that he could scarcely command a moment for retirement. They begged to receive from him religious books, and to have their names written therein with his own hand, as memorials of him, and very many followed him from place to place till his final embarkation. It was indeed a surprising fact, that a young man, scarcely more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age, and previously unknown to the world, should be able to collect such immense congregations, and rouse and command their attention; multitudes hanging upon and receiving instructions from his lips. But God had endowed him with a singular union of qualities, which most eminently fitted him for the work of an evangelist. He was faithful to his trust, and his divine Master abundantly blessed and honored him in the discharge of its momentous duties.

Blake, not able to restrain his natural ardour, or, perhaps, not fully informed of the superiority of his enemies, put out to encounter them, though his fleet was so weakly manned, that half of his ships were obliged to lie idle without engaging, for want of sailors. The force of the whole Dutch fleet was, therefore, sustained by about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> ships. Two of the English frigates, named the Vanguard and the Victory, after having, for a long time, stood engaged amidst the whole Dutch fleet, broke through without much injury, nor did the English lose any ships till the evening, when the Garland, carrying forty guns, was boarded, at once, by two great ships, which were opposed by the English, till they had scarcely any men left to defend the decks; then retiring into the lower part of the vessel, they blew up their...", "...in the road. What a still, lazy place it was! Some one asked the time. The driver's watch had stopped. Nobody knew; it appeared not to matter. This seemed no place for clocks. A stout lame man, having the look of a Southern war veteran, stopped on his cane in the middle of the road, looked around carefully at the outlying country and the shadows, then took a calculating glance at the heavens.

You gen'lly get here about two, but you was a bit late to-day, a leetle bit late, I should say maybe to the amount of about twelve minutes.' He leaned on his cane again and began dotting his way slowly and heavily through the dust toward the hotel. I could not have told whether he was in jest or earnest.

Mynheer Foersech further assures his gentle readers that he witnessed several of these expeditions, and entreated the culprits to bring him some branches of the tree; but two withered leaves were the only specimens he could obtain from the solitary wretch who had the good fortune to escape, and who described the tree as growing on the borders of a...", "...and rippled along the trenches, and the guns could come no nearer with living men and horses. It was long past midday, and that unhappy breakfast seemed further off than ever. As the afternoon wore on, a curious condition of things was established. The guns could not advance, and, indeed, it was found necessary to withdraw them from a 1200 to a 2800-yard range, so heavy were the losses. At the time of the change the 75th Battery had lost three officers out of five, nineteen men, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> horses. The infantry could not advance and would not retire. The Guards on the right were prevented from opening out on the flank and getting round the enemy's line, by the presence of the Riet River, which joins the Modder almost at a right angle. All day they lay under a blistering sun, the sleet of bullets whizzing over their heads. 'It came in solid streaks like telegraph wires,' said a graphic correspondent. The men gossiped, smoked, and many of them slept. They lay on...", "...a second Quantrell, to be a freebooter, going where he pleased and plundering all who were not strong enough to resist. He believed that with his company he could imitate Quantrell's famous raid on Lawrence, overrun all Southern Colorado and burn and sack the city of Denver, where he had been imprisoned. The majority of his men were Texans, and they did not relish the idea of a 500-mile raid through a hostile country, so that when he got ready to start, in April, 1864, he found that but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of his men would stay with him. Nothing daunted, he resolved to push forward with this small band, fully believing that he could get plenty of recruits in the mines, where rebel sympathizers had been plentiful enough a few years before. In this, as we shall learn later, he was badly disappointed, never securing a single recruit. His friend, Col. McKee, gave them a pass through to Belknap, and taking only a few rations they pushed on through the Confederate lines.

What number had she at first? From the twelve remaining, deduct one, and eleven is the number she sold the last boy, which was half she had; her number at that time, therefore, was twenty-two. From <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> deduct two, and the remaining twenty was two-thirds of her prior stock, which was therefore thirty. From thirty deduct ten, and the remainder twenty is half her original stock; consequently she had at first forty apples. Why did the young lady return the dumb water? Because it didn't answer.

He dined alone in the small salle-a-manger where he had always dined alone, and where the last time he was here he had grown in an instant from <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> to thirty-two. Now, in another instant, it was as if he had gone back to twenty-two. It was even almost as if Edhart had returned to life. The mellow glow of the long twilight tinted the room just as it used to do.

The departments that elected them are better judges of their moral and political characters than those who have denounced them.

But she is much older than this child. She must be nearly forty by now, and to think I haven't seen her face for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years.

As regards the rest of the State, it may briefly be stated that this immense territory of thousands of square miles contained not over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> thousand white and black people combined. How many Indians there were is not definitely known, but they have been estimated at fifteen to eighteen thousand. The main cities were San Antonio de Bexar, San Felipe de Austin, Nacogdoches, San Augustine, Columbia, and the seaport town of Velasco, but not one of these boasted of more than thirty-five hundred inhabitants.

He had told her that the tough little plains pony could go any distance that its rider was able to \"fork\" it. She believed that, for the little animal under her had never looked tired when she had ridden him to the ranchhouse at the end of a hard day.

In spite of this consideration there are some differences of statement which are perplexing. Mesha says in substance that Omri conquered Medeba and occupied it during his reign, half the reign of his son, a period of forty years, but Chemosh restored it to Moab in his (Mesha's) day.

All the reign of Omri, and half of that of Ahab would, accordingly, be but twenty-three years. It is possible, however, as has been suggested by several scholars, that Mesha uses the word son to denote descendant, and that he refers to the war with Israel in the reign of Jehoram, son of Ahab, described in 2 Kings 3:6-27.

W. & O. for the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles between Utica and Remsen, Dr. Webb struck his new road off through the depths of the untrodden forests for nearly 150 miles. At first it was said that it was his aim to meet and terminate his line at Tupper Lake, which had been reached by the one-time Northern Adirondack from Moira, on the Ogdensburgh & Lake Champlain. Dr. Webb did meet this line, also the tenuous branch of the Delaware & Hudson, extending westward from Plattsburg, and then down to Saranac Lake and...", "...but cold water was thrown upon the project, and it failed. The navvy workmen, who have made the railways and docks of England, are a hard-working but a rather thriftless set. They are good-hearted fellows, but sometimes drunken. In carrying out their operations, they often run great dangers. They are sometimes so seriously injured by wounds and fractures as to be disabled for life. For instance, in carrying out the works of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> cases of compound fractures seventy-four simple fractures, besides burns from blasts, severe contusions, lacerations, and dislocations. One man lost both his eyes by a blast, another had his arm broken by a blast. Many lost their fingers, feet, legs, and arms; which disabled them for further work. Knowing the perils to which railway labourers were exposed, it occurred to a late eminent contractor to adopt some method for helping and comforting them in their declining years....", "...given him to them to sell for them in Egypt.

This seems to be a small beginning upon which to rear a full-grown rooster. The bulk or quantity as found in hens' eggs, and indeed in the eggs of all birds, is wonderfully disproportionate to the size of the mother bird. The laying of eggs must be regarded as a particularly exhausting process, and yet fowls will keep it up for a long time and not lose much in flesh. We have known a hen of the game variety which has laid <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> eggs in twenty-two consecutive days, and they average in weight one thousand grains each. This gives in amount twenty-two thousand grains, or rather more than three pounds avoirdupois, of which about two and a quarter pounds is water.

About ten persons were present when I measured the part exposed to observation. We applied a strong cord close to the metal, in all parts of its periphery, and round the lower part, where it touches the ground, taking care at the same time not to stretch the cord. From the piece of the bell broken off, it was ascertained that we had thus measured within two feet of its lower extremity. The circumference obtained was sixty-seven feet four inches; allowing a diameter of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet five inches, and one-third. We then took the perpendicular height from the top, and found it to correspond exactly with the statement made by Hanway; namely, twenty-one feet four inches and a half. In the stoutest part, that in which it should have received the blow of the hammer, its thickness equalled twenty-three inches.

Lorris is a little town situated between Orleans and Montargis. Here, about the year 1200, the earlier poet was born. He was a scholar, at least as far as knowledge of Latin extends, and learned above all in the lore of love. He died young, probably before 1230, and during the five years that preceded his death the first part...", "...your coat for you, Uncle Wiggily.\" \"You.

Then, about fourteen thousand six hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> black ants took each a long, sharp pine needle, and threading it with grass, they began to sew up the rips and tears in Uncle Wiggily's coat. And in places where they could not easily sew they stuck the cloth together with sticky gum from the pine tree. So, though the pine tree was to blame, in a way, for Uncle Wiggily's fall, it also helped in the mending of his coat. Soon the coat was almost as good as new and you could hardly tell where it was torn. And Uncle...", "...is a native of San Francisco.

He was a simple-natured scientist, and treated Bell with the utmost kindness. He showed him an ingenious talking-machine that had been made by Baron de Kempelin. At this time Bell was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> and unknown; Wheatstone was sixty-seven and famous. And the personality of the veteran scientist made so vivid a picture upon the mind of the impressionable young Bell that the grand passion of science became henceforth the master-motif of his life.

One evening we went, in a body, to visit them and were entertained by dancing. However, too much \"fire water\" caused some fear among the guests. We had several courses of lectures during those early years. One year we had as lecturers, Wendell Phillips, Douglas, Beecher, Tilton and Emerson; following them came the Peake family, bell ringers and last of all, a sleight of hand performer from Mankato, Mr. Wheeler, who astonished his audience by swallowing a blunt sword <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> inches long. At another time we had a home-made \"lecture course\" in which Mr. Cole, Mr. Batchelder, Judge Lowell, myself and others took part.

If the circumference had been given, the diameter might have been found by dividing the circumference into <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> parts and setting off seven of them.

But a general discharge from the enemy, killing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of their men caused them to make a retrogade movement, much to the amusement of the French. The battle had lasted during three hours, and when evening came, the scene was as quiet as if the blast of war had never scared the birds from the trees or the cattle from the plain.

There a flatboat, twelve by thirty feet in dimension, was constructed on lines similar to a western ferry boat, having a carrying capacity of eight tons with a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> foot oar at each end to direct its course. The rapid current averaging about four miles per hour precluded any thought of going up stream in a large boat, so it was constructed on lines sufficiently generous to form a living boat as well as to carry the season's collection of fossils.

The spiritual aspect of things is now the main topic. The poet deals less with incident, and more with the moral significance of the nation's sufferings. It is the religious culmination of the book. His poem is rather lyrical than narrative, which may account for some obscurities in the connexion of thought; but his alphabetic scheme proves that he _designed_ <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> stanzas, not sixty-six detached couplets. There is something arresting in that bold \"I am the Man\"; and the lyrical intensity, the religious depth and beauty of the whole, may well blind us to occasional ruggedness of metre and language, abrupt transitions from figure to figure and other alleged blemishes, some of which may not have seemed such to the poet's contemporaries (e.g. the repetition of the acrostic word, far more frequent in Psalm cxix.); and some disappear on...", "...and began to swim, the column drew back, and followed in the direction of another column, which had not yet lost the firm ground.

The diameter of the inner circle was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet and of the outer thirty-three feet. The walls were thick and were perforated apparently by three equi-distant doorways.

Needless to add, I very soon became as enthusiastic about that game as all other games I ever had any knowledge of, and before the football season was over I was as rabid a rooter as the Tuckers themselves. \"I believe you are a born lover of games, Page,\" said Miss Sayre, smiling as my enthusiasm got the better of me and I let out a piercing shriek in honor of a short, bow-legged boy who had seized the ball at a crucial moment...", "...and a half!--on a wet collodion plate, 10 by 8.

The plate had <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> or three seconds' exposure, and when I developed in their dark room, it was just those two or three seconds over-exposed. Nevertheless, Mr. Fry brought me a print from that negative in a few days, and acknowledged that it was one of the finest negatives he had ever seen.

Step by step we have seen a handful of gallant people free themselves from oppression by emperor or duke, by prince or lord, by prelate or cloister. Inch by inch the people at large have gained their political rights from foreign overlords or from native aristocracies. We have seen how a tiny confederation of three petty states has grown into a league of eight, and then of thirteen independent districts, and how this has developed into the federal state of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> cantons of our own day.

Samuel composed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> theses on Hebrew grammar. Only one, however, Sefer-ha Osher, the \"Book of Riches,\" is worthy of mention. The rest were only polemic treatises directed against the great Hebrew linguist, Ibn Janach, towards whom Samuel was unfriendly.

Kaltschmid describes a case of ascites in which, in 12 paracenteses, 500 pounds of fluid were removed. In 1721 Morand reported two cases of ascites in one of which, by the means of 57 paracenteses, 970 pounds of fluid were drawn off in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> months.

And we had scarcely retreated down the steep slope and into the ravine before they occupied the ridge above us in hundreds, sending volley after volley after our retreating men. It was a case now of _sauve qui peut_, and to me the only marvel is how we lost so few under the circumstances. Our casualties were four killed (including Surgeon-Major Cornish), eleven wounded, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> prisoners. The Highlanders suffered the most. The officers were the last to leave the ridge. I saw Captain Robertson standing on the crest of the slope giving some final directions just a moment before the ridge was entirely covered by the Boers, and his escape consequently was almost a miraculous one. I was in the ravine before I heard our artillery open fire upon the Boers. Second-Lieutenant Staunton, 92nd Highlanders, was taken prisoner....", "...our delight. We threw the lead and began looking for anchorage. Nine, eight, seven fathoms were successively reported, and for some minutes the depth remained at six and a half.

Not having enough milk for both, and being too poor to secure the assistance of a midwife, in her desperation she sought an old woman named Laverge, a widow of sixty-five, whose husband had been dead twenty-nine years. This old woman gave the breast to one of the children, and in a few days an abundant flow of milk was present. For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> months she nursed the infant, and it thrived as well as its brother, who was nursed by their common mother--in fact, it was even the stronger of the two. Dargan tells of a case of remarkable rejuvenated lactation in a woman of sixty, who, in play, placed the child to her breast, and to her surprise after three weeks' nursing of this kind there appeared an abundant supply of milk, even exceeding in amount that of the young mother.

It may easily be imagined, therefore, that the...", "...the prelate fled to Rome. In 1453 Mahomet II. entered Constantinople. There was no longer a Christian emperor of the east, and Moscow became the heir of Constantinople and the metropolis of orthodoxy. Ivan, the artist-monk of Constantinople, brought to Moscow such of the holy relics as he could save, and, what is more, by his own genius impressed upon the Muscovite priesthood a love of culture to which Moscow had hitherto been a stranger. Ivan III., styled \"The Uniter of Russia,\" was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age when, in 1462, he succeeded his father Vasili, the Blind. He continued the policy of the princes of Moscow and early obtained a success against the Tartars of Kazan. In 1472 he married Sophia, a daughter of Thomas Paleologus, a brother of the last emperor of Byzantium, and this union, with a member of the race that had so long held sway over all orthodox Christianity, greatly influenced his policy. His wife, less patient than the Russians, found the Mongol yoke...", "...to leave, reprieve him and put no one in his place. McNEIL. When the order was delivered to Colonel Strachan he raved like a madman. He had had ten coffins made, and though the heavens fell, they should be filled.

The ascetic youth was thoroughly dismayed by the calamitous turn of events. He regarded Frick as \"an enemy of the People,\" a cruel exploiter of labor who had to be destroyed as a concrete warning of the oncoming revolution. He gloried in this opportunity to serve the American workers in the manner of the Russian nihilists. It pained him therefore to think that he owed his failure to kill Frick to the interference of the very workers for whom he was...", "...say I would send a man to Mtesa as soon as I had seen Kamrasi about opening the road; that I trusted he would take all the guns from the deserters and keep them for me, but the men themselves I wished transported to an island on the N'yanza, for I could never allow such scoundrels again to enter my camp.

He has also suggested that the appearances could be accounted for by supposing a body like our sun to be rotating in twelve days and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> hours, and having attached to it an enormous protuberance extending over more than one hundred and eighty degrees of longitude, so that when one end of it was approaching us with the rotation of the star the other end would be receding, and a splitting of the spectral lines at certain periods would be the consequence. \"The variation in light,\" he adds, \"may be caused by the visibility of a larger or smaller portion of this protuberance.\" Unfortunate star, doomed to carry...", "...equal parties, and ascertain, by drawing lots, which of the two shall go to the palace, and beg for food and assistance.

Then, taking off his helmet, he put two shells into it, on one of which was written, \"Go,\" and on the other \"Stay.\" Another person now held the helmet, while Ulysses and Eurylochus drew out each a shell; and the word \"Go\" was found written on that which Eurylochus had drawn.

It was a tremendous fight, brief as it was savage; at two o'clock the assault was made and within an hour Charles was repulsed. Almost all the infantry perished. The slain is estimated variously from ten to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> thousand. Charles did not keep his vow to perish if defeated. To his assured allies he clung closely, and none had more reason to be faithful to him than Yolande of Savoy.

As it was, six or seven of his <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> followers were Negroes. Meantime the slave power was impelled by the high price of slaves and the exhaustion of cotton land to make increased demands. Slavery was forced north of Mason and Dixon's line in 1820; a new slave empire with thousands of slaves was annexed in 1850, and a fugitive slave law was passed which endangered the liberty of every free Negro; finally a determined attempt was made to force slavery into the Northwest in competition with free white labor,...", "...with sorrow for my hard fate.

My knowledge of country ways, too, enabled me to behave like a landed proprietor of small means. After a hearty lunch I pushed boldly on up the Valerian Highway and covered the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles between Tibur and Carseoli without visibly tiring my mount. He was no more winded nor lathered than any traveller's horse should be at the end of a day on the road. At Carseoli I again knew of a clean, quiet inn, and there I dined and slept. Thence I intended to follow the rough country roads along the Tolenus. Stream-side roads are always bad, so I allowed two days more in which to reach home, and I could hardly have done it quicker. The night after I left Carseoli...", "...of more important bodies._ --_A. de Morgan, 1847._ When any scholar could advance beyond hornbook and primer he was ready for grammar. This was not English grammar, but Latin, and the boy usually began to study it long before he had any book to con. A bulky and wretched grammar called Lilly's was most popular in England. Locke said the study of it was a religious observance without which no scholar was orthodox. It named twenty-five different kinds of nouns and devoted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> pages of solid print to declensions of nouns; it gave seven genders, with fifteen pages of rules for genders and exceptions. Under such a regime we can sympathize with Nash's outburst, \"Syntaxis and prosodia! you are tormentors of wit and good for nothing but to get schoolmasters twopence a week.\" It was said of Ezekiel Cheever, the old Boston schoolmaster, who taught for over seventy years, \"He taught us Lilly and he Gospel taught.\" But he also wrote a Latin grammar of...", "...up in New York City to entice people into the habit of talking to other cities.

By 1906 even the Rocky Mountain Bell Company had grown to be a ten-million-dollar enterprise. It began at Salt Lake City with a hundred telephones, in 1880.

Conceiving that he should lose ground by making any more motions of a personal nature, especially before the fate of Pitt's India Bill should be decided, he set himself to work to defeat that bill. A long debate took place upon its second reading, which was on Friday, the 23rd, and on the motion for its commitment, it was rejected by two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> against two hundred and fourteen. Exulting in his victory, Fox then moved for leave to bring in another bill, similar in its principles to his former one, and this being given, he called on Pitt to state explicitly whether he intended to prevent its progress by a dissolution of parliament.

The severity of the little action and the hardihood of the defence are indicated by the fact that the small body who held the kopje lost fifteen killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> wounded, the gunners losing nine out of fifteen. A relieving force appeared at the close of the action, but no vigorous pursuit was attempted, although the weather was wet and the Boers had actually carried away sixty loaded wagons, which could only go very slowly.

About 1880 lynching of Negroes began to increase, nominally because of more frequent rapes of white women; and to this day one often hears it said: \"Lynchings never occur except for the one crime.\" In the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years from 1882 to 1903, Cutler has recorded 3,337 cases of lynchings, an average of 150 a year, rising to the number of 235 in 1892. In 1903 there were 125 persons lynched and 125 executed legally. Of these lynchings, 1,997 took place in the Southern states, 363 in the Western states, 105 in the Eastern states, and not a single one in New England. Of the 3,337 lynchings, 1,169 were of Whites (109 for rape) and 2,168 were Negroes, thus completely disposing of the notion that...", "...of my saddle----\" \"Your saddle?

What had been occurring on the Malabar coast during this long and adventurous campaign? The answer may be summed up in a few lines. It will be remembered that Almeida had set out from Belem in 1505 with a fleet of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> sail, carrying soldiers to the number of 1500 men. First he seized Quiloa and then Mombaz, of which the \"cavaliers, as the inhabitants loved to repeat, did not yield as easily as the chicken hearts of Quiloa.\" Out of the enormous booty, which by the fall of this town fell into the hands of the Portuguese, Almeida only took one arrow as his share of the spoil, thus giving a rare example of disinterestedness.

Its place of retirement in the winter, is not positively known; but it is supposed by some, to be far north of the arctic circle; and by others, to be in some part of the Atlantic farther south. Shoals of this fish appear on the coasts of both Europe and America, in the summer season. Of this fish there are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> species. 20. The mode of catching the mackerel, is either with a net or with hooks and lines. The latter method succeeds best, when the boat or vessel is driven forward by a gentle breeze; and, in this case, a bit of red cloth, or a painted feather, is usually employed as a bait. Several hooks are fastened to a single line, and the fish bite so readily, that the fishermen occasionally take one on each hook at a haul. The mackerel is _cured_ in the usual manner, and packed...", "...have prevailed. The cultivator deals directly with the government; has a lease as it were subject to revaluation every thirty years.

But Diodorus is not consistent with himself; he attributes (xi. 48) Leotychides's death to the year 476-475 and he records (xii. 35) Archidamus's death in 434-433, though he introduces him in the following years at the head of the Peloponnesian army (xii. 42, 47, 52). Further, he says expressly that Leotychides [Greek: eteleutesen arxas ete eikosi kai duo], i.e. he lived <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years after his accession. The twenty-two years, then, may include the time which elapsed between his exile and his death. In that case Leotychides died in 469, and 476-475 may be the year in which his reign, though not his life, ended.

At her trial nine hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> men from all parts of Germany were ready to testify to something like thirty thousand separate instances of brutal treatment of soldiers. Dr. Rosa Luxemburg was born in Russian Poland, of Jewish parents, and studied in Switzerland. She went later to Germany in order to become active in Social-Democratic propaganda.

By midday most of the men were so exhausted that they could hardly crawl along.

If Purcell composed the work before he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> he worked a miracle; and even if the date is ten years later it stands as a wonderful achievement. If we ask why he did not produce more real operas, there can be only one answer: the town did not care for them.

In 1831, Cyrus, then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, took up the problem, and after careful study constructed a machine which was successfully employed in the late harvest of 1831 and patented in 1834.

If these can be obtained, all is well. If not, and if the inhabitants prove as inhospitable as Polyphemus or the Laestrygons, then there will but half of us perish, and the remainder may set sail and escape.\" As nobody objected to this scheme, Ulysses proceeded to count the whole band, and found that there were forty-six men, including himself. He then numbered off <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of them, and put Eurylochus (who was one of his chief officers, and second only to himself in sagacity) at their head. Ulysses took command of the remaining twenty-two men, in person. Then, taking off his helmet, he put two shells into it, on one of which was written, \"Go,\" and on the other, \"Stay.\" Another person now held the helmet, while Ulysses and Eurylochus drew out each a shell; and the word \"Go\" was found written on that which Eurylochus had drawn. In this manner it...", "...At the age of ten John Wesley went to Charterhouse School. For a long time after he got there he had little to live on but dry bread, as the elder boys had a habit of taking the little boys' meat; but so far from this hurting him he said, in after life, that he thought it was good for his health! Although he was not at school remarkable for the piety he had shown earlier, yet he never gave up reading his Bible daily and saying his prayers morning and evening. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> he began to think of entering the ministry, and wrote to his parents about it. He also commenced to regulate the whole tone of his life. \"I set apart,\" he writes, \"an hour or two a day for religious retirement; I communicated every week; I watched against all sin, whether in word or deed. I began to aim at and pray for inward holiness.\" In September, 1725, when he had just passed his twenty-second year, he was ordained. Thirteen years later John Wesley began that series of...", "...While Major Bach never repeated the senseless pit-digging and refilling programme for the priests, his invention was by no means exhausted. Direct incentive to rebellion proving completely abortive he now resorted to indirect pettifogging and pin-pricking tactics, harassing the unfortunate priests at every turn, depriving them of food or something else, reducing their rations, giving them the most repulsive work he could discover, and so forth. But it was all to no purpose. Those <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> priests beat him at every turn. For Major Bach to try to break their proud spirit was like asking a baby to bend a bar of steel! What ultimately became of these prisoners I cannot say. In fact, I do not think there is any one who can definitely relate their fate.

The great peak of Kinchinjunga is in part hidden by those of Pundim and Nursing, but the panorama of snowy mountains is very grand indeed. The effect is quite deceptive; the mountains assuming the appearance of a continued chain, the distant snowy peaks being seemingly at little further distance than the nearer ones. The whole range (about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles nearer than at Dorjiling) appeared to rise uniformly and steeply out of black pine forests, which were succeeded by the russet-brown of the rhododendron shrubs, and that again by tremendous precipices and gulleys, into which descended mighty glaciers and perpetual snows. This excessive steepness is however only apparent, being due to foreshortening.

I don't feel any real religion; I should think those feelings impossible to obtain, for even if I thought all the Bible was true, I do not think I could make myself feel it: I think I never saw any person who appeared so totally destitute of it.\" It was something to arrive at the conviction that she lacked the one thing needful; and that she...", "...and to consider how far it will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in their present posture.

On August twenty-ninth, Count Szoegyeny, the Austrian Ambassador, left Berlin.

Quite a crowd of Germans and diplomats were at the station to witness the rather sad farewell. His successor was Prince Hohenlohe, married to a daughter of Archduke Frederick.

Cassius has this to say on the subject: 'Select for farm hands those who are fitted for heavy labour, who are not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age and have some aptitude for agriculture, which can be ascertained by trying them on several tasks and by enquiring as to what they did for their former master.'

In more recent times, the conditions have been so greatly changed by immigration, that the later statistics cease to have a definite meaning with regard to acclimatization. We have here a population which doubled itself every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years; and the greater part of this rapid increase must certainly be due to the old European immigrants.

For instance, in France, to protect farmers, a law was passed imposing a duty of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> per cent. upon imported wools, and the result has been that native wools have been sold for much lower prices than before the passage of the law. In England a law in behalf of the consumers was passed, exempting foreign wools from duty, and the consequence has been that native wools have sold higher than ever before. And this is not an isolated fact, for the price of wool has no special or peculiar nature which takes it out of the general law governing prices. The same...", "...the preceding measurements.

I suppose you know that?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I might be willing to increase the mortgage to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> hundred, and he could lend you the extra two hundred.\" This was a new idea to Tom, and he took a little time to think it over. \"I don't like to ask father to do that,\" he said. \"He finds it very hard now to pay the interest on the mortgage.\" \"I thought you intended to pay the money in a year,\" said the squire sharply. \"So I do,\" said Tom, and he began to think more favorably of the plan. \"In that case your father wouldn't suffer.\" \"You are right, sir.

Before two years had elapsed, it had gone through <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> editions, and been translated into most of the European languages. This early success, rare in works of profound and original thought, showed, that though it was in advance of the age, it was but a little in advance; and that it had struck a key which was ready to vibrate in the national mind.

This, on the left side, is an impassable fall, but on the right is a succession of rapids. From the sixth to the fifth cataract is a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> mile stretch of navigable water. The fifth, fourth, third, second and first cataracts come in quick succession, and within a space of nine miles.

Kirtland is three miles from Mentor, the home of the late President Garfield, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles east of Cleveland, and is situated in a remarkably fertile country. As soon as the Mormons arrived there they purchased a square mile of land, which they laid out in half-acre lots. In addition they bought a number of farms.

But when the report was taken up for consideration several days later an amendment was offered which proposed to substitute the boundaries as described in the Constitution of 1844. On a test ballot the vote of the Convention stood <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> to eight in favor of the amendment. This was on the eighth of May. Six days later a resolution instructing the Committee on Revision to amend the article on boundaries so as to read as follows was adopted by a vote of eighteen to thirteen: \"Beginning in the middle of the main channel of the Mississippi river, at a point due east of the middle of the mouth of the main channel of the Des Moines river; thence up the middle of the main channel of the said Des Moines river, to...", "...and the steamboat \"Fulton,\" to her starboard side; they towed her through the water from three and a-half to four miles per hour.

The Collins line charged from thirty to forty dollar a ton for freight, a charge which all the modern improvements and the increase in the size of vessels, has not materially lessened. In six years, however, the corporation was practically bankrupt. The high speed required by the Government more than offset the generous subsidy, and misfortune seemed to pursue the ships. The \"Arctic\" came into collision with a French steamer in 1854, and went down with two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of the two hundred and sixty-eight people on board. The \"Pacific\" left Liverpool June 23, 1856, and was never more heard of. Shortly thereafter the subsidy was withdrawn, and the famous line went slowly down to oblivion.

For a palanquin, it is necessary to engage eight bearers, besides several for the luggage. Although each does not receive more than eight rupees a-month, out of which he pays his own expenses; still the expense is heavy, because so many are required, and their return journey must be paid for. Travelling on camels is also expensive, and is the most inconvenient. I decided, therefore, on adopting the less costly mode of conveyance by oxen. As I travelled...", "...American frigates could get to sea at all, on account of their heavy draft and the close blockade; whereas the smaller vessels, national or private, had not only many harbors open, but also comparatively numerous opportunities to escape.

She hailed, it appeared, from London, from which port she had originally sailed, having on board <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> adult passengers, with five children; specie amounting to one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and a very valuable general cargo, all for Kingston. She had joined a convoy at Plymouth, and had sailed with it, all going well with the fleet until they reached the neighbourhood of latitude 25 degrees North and longitude 50 degrees West, when a hurricane was encountered which completely scattered the convoy, and compelled the _Truxillo_ to run to the southward for three days...", "...But this problem was, despite its difficulties, still possible of solution; and Hooker set himself to work to elucidate it.

This son, William by name, was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age at the time; and as he died in 1813, eleven years after the publication of Dr. Stuber's biographical sketch, he had ample time to contradict the kite story if instead of being a fact it were a mere romance.

Now Gildas, as we are told by William of Malmesbury, 'took up his abode' at Glastonbury 'for a series of years.' If Arthur died, as was supposed, in the year 542, and Gildas was born in 520, the historian must have been <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old when the king was buried under the description of 'the famous King Arthur,' _inclytus Rex Arthurius_. Gildas might have been present had this taken place as represented, or at any rate must have heard from his friends the monks of what could not fail to be of interest to the British historian. But neither Arthur's death nor his life appealed to Gildas. Thus we must discredit both the Camel and Glastonbury as connected with Arthur's death and burial.

She was one of the most beautiful women of her time; but for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years she had lived nearly in a state of separation from her husband, and no living heir to the throne had been born. The king and the queen were not harmonious; and after the lapse of this long period, the birth of a son was regarded as an extraordinary, if not a miraculous event, especially by the devout people of the nation, who called the child the \"God-given.\" Louis XIII. was personally a brave man, and had some good qualities; but as a ruler he was weak and incapable...", "...my revolver--'\" \"Revolver!

It is true, in particular, that, since the disastrous period that preceded the Repeal of the Corn Laws and the passing of the Ten Hours' Act, social improvement has been real and marked. Trade Unionism and co-operation have grown, wages upon the whole have increased, the cost of living has diminished, housing and sanitation have improved, the death rate has fallen from about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> to less than fifteen per thousand. But with all this improvement the prospect of a complete and lifelong economic independence for the average workman upon the lines of individual competition, even when supplemented and guarded by the collective bargaining of the Trade Union, appears exceedingly remote. The increase of wages does not appear to be by any means proportionate to the general growth of wealth. The whole standard of living has risen; the very provision of...", "...under one command in the history of the American Navy concentrated before Fort Fisher, North Carolina, late in 1864.

The extraordinary sepulchral chamber of the Hawara pyramid, which, though it is over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet long by ten feet wide over all, is hewn out of one solid block of hard yellow quartzite, gives some idea of the remarkable facility of dealing with huge stones and the love of utilizing them which is especially characteristic of the XIIth Dynasty.

These two episodes embrace many centuries between them. A very interesting study might be made of the gradual transformation from the redskin to the knight; it might be shown how, and at what period of history, each of the virtues of chivalry penetrated victoriously into the undisciplined souls of these brutal warriors who were our ancestors; it might be determined at what moment the church became strong enough to impose upon our knights the great...", "...we dined on mountain _florellen_ and strawberries and cranberries.

The ancestress, the forgotten one, tall, bony, ghastly, remained motionless, her eyes, only seeming to have life, her eyes shining clear as spring water in her thin...", "...the position of the principal rivers, mountains, and towns.

He at the same time carefully weighed his stores of provision, which consisted of tea, coffee, biscuit, salted meat, and pemmican, a preparation which comprises many nutritive elements in a small space. Besides a sufficient stock of pure brandy, he arranged two water-tanks, each of which contained <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> gallons. The consumption of these articles would necessarily, little by little, diminish the weight to be sustained, for it must be remembered that the equilibrium of a balloon floating in the atmosphere is extremely sensitive. The loss of an almost insignificant weight suffices to produce a very noticeable displacement.

Such, in its principal characteristics, is the life Paganina led until she was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age. Her beauty had developed radiantly. She held her head aloft, as one who looks on high; and her eyes so sought the distance that she won the name of proud from the good women who met her in their daily walks.

Of this poem, the author was, I think, allowed to enjoy the praise for a long time without disturbance. Many years afterwards Dennis published some remarks upon it, with very little force, and with no effect: for the opinion of the publick was already settled, and it was no longer at the mercy of criticism. About this time he published the Temple of Fame, which, as he tells Steele in their correspondence, he had written two years before; that is, when he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, an early time of life for so much learning and so much observation as that work exhibits. On this poem Dennis afterwards published some remarks, of which the most reasonable is, that some of the lines represent motion, as exhibited by sculpture[115].

In truth the tragical scene enacted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years ago was always before her eyes. She beheld the \"Cynthia\" filling with water and ready to sink. She saw herself tying her infant to a large buoy while the passengers and sailors were rushing for the boats.

The lessons to be drawn from these severely condensed records, cut down to the bone, as it were, are plain. The first of them is, that when a life is over, the one thing which lasts, or is worth thinking about, is the man's relation to God and His will. Here are twelve years' reign in the one case, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> in the other, all boiled down, so to speak, into half a dozen sentences, and estimated according to one standard only.

That a period of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years has not been sufficient to render New South Wales independent of the mother country, is a reflection which must produce strong and ungenial suspicions of the prudence of those methods which have been pursued to accelerate such a desirable end; and the continuance of the late system, the inefficiency of which has been amply illustrated by recent events, and facts which are incontrovertible, is, of all evils, the most sincerely to be deprecated and guarded against.

Brother Dominick Collins, who had been a soldier in France and Spain, was executed at Youghal in 1602. He was the last of Elizabeth's victims. An interesting character appears at this juncture in the person of Father Slingsby, the eldest son of Sir Francis Slingsby, a Protestant Englishman settled in Ireland. Young Francis was converted to the Faith in 1630, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old; he made up his mind to be a Jesuit, but in obedience to his father's order he returned to Ireland. He was imprisoned in Dublin. At the request of the queen, Henrietta Maria, however, he was not executed but banished from the kingdom. Returning to Rome in 1636, he was received into the Society in the following year. It was the intention of his Superiors to send him back to Ireland but he was detained on the Continent for his studies. He was ordained a priest in...", "...by reason of swamps. But it was on that half-moon road that I should have been now, if my order to have a horse meet me at the Halfway stables I had built at the beginning of it had not been forgotten or disregarded by some one at La Chance.

I was obliged to get home, for reasons of my own; but when I walked in on Billy Jones, the foreman at the Halfway stables, that afternoon, after months of absence and road-making, there was not even a team horse in his stables, let alone my own saddle mare.

It was only two miles long and extended from the city of Durban to its harbor. Since then several inland lines, aggregating over four hundred miles, have been constructed at a cost of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> million dollars. The roads are operated by the colonial government and yielded in 1891 a net revenue of 4.4 per cent. on the capital expended.

During his researches on the motions of Mars, Kepler discovered that the planet sometimes travelled at an accelerated rate of speed, and at another time its pace was diminished. At one time he observed it to be in advance of the place where he calculated it should be found, and at another time it was behind it. This caused him considerable perplexity, and, feeling convinced in his mind that the form of the planet's orbit could not be circular, he was...", "...into England. The only advantage gained by the English invasion was that the king, by promises of pardon and rewards, drew away a number of the leading men who had hitherto acted with Glendower. Their defection, however, was more than made up by the enthusiasm excited by the spectacle of the second retirement of a great English army, without having effected anything of importance. So evident was this, that in October Henry again advanced, with the contingents of no fewer than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> counties. The season, however, was already unfavourable for operations and, after enduring great hardships and suffering, the army again fell back, having effected even less than the two which had preceded it.

The goat skins were thirty-seven in number, dyed red, and were sewn together, so as to form a roll forty-eight feet in length by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> inches in width.

This woman had never existed; there had been a certain Barbara Rozenzoph who died in 1919, and her vote was used by Marjeta Hanzio, aged <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years. The case was so flagrant that the Commission discovered it and the woman confessed to having acted on a note which she had received from the special Austrian _gendarmerie_ force, the Heimatsdienst.

While it is to be confessed, that Wolf's objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's modification of his theory any better. He divides the first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus. This as Grote observes, \"ex-plains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else.\" Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the...", "...first rough draft of an account of my first impression of Haydon.

The nobles followed the King; the merchants followed the nobles after their kind; the peasants were still clothed in the simplest of garments, having retained the Norman tunic with the sleeves pushed back over the wrist, kept the loose boots and...", "...a length of more than forty miles on its southern side it is open and without any reef, whilst on the other sides it is bounded by a reef, in parts rising to the surface and perfectly characterised, in parts lying some fathoms submerged. In the Chagos group there are annular reefs, entirely submerged, which have the same structure as the submerged and defined portions just described. The Speaker's Bank offers an excellent example of this structure; its central expanse, which is about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> fathoms deep, is twenty-four miles across; the external rim is of the usual width of annular reefs, and is well-defined; it lies between six and eight fathoms beneath the surface, and at the same depth there are scattered knolls in the lagoon. Captain Moresby believes the rim consists of dead rock, thinly covered with sand, and he is certain this is the case with the external rim of the Great Chagos Bank, which is also essentially a submerged atoll. In both these cases, as...", "...manager in Illinois._ James Ford Rhodes, LL.D.: \"When Lincoln entered upon political life he became reticent regarding his religious opinions, for at the age of twenty-five, influenced by Thomas Paine,... he had written an extended essay against Christianity.\" Hon.

Mr. Herndon was a man of academic education, and possessed a number of books that in that day would be considered a good library, and he told me that the books of his which fairly fascinated Lincoln were Volney's 'Ruins' and the works of Thomas Paine, especially the latter, of which he had memorized many pages.\"--Col.

As soon as we arrived at that, which as I have said was named Juana, I proceeded along its coast a short distance westward, and found it to be so large and apparently without termination, that I could not suppose it to be an island, but the continental province of Cathay. In the meantime I had learned from some Indians whom I had seized, that the country was certainly an island; and therefore I sailed toward the east, coasting to the distance of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles, which brought us to the extremity of it; from this point I saw lying eastwards another island, fifty-four miles distant from Juana, to which I gave the name Espanola. All these islands are very beautiful, and distinguished by a diversity of scenery; they are filled with a great variety of trees of immense height, and which I believe to retain their foliage in all seasons; for when I saw them they were as verdant and luxurious as they usually are in Spain in the...", "...Brady. I told her she hadn't any business bothering you, but she swears she'd spend it.\" \"That was wrong, Sally.\" Miss Grower tossed her head. \"Oh, she knew I'd take it, well enough.\" \"I imagine she did,\" Mr. Bentley replied, and his eyes twinkled. He rose and led the way into the library, where he opened his desk, produced a ledger, and wrote down the amount in a fine hand. \"Susan Brady, three dollars and thirty-five cents. I'll put it in the savings bank to-day. That makes <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> dollars and forty cents for Sue. She's growing rich.\" \"Some man'll get it,\" said Sally. \"Sally,\" said Mr. Bentley, turning in his chair, \"Mr. Holder's been telling me about a rather unusual woman in that apartment house just above Fourteenth Street, on the south side of Dalton.\" \"I think I know her--by sight,\" Sally corrected herself. She appealed. to Holder. \"Red hair, and lots of it--I suppose a man would call it auburn.

We had long conjectured, that the non-arrival of supplies must be owing either to accident or delays in the voyage, and not to any backwardness on the part of government in sending them out. We now found that our disappointment was to be ascribed to both misfortune and delay. The _Lady Juliana_, we have seen, sailed in July last, and in the month of September following his majesty's ship _Guardian_, of forty-four guns, commanded by Lieutenant...", "...you any more, for you are young and thoughtless, and of course you couldn't foresee what an effect--' 'But oh, dear, I ought certainly to have known better.

Another is on the freedom of Flaminius, proclaimed at the Isthmia B.C. 196. An Alcaeus was one of the Epicurean philosophers expelled from Rome by decree of the Senate in B.C. 173, and may be the same. Others of his epigrams are on literary subjects. All are written in a hard style. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> in all in the Anthology. Some of them are headed \"Alcaeus of Mitylene,\" but there is no doubt as to the authorship; the confusion of this Alcaeus with the lyric poet of Mitylene could only be made by one very ignorant of Greek literature. Of the same period is DAMAGETUS, the author of twelve epigrams in the Anthology, and included as \"a dark violet\" in the /Garland/ of Meleager, l. 21. They are chiefly epitaphs, and are in the best style of the period.

That was a puzzler. He didn't know they came in sizes. He was about to tell her to pick out the smallest size, when he happened to think of something. \"Take a tape measure and measure my arm; that will just fit.\" The girl looked wise as though she had been there herself, found that it was a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> inch corset the boy wanted, and he went home and wrote a note and sent it with the corset to the girl. He didn't hear anything about it till the following Sunday, when he called on her. She received him coldly, and handed him the corset, saying, with a tear in her eye, that she had never expected to be insulted by him. He told her he had no intention of insulting her; that he could think of nothing that would cause her to think of the gentle pressure of his arm around her...", "...rotters, aren't they?

She was of that cross bred type that are so numerous, full bloods seemingly to have become rare about those parts. She was of a light brown complexion, almost a mulatto. She seemed about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age. Of the curious eyes upon her she seemed entirely unaware, finally leaving the train at a station that he was familiar with and disappeared. At Thirty-first Street he left the train, fell in with the scattered crowd below and the dash of the city life was his again in a twinkling.

The most heartrending of them all are injuries to children, and, sometimes, to women. Let me cite you several of such cases: Albert Jennings, ten years old, was sitting on the tracks north of Lampton, July 9, at 10:45 a.m., where he was struck by a work train of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> empty flats backing north and both legs crushed. Air not coupled in as required by Rule 44; no hand brakes on the cars.

At present, the usual remuneration is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> sous, the wife earns twelve, the children so little that they do not lighten the burthen; but supposing no incumbrances, thirty-four sous, the price of the man and woman's work, can hardly enable them to exist and pay house-rent, which is dear in Lyons.

Their masters summoned them before the Prefet, and the increase...", "...the more exposed settlements. While we were near the Caddoe village, a reliable citizen came into our camp and reported having seen a considerable force of Indians on Rock creek, a little over twenty miles distant. Judging from the intelligence received as to the number of warriors, Captain Brown thought it prudent to prepare for a defense of his camp rather than to start in pursuit. We were out of ammunition; and to procure a supply, it was necessary for some one to go to Belknap, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles distant, and it fell to my lot to be the messenger. It was by no means a pleasant task, partly because the weather was exceedingly hot, but especially because all the Indians in that region had come to look upon the Rangers as enemies.

He drove on, around the rubbly base of a blackened volcano...", "...statement, to wit, that Talbot was buried on the spot where he fell, whereas his body was carried from the field and taken to England. The ecclesiastical chronicler must have accepted the story in circulation among the common people, which is repeated to this day by the peasants around Castillon, who even point out a mound which they call 'Talbot's grave.' Shakespeare does not fall into this error, although he brings Jeanne d'Arc upon the battlefield, notwithstanding that she was burnt <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years before the death of Talbot. According to the version accepted by French historians, Talbot was overthrown by a cannon-shot, and was afterwards despatched on the ground by a soldier who ran his sword through the hero's throat. His body was carried into the French camp, where it remained all night, and it was so disfigured that his herald could hardly recognise it. Many of the fugitives were drowned or were killed by the archers while attempting to swim across the...", "...The east side of the Bay had not been sounded; if any existed, it would probably be found on that side. Mr. Flinders named the land upon which Cape Moreton was situated Moreton Island, supposing it to be that which Captain Cook would have given it, had he known of its insulated form. It appeared to be a strip of land whose greatest extent east and west was not more than four or five miles; but, according to the observations for the latitude, its north and south extent was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles. The ridge of land which ran along the middle of the island was nearly of the same height with the Cape; and, although it appeared to be composed of great piles of sand heaped together upon a base mostly of stone, it was yet interspersed with small trees calculated to mislead a distant observer, who would probably think that some parts of it were not among the most barren spots in the universe. In passing out of the bay they saw a large turtle lying asleep upon the...", "...or professional. Colonel W. S. Oliver was master of transportation on this occasion by special detail. CHAPTER XXXIII. ATTACK ON GRAND GULF--OPERATIONS BELOW VICKSBURG. On the 24th my headquarters were with the advance at Perkins' plantation. Reconnoissances were made in boats to ascertain whether there was high land on the east shore of the river where we might land above Grand Gulf. There was none practicable. Accordingly the troops were set in motion for Hard Times, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles farther down the river and nearly opposite Grand Gulf. The loss of two steamers and six barges reduced our transportation so that only 10,000 men could be moved by water. Some of the steamers that had got below were injured in their machinery, so that they were only useful as barges towed by those less severely injured. All the troops, therefore, except what could be transported in one trip, had to march. The road lay west of Lake St. Joseph. Three large bayous had...", "...Great numbers of the dead fish were floating upon the water. Here we met a considerable number of natives, and although the women would not come close, several of the men did, and made themselves useful by holding some of the horses' bridles and getting firewood. Most of them had names given them by their godfathers at their baptism, that is to say, either by the officers or men of the Overland Telegraph Construction parties. This was my thirty-second camp; I called it Rogers's Pass; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles was our day's stage. From here two conspicuous semi-conical hills, or as I should say, truncated cones, of almost identical appearance, caught my attention; they bore nearly south 60 degrees east.

It was his first glimpse of the inner workings of such a life, and its novelty interested him. A girl of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> who received attention and admiration in an enjoyable, matter-of-fact manner, as if she was used to and neither over- nor under-valued it, who could make coffee and conversation bearable and even exciting, who could hold her own against patronage and slights, and be as piquant and self-possessed at home as in society, who could be dazzling at night and charming in the morning, was novelty enough in herself to make Bloomsbury Place attractive, even at its dingiest, and there...", "...immense masses of rock, fixed together with a great deal of art, and seemingly calculated to last an eternity.

On the way I once more visited Herr Klinger, strengthened myself with a hearty meal, and arrived safely at Cairo late in the evening.

This ended my actual connection with National League base-ball, and its mismanagement. In spite of the fact that I have been connected with the Chicago Base-Ball Club for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years as an active player and for twenty-four years as a stockholder, I have never attended a meeting of that organization until recently, and then Mr. Hart and myself were the only stockholders present.

They associate in large flocks and frequent open glades, the borders of forests, and banks of rivers, which offer abundant supplies of grain, berries, and insects, in quest of which they wander during the day, and collect together at evening, and roost in clusters on the branches of trees or shrubs. Several other wild species are known, some of which are remarkable for their beauty; but the common Guinea-fowl is the only one domesticated in Europe. The Guinea-fowl is about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> inches long, and from standing high on its legs, and having loose, full plumage, appears to be larger than it really is, for when plucked it does not weigh more than an ordinary Dorking. It is very plump and well-proportioned. The Guinea-fowl is not bred so much as the turkey in England or France, is very rare in the northern parts of Europe, and in India is bred almost exclusively by Europeans, although it thrives as well there as in its native country.

He reigned seventeen years, and was interred in the city of David;* Abijam, the eldest son of Maacah, succeeded him, and followed in his evil ways. Three years later Asa came to the throne,** no opposition being raised to his accession. In Israel matters did not go so smoothly. When Jeroboam, after a reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years, was succeeded by his son Nadab, about the year 905 B.C., it was soon evident that the instinct of loyalty to a particular dynasty had not yet laid any firm hold on the ten tribes. The peace between the Philistines and Israel was quite as unstable as that between Israel and Judah: an endless guerilla warfare was waged on the frontier, Gibbethon being made to play much the same part in this region as Ramah had done in regard to Jerusalem. For the moment it was in the...", "...tail! And see! in spite of whip and shout, Old Hiram's mare is giving out!

Sand without a moment's hesitation went to the rampart, where, always religious, even in his childish pleasures, he made a short prayer; then, without fear, without hesitation, with a confidence that was almost superhuman, he sprang to the ground: the distance was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet. Sand flew instantly to Wonsiedel, and reached it, although the enemy had despatched their best runners in pursuit. Then the garrison, seeing the success of their enterprise, took fresh courage, and united their efforts against the besiegers, hoping everything from Sand's eloquence, which gave him a great influence over his young companions. And, indeed, in half an hour he was seen reappearing at the head of some thirty boys of his own age, armed with slings and...", "...succeeded his father, Louis XI, on the 30th of August, 1483. Louis by dint of executions, had tranquillised his kingdom and smoothed the way for a child who ascended the throne under the regency of a woman. And the regency had been a glorious one, and had put down the pretensions of princes of the blood, put an end to civil wars, and united to the crown all that yet remained of the great independent fiefs. The result was that at the epoch where we now are, here was Charles VIII, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age, a prince (if we are to believe La Tremouille) little of body but great of heart; a child (if we are to believe Commines) only now making his first flight from the nest, destitute of both sense and money, feeble in person, full of self-will, and consorting rather with fools than with the wise; lastly, if we are to believe Guicciardini, who was an Italian, might well have brought a somewhat partial judgment to bear upon the subject, a young man of little wit...", "...were called to suffer. Nicolas was scourged with leather thongs on the back and limbs, and his arms extended, so that they became for a time paralysed. His back, which was lashed and bleeding, was tenderly bathed with warm water and healing lotions by S. Theodore, his superior, till it was healed. Both were driven into exile, and kept for three years in nakedness, and without sufficient food and drink, in a wretched prison. They were beaten again at Smyrna, and further imprisoned for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> months, with their feet in the stocks. On the death of Leo, the confessors were released, and visited S. Nicephorus at Chalcedon. This took place during the absence of Constantine Copronymus, who had undertaken an expedition against the Saracens. During this absence, his kinsman, Artavasdus, assumed the purple, and everywhere the sacred images were triumphantly restored. Constantine flew for refuge to his paternal mountains; but he descended at the head of the bold...", "...was to be called \"The Army of Occupation in Utah.\" Thousands of cattle and immense supply-trains were started across the plains in advance. The price for the transportation was twenty-two cents a pound. These exorbitant contracts made the lucky individuals who had secured them very wealthy. By a little political wire-pulling he who had secured the flour contract obtained permission to provide the troops with Utah flour. It cost him but seven cents a pound, but he received the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> cents which it would have cost to have transported it from the States. This large army was stationed in Utah Territory for nearly four years. It is stated on good authority that the private soldiers asked of each other, \"Why were we sent here? Why are we kept here?\" while the common people wondered whether the authorities at Washington kept them there to make the contractors rich. At that time the people of the territory were in a starving condition in consequence of...", "...yesterday on Dromedary?\" Carter nodded somewhat guiltily. A man in the crowd volunteered: \"And he had Her Highness in the second, too, for four hundred.\" \"You've made a good day,\" said Burbank. \"Give me a chance to get my money back to-morrow. \"I'm sorry,\" said Carter. \"I'm leaving New York to-morrow.\" The same scarlet car bore them back triumphant to the bank. \"Twenty-two thousand dollars?\" gasped Carter, \"in CASH!

As the founder of the new dynasty the Greeks call him Heracles. Agron, the fourth descendant of this Sandon-Heracles, is said to have ascended the throne of Lydia in the year 1194 B.C. After him <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> kings, the descendants of Agron, bore the crown of Lydia for a space of 505 years, down to the year 689 B.C.[766] The power possessed by Lydia under this family of rulers cannot have been very considerable.

In an informal account written by the Achilles to this Sarpedon, he says: \"On that day we avenged his death. Near <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> hundred of the enemy's dead remained on the ground when night closed upon the scene of action.\" It is significant of the scale on which the war was waged, that the engagement thus written of goes solely (so far as can be learned) under the vague designation of one of the battles before Atlanta. 14. The piece was written while yet the reports were coming North of Sherman's homeward advance from Savannah. It is needless to point out its purely dramatic character....", "...taken no precautions to guard against a surprise: for there was no sentinel, and no person could be seen near the mansion. \"Platoon--halt!\" said Deck, when he had led his men into the shelter of the trees; but he spoke in a very low tone, for he was not more than fifty feet from the mansion. Taking the bugler and the guide with him, he crept carefully around the principal building, halting at the corner. From this point he obtained a full view of the ground in front. He counted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> horses, secured to a fence and in other places where it could be done. This he concluded was the force of the enemy. He could hear very loud noises and shouts within the mansion, and the sounds appeared to come from the upper story of the building.

Ordinary chemical forces resume their sway, and the oxygen of the air combines with the newly deposited carbon to reproduce a little carbonic acid. But this must be placed to the account of decomposing, not of growing vegetation; for by so much as plants grow, they decompose carbonic acid and give its oxygen to the air, or, in other words, purify the air. It has been found by experiment, that every six pounds of carbon in existing plants has withdrawn <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> pounds of carbonic acid gas from the atmosphere, and replaced it with sixteen pounds of oxygen gas, occupying the same bulk. And when we consider the amount of carbon that is contained in the tissues of living, and of extinct vegetation also, in the form of peat and coal, we may have some idea of the vast body of oxygen which the vegetable kingdom has added to the atmosphere. And it is also to be considered, that this is the only means we know of whereby free oxygen is...", "...fifteen minutes into the Farm grounds, an extra fare of five cents being charged.

But he let Fitz pass him, and he stood. The old bear was coming, crazy. She only halted to scratch where a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> pellet had stung her hide. Van Sant waited, steady as a rock. He lifted his little rifle slowly and held on her, and just as she was about to reach him he fired. \"Crack!\" Headfirst she plunged.

This man, named Husson, became insane through his sudden fall from opulence to poverty; he flung himself into the Seine, leaving the beautiful Madame Husson pregnant. Moreau, very intimately allied with Madame Husson, was at that time condemned to death; he was unable therefore to marry the widow, being forced to leave France. Madame Husson, then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, married in her deep distress a government clerk named Clapart, aged twenty-seven, who was said to be a rising man. At that period of our history, government clerks were apt to become persons of importance; for Napoleon was ever on the lookout for capacity. But Clapart, though endowed by nature with a certain coarse beauty, proved to have no intelligence. Thinking Madame Husson very rich, he feigned a great passion for her, and was simply saddled with the...", "...cultivating the native grape and of making Wine\". Thus Adlum's[68] _Cultivation of the Vine_ was the first American book on American grapes. The author's intentions, as indicated in his preface, quoted above, were good; but his book, as an exposition on native grape culture, is a failure. The work is concerned for most part with wine-making and his cultural directions are taken almost wholly, such as they are, from European books. In the last four pages of the treatise he describes <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> varieties of grapes of which perhaps a dozen are native sorts. In this edition the Catawba is described as the Tokay but in a second edition, published in 1828, the name is changed from Tokay to Catawba. Adlum was one of the first to call attention to the Catawba and was at the time its chief distributor. He advocated in his book, and in the papers of the time, the establishment of an experimental farm[69] upon which could be grown \"cuttings of the different species of the...", "...Voyage to New York,\" in 1679-1680, by Jasper Dankers and Peter Sluyter, edited and translated by Hon.

A letter had been lodged in the hands of the fiscal, from Captain Beachum, stating that the robbery was committed at a distance of about ten miles from Gretna; that the perpetrators were two ruffians, mounted on good horses; that they had taken the portmanteau filled with valuable papers, and also his purse, containing a balance of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> guineas, and a diamond ring, marked \"C.

In the second year of Mr. Whitehead's labours the present Meeting House was erected.

Thus, were there a line from Suez to Souakim by steamers, similar to that already established to Jedda, Cassala would be only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> days' journey from Cairo. At present, the arrival of steamers at Souakim is entirely uncertain; therefore the trade of the country is paralysed by the apathy of the Egyptian Government.

[D] Up to the present time, the Nebraska line has expended about twenty-five millions; the Central Railroad, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> millions. On two hundred and fifty-nine miles of the Kansas Road there were also expended, in cost and equipment, eleven millions. All this has been obtained from the sale of bonds, paid-in stock, and the net earnings of the roads.

The squadron appeared before the city on the fourth of March and after a siege of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> days succeeded in capturing the fort of Bocachica at the entrance of the harbor. Admiral Wentworth then made preparations to take the fort of San Lazare, which dominated the city. He planned to attack it with a force of two thousand men, but half of them, misunderstanding his directions, remained in camp.

Another indenture of the same date was made between Thomas de Boneston and Robert: for making a window at the west gable of the cathedral church, the said Robert is to find all sorts of glass and be paid 6d. per foot for white and 12d. per foot for coloured glass.

Of the thirty-two delegates who were elected to seats in the Convention of 1846, ten were Whigs and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> were Democrats. Fifteen of the members were born in the South, eight in the New England States, four in the Middle States, and five in Ohio.

It was a rare opportunity to see the handiwork of the enemy at close quarters, and we did not wish to miss it. Termonde is about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles from Antwerp, and a powerful car made short work of the distance. Starting directly southwards through Boom, we reached Willebroeck and the road which runs east and west from Malines through Termonde to Ghent, and along it we turned to the right. We were now running parallel to the German lines, which at some points were only a couple of miles away on the other side of the Termonde-Malines railway. We passed numerous Belgian outposts along the road, and for a few...", "...example; whose ancestress could not well avoid being a mother, it is true, but had accidentally omitted the preliminary rite.

He never had any pupil but a young woman named Haverman, and his brother Michael. Two other brothers have distinguished themselves in painting, one named Justus, who painted battles, and died at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, the other named James, who ended his days in England in 1740. He copied the pictures of his brother John so well as to deceive the connoisseurs: he had usually L20 for each copy.

This universal enthusiasm enabled Elias to complete the Lower Church in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> months, while the Upper Church was roofed in six years later, and finished in all essential details by 1253. But while Elias was applauded by most people, a few of the franciscans, headed by Fra Leo, still clung to the letter of the franciscan rule, and bitterly disapproved of these innovations.

When she was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old she was living with her mother at Exeter. Mrs. Holt was a widow with comfortable means,--ample that is for herself and her daughter to supply them with all required by provincial comfort and provincial fashion. They had a house without the city, with a garden and a gardener and two boys, and they kept a brougham, which was the joint care of the gardener and the boy inside and the boy outside. They saw their friends and were seen by them. Once in the year they left...", "...them where they are; for I know that as long as I stay up Others will punctually come for ever and ever.

The count was about retiring from the jetty, when he perceived a six-oared boat approaching it. At a moment when curiosity had been so much excited, this incident could not fail to attract all eyes. In the stern of the boat sat a young man, who appeared to be from twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age, and who was dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant of the royal navy--he was sitting, or rather lying, upon a bearskin, one hand reclining carelessly on the tiller of the small boat, while the coxswain, who, thanks to the caprice of his officer, had nothing to do, was sitting in the bow.

Isaac was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, when he was received as a member of the Society of Friends. It was probably the pleasantest period of his existence. Love and religion, the two deepest and brightest experiences of human life, met together, and flowed into his earnest soul in one full stream. He felt perfectly satisfied that he had found the one true religion.

Setting out from Fort Cumberland on the Potomac, the English General made his way north-westward at the head of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> hundred men, four hundred and fifty of these being veteran Virginians under the command of Colonel George Washington. But the overweening Braddock considered these raw colonials to be the least effective of his troops.

It was subsequently enlarged to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> and twenty-four, including trumpets and kettledrums on special occasions. From 1776 to 1778 there were also clarinets. This gradual extension of resources may be taken as roughly symbolizing Haydn's own advances in the matter of orchestral development.

The government, however, was scarcely likely to succeed as long as the bickerings between Mondejar and his rivals continued. In the spring of 1569, Philip, anxious to check these cabals, appointed Don John, his half-brother, the illegitimate son of Charles V., to the supreme command. At the same time he was forbidden to take the field, and as he was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old he was to be guided by a council of war, of which Deza and Mondejar both were members. The only result, therefore, of the change was that the quarrel was transferred from the camp to the council, where finally the views of Deza triumphed. In June, 1569, the whole of the Moorish inhabitants of the town of Granada, amounting to some three thousand five hundred souls, were ordered to leave the city for the interior, where they were to find new homes.

On the contrary, when they see any Castilian who makes a show, they immediately call him 'Captain,' and canonize him under this name, although he does not deserve to be even a soldier. The same is true in regard to the religious, of which I could say much because of my experience therein of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years.

Mummies thus prepared were considered to represent Osiris.

After injection the body was steeped a certain number of days in natron; the contents of the abdomen were allowed to escape; and the process was then complete.

Switzerland is made up of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> cantons, or states, each of which has two representatives; and, besides these, there are 128 members of the National Assembly, and seven members of the Federal Council, each of which last is chosen once in three years. The country is only one-third as large as the State of New York, being 200 miles long and 156 broad; and two-thirds of it is composed of lofty mountains or deep ravines.

There seemed an unexplained need for immediate departure; he begged her to forward his things; and shake them out carefully before she put them into the trunk.

Much against her own wish, we are told, she was appointed abbess at the age of twenty-five.

Though the rule required the abbess to be changed every three years, Maria remained the effective ruler of Agreda till her death. The Virgin was declared abbess, and Maria acted as her locus tenens. In her later years she inclined to the ``internal prayer,'' and neglect of the outward offices of the church, which was...", "...asks something for a reason, otherwise it would be a useless question.

And we have already seen that in 1865, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years after, the one only war he approved was that which had been fought against Russia for this very purpose. In the early stage of the negotiations which led to that war, his complaint was that the Government was not vigorous enough in defending Turkey.

Many instances have come to light in which immigrants have mistaken poisonous varieties in this country for edible ones with which they were familiar at home. In the vicinity of New York City there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> deaths from mushroom poisoning in one ten-day period (September, 1911) following heavy rains. The \"fly _Amanita_\"[23] (_Amanita muscaria_) in this country has been apparently often mistaken for the European variety of \"royal _Amanita_\" (_A. caesaria_).[24] Such a mistake seems to have been the cause of death of the Count de Vecchi in Washington, D.C., in 1897.

We left her far behind us. On the 10th of July, the wind continued favourable, there was a heavy swell of the sea, and much motion in the vessel. The weather clearing off towards noon, we were enabled to make exact observations, which we could not do for some days before, on account of the cloudy weather. It appeared, that we had made a small mistake in our computation of the longitude, for by the precise observation of this day, we found our latitude to be fifty degrees <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> minutes, and our longitude seventeen degrees. We saw already several birds, a proof that we were approaching land; we continually saw petrels and mother Carey's chickens. The more we sailed northwards, we felt the air becoming cooler, which created in me no pleasant sensation.

True enough, in several states the electors had been selected before the full pressure of the embargo was felt, but with such a substantial majority it is difficult to accept unreservedly Henry Adams' view that \"no one could fail to see that if nine months of embargo had so shattered Jefferson's power, another such year would shake the Union itself.\" BOOK SIX _The Sage of Monticello_...", "...the personality of some eminent teacher is shown by the career of Abelard.

Before long he had overcome his instructor in discussion, thus establishing his own reputation. At the early age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> Abelard himself set up as a lecturer. Few teachers have ever attracted so large and so devoted a following. His lecture room under the shadow of the great cathedral was filled with a crowd of youths and men drawn from all countries.

This raised the entire question of education, one of the most difficult to deal with in the whole range of Irish politics. On the 10th of April, Mr. Orde--destined to be the author of just, but short-lived projects--introduced his plan of what might be called national education. He proposed to establish four great provincial academies, a second university in some north-western county, to reform the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> diocesan schools, so richly endowed under the 28th Henry VIII., and to affiliate on Trinity College two principal preparatory schools, north and south.

They finished by cutting off a foot, a hand, and lastly his head; after which the Hurons put all the members into a cauldron, each one partook of them, and a piece was offered to Father Brebeuf. Charlevoix speaks in another place of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> Hurons eaten by the Iroquois. It cannot, then, be doubted, that in more countries than one, human nature has reached this last pitch of horror; and this execrable custom must be of the highest antiquity; for we see in the Holy Scriptures that the Jews were threatened with eating their children if they did not obey their laws.

At fourteen miles we struck a large gum plain, but after a short time again entered the scrub.

Probably Tallmadge felt within himself that he was not destined to a great political career. In any case, he finally accepted the offer with perfect good humour, giving Weed a brief letter consenting to the use of his name as lieutenant-governor. With this the young journalist arrived at Utica on the morning of convention day. There were one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> delegates in the convention, of whom one-fourth belonged to the People's party. These supported Tallmadge for governor. When they discovered that Tallmadge's vote to remove Clinton had put him out of the race, they suggested John W.

This left the way open to DeWitt Clinton, and, as he carried off the nomination by a large...", "...out at the top! Now just at that moment Tommy happened to be leaning over for a right _good_ look down the hole. He received thirty pounds or so of agitated 'coon square in the chest. Thereupon he fell out of the tree incontinently, with the 'coon on top of him. We caught our breath in horror. Although we could plainly see that Tommy was in no degree injured by his short fall, yet we all realized that it was going to be serious to be mixed up with a raging, snarling beast fight of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> members. When the dachshunds should pounce on their natural prey, the medium-size game, poor Tommy would be at the bottom of the heap. Several even started forward to restrain the dogs, but stopped as they realized the impossibilities. Tommy and the 'coon hit with a thump.

She has already induced <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of these girls to enter the asylum at Sachsenhausen. The police authorities and city magistrates have given this same sister access to the women prisoners, which is a decided favor, coming from German officials.

Many deaconesses were called upon to go out as nurses in private families, and, in order to obtain room to accommodate the added number these services...", "...Cuellar. The gardens at Madrid, even, are in a sorry plight; its hothouses are almost empty. The grounds which were laid out at great expense by a wealthy and patriotic Spaniard at Orotava (Teneriffe), a spot whose climate has been of the greatest service to invalids, are rapidly going to decay. Every year a considerable sum is appropriated to it in the national budget, but scarcely a fraction of it ever reaches Orotava. When I was there in 1867, the gardener had received no salary for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> months, all the workmen were dismissed, and even the indispensable water supply had been cut off.

It was a calabash tree, otherwise called the monkey-bread tree, which the Woloffs call _goui_ in their language. Its height was nothing extraordinary, being but about sixty feet; but its trunk was of prodigious dimensions.

I believe there has never been any thing seen equal to it in any country; and, I am persuaded that, had our ancient travellers known it, they would not have failed to have included it among the wonders of the world. It is also very astonishing that this tree has been totally neglected by those who have given us the history of Senegal, especially as there are but few common to the country.

I would have traded the finest case of vintage wine in the Chimay vaults for another bowl. Just as the woman brought in the soup Mittendorfer appeared, escorting a French lieutenant who was taken prisoner this morning. The prisoner was a little, handsome, dapper chap not over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, wearing his trim blue-and-red uniform with an air, even though he himself looked thoroughly miserable. We were warned not to speak with him, or he with us; but Gerbeaux, after listening to him exchanging a few words with the lieutenant, said he judged from his accent that the little officer was from the south of France. We silently offered him a bowl of the soup as he sat in a corner fenced off from the rest of us by a small table; but he barely tasted it, and...", "...1202 was scarcely less magnificent. \"On the last day of Muharrem,\" says a writer of that period, \"stars shot hither and thither in the heavens, eastward and westward, and flew against one another like a scattering swarm of locusts, to the right and left; this phenomenon lasted until daybreak; people were thrown into consternation, and cried to God the Most High with confused clamor.\" The shower of 1366 is thus described in a Portuguese chronicle, quoted by Humboldt: \"In the year 1366, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> days of the month of October being past, three months before the death of the king, Don Pedro (of Portugal), there was in the heavens a movement of stars such as men never before saw or heard of.

But turned adrift in a world almost unexplored, he faced the task with his old-time bravery and dogged persistence, and at once showed the skill of a master mind in systematic work. The two new professorships in zooelogy were filled, one by Lamarck, previously known as a botanist, and the other by the young Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire, then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, who was at that time a student of Hauey, and in charge of the minerals, besides teaching mineralogy with especial reference to crystallography. To Geoffroy was assigned the four classes of vertebrates, but in reality he only occupied himself with the mammals and birds. Afterwards Lacepede[33] took charge of the reptiles and fishes. On the other hand, Lamarck's field comprised more than nine-tenths of the animal kingdom. Already the collections of insects,...", "...48), is very vague; but it is much easier to judge of the extent of Mohammedan countries than of the extent of their population. On this latter point we have the most conflicting statements.

Go right home, and mind you tell your mother you've been here.\" The forty-two cents, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of which were pennies, jingled and weighed heavily in Nancy's pocket. She was not happy going home. She had meditated going to the Indian encampment that night to buy the basket, but it looked so dark over the fields that she was afraid to; so she went straight home. Her mother had returned from the neighbor's; there she stood in the front door, watching for her. \"Nancy Mann, I want to know where you've been,\" she cried out, as soon as Nancy opened the gate. \"Over...", "...as he was saying good-by, that he'd only been playing a little, it all but broke my heart--what I thought was my heart.

All my talking did not prevent a surprise, for the second day after our departure the Indians made an attack on the herders, captured <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> horses in broad daylight and killed one of the herders. The same evening about sundown they made an attack on the command, and after a hard fight for an hour or more, the Indians retreated, leaving sixty dead Indians on the battlefield, there being eleven soldiers killed and twenty wounded.

There was no other man to choose. The liquor problem was more his to handle than the Premier's. Calder did not share the popular enthusiasm for Government-dispensed liquor.

PETERSBURG (with suburbs 1,267,000), the capital of Russia, is, like most European capitals, an important trade centre as well as the seat of government. Its manufactures are general and numerous, but the chief ones are those concerned in making munitions of war. Until 1885 St. Petersburg was not a seaport, but in that year a canal was built which now permits vessels drawing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet of water to enter its docks. Its harbour, however, is closed with ice from November to May. Near St. Petersburg is REVAL, the chief cotton port of Russia. The raw cotton importation of Russia averages about $60,000,000 annually, most of which comes direct from the United States. MOSCOW (988,000), the ancient capital of Russia, is also a great manufacturing city, but its principal importance is derived from the fact that it is the great centre of the internal trade of...", "...numbers, but was at last shot through the heart by a dragoon, and the Camisard chief lay dead upon the ground.

There was my friend Viedler; a man worth several millions. He had been warmly sympathetic in his expressions of regret at my misfortune. He and Mrs. Viedler had always shown a cordial fondness for us, which we reciprocated. The social intimacy had been close and always delightful. At first I thought I would ask him for the entire amount, then concluded to ask for five thousand...", "...a dishevelled young man, with wild eyes and a suitcase.

The young man stepped forward, with his fists clenched. \"Mine!\" he bellowed. \"Mine! Don't deny it. I recognize you. I saw you--the lot of you. I saw you drag her into a car and kidnap her. I saw that ass Culver and a policeman chasing you in another car. Oh, I know you, all right.

Accordingly the viceroy of India determines to send a fleet to drive out the Dutch from those seas; and (May 5, 1601) notifies Tello of this. On September 1, 1602, a council of war is held at Manila, which decides to furnish aid for this expedition against the Dutch; its commander has already captured and subjugated Amboyna. This is followed by a list of the supplies furnished to the Portuguese fleet; their value amounts to over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> thousand pesos, including eight months' pay for two hundred soldiers and a number of seamen. An official statement (dated October 2) enumerates the proceedings of the Manila authorities in raising these troops and supplies, and notifies the Portuguese envoys to be ready to convey this aid to the fleet.

A similar variation has been noted in the case of marginal land, marginal factories, marginal forges, and marginal agents of every kind. [Sidenote: \"What is a dollar?\"] The question was once asked in Parliament, \"What is a pound?\" and a good question to ask in beginning the study of money is, \"What is a dollar?\" The answer, so far as it refers to the standard money, is: a dollar is a convenient name applied to twenty-three and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> hundredths grains of fine gold or twenty-five and eight tenths grains of standard fineness. The exchange value of gold varies in different places and conditions, but the name remains the same. A dollar exchanges for more wheat in Dakota than in New York or for more iron in Pittsburg than in Oregon, yet it is sometimes asserted that the value is always the same because the name is always the same. The fallacy of this may be seen in the equivalent expression that twenty-three...", "...in Pittsfield just before the close of the last century, and with the exception of a brief residence in Boston, has passed her entire life there.

The result was a failure, and a removal to Boston with the idea of retrieving his fortunes in new scenes.

This affliction did not change, but perhaps intensified, the character of Mrs. Fenn.

Next day he rode right in among the Federal posts in rear, discovering that McClellan's right stretched little north of the Chickahominy, that it was not fortified, and that it did not rest on any strong natural feature, such as a swampy stream.

Three authorities affirm that in Norway the stripes are less plain in the foal than in the adult. Perhaps there is no fixed rule.

Edwards examined for me <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> foals of race-horses, and twelve had the spinal stripe more or less plain; this fact, and some other accounts which I have received, lead me to believe that the spinal stripe often disappears in the English race-horse when old.

Among the knights were Almaric St. Lawrence, ancestor of the Howth family, and Roger le Poer, apparently a collateral ancestor of the Powers and Eustaces. In the course of a year or two, though by no means always successful in battle, De Courcy made himself supreme in eastern Ulster.

The Referee. In one way the most important man on the field is the referee, as the success of the game depends a great deal on his ability to control the play and players adequately. He is commonly known as the \"Knight of the Whistle,\" and his responsibilities are manifold. To be a successful referee one must keep thoroughly fit, and be able to turn out on to the field in as good a condition as the player does, for he has got to go through more running than any of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> players, and must keep up with their pace. Like Caesar's wife, he should be above suspicion, and give his decisions without fear or favour. It is the weak referee that often spoils a game and brings football into disgrace. Refereeing in a first class match is much easier than taking the whistle in what we might call junior ones. In senior circles players know the game from \"A\" to \"Z,\" and play accordingly; but often a referee has to use more judgment than if he were...", "...have now been in Paris three years, and as yet I have seen no results.

General Badeau, in his history, also makes the same statement, on my authority. Out of justice to General McCook and his command, I must say that they left a point <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles east of Savannah on the morning of the 6th.

About twenty years since, the Owner took a Cyon, and grafted it upon a common Hedge Pear; but the Fruit does not prove altogether so good, and the Rind or Skin, is thicker than that of the Original.\" Thus, early in the history of Massachusetts, the pear was largely planted and became a prominent fruit. These early plantations grew so well that no doubt they inspired the horticulturists of the first half of the nineteenth century, of which...", "...in the platform, however, was given to the question of the public debt. Part of the bonds issued during the war had, by acts of Congress, been made payable in \"dollars,\" a word which might mean either paper dollars or gold dollars. Paper, however, was much less valuable than gold, times were hard, and many people held the opinion that the debt could properly be paid in paper. Such was the \"Ohio idea,\" which was made part of the Democratic platform. The choice of a candidate required <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> ballots. Early trials indicated the strength of George H. Pendleton, popularly known as \"Gentleman George\" and the chief exponent of the \"Ohio idea.\" Johnson also had support. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, having failed to obtain the Republican nomination, allowed it to be known that he was willing to become the Democratic candidate. At length, on the twenty-second ballot, a few votes were cast for Governor Horatio Seymour of New York, the chairman of the convention.

I had, in November, 1856, come from the common labor of a farm to a small city, to there complete a course of law reading, commenced years before and prosecuted at irregular intervals. After my removal to Springfield I finished a preparatory course, and January 12, 1858, when not yet <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age, I was admitted to practice law by the Supreme Court of Ohio, and settled in Springfield, where I had the good fortune to enjoy a satisfactory share of the clientage.

I got out my muskets, loaded them, and went to an enormous amount of labour and trouble--all because I had seen the print of a naked foot on the sand. There seemed to me then no labour too great, no task too toilsome, and I made me a second fortification, and planted a vast number of stakes on the outside of my outer wall, which grew and became a thick grove of trees, entirely concealing the place of my retreat, and adding greatly to my security. I had now been <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years on the island, and had grown so accustomed to the place that, had I felt myself secure from the attack by savages, I fancied I could have been contented to remain there till I died of old age.

About two years after I first knew these fears, I was surprised one morning by seeing five canoes on the shore. I could...", "...and was delighted to meet me again.

Sallust takes credit to himself, in words that Tacitus has almost adopted, [84] for a strict impartiality. Compared with his predecessors he probably _was_ impartial, and considering the closeness of the events to his own time it is doubtful whether any one could have been more so.

We did not touch the dead Indians but left them as a warning to others who might come that way. We next looked after the stock.

This process was effected by Sophocles. He was born at Colonus, near Athens, in 495, mixed with the best society in Periclean times, was a member of the important board of administrators who controlled the Delian League, the nucleus of the Athenian Empire, and composed over one hundred tragedies. In 468 he defeated Aeschylus, won the first prize <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> times and later had to face the more formidable opposition of the new and restless spirit whose chief spokesman was Euripides. For nearly forty years he was taken to be the typical dramatist of Athens, being nicknamed \"the Bee\"; his dramatic powers showed no abatement of vigour in old age, of which the _Oedipus Coloneus_ was the triumphant issue. He died in 405, full of years and honours. Providence has ordained it that his art, like his country's tutelary goddess Athena,...", "...terminating as such.

During gestation she was much frightened by a rat. The child was weak, the testes undescended, and it lived but eighteen days, dying of symptoms of atrophy. The parents were poor, of excellent character, and although, according to the evidence, this pregnancy lasted but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> weeks and two days, there was absolutely no reason to suspect infidelity.

Personal ambition, rather than treason to his country, must have been the motive influencing the latter; for when the Royalist general, Arredondo, marched with an overwhelming force against the patriots at San Antonio de Bexar, Alvarez boldly gave him battle. Guttierez, with noble patriotism, fought in the ranks of his late command and did not survive the defeat. His heroic devotion was imitated on the same spot by Barrett Travis, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years afterwards. The defeat and death of Guttierez occurred on March 15, 1814. Among the Americans who took service under Guttierez was Augustus W. Magee, of Massachusetts, who laid down his commission as a lieutenant in the United States army to join the filibusters. His fate was peculiar. After several successes he found himself, as he supposed, so beset by Governor Salcedo that he made terms for the surrender of himself and followers and their transportation to the...", "...that it was genuine he had no doubt, although he questioned whether written by Tasman, or transcribed at his command.

No sooner was the word spoken, than the wretch fell dead before them, and the name of God and of Columba was greatly magnified through all the neighbouring country. We have already spoken of the great College of Clonard founded by St. Finnian, who is quite distinct from his namesake of Moville. We have seen that Columba was there, and was recognised as one of the Twelve Apostles of Erin, who were trained up together at that great seminary in all sacred learning. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age at this period, for he was not yet ordained a priest, so that we may fix the period of his sojourn at Clonard about the year A.D. 543. The immediate purpose of Columba's studies at Clonard was to prepare himself for the priesthood. There he was trained by the most celebrated master of Erin in all the virtue and learning necessary for that holy state. He built his little cell close to the church, and when he was not engaged in study, or attending his lectures, he...", "...way.

After breaking their battalions, Guise, over eager in pursuit, and already twice wounded, had his horse killed under him, was surrounded, overmatched, and left for dead, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> wounds.

But it is fair to say that in a majority of cases these indictments were found by men in sympathy with me, and whose chief object in having me arrested was to punish the men who sold me liquor. Another mistake! It is next to impossible to get a drunkard to tell where he got his liquor. Half the time he himself does not know where he got it. I never indicted a saloon keeper in my life.

In the year 1551 the city of Kazan, upon the River Kazanka, a tributary of the Volga, was the last city that remained in the hands of the Tatars. It was a rich and powerful place, a great centre of trade between Europe and the East, but it was also a nest of robbers, who had frequently broken faith with the Russians, and had lately expelled the Khan Schig Alei for having endeavored to fulfill his engagements to them. The Tzar Ivan Vassilovitch, then only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age, therefore marched against the place, resolved at any cost to reduce it and free his country from these inveterate foes. On his way he received tidings that the Crimean Tatars had come plundering into Russia, probably thinking to attack Moscow, while Ivan was besieging Kazan. He at once sent off the Prince Kourbsky with 15,000 men, who met double that number of Tatars at Toula, and totally defeated them, pursuing them to the River Chevorona, where, after a...", "...WALK DEM GOLD STREETS_ \"De years are mighty long widout Lottie, Massa.

It was expected that they would be joined there by a reinforcement from Brest, and by the Dutch squadron in the Texel, making a total of about fifty of the line, under the command of the Spanish Admiral, Don Luis de Cordova. The Dutch did not appear, owing probably to Howe's demonstration before their ports; but eight ships from Brest raised the allied fleet to forty. To oppose these Howe sailed on the 2d of July with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> sail, of which eight were three-deckers. Before his return, in the 7th of August, he was joined by eight others; mostly, however, sixty-fours. With this inferiority of numbers the British Admiral could expect only to act on the defensive, unless some specially favourable opportunity should offer.

Cox, who, in a few short months after, was called to his eternal reward. His dying language was, \"Though a thousand fall, Africa must not be given up.\" Five other missionaries have fallen in the same field. The Liberia mission now includes an annual conference of seventeen preachers, all colored, except the superintendent...", "...Madison, Louisiana, there is a raised way three feet high, seventy-five feet wide, and two thousand seven hundred feet long, with broad excavations three feet in depth extending on both sides for about two thirds its length. Two parallel banks at Piketon, Ohio, are shown in the cut. They are ten hundred and eighty feet long, two hundred and three feet apart at one end, and two hundred and fifteen at the other; the height on the outside being from five to eleven feet, but on the inside <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> feet at one end. A modern carriage road now runs between the mounds. From the end of one of them a slight embankment extends twenty-five hundred and eighty feet to a group of mounds.

Without doubt with increasing population there will come some increase in the use of what are now non-agricultural lands for the practice of agriculture, but with three hundred years of agricultural history back of us in this state it does not seem likely that there will be much change in the relation of non-agricultural to agricultural land during the next half-century. Out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> millions of acres of farm lands in the state but fifteen millions are actually under cultivation, leaving, therefore, from six to eight millions of acres within the farms of the state but lying idle.

He wanted the work done, and used his tongue pretty freely; still he was a man who would speak the truth, and treated his men as well as he dared to do under the brutal regime ruling in Chatham.

Melito, for example, who wrote not long after the middle of the second century, bears this testimony. Capitolinus, an author who flourished about the close of the third century, reports that Antoninus Pius lived \"without bloodshed, either of citizen or foe,\" during his reign of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years. [45:2] Dr. Lightfoot strives again and again to evade the force of this evidence, and absurdly quotes the sufferings of Polycarp and his companions as furnishing a contradiction; but he thus only takes for granted what he has elsewhere failed to prove. He admits, at the same time, that this case stands alone. \"_The only recorded martyrdoms_,\" says he, \"in Proconsular Asia during his reign [that of Antoninus Pius] are those of Polycarp and his companions.\" [45:3] It...", "...honorable relation and most advantageous to the younger man.

The following are the particulars:--Seventeen hit the first target direct, and burst behind it, the fragments penetrating the second one; three grazed and burst immediately in front of the first target, and perforated both with the pieces; one hit the bottom of the first target and exploded in the ground, and the remaining one missed entirely and burst on some rocks nearly on line beyond....", "...her, and that she died, in 1886, at Roundfield Place, not the house to which Wilkinson came, whither we removed in 1897. Other similar things were said, about other deceased relatives, all true. In this kind of thing it is our duty to stick to known causes before admitting unknown, and my first supposition was that Wilkinson had primed himself with information. He could have ascertained most of the things by local inquiry, though it would not be very easy, for my mother had been dead <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years, and only middle-aged or elderly people would remember her. Further interviews with him, however, soon carried me beyond the fraud theory--for holding which I now apologise to him, feeling considerably ashamed--for he gave me messages from many people whose association with me I feel sure he did not know, and also some family matter of a very private kind, characteristic of the spirit who purported to be communicating, but known to only four living people.

This final lesion of madness, this irremediable darkness of the mind, was evidently not so complete but that some memory of the past, lying hidden there, might awaken suddenly under the terrible blow which had struck her.

His effort, no doubt, was in a way easier than that made by Mr. Taynton, for to be <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old and in love should be occupation sufficient. But he, too, had his bad hours, when the past rose phantom-like about him, and he recalled that evening when his rage had driven him nearly mad with passion against his traducer.

This evangelist, begun when Donatello was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> and completed before his thirtieth year, challenges comparison with one worthy rival, the Moses of Michael Angelo. The Moses was the outcome of many years of intermittent labour, and was created by the help of all the advances made by sculpture during a century of progress. Yet in one respect only can Michael Angelo claim supremacy. Hitherto Donatello had made nothing but standing figures.

Thus began that struggle which seemed interminable at the time, and which actually lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years. As usual the West Indies suffered, but this time they were not quite so much the scene of contention as they had been formerly. Tobago was captured from the French on the 15th of April, but during the remainder of the year little was done. In January, 1794, however, Admiral Sir John Jervis arrived at Barbados, and in the following month took Martinique after a severe struggle. Then he went on to St. Lucia, which also surrendered, and before the end of April Guadeloupe...", "...somewhat after the interval may be attributed to the disinclination of the Riptonians to exert themselves unduly. They ceased playing in the stern and scientific spirit in which they had started; and, instead of adhering to an orthodox game, began to enjoy themselves.

They tried to drop goals. In this way only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> points were scored after half-time. Allardyce and Drummond battled on nobly, but with their pack hopelessly outclassed it was impossible for them to do anything of material use. Barry, on the wing, tackled his man whenever the latter got the ball, but, as a rule, the centres did not pass, but attacked by themselves. At last, by way of a fitting conclusion to the rout, the Ripton back, catching a high punt, ran instead of kicking, and, to the huge delight of the town...", "...his city from being set on fire by burning arrows.

The ship of war, which had arrived before him, was beached close up by a gate of the city, which opened on the creek or port, and her crew were busily engaged discharging her stores.

At fifty, Mr. Plantat, whose career had been one of unbroken prosperity, lost in the same month, his wife, whom he adored, and his two sons, charming youths, one eighteen, the other <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old. These successive losses crushed a man whom thirty years of happiness left without defence against misfortune. For a long time his reason was despaired of. Even the sight of a client, coming to trouble his grief, to recount stupid tales of self-interest, exasperated him.

He then breakfasted with the other priests in the house, and set out soon after to call on people whose opinion was necessary, returning for a cup of tea soon after sixteen o'clock. Then he settled down, after the rest of his office and a visit to the Blessed Sacrament, to compose his letter, which though short, needed a great deal of care and sifting. After dinner he made a few notes for next day, received visitors again, and went to bed soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> o'clock. Twice a week it was his business to assist at Vespers in the afternoon, and he usually sang high mass on Saturdays. It was, therefore, a curiously distracting life, with peculiar dangers.

Louis Napoleon was then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age. An insurrection in Paris overthrew the old Bourbon dynasty, and established its modification in the throne of Louis Philippe. This revolution in France threw all Europe into commotion. All over Italy the people rose to cast off the yoke which the Allies, who had triumphed at Waterloo, had imposed upon them. The exiled members of the Bonaparte family met at Rome to decide what to do in the emergency. Hortense attended the meeting with her two sons. The eldest,...", "...was not long before the appropriate criminal arrived. The scene of the first appearance was the suburb of Tottenham, where two Russian Poles attempted, and failed in, an idiotic street robbery. The attempt was made in broad daylight in the open street, and the two wretches, having failed, ran away, shooting at every human being they met. In the end they were both killed--one by his own hand--but not until they had murdered a gallant constable and a poor little child and injured in all, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> persons. \"I read the newspaper account with deep interest and the conviction that this was only a beginning.

His nature is peculiar in the fact that the organs of the brain which deal with property values, and the ability to make a living by ordinary transactions, are almost entirely idiotic.

Nothing saved them but their admirable construction, which combined the greatest strength with moderate weight; those built to carry the heaviest loads seldom exceeding a ton or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> hundredweight, and the perch being short was favourable to draught. For a great many years they were nearly all perch coaches, as it was pretty well the universal opinion that under-spring coaches were not so steady or well calculated for heavy loads and high speed. This opinion, however, was in later years considerably modified, and most coachmen that I was acquainted with had arrived at a conclusion favourable to the under-spring build. I can say this for them, that the...", "...of the Abbeys, or from one or other of the branch establishments through the West, in which Mr. Abbey holds an interest, it would be manifestly out of place to omit, in a work of this character, a reference to him and his operations.

Her master was Mr. James Bowen, so highly distinguished in the battle of the 1st of June, when he was master of the fleet, and who afterwards became a retired commissioner, and rear admiral. On the 1st of July, the _Artois_ fell in with a French frigate-built ship, the _Prince of Robego_, of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> guns, and 180 men; and after a four hours' pursuit, and a running fight of half an hour with the chase guns, ran alongside, and took her. Captain Pellew gladly availed himself of this opportunity to show his grateful respect to the memory of his benefactor, Captain Pownoll, by giving the agency to his brother-in-law, Mr. Justice, one of the officers of Plymouth-yard: and the plea of gratitude which he offered to his own brother, was felt to be quite conclusive.

Because too much success dazzles nations as well as kings. When the Romans began to think that nothing could resist them in the future because nothing had resisted them in the past, they believed that all was permitted them.

Schnetz gave him their names. Most of them had passed their first youth. Only one boyish face, of a foreign cast, gazed dreamily with big, black eyes into the cloud of smoke that circled up from his cigarette. It was, Schnetz told his neighbor, that of a young Greek painter, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, who was, in spite of his delicate, almost girl-like appearance, a dangerous lady-killer. He was not really intimately acquainted with any of them, and only Rossel's intercession in his favor and his talent, which was by no means slight, had procured him the entrance into this circle. A little, bent old man, with delicate features and snow-white hair, was the last to enter. He hung his hat and cloak on a nail, and took his seat in the only unoccupied chair at the...", "...the department was overstocked with younger, liver men. \"I'm mighty sorry, and I wish you good luck,\" he said, with flash of the real man under the smooth, steely exterior.

Being quite human, Father felt a scornful envy of her for a minute, when she repeated all the pleasant things that had been said to her. But she was so frank, so touchingly happy, that he could not long harden his heart. When he told her of his ill-fortune she put her hand to her breast and looked desperately afraid.

IX SPECIAL SEX-INSTRUCTION FOR MATURING YOUNG WOMEN [Sidenote: Parents would limit knowledge of daughters.] It was my original plan to make this lecture parallel with the preceding one for young men, but much discussion with parents and with scientifically trained women whose suggestions and criticisms I value has shown me that there is no consensus of opinion as to what should be taught to young women between eighteen and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age. I have found many fathers and mothers who think that their boys of fourteen or fifteen should be informed as suggested in the preceding lecture; but concerning some of the facts for boys these same parents were doubtful whether their daughters ought to know before twenty, and some of them have said twenty-five and even thirty. Some of them have said that they see no reason why an unmarried young woman of the protected group should know much more than a very...", "...F. B. Schell, E. P. Garret and Granville Perkins.

One day's pleasant sailing was quite as much in that way as experience taught them to expect. A violent storm arose, the waves ran high, and their clumsy boat, trembling under the strain, was in danger of sinking at any moment. The safety of the whole company depended entirely upon the skill and nerve of M'Gary. For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> successive hours he held in his strong grasp the steering oar and kept the head of the boat to the sea. A break of the oar or a slip from his hand and all was lost! They finally grappled an old floe in a slightly sheltered place, and rode out the storm. For twelve days heroic exertions were made to get the boat through the pack which now beset them, with the view of working south and west.

All the time he had been in the room with her in that house in the swamp, he had felt that he ought to remember where he had seen those eyes before. Now, he counted the years that had passed since he saw her, and, to his astonishment, they were five. \"She was seventeen then, the chief told me,\" he thought, \"that would make her <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> by now.\" And then it came back to him how strangely she had looked at him while he was leaving her presence, and he wondered if her recollection for faces was as good or even better than his own. \"But,\" he argued, \"it could not be possible that she would remember me from that one short glance she must have had of me at that time.

The Angular Epeira, settled high up in the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or nine feet. There is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows the Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent business, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut. In fact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming. But is that all? No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means of rapid transit...", "...* * * * * At the meager distance of 384,000 kilometers (238,000 miles) that separates us from it (about thirty times the diameter of the Earth), the Moon is a suburb of our terrestrial habitation.

She then, at the age of fifteen, opened a school for girls in Dunbarton Street, in Georgetown, and gave herself to the work, which she loved, with the greatest assiduity, and with uniform success. In 1827, when she was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years of age, her remarkable beauty and elevation of character so much impressed Father Vanlomen, the good priest, that he took it in hand to give her a higher style of school in which to work for her sex and race, to the education of which she had now fully consecrated herself.

Defeated on June 4, he fled once more to the hills, but in the beginning of July was facing his foes again at the head of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> thousand men.

He marched upon...", "...This was the first voyage that Americo made with Hojeda. It is, therefore, clear that neither Hojeda nor Americo can have left Cadiz in 1497, but they must have sailed in 1499. That this was the first voyage made by Hojeda and Americo in search of the mainland appears from two reasons which have already been mentioned as being given by Americo himself in his first _Navigation_. One is, that they arrived at a land called by the natives Paria, and the other that the Indians wounded <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> men and killed one in a certain island. This latter fact was told to Francisco Roldan by Hojeda's people when the same Roldan went on board the ships of Hojeda. The Admiral sent him as soon as he was informed that Hojeda had reached the land of Brasil.[148] Francisco Roldan wrote to the Admiral from thence these, among other words which I saw in the handwriting of Francisco Roldan, his handwriting being well known to me.

The reader may ask what we mean by a deist here. A deist or theist in Franklin's time was one who believed in a God, but questioned the Christian faith and system. He was not an atheist.

[v.04 p.0995] The common solar year containing 365 days, and the lunar year only 354 days, the difference is eleven; whence, if a new moon fall on the 1st of January in any year, the moon will be eleven days old on the first day of the following year, and twenty-two days on the first of the third year. The numbers eleven and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> are therefore the epacts of those years respectively. Another addition of eleven gives thirty-three for the epact of the fourth year; but in consequence of the insertion of the intercalary month in each third year of the lunar cycle, this epact is reduced to three. In like manner the epacts of all the following years of the cycle are obtained by successively adding eleven to the epact of the former year, and rejecting thirty as often as the sum exceeds that number. They are...", "...astounding piece of news, an exclamation of amazement broke from the minister's lips; but immediately his teeth were set hard as his eye dived down the column, lapping up the words of the story by sentences and almost by paragraphs. Miss Dounay, it appeared, had gone to the office of District Attorney Miller at three o'clock that afternoon by appointment, and had there sworn to a complaint, charging him, the Reverend John Hampstead, with the theft of her diamond necklace, valued at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> thousand dollars. There were a few lines of an interview with District Attorney Miller, in which that official stated that at first he had not regarded Miss Dounay's charges seriously, but that the actress was so emphatic in her demand for the warrant of arrest that he had not felt himself justified in refusing it. At the same time, the District Attorney expressed his personal belief in the innocence of the minister. An attempt to serve the warrant immediately, the story...", "...feelings would prevent his seeing a number of things which do not concern his passions. He would not describe, while sharpening his horns for the fight, the little field-flowers, which he could not notice, nor the village cure's wig, which does not concern him at all; but this small and numerous school of self-styled realists has, in my opinion, so little keen feeling and true passion that it is like the mathematician who wrote from his mother's deathbed, 'I lost my mother this day at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> and one-half minutes after eight [mean time].' The passions are not so accurate, and do not see so many things.\" Here is an extract from a letter written in the perturbed days of 1848: \"In the country, whence I write, there is no news. The vervain, the heliotropes, are in flower, as they are every year, and the squirrels run up and down the trees without asking what is going on in Paris. Not one has subscribed to the most insignificant newspaper. By the way, do you...", "...to the governor, as he has no other free person whatever to overlook any piece of work carrying on by the convicts. Near to this farm-house, there is a very good barn and a granary. The convicts houses form a line at some distance, in front of the barracks, with very good gardens before and behind each house: indeed, the whole, joined to the pleasantness of the situation, makes it a beautiful landscape. In 1789, the quantity of ground sown with wheat here, and at Sydney-Cove, was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> acres; with barley, seventeen acres; flax, Indian corn, and beans, three acres. The quantity of wheat raised was two hundred bushels; of barley, sixty bushels; flax, beans, and other seeds, ten bushels: the wheat is a fine full grain. This year (1790) near one hundred acres will be cleared at Rose-Hill, of which forty are to be sown with wheat. After dinner, I accompanied the governor from Rose-Hill to Prospect-Hill, which is about four miles distant: we walked through a...", "...of which I was capable, I should have almost forgotten how to use the pen. It was in circumstances such as I have described that I began my first book, but it was not a story-book, and I had no idea that it would ever become a printed book at all. It was merely a free-and-easy record of personal adventure and every-day life, written, like all else that I penned, solely for the uncritical eye of that long-suffering and too indulgent mother! I had reached the advanced age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> at the time, and had been sent to take charge of an outpost, on the uninhabited northern shores of the gulf of Saint Lawrence, named Seven Islands. It was a dreary, desolate, little-known spot, at that time. The gulf, just opposite the establishment, was about fifty miles broad. The ships which passed up and down it were invisible, not only on account of distance, but because of seven islands at the mouth of the bay coming between them and the outpost. My next neighbour,...", "...cease till the fleets on both sides were disabled; and then they lay-to for some time repairing damages, and apparently with the intention of renewing the struggle. As soon as Zouttman's ships were made manageable, however, he wore round, and with all the sail he could carry, bore away for the Texel. Parker could not pursue him with any hope of overtaking him; but on the next day his frigates discovered the Hollandia, a sixty-eight gun-ship, which had been ruined in the battle, sunk in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> fathoms of water; and it is said that most of the crew were in her when she went down. By this victory the voyage of the Dutch to the Baltic was abandoned; their means of procuring naval stores were cut off; and their valuable carrying-trade was, for this year at least, annihilated. On his arrival at the Nore, Parker was visited by the King and the Prince of Wales; and every captain that had been engaged in the action, and had escaped death, was presented to his majesty on...", "...above the bottom of the valley on which the crater now stands. At that time an explosive volcanic eruption occurred on the bottom of the lake, and the rim of the crater, built up by this explosion, was gradually pushed above the surface of the lake, so as to shut out its waters. Extinct volcanic craters, not unlike those of Utah, occur also near Ragtown, in Nevada, in a district known as the Carson Valley Desert, in one of the broadest areas of what was once Lake Lahontan. Ragtown is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> miles southwest of Wadsworth on the Central Pacific Railroad. At the present time there are two circular depressions or volcanic craters filled with pools of strongly alkaline water known as the Ragtown Pond, or Soda Lake. The large lake covers an area of 268-1/2 acres. Its greatest diameter is over 4,000 feet. Without going into a detailed description it will suffice to say that the larger crater probably was destroyed by an explosive volcanic eruption. Another intensely...", "...pockets of his very shabby overcoat, and continued to regard the editor with his singularly boyish, dimpling smile. With one swift glance Maxwell took him in, from the broken boot on the foot he was gently swinging to and fro to the thick, curly locks on his handsome head. He had a complexion like a girl's, a dimple in each cheek, and a jaw like a bull-dog's. He was all of six feet tall, and his badly made clothes could not wholly conceal the perfect lines of his figure. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old, Maxwell decided, and, notwithstanding his dimples, his complexion, his youth, and his smile, he conveyed a vivid impression of masculinity and strength. He was wholly self-possessed, and his manner suggested that the business which had brought him where he was was of such urgent value and importance that the busy world itself might well hush its noisy activities long enough to hear of it. To his own great surprise, Maxwell waited until his caller was prepared to...", "...that he should feel a censure from that House as the heaviest misfortune of a long life, checkered as it had been by many vicissitudes. When Mr. Adams began his defense, not only was a large majority of the House opposed to his course, but they had brought themselves by a series of violent harangues into a condition of bitter excitement against him. When he ended, the effect of this extraordinary speech was such, that all the resolutions were rejected, and out of the whole House only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> members could be found to pass a vote of even indirect censure. The victory was won, and won by Mr. Adams almost single-handed. We count Horatius Cocles a hero for holding the Roman bridge against a host of enemies; but greater honors belong to him who successfully defends against overwhelming numbers the ancient safeguards of public liberty. For this reason we have repeated here at such length the story of three days, which the people of the United States ought always to...", "...against the Mannai. The place assigned to it in the Bab. Chron. quite in the beginning of the reign, is confirmed by a fragment of a tablet quoted by Winckler. Perhaps it was carried out by a Babylonian army: although Assur-bani-pal claimed the glory of it, by reason of his suzerainty over Karduniash. Meanwhile, the army which Esarhaddon had been leading against Taharqa pursued its course under command of the Tartan.* Syria received it submissively, and the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> kings who still possessed a shadow of autonomy in the country sent assurances of their devotion to the new monarch: even Yakinlu, King of Arvad, who had aroused suspicion by frequent acts of insubordination,** thought twice before rebelling against his terrible suzerain, and joined the rest in paying both homage and tribute. Cyprus and also Phoenicia remained faithful to their allegiance, and, what was of still more consequence, the states which lay nearest to...", "...of the case were related to Sir Adrian Fairfax, that kind General might mitigate the sentence. The missionary had drawn the young deserter's history from him, and every word he spoke increased the good man's interest, and made him long to rescue the youth from an ignominious death. Even the eyes of the president of the court-martial, Colonel Graham, were observed to fill with tears when the question was asked of the prisoner-- \"How old are you?\" And Gray replied, \"I am <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> to-day.\" His air was so different to the reckless, daring manner of men hardened in crime, and every one felt the force of the words he uttered in his defence. \"I acknowledge my crimes,\" he said; \"but I have been very unfortunate.\" His open countenance when his eyes were raised, for shame and sorrow usually weighed them down; his slight boyish frame, attenuated by illness; his air of deep humility--humility without fear--for every question was answered unhesitatingly...", "...friend tried to brighten him up a bit by feigning to take deep interest in a subject that to him was absolutely the driest in the world. \"Meer and Baedler--I mean Beer and Maedler,\" he went on, \"must have measured at least forty or fifty mountains to their satisfaction.\" \"Forty or fifty!\" exclaimed Barbican. \"They measured no fewer than a thousand and ninety-five lunar mountains and crater summits with a perfect success. Six of these reach an altitude of upwards of 18,000 feet, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> are more than 15,000 feet high.\" \"Which is the highest in the lot?\" asked Ardan, keenly relishing Barbican's earnestness. \"_Doerfel_ in the southern hemisphere, the peak of which I have just pointed out, is the highest of the lunar mountains so far measured,\" replied Barbican. \"It is nearly 25,000 feet high.\" \"Indeed! Five thousand feet lower than Mount Everest--still for a lunar mountain, it is quite a respectable altitude.\" \"Respectable! Why it's an enormous...", "...be forced down our throats in violation of the fundamental principle of free government, under a mode of submission that is a mockery and insult, I will resist it to the last.\" Walker, the fourth Democratic governor who had now been sacrificed to the interests of the Kansas pro-slavery cabal, also wrote a sharp letter of resignation denouncing the Lecompton fraud and policy; and such was the indignation aroused in the free States, that although the Senate passed the Lecompton Bill, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> Northern Democrats joining their vote to that of the Republicans, the measure was defeated in the House of Representatives. The President and his Southern partizans bitterly resented this defeat; and the schism between them, on the one hand, and Douglas and his adherents, on the other, became permanent and irreconcilable.

According to Randolph's letter, dated 7th July 1562, there were eighty-three persons apprehended at Hawick, \"of the which twenty were acquitted by the assize; the rest condemned; of the which <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> were presently drowned there, for lack of trees and halters; six hanged at Edinburgh, yesterday being Monday,\" &c.

But I begin to find that the climate is playing old hack with me, and the sooner I have a change the better. Although I have kept to my post throughout, I have continued for many summers to send my best half up to the hills with ladies, or at my own expense. Remember, dear mother, I have served the State for upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years. I have more than completed my portion of the contract, and have tried to do my duty on many a hard-fought field, both in the Crimea and out here; and if spared a few months more, we will see what the Government will give me. They must give me the pension of my rank, viz., the large sum of 2s. 6d. per diem. I see by the papers there is some talk of increasing the rate of pensions for all ranks. I hope to be home some...", "...\"On this point,\" he insisted, \"there can be no concession or compromise.\"[3.14] [AMERICAN GRIEVANCES] Here our point of view must be shifted. So far we have mainly been concerned with complaints on the part of Mexico, and it will be admitted that in those affairs the United States did not materially injure her in any unlawful way, and exhibited no malicious intentions. We must now take up certain American grievances; and first in order may be mentioned the summary execution of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> of our citizens in 1835. Under the revolutionist Mejia they had left the United States for Texas, but they were conducted to Tampico and there were captured. The minister of relations asserted that they were duly tried, and simply experienced the rigor of the law; but our minister ascertained that no trial took place. In spite of international law and treaty stipulations the government ordered them shot, and shot they were--officially murdered. At the edge of the grave...", "...as in a mirror. It was delightful to watch these splendid birds, old and young swimming together in the peaceful enjoyment of life, seeking their food, and pursuing one another playfully in the water. I could not think of breaking in upon their happy beautiful existence by firing among them, but our dog Juno was by no means so considerate; for all at once I heard a plunge, and saw her drag out of the water a most peculiar-looking creature, something like a small otter, but not above <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> inches in length, which she would have torn to pieces, had we not hurried up and taken it from her. This curious little animal was of a soft dark brown colour, the fur being of a lighter shade under the belly; its feet were furnished with large claws, and also completely webbed, the head small, with deeply set eyes and ears, and terminating in a broad flat bill like that of a duck. This singularity seemed to us so droll that we both laughed heartily, feeling at the same...", "...good prints. One of them is a library, and another a gallery. He has several canary-birds disposed in a pretty manner in breeding-cages. in his garden was a bed of good tulips in bloom, flowers and fruit-trees, and all neatly kept. They are permitted at certain hours to talk to strangers, but never to one another, or to go out of their convent. But what we chiefly went to see was the small cloister, with the history of St. Bruno their founder, painted by Le Sceur. It consists of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> pictures, the figures a good deal less than life. But sure they are amazing! I don't know what Raphael may be in Rome, but these pictures excel all I have seen in Paris and England. The figure of the dead man who spoke at his burial, contains all the strongest and horridest ideas of ghastliness, hypocrisy discovered, and the height of damnation, pain and cursing. A Benedictine monk, who was there at the same time, said to me of this picture C'est une fable, mais on la...", "...regiment of the line (Cameronians), whose pay was a shilling a day and a penny for beer, saved over four thousand pounds. Two hundred and fifty men of the first battalion, or one-third of the corps, were depositors in the savings bank, and their savings amounted to about seventeen pounds per man. But this is not all. Private soldiers, out of their small earnings, are accustomed to remit considerable sums through the post office, to their poor relations at home. In one year, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> thousand pounds were thus sent from Aldershot,--the average amount of each money order being twenty-one shillings and fourpence. And if men with seven shillings and seven-pence a week can do so much, what might not skilled workmen do, whose earnings amount to from two to three pounds a week? Soldiers serving abroad during arduous campaigns have proved themselves to be equally thoughtful and provident. During the war in the Crimea, the soldiers and seamen sent home through...", "...piano lessons in his magazine, and Madame Marchesi a series of vocal lessons. The Journal introduced its readers to all the great instrumental and vocal artists of the day through articles; it offered prizes for the best piano and vocal compositions; it had the leading critics of New York, Boston, and Chicago write articles explanatory of orchestral music and how to listen to music. Bok was early attracted by the abilities of Josef Hofmann. In 1898, he met the pianist, who was then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years old. Of his musical ability Bok could not judge, but he was much impressed by his unusual mentality, and soon both learned and felt that Hofmann's art was deeply and firmly rooted. Hofmann had a wider knowledge of affairs than other musicians whom Bok had met; he had not narrowed his interests to his own art. He was striving to achieve a position in his art, and, finding that he had literary ability, Bok asked him to write a reminiscent article on his famous master,...", "...while,\" whispered Diana. And when Frank stamped into the room, Enoch was standing alone, his great head bowed in the firelight. \"Can't you stall 'em off a little while?\" demanded Frank. Enoch shook his head with a smile. \"I've played truant too long to dictate now. Jonas and I must pull out to-night. Perhaps it's best, after all, Frank, and yet, it seemed for a moment as if it were physically impossible for me to give up that trip down Bright Angel. I've dreamed of it for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-two</span> years. And to go down with Diana and you--\" \"It's life!\" said Frank briefly. He sank into an armchair and neither man spoke until Na-che announced supper. Diana appeared then, her cheeks and eyes bright and her voice steady. Enoch never had seen her in a more whimsical mood and the meal, which he had dreaded, passed off quickly and pleasantly. Not long after dinner, Frank announced the buck-board ready for the drive to the station. He slammed the door after this..."]
