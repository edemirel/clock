The date of the _Brut_ is 1155, of the _Rou_ 1160. This latter is the better of the two, though Wace was not a great poet. It consists chiefly of octosyllabics, with a curious insertion of Alexandrines in rhymed not assonanced _laisses_.

Fabre insists on this fact, and rightly, for nothing should be neglected; he makes it a text to show how automatic instinct is, and how the acts which proceed from it are invariably regulated so as to succeed one another always in the same order.

Among the Celts this was unknown, with them a church took its name after its founder, and the founder of a church dedicated it by a partial fast of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days, and prayer and vigil on the spot. The early basilicas of Rome also took their titles from the families that surrendered their halls for Christian worship.

I shall, in the course of this book, enter upon the value of these attacks. Meanwhile I can only say how regrettable this obstinacy appears to me and will appear to every free spirit.

It was too late to prevent the mission of Ybarra, who, immediately after his arrival in Brussels, began to urge in the king's name that the words in which the provinces had been declared free by the archdukes might be expunged. What could be more childish than such diplomacy? What greater proof could be given of the incapacity of the Spanish court to learn the lesson which <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years had been teaching? Spinola again wrote a most earnest remonstrance to the king, assuring him that this was simply to break off the negotiation. It was ridiculous to suppose, he said, that concessions already made by the archdukes, ratification of which on the part of the king had been guaranteed, could now be annulled. Those acquainted with Netherland obstinacy knew better. The very possibility of the king's refusal excited the scorn of the States-General. Ybarra went...", "...the nave, tribunes had been erected for the choristers of the Sixtine Chapel, the Corps Diplomatique, the Knights of Malta, the Roman nobility, and other guests of various kinds. And, finally, in the centre, before the altar, there were three rows of benches covered with red rugs, the first for the cardinals and the other two for the bishops and the prelates of the pontifical court. All the rest of the congregation was to remain standing. Ah! that huge concert-audience, those thirty, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand believers from here, there, and everywhere, inflamed with curiosity, passion, or faith, bestirring themselves, jostling one another, rising on tip-toe to see the better!

What he saw in the Daney pew, however, chilled his fury and threw him into a veritable panic of embarrassment. For to the right of the incomprehensible general manager sat the young ex-laird of Port Agnew; at Daney's left the old Laird beheld his new daughter-in-law, while further down the pew as far as she could retreat, Mrs. Daney, with face aflame, sat rigid, her bovine countenance upraised and her somewhat vacuous glance fixed unblinkingly at a point some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet over Mr. Tingley's pious head. Donald intercepted the old man's amazed and troubled glance, and smiled at his father with his eyes--an affectionate overture that was not lost on The Laird ere he jerked his head and eyes once more to the front. Mrs. McKaye and her two daughters were as yet unaware of the horror that impended. But not for long. When the congregation stood to sing the final hymn, Nan's wondrous mezzo-soprano rose clear and sweet over the indifferent-toned...", "...have all here safe and dry. In a couple of hours we arrived in the kampong Batokelau (turtle), and below are other rapids which, though long, are less of an obstacle. A beautiful mountain ridge, about 1,200 metres high, through which the river takes its course, appears toward the southeast. The population includes fifty \"doors\" of Busangs, forty \"doors\" of Malays, and twenty of Long-Glats. Crocodiles are known to exist here, but do not pass the rapids above.

On the 22d, the rain abated and the weather began to clear up, but the wind continued steadily blowing from the east, which kept us in the same spot. Nothing interrupted the uniformity of our mode of living, which we beguiled by reading the newspapers that we received from the city, and looking at vessels coming from England, running into port before the wind. One of these vessels had one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> Irish emigrants on board. The James Cropper, a ship belonging to the line, had sailed on the 16th ultimo from Liverpool. Two days previous, the Silas Richards, another of the same line, had also arrived, which left Liverpool on the 24th ult. In one of the New York papers, we found a letter from the master of this vessel, in which he stated, that he had seen the celebrated sea serpent, not far from the American coast. During the 23d of June, we still remained becalmed; the...", "...of the country. The efforts of the Jesuit missionaries were crowned with remarkable success. All ranks and classes, from priest to peasant, embraced the Catholic faith. Churches, schools, convents, and monasteries sprang up all over the country. The only opposition came from the Bonzes, or native priests, who felt their influence and power declining. They appealed to the Emperor to banish the Roman Catholic priests, but the imperial edict simply was, \"Leave the strangers in peace.\" For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years or thereabouts Catholicism not only flourished but was triumphant. Indeed, a Japanese mission of three princes was despatched to Pope Gregory XIII. laden with valuable presents. The arrival of this mission was acclaimed as a veritable triumph throughout Catholic Europe. By a stroke of irony its advent there was almost contemporaneous with not only the overthrow but the almost total extinction of Christianity in Japan. The edict for the banishment of the missionaries was...", "...that God exacts a temporary punishment for sin, after the guilt and eternal punishment are remitted, appears from the testimony of His Sacred Word. St. Paul teaches that the death of the body is a punishment which the sin of our first parent entailed on his progeny; and yet many who have been regenerated by baptism from that original guilt, nevertheless die before they have committed any actual sin whatever. The children of Israel had to leave their bones in the wilderness, after the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years' sojournment, as a punishment, inflicted by the Almighty Himself, for sins which He had expressly forgiven them. Num. xiv. 20, 22. David was forgiven his sin--and yet he was punished for it, by the death of his child, whom he loved most tenderly. He sinned by numbering his people; and although it was forgiven him, he had still to choose his punishment--either war, famine, or pestilence.

Never has the intrinsic superiority of a democratic over an aristocratic order of society been so magnificently vindicated as during the last forty years of our national career. During that period the free portion of this Union has grown to an overwhelming superiority over the slave portion, and compelled the slaveholders to draw the sword to save themselves from material and providential destruction. This period of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years may be regarded as that of the _consolidation of the people_. The first thirty years of it was the era of their _industrial and social consolidation_; the last ten years has been the period of their _political union against the Slave Power_. An aristocracy always exhibits the uttermost pitch of human policy in its career, and amazes and outwits society by its marvellous display of executive ability.

Its soil is generally light and easily exhausted, and is tilled by the rude and unwilling labor of the slave.

The average yield of wheat south of Tennessee is but six bushels to the acre, in place of twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> in Ohio. The Southern planters, who can sell cotton with profit at ten cents per pound, cannot produce corn for less than one dollar per bushel, or tenfold the cost in the West, and in past years a dollar has been the customary price from North Carolina to Texas.

The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor, which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats. It served as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that its waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a height of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet, which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream. In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at their maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and, doubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn away the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth. It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this stream.

To sum up the present attitude of the Gobelins, then, is to say that the director of to-day encourages the education of taste in the weavers by encouraging them to copy old tapestries instead of paintings old or new, and in a reduction of the number of the tones employed.

Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative.

Twenty-two lessons, of from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> minutes each, were given, about one-third of the time being devoted to drawing, and two-thirds to writing. As to the method pursued, the main points were, to present but a single element at a time; to illustrate on the blackboard defects and excellences in execution; frequent review of the ground passed over, especially in the _first_ steps of the course; a vigorous exercise of all the mental faculties requisite for the performance of the task; and a desire for improvement,...", "...Wages at 17c an hr., 40 girls 375.00 ------- Total cost, 40 girls $672.00 Total cost per girl 16.80 The Board of Education, for its part 2.

About them the whole regiment was now halted. The men tumbled down to catch <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> winks.

Nine months afterwards of the same year, there appeared an increased issue of nearly nine millions, being more than one-fourth of their circulation. What was the consequence? Such an advance in prices, that in September last the cost of every article of import was raised from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> to one hundred per cent. This caused a falling off of trade.

At a small distance below, is the river Rideau on the left, falling over a perpendicular rock, near <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet high, in one sheet, assuming the appearance of a curtain; and from which circumstance it derives its name. To this extent the lands have been surveyed, as before observed, and are very fit for culture. Many loyalists are settled upon the river Rideau, and have, I am told, thriving plantations. Some American families preferring the British territory, have also established themselves along a river on the opposite side, where the soil is excellent.

A varied topography has produced diversified regional weather and soil conditions. The climate is basically continental, with warm summers and cold winters, but the growing season is relatively long--from 180 to 210 days. The amount of precipitation fluctuates from year to year, which results in recurrent droughts. Rainfall averages about twenty-five inches, ranging from only fifteen inches on the Dobruja plateau to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> inches in the mountainous regions. In the principal farming regions, annual precipitation averages about twenty-three inches in the fertile southern plain but dips below twenty inches in the hilly regions of Moldavia in the northeastern part of the country.

And this, though a short letter, contains nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> clear allusions to books of the New Testament; which is strong evidence of the respect which christians of that age bore for those books.\" It appears from this account, that, as Polycarp was a contemporary of the apostles, and referred to the books of the New Testament in his writings, as to books of established authority, these books must have been written as early as the time in which their reputed authors lived, which places their date prior to the destruction of Jerusalem; as...", "...been lately discovered there, who, really adhering to the faith of their fathers, have externally embraced Mahomedanism.

Little was attempted in 1788 by the Russians till August, when Potemkin found himself in a position to invest Oczakoff. The siege was protracted till December, when Suvorov was called in to assist. Under his spirited advice, an assault was made on the fortress, and, in spite of enormous losses, the Russians overcame all opposition and entered the city. A frightful scene of carnage then occurred. The city was given over to the Russian soldiers. Of a population of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand only a few hundreds escaped death, and twenty thousand of the garrison were slaughtered. In spite of this great loss, the campaign of 1788 had not been altogether to the detriment of the Turks. Though they lost Oczakoff, and all hopes of recovering Kilburn and the Crimea had vanished, they had successfully resisted Austria. Joseph's attack had ignominiously failed. The campaign of the following year was far more disastrous to the Turks.

This proved to be quite the most important thing that occurred to him that year. Stuart further offered to lend him the necessary books. This offer was gladly accepted, and having no means of travel, he walked to and from Springfield, a distance of twenty miles, to get the books and return them. During this tramp he was able to read <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pages of the volume. Thus he read, and we may venture to say mastered, Chitty, Greenleaf, and Story, in addition to Blackstone before mentioned. It was the best foundation that could have been laid for a great lawyer.

Not long after her marriage menstruation stopped and all the ordinary symptoms of beginning pregnancy developed.

In that year a squadron appeared in the waters outside the harbor on which the people looked with doubt. It flew the French flag, and that standard had not been a welcome visitor in the past. In fact, it was commanded by a daring Frenchman named Duclerc, who was on the seas for spoil. But a look at the strong defences of the harbor entrance, and some exchange of shots, warned him of the perils that would attend an attempt to pass them by force, and he sailed on to a point some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles down the coast, where he landed a party of a thousand marines. His design to attack the city with this small party seemed folly. The governor, Francisco de Castro, had a force of eight thousand Portuguese troops, besides five thousand armed negroes and several hundred Indian bowmen.

He left a desert behind him. If we could trust the exaggerated reports of Greek historians, Rome remained <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days without inhabitants, tenanted only by beasts. So ended the second act of the Gothic tragedy. But as Vitiges had quitted Rome, so Totila deserted it, and in the spring of 547 it was entered again by Belisarius.

This increasing farm prosperity in Minnesota, which lessens the mortgage foreclosures of the exclusive wheat growers <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> per cent in thirty years, has been the main factor in the settlement of Minnesota and the two Dakotas. It has caused the wheat grown in the territory of these three States to increase from 10,000,000 bushels in 1867 to 190,000,000 bushels in 1898.

Mr. Biddle was sub-postmaster of Rudgeway for over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years, and occupied the post until his death in 1889, at the ripe age of 91 years, when he was succeeded by his daughter, and she, in turn, was succeeded by his son, William Biddle, who still holds the appointment. Prior to becoming sub-postmaster, Mr. Edward Biddle was \"Pike\" keeper at Stone, and used to pay L752 per annum for his post.

With these advances in the art of cover decoration came the demand for the more delicate tints and richer shades of the colors, and as a result finer colors than could be produced in the common cloths were introduced to meet this demand; these fabrics were called the \"extra\" cloths. They have a solid, smooth surface, more \"body,\" and are in every way firmer and better fabrics, and more costly, too, some of the shades costing from twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> per cent more than the common cloths. Extra cloths are used largely on the better class of bindings, such as the popular fiction, holiday books, scientific books, and books of reference, and whenever fine coloring or a better appearance is desired.

The first <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of the last century saw the Post Office at its best as an instrument of taxation. But this very fact drew attention to the lack of other and more important objects. Rates had been forced so high that people resorted to legal and illegal means to evade paying them.

A speed of sixty miles an hour has been reached tobogganing. Perhaps a charm of the toboggan is that it is not very useful. The flat board, set on runners, can only slide down hill, and you must draw it up first. The ski, on the other hand, has a very definite use. It enables snow-covered country to be traversed with safety at great speed, and a proof of its practical value is that the Swiss army is trained to march on ski. Down a steep slope a pace of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles an hour can be reached by the expert ski-runner, and he can leap great heights and great distances with the aid of the momentum of that speed. But to become an expert ski-runner calls for some trouble and pain. With ski the exploration of the Alps in all kinds of weather has become possible.

What astonished the most acute was that this wonderful treaty was conceived and carried out by a young ambassador who had hitherto been famed only as a wit. The first foundations had been laid in 1750 by Madame de Pompadour, Count Canes (who was created a prince), and M. l'Abbe de Bernis, who was not known till the following year, when the king made him ambassador to Venice. The House of Bourbon and the House of Hapsburg had been foes for two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years when this famous treaty was concluded, but it only lasted for forty years, and it is not likely that any treaty will last longer between two courts so essentially opposed to one another. The Abbe de Bernis was created minister for foreign affairs some time after the ratification of the treaty; three years after he re-established the parliament, became a cardinal, was disgraced, and finally sent to Rome, where he died.

The valley of Achin alone was said to be able to furnish <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand men upon an emergency. A certain number of warriors however were always kept on foot for the protection of the king and his capital. Of these the superior class were called ulubalang, and the inferior amba-raja, who were entirely devoted to his service and resembled the janizaries of Constantinople. Two hundred horsemen nightly patrolled the grounds about the castle, the inner courts and apartments of which were guarded by three thousand women.

Sir Richmond walked thoughtfully down the platform towards the exit. \"What else could I do?\" he asked aloud to nobody in particular.

Dr. Martineau was forgotten.

Most of the harvest of logs cut on the Yadate Pass must have been lost, for over 300 were carried down in the short time in which I watched the river.

That brings back another parallel, almost, I might say, an historical parallel, to our mind; that of Dr. Anna Kingsford, taking place perhaps some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago, who claimed--of course she was a very strong anti-vivisectionist--that by thought-power she caused the death of Claude Bernard, the great vivisection scientist of France.

The gradations from the ordinary state of a flower-stalk, as represented in the drawing (fig. 10), to that of a true tendril (fig. 9) are complete.

From this state we can trace every stage till we come to a full-sized perfect tendril, bearing on the branch which corresponds with the sub-peduncle one single flower- bud! Hence there can be no doubt that the tendril is a modified flower-peduncle. Another kind of gradation well deserves notice.

We paid a dollar a share for the common stock and five dollars a share for the preferred stock--which seemed to be a fair price considering that no interest had ever been paid upon the bonds and a dividend on the stock was a most remote possibility. The rolling stock of the road consisted of about seventy locomotives, twenty-seven passenger cars, and around twenty-eight hundred freight cars. All of the rolling stock was in extremely bad condition and a good...", "...I found that to do so would greatly injure the horses.

The firm of Puech and Lacamp was not prosperous, but the money brought by Pierre Rougon retrieved the situation, and after a few years the two original partners retired. Fortune, however, soon changed, and for thirty years there was a continual struggle to make ends meet. Three sons and two daughters were born, and their education was a heavy drain upon their parents' means. In 1845 Pierre and his wife retired from business with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand francs at the most. Instigated by the Marquis de Carnavant, they went in for politics, and soon regular meetings of the reactionary party came to be held in their \"yellow drawing-room.\" Advised, however, by their son Eugene, they resolved to support the cause of the Bonapartes, and at the time of the _Coup d'Etat_ of 1851 Pierre was the leader of that party in Plassans.

The prisoners were marched immediately to Old Chilicothe, the principal Indian town on the Little Miami, where they arrived on the 18th.

Here Governor Hamilton, the British commander of that post, treated them with much kindness. The ten men were soon delivered up for a small ransom. But when the Governor offered them one hundred pounds to give up Boone, that he might allow him to return home, they refused to part with him; they looked upon him as too dangerous an enemy to be allowed to go free upon any terms. Several English gentlemen were moved with pity when they saw Boone thus a helpless prisoner, and...", "...what Miss Powle thinks of. I wish this was Melbourne we were coming to, instead of Sydney.

He was a surly ruffian, and it was not until Nullo ordered four men to load, and to put the fellow with his back to the wall, that he would answer my questions. He said then that the prisoner was, he should say, between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> and fifty, but it was not easy to judge of age after a man had been below there for a few months. He had never said more than a few words to him, and it had never struck him that he was not an Italian. I questioned him more closely as to this, and he admitted that he had sometimes, when he went down, heard the prisoner singing. He had listened, but could not understand the words, and they might have been in a foreign language. He had no more interest in that prisoner than in any...", "...years before our era of reckoning. Until we arrive at them, we perceive only a few torches to lighten the darkness, such as the era of Nabonassar, the war between Lacedaemon and Messene; even those epochs themselves are subjects of dispute. Livy took care not to state in what year Romulus began his pretended reign. The Romans, who well knew the uncertainty of that epoch, would have ridiculed him had he undertaken to decide it. It is proved that the duration of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ascribed to the seven first kings of Rome is a very false calculation. The first four centuries of Rome are absolutely destitute of chronology. If four centuries of the most memorable empire the world ever saw comprise only an undigested mass of events, mixed up with fables, and almost without a date, what must be the case with small nations, shut up in an obscure corner of the earth, that have never made any figure in the world, notwithstanding all their attempts to...", "...aspect of the Provincial Charter is profoundly interesting, and it will be considered in its legal bearings hereafter. Its political tendencies, however, first demand attention, for it wrought a complete social revolution, since it overthrew the temporal power of the church. Massachusetts, Maine, and Plymouth were consolidated, and within them toleration was established, except in regard to Papists; the religious qualification was swept away, and in its stead freeholders of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> shillings per annum, or owners of personal property to the value of forty pounds sterling, were admitted to the franchise; the towns continued to elect the house of representatives, and the whole Assembly chose the council, subject to the approval of the executive.

However, she could afford to bide her time, feeling certain that in the long run Sir Ralph would yield, her stronger will working on his fears. The funeral was over. The family vault of the Coleman's in the quaint old church, a little beyond the Park limits, had received the mortal remains of the worthy man, who for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years had attended divine service within that sacred edifice where the last sad rite for the departed had just been performed. It had been a solemn and imposing ceremony. The cortege passed slowly and silently down the broad avenue of venerable elms, through the Park gate and up the road leading to the old church yard. The superbly mounted coffin, borne on its funeral hearse, whose black plumes, undulated in the soft winds that sighed through the trees, was drawn by six velvet...", "...Priest: \"If, owing to drunkenness or gluttony, anyone vomits up the Eucharist, let him do forty days' penance, if he be a layman; but let clerics or monks, deacons and priests, do seventy days' penance; and let a bishop do ninety days'. But if they vomit from sickness, let them do penance for seven days.\" And in the same distinction, we read a decree of the (Fourth) Council of Arles: \"They who do not keep proper custody over the sacrament, if a mouse or other animal consume it, must do <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days' penance: he who loses it in a church, or if a part fall and be not found, shall do thirty days' penance.\" And the priest seems to deserve the same penance, who from neglect allows the hosts to putrefy. And on those days the one doing penance ought to fast, and abstain from Communion. However, after weighing the circumstances of the fact and of the person, the said penances may be lessened or increased. But it must be observed that wherever the species are found to be...", "...of her traditions, is often treated with so little respect by white men, that she is constantly subjected to insult.

I believe Ehrenbreitstein is called the Gibraltar of Germany. It mounts four hundred cannon, and the magazines will contain provisions for eight thousand men for ten years.

It is either stone, or stuccoed, with an Ionic portico; and, with its wings, is five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet front. All round this city, the heights are strongly fortified; and, look where you may, you see means of defence. We here determined upon an excursion to Stolzenfels, which is about four miles from Coblentz, and our party went in two carriages--the family of Mr. B. in one, and ourselves in the other. The ride was very pleasant along the banks of the Rhine, and through orchards and vineyards--the heights towering away over us all the way. We came to the village of...", "...with rain as they drove from the Gare de Lyon. [Illustration: \"She Wondered What Love Was.\"] All this time something in Theodora was developing. Her beautiful face had an air of dignity. The set of her little Greek head would have driven a sculptor wild--and Josiah Brown was very generous in money matters, and she had always known how to wear her clothes, so it was no wonder people stopped and turned their heads when she passed. Josiah Brown possessed certainly not less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand a year, and so felt he could afford a carriage in Paris, and any other fancy he pleased. His nerves had been too shaken by his illness to appreciate the joys of an automobile. Thus, daily might be seen in the Avenue des Acacias this ill-assorted pair, seated in a smart victoria with stepping horses, driving slowly up and down. And a number of people took an interest in them. Towards the middle of May Captain Fitzgerald arrived at the Continental, and Theodora felt...", "...of party spirit and the violence of political animosity, she was mild and courteous to all. The political assailants of her husband she treated with a kindness, which disarmed their hostility of its individual rancor, and sometimes even converted political enemies into personal friends, and still oftener succeeded in neutralising the bitterness of opposition.] At this period her courage and firmness were put to a severe test. In August, 1814, the British troops landed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles below Washington, and approached that city. The president left the city to hold a council of war. Before his departure he anxiously inquired if she had courage or firmness to remain in their house until his return on the morrow, or succeeding day. She assured him she had no fear but for him and the success of the army. When the president reached Bladensburgh he unexpectedly found the two armies engaged. Meanwhile terror spread over the city--all who could obtain conveyances...", "...with lighted torches in hand ready to fire the heaps of combustibles that had been piled in every house. For the people, loth to trust too implicitly in the unwilling promises of officers smarting under the consciousness of defeat, had abandoned their homes, with the solemn determination that if the invaders made a single attempt at plunder they should find naught but ashes for their loot. But the promises were kept in good faith. The army established its headquarters at Camp Floyd, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles southwest from the city. There the soldiers remained until summoned back, at the outbreak of the Civil War. During their two years' encampment in Utah, the soldiers were fed by the people. Everything in the nature of food was eagerly bought up at an unusual price, and thus the nation's gold found its way into the hands of the citizens. Then, so great was the hurry of the army's departure, so urgent the need of speedy travel, that all their belongings outside of actual...", "...faction, but with a clear majority of the nation led by the most enlightened, and the most eminent, of its sons. Agitators and incendiaries retired into the background, as will always be the case when the country is in earnest; and statesmen who had much to lose, but were not afraid to risk it, stepped quietly and firmly to the front. The men, and the sons of the men, who had so long endured exclusion from office, embittered by unpopularity, at length reaped their reward. Earl Grey, who <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years before had been hooted through the streets of North Shields with cries of \"No Popery,\" lived to bear the most respected name in England; and Brougham, whose opinions differed little from those for expressing which Dr. Priestley in 1791 had his house burned about his ears by the Birmingham mob, was now the popular idol beyond all comparison or competition. In the face of such unanimity of purpose, guided by so much worth and talent, the Ministers lost their nerve, and,...", "...does not cover or explain.

The tracks of tornados have been searched as with candles. When they have been narrow, from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> to eighty rods, their action has been substantially similar, and, although, as we have herein before stated, some irregularities have been found which were consistent with gyration--for irregularities attend the violent action of all forces, and particularly the motion of electricity through the atmosphere, as every one who has seen the zig-zag course of a flash of lightning knows--yet the evidence of two lateral inward currents, or lines of force, has predominated over all...", "...of sufficient resolution of character to make use of those means of keeping the captains up to their duty which Cornelius de Witt had in vain threatened to set in motion in the previous war. There was much to be said for bringing on a battle in order to find who would do his duty and who would not, provided it was also decided to make a necessary example of such as showed the white feather. The first great battle of the second Dutch war was fought on the 3rd June between thirty and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles S.E. of Lowestoft. On the 1st June the Duke of York had been at anchor at Solebay when he was informed of the appearance of the Dutch to the S.S.E. He at once weighed, and stood farther out, coming to an anchor at nightfall. The wind was easterly. During the whole of the 2nd June the English were working up towards the Dutch, who continued to decline battle; and as the wind, though drawing round to the south, was still more or less easterly, they had the weather-gage, and...", "...whatever,\" Collingwood said. \"'We all got on the wrong train,'\" Ellerdine repeated to himself slowly in a sing-song voice; and then, looking up brightly, \"Does seem easy, doesn't it?\" \"Top hole,\" said Collingwood. Thus encouraged, Lord Ellerdine began to repeat the second half of his lesson. \"'We all stayed the night at this hotel.' There's something wrong with that.\" \"It's only your sense of the scrupulous,\" Collingwood replied. \"Only say it often enough. Say it thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> times; then it will sound all right.\" At this moment the door opened and Lady Attwill came in. She looked quickly at Collingwood and he at her. \"Good morning,\" he said. \"Well, how is Peggy?\" \"She has a bad headache,\" Lady Attwill replied. \"She's coming in in a minute or two. I have had a warm quarter of an hour, I can tell you, though I am sure I don't know what _I_ have done....\" If the woman was acting she was acting supremely, for there seemed genuine disgust in her...", "...\"But, Noureddin,\" I remonstrated, \"you do not consider that in speaking thus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed everything.\" This remonstrance only irritated him the more. Throwing himself on me like a madman, he tore me from my horse, beat me to his heart's content, and left me in the state your Majesty sees.\" So saying Saouy turned aside his head and wept bitterly. The king's wrath was kindled against Noureddin. He ordered the captain of the guard to take with him <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> men, to pillage Noureddin's house, to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the slave to him. A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan's, hearing this order given, slipped out of the king's apartment, and hastened to warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with the beautiful Persian. Then, presenting him with forty gold pieces, he disappeared before Noureddin had time to thank him. As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on her veil they fled...", "...two hundred years, till cannon mocked those oft perturbed waters, and civilization dried them. \"Aha! a good shot,\" cried Baldwyn of Burgundy. The tall knight retired. The besiegers hooted him. He reappeared on the platform of the barbican, his helmet being just visible above the parapet. He seemed very busy, and soon an enormous Turkish catapult made its appearance on the platform and aided by the elevation at which it was planted, flung a twentypound stone some two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> yards in the air; it bounded after that, and knocked some dirt into the Lord Anthony's eye, and made him swear. The next stone struck a horse that was bringing up a sheaf of arrows in a cart, bowled the horse over dead like a rabbit, and spilt the cart. It was then turned at the besiegers' wooden tower, supposed to be out of shot. Sir Turk slung stones cut with sharp edges on purpose, and struck it repeatedly, and broke it in several places. The besiegers turned two of their...", "...men. Mr. Hunt endeavored to gather some information from these Indians concerning the country and the course of the rivers. His communications with them had to be by signs, and a few words which he had learnt, and of course were extremely vague. All that he could learn from them was that the great river, the Columbia, was still far distant, but he could ascertain nothing as to the route he ought to take to arrive at it. For the two following days they continued westward upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles along the little stream, until they crossed it just before its junction with Snake River, which they found still running to the north. Before them was a wintry-looking mountain covered with snow on all sides. In three days more they made about seventy miles; fording two small rivers, the waters of which were very cold. Provisions were extremely scarce; their chief sustenance was portable soup; a meagre diet for weary pedestrians.

It is generally supposed that these weapons had been hidden away in readiness for the Jacobite rising of 1715 or 1745.

It was garrisoned by about 200 volunteer troops under Major Daniel Beasley, with refugees from the neighboring settlement, making a total at the time of its destruction of 553 men, women, and children.

The microscopic characters of the exudate are pretty uniform. Wilks and Clark[29] describe the surface of the tubes, examined with a linear magnifying power of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> diameters, as exhibiting the appearance of a gelatinous membraniform matrix traversed by a coarse network of opaque yellow lines, studded at their points of intersection by similarly colored rounded masses.

Her head was disproportionately large to the size of her body; her features, like her voice, were harsh, masculine, and unpleasant in the extreme.

DESIGNER.--Ralph Agas, land surveyor and engraver, died in 1621, and he is described in the register as \"an aged.\" Of course, it is possible that Agas lived to the age of eighty-five or over, in which case he might not have been too young to execute this work in 1560, and he himself says, in a document dated 1606, which has been preserved, that he had been in work as a surveyor for upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. There are two branches into which the enquiry now resolves itself. First, did Agas really make the map? And, second, if he did, at what date did he make it? There is no conclusive evidence on either hand. There is a survey of Oxford, similar in character, signed by him, and though this is not dated, it is known to have been completed in 1578, and published ten years later. On the original copy of this, which is at the Bodleian, there are the following lines: \"Neare tenn...", "...most of whom wore garments of high-priced Venetian cloth.

But, besides attending to such cases as the village may afford, he is day and night at the service of every one who may command his assistance within a circle of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles in diameter, untraversed by roads in many directions, and including moors, mountains, rivers, and lakes. For late and dangerous journeys through an inaccessible country for services of the most essential kind, rendered at the expense, or risk at least, of his own health and life, the Scottish village doctor receives at best a very moderate recompense, often one which is totally inadequate, and very frequently none whatever. He has none of the ample resources proper to the...", "...you did not faint in the presence of the dead and dying!\" said Marta thoughtfully, wonderingly, leaning nearer to her mother, her eyes athirst and drinking. \"But I believe it is only a wispy-waspy sort of girl that faints at all these days. They're all so businesslike,\" said Mrs. Galland--\"so businesslike that they are ceasing to marry.\" How many girls she had known to wait a little too long! If anything could awaken Marta to action it ought to be war, which was a great match-maker <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago. The thought of a lover in danger had precipitated wavering hearts into engagements. Marta's mood was such that she received the hint openly and playfully to-day. \"Oh, I don't despair!\" she exclaimed, straightening her shoulders and drawing in her chin with a mock display of bravery. \"I believe it was in an English novel that I read that any woman without a hump can get any man she sets out for.

A star appeared far down the track which soon waxed into the headlight of the approaching train. It came on with an increasing roar; the engine bore down upon the ambushing desperadoes with a glare and a shriek like some avenging monster come to deliver them to justice. Black Eagle flattened himself upon the ground. The engine, contrary to their calculations, instead of stopping between him and Bud King's place of concealment, passed fully <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> yards farther before it came to a stand. The bandit leader rose to his feet and peered through the bush. His men all lay quiet, awaiting the signal. Immediately opposite Black Eagle was a thing that drew his attention. Instead of being a regular passenger train it was a mixed one. Before him stood a box car, the door of which, by some means, had been left slightly open. Black Eagle went up to it and pushed the door farther open. An odour came forth--a damp, rancid, familiar,...", "...resist them. He acceded to the wishes of the Adelantado, therefore, to visit the interior of his dominions, and furnished him with three guides to conduct him to the mines. Leaving a number of his men to guard the boats, the Adelantado departed on foot with the remainder. After penetrating into the interior about four leagues and a half, they slept for the first night on the banks of a river, which seemed to water the whole country with its windings, as they had crossed it upwards of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> times. On the second day, they proceeded a league and a half farther, and arrived among thick forests, where their guides informed them the mines were situated. In fact, the whole soil appeared to be impregnated with gold. They gathered it from among the roots of the trees, which were of an immense height, and magnificent foliage. In the space of two hours each man had collected a little quantity of gold, gathered from the surface of the earth. Hence the guides took the...", "...took a Broadway car up-town. But Miss Higgins was away on her vacation, and none of the girls who still remained in the flower-shop knew any more about Bessie's whereabouts than I did. Thus it is in the busy, workaday world. Nobody knows where you come from, and nobody knows where you go. Eunice suggested looking in the directory; but as we found forty of the same name, it seemed hopeless. I did happen to know, however, that her father had once been a cutter or tailor; and so out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> we selected all the likeliest names and began a general canvass. After five hours of weary search, and after climbing the stairs of more than a score of tenement-houses, without success, we turned at last into East Broadway, footsore and dusty. In this street, on the fifth floor of a baking tenement, we tapped at the door of Bessie's home. A little blonde woman answered the knock, and when we asked for Bessie she burst into sobs and pointed to a red placard on the door--the...", "...the hillside, there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what should be done with her infant. A resolution to adopt it was unanimous and enthusiastic. But an animated discussion in regard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at once sprang up. It was remarkable that the argument partook of none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they should send the child to Red Dog,--a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles,--where female attention could be procured. But the unlucky suggestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition. It was evident that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition would for a moment be entertained. \"Besides,\" said Tom Ryder, \"them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and ring in somebody else on us.\" A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed at Roaring Camp, as in other places. The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with...", "...there I buried Leah. 49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. 49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. 50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 50:3 And <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. 50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.

As I have said before, the literal accuracy of such a description must have been limited by his power and his willingness to see things as they were. In some ways there is no greater stranger to the youth of twenty than the man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> who was once that youth, and if he overcomes that strangeness it is often by the perilous process of concealing the strangeness and the difference. The result is--or is it an individual misfortune of mine?--that the figure of \"Lavengro\" seems to me, more often than not, and on the whole, to be nearer the age of forty than of twenty. The artist, that is to say, dominates his subject, the tall overgrown youth of twenty-two, as grey as a badger. It is very different in \"The Bible...", "...says the Hebrew scripture, \"came unto Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.\" Jonah, instead of acting as he was commanded, went to Joppa, and thence to Tarshish. He was overtaken by a storm, swallowed by a whale, and thrown up again. Being commanded again, he arose and went to Nineveh, \"_an exceedingly great city of three days' journey_;\" where, having warned the inhabitants, that in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days their city should be overthrown, the people put on sackcloth, \"from the greatest of them even to the least.\" The king sat in ashes, and proclaimed a fast. \"Let neither man nor beast,\" said the edict, \"herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water; but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth; and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

His book was published in 1917, by the George H. Doran Company, New York, and is entitled The American Revolution in our School Textbooks. Here following are some of his discoveries: Of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> school histories used twenty years ago in sixty-eight cities, and in many more unreported, four tell the truth about King George's pocket Parliament, and thirty-two suppress it. To-day our books are not quite so bad, but it is not very much better; and-to-day, be it added, any reforming of these textbooks by Boards of Education is likely to be prevented, wherever obstruction is possible, by every influence visible and invisible that pro-German and pro-Irish propaganda can exert....", "...upon the society of my neighbors for diversion. The type-writer gave no sign of being. Little did I guess that Boswell was busy working up my scheme in his Stygian home! But it came to pass finally that I was roused up. Walking one morning to my desk to find a bit of memoranda I needed, I discovered a type-written slip marked, \"No time for small talk. Boswell's tours grand success. Trolley-party to-night. Ten cars wanted. Jim.\" It was a large order for a town like mine, where <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand people have to get along with five cars--two open ones for winter and two closed for summer, and one, which we have never seen, which is kept for use in the repair-shop. I was in despair. Ten car-loads of immortals coming to my house for a trolley-party under such conditions! It was frightful! I did the best I could, however. I ordered one trolley-car to be ready at eight, and a large variety of good things edible and drinkable, the latter to be held subject to the...", "...or not, cash must be had; and for that quite another sort of Edicts, namely 'bursal' or fiscal ones. How easy were fiscal Edicts, did you know for certain that the Parlement of Paris would what they call 'register' them! Such right of registering, properly of mere writing down, the Parlement has got by old wont; and, though but a Law-Court, can remonstrate, and higgle considerably about the same. Hence many quarrels; desperate Maupeou devices, and victory and defeat;--a quarrel now near <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years long. Hence fiscal Edicts, which otherwise were easy enough, become such problems. For example, is there not Calonne's Subvention Territoriale, universal, unexempting Land-tax; the sheet-anchor of Finance? Or, to show, so far as possible, that one is not without original finance talent, Lomenie himself can devise an Edit du Timbre or Stamp-tax,--borrowed also, it is true; but then from America: may it prove luckier in France than there!

One who was with her there during her last visit, writes: \"Having been witness of Adelina's many triumphs and of outbursts of enthusiasm bordering upon madness, I did not think that greater demonstrations were possible.

On his way, probably to Spain, to follow up that fair prospect, he reached the Netherlands, and rapidly discovering the state of feeling in the Dutch, or as it was then called, the _Batavian_ republic, he addressed himself to the Directors, who consulted Hoche, by whom in turn Tone was consulted. Tone had a high opinion of Lewines, and at once proceeded with him to the Hague, where they were joined, according to agreement, by...", "...30, 1870. \"TELL ME NOT IN MOURNFUL NUMBERS.\" Longfellow's \"Psalm of Life\" was written when he was a young man, and for some years it carried the title he gave it, \"What the Young Man's Heart Said to the Psalmist\"--a caption altogether too long to bear currency. The history of the beloved poet who wrote this optimistic ballad of hope and courage is too well known to need recounting here. He was born in Portland, Me., in 1807, graduated at Bowdoin College, and was for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years professor of Belles Lettres in Harvard University. Died in Cambridge, March 4, 1882. Of his longer poems the most read and admired are his beautiful romance of \"Evangeline,\" and his epic of \"Hiawatha,\" but it is hardly too much to say that for the last sixty years, his \"Psalm of Life\" has been the common property of all American, if not English school-children, and a part of their education. When he was in London, Queen Victoria sent for him to come and see her at the...", "...All day long the farmer was about in the fields while his wife looked after the house and the dairy. Sometimes, as they sat alone of an evening, the plowman's wife would remind him of the unused ring and would talk of things she would like to have for the house. But he always said there was plenty of time. The man and his wife grew old and gray. Then came a day when they both died, and the wishing ring had not been used. It was still on the plowman's finger as he had worn it for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. One of his sons was going to take it off, but the oldest said, \"Do not disturb it. There is some secret connected with it. Perhaps our mother gave it to him, for I have often seen her look longingly at it.\" So the old plowman was buried with the ring which he had supposed to be a wishing ring. It was not, but it had brought more good fortune and happiness than all the wishing in the world could have given.

Two or three men, whether assassins or soldiers, must have surrounded and despatched him before help was available. A blow from an axe must have severed part of his left cheek, exposed the teeth, fractured the jaw, and sent him senseless to the ground; another blow must have seriously injured the skull, and a dagger or javelin has cut open the forehead on the right side, a little above the eye.

A notable part of this retrogression occurred in 1454, when edicts were issued in the name of Ladislas, with the consent of Rokyzana, ordering that the epistles and gospels, in the canon of the mass, should be recited in Latin and not in the vulgar tongue; that confession should be a prerequisite to communion; that children should...", "...enjoyed in the way of holidays, and if this did not answer, threatened to sell them--a threat which was, in the vast majority of cases, quite sufficient to insure good behavior; for the slaves were well aware of the difference between life in the well-managed establishments in Virginia and that in some of the other Southern States.

Thus, the Hebrew race, during many centuries, made supreme contributions to religious thought; and the Greek, during the brief climax of the race, to speculative...", "...days, as the phrase is, but she never referred to them in the presence of curious visitors; and, though perfectly polite to every one who approached her, never cultivated any intimacies among her neighbors.

One bleak autumn when Isaac was getting on fast toward <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> and when he was as usual out of place through no fault of his own, he set forth, from his mother's cottage on a long walk inland to a gentleman's seat where he had heard that a stable-helper was required.

It was easy for him to comply...", "...outside of the Scriptures, pointing to the soul's immortality.

He was present at the opening session in 1874, and at almost every session afterward for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years,--aggressive in debate, instantaneous in repartee, marvelous in memory of faces and facts, and ready to speak upon the widest range of subjects. Every year, Dr. Buckley held a question-drawer, and few were the queries that he could not answer; although in an emergency he might dodge a difficulty by telling a story. For many years he was the editor of the _Christian Advocate_ in New York, known among Methodists as the \"Great Official\"; and he made his paper the champion of...", "...offices, etc., and reach the Agricultural Building--the palace of the farmer. The hard fate of which he habitually complains--that of being thrust into a corner save when he is wanted for tax-paying purposes--does not forsake him here.

Garnish with parsley. Serve with poached eggs on a separate dish. It takes from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> minutes to broil a chicken well. CHICKEN PIE. Prepare the chicken as for fricassee. When the chicken is stewed tender, seasoned, and the gravy thickened, take it from the fire; take out the largest bones, scrape the meat from the neck and backbone, throw the bones away; line the sides of a four or six quart pudding-dish with a rich baking powder or soda biscuit dough, a quarter of an inch thick; put in part of the chicken, a few lumps of butter, pepper and salt, if needed,...", "...wore a grey silk dress, and I remember lifting the skirt up as we passed the door and hitting the kerbstone with it.

And the rather as it was consonant with the uniform practice of the ancient Oriental nations to employ captive foreigners on servile and laborious works.

The relieving force immediately were called on to beat off another enemy attack. At noon on April 17, 1916, the 24th Battalion was relieved by the 26th. The terrible strain to which the troops were subjected at this time necessitated that these, too, should have relief. The 26th were in turn relieved by the 29th Battalion of the Sixth Brigade in the night of April 18-19, 1916. On the next day the defense collapsed. Crater 6 was held by Lieutenant Myers and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> men on the left, and Lieutenant Biggs occupied Crater 7 on the right. The Germans shelled the crater so heavily in the afternoon that only a few of the defenders were left alive. Then the Germans advanced.

Five men who tried to get away across the fire-swept country escaped, though only one man was unwounded. They were the sole survivors of the garrison.

Although nearly, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years had passed away since his father had related that eventful history, it had made so deep an impression upon him that he repeated it to me, as he assured me, nearly word for word.

The calculation was a sound one. For two generations after the appearance of the letter of the 21st of January 1769, speculations as to the authorship of Junius were rife, and discussion had hardly ceased in 1910. Joseph Parkes, author with Herman Merivale of the _Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis_ (1867), gives a list of more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> persons who had been supposed to be Junius.

The irrefragable results noted by Dr Murray will probably come as a surprise to many, though they have now been before the public for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. The Durham dialect of the _Cursor Mundi_ and the Aberdeen Scotch of Barbour are hardly distinguishable by grammatical or orthographical tests; and both bear a remarkable resemblance to the Yorkshire dialect as found in Hampole.

They are only judgments of modern critics as to how and what the author of the book before us ought to have written.

He lived after his trial a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years (42:16), and must have been then considerably advanced in life. This points to a period as early as that of Abraham. To the same conclusion we are brought by the fact that no form of idolatry is mentioned in the book, but only the worship of the heavenly bodies. The simplicity of the patriarchal age appears, moreover, in all its descriptions. But we need not from this infer that the book was written in the patriarchal age, for the author may have received from the past the...", "...entitled. It is just to the Minister to add, that Captain Dashmore had shown as little regard for orders from a distance, as had immortalized Nelson himself; but then the disobedience had not achieved the same redeeming success as that of Nelson, and Captain Dashmore ought to have thought himself fortunate in escaping a severer treatment than the loss of promotion.

Now the amount of light given by such a gas flame is no greater than is pleasant to the eye; it is true that if we burn five cubic feet of acetylene from a suitable flat-flame burner, a...", "...by the Lords after the electors have returned the Liberals to power. The permanent and overwhelming Conservative majority in the Lords acts on the assumption that a Liberal ministry does not represent the will of the people, an assumption at variance with the present theory of democratic government, and in contradiction to the constitutional practice of the Crown. The great size of the House of Lords makes the difficulty of dealing with this majority so acute.

Then for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years the people of God went through the desert, under the leadership of Moses, when the tabernacle of testimony was dedicated, in which God was worshipped by sacrifices prophetic of things to come, and that was after the law had been very terribly given in the mount, for its divinity was most plainly attested by wonderful signs and voices. This took place soon after the exodus from Egypt, when the people had entered the desert, on the fiftieth day after the passover was...", "...war on the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore.

As the mother tried to tell them why she had come--of a Saviour from sin--of a hope after death, some listened intently and seemed to get a gleam of light, but for the most part the crowd was restless and keen only to get inside the house about which they had heard so many strange stories. At last baby Nell wakened, and making the fact known by lusty cries, gave the women the opportunity they desired. As the mother ran to her little one the crowd of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or fifty women and children pressed in after her. With the baby in her arms the mother faithfully kept her promise. Nothing escaped their curious eyes--beds were turned back, drawers opened, sewing machine examined, and organ played before they appeared satisfied.

Convinced at last of the poverty of the colony, Drake accepted a ransom of twenty-five thousand ducats. The sum, which is equal to about fifty thousand pounds of our money, though little enough to satisfy the shareholders, was very serious for the enemy. For besides this loss the town had been stripped of everything worth carrying away by the troops and seamen. Two hundred <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> guns were taken on board the English ships; and not only were they thoroughly refurnished from the Spanish stores, but for a month the whole expedition had lived in free quarters at the enemy's expense.

He was rather more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of age. Light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady, lively, rapid in its changes.

The timbers of the house creaked as the blast lay hard upon it, and now and again the faint fine crystals came sifting down upon my face,--driven beneath the shingles by the tempest.

I felt none of the exultation of a \"king in fairyland\" nor that of a \"lord of the soil.\" The morning came, bright with sun but with the thermometer <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> degrees below zero.

Before we reached the fourth Chickesa Bluff, we passed a large island, called President's Island.

And when you ask the whys and the wherefores of this, the answer comes in but two words: \"terminal expense.\" To reduce drastically this expense, particularly in freight haulage, is to accomplish to-day one of the largest single economies in the operation of the American railroad, while as we have seen, and as we shall again see, further operating economies are apparently its one salvation, no matter who may...", "...business for myself came on suddenly one day, when I got home and found another baby in the house. I was right in the very worst spasms of it when my brother Enoch, whom I hadn't seen for seventeen years, walked in on me.

Enoch had been captain and part owner of a Pacific whaler; she had recently burned at Honolulu, and he was back home now to buy a new ship.

This was opened in 1842 as a penny theatre, and enlarged in 1854. In Church Street there is also a Baptist chapel. Salisbury and Carlisle Streets are indescribably dingy. In the latter is St. Matthew's Church, which has the (perhaps) unique distinction of having been built for a theatre. It was consecrated in 1853, and restored <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years later. Close by the church, between the two streets mentioned above, is the Portman Market. This was opened as a hay-market in 1830, and the year following was dedicated to general uses. The market is still held on Friday every week.

Her mother, seeing the savages approaching, called loudly for her to run, but the warning came too late. Ere her daughter could reach the gate, her mother saw her tomahawked and scalped. Monk was captured and asked about the force of the fort. Like the half-witted boy who was questioned by the Tories, Monk exaggerated the situation, saying there were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> men in the fort then molding bullets in anticipation of an attack. The truth is that aside from the women and children, there were only four men, who were too disabled to march. The savages accordingly thought it best to retreat. No sooner had they withdrawn from the vicinity of the fort than two boys were dispatched to find Captain Estill's band and tell them of the tragedy. In a few hours the messengers found the men, and so uneasy were some of the party for their families...", "...Claude had clutched desperately around him, and, as it happened, his fingers gripped a friendly bush, to which he continued to cling even as he struggled to better his condition and shouted as best he was able.

At first I could distinguish nothing, but soon I saw the tawny flanks and the lashing tail of the lion. His head was hidden by the bushes. At that time we were about a hundred yards from him and it was necessary to circle off to a point where the rest of his body could be seen. A little side ravine intervened, and I had to cross it and come directly down through the clump of bushes.

Mr. Stone's boyhood was spent in the various occupations of country farm life, where he received in common with other boys the advantages of a public school education. In his sixteenth year he left home to try the world for himself, and for a year and a half worked industriously at the carpenter's trade with his elder brother, to whom he was apprenticed for four years, to receive thirty-five dollars the first year, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> the second, forty-five the third, and fifty the fourth. An unconquerable desire for a better education forced him to leave this occupation for a time, and enter an academy, the expenses of which he met in part by teaching a public school in the winter season, and which left him only five dollars with which to make another start in the world. In the meantime, Mr. Stone's brother, to whom he was apprenticed, had been employed by Mr. Howe, the patentee of the \"Howe Bridge,\" and to...", "...Now he felt it again.

Seven-and-twenty years afterwards the trunk of the largest one had extended more than half a foot in circumference; which is probably more than most oaks of a similar age would do during an equal period.

We are likely to turn away from our quest for definite knowledge, feeling that even Jesus has told us nothing. Yet he has told us a great deal. There is one wonderful revelation of which perhaps too little has been made. After Jesus had died, and lain in the grave for three days, he rose again, and remained for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days upon the earth. During that time he did not resume the old relations. He was not with his disciples as he had been during the three years of his public ministry, journeying with them, speaking to them, working miracles; yet he showed himself to them a number of times.

The doctrines of the French Encyclopedistes were inherited by the English school of Utilitarians, led by Bentham and the two Mills; and John Stuart Mill in particular, declared that one of the chief obstacles to human improvement was the tendency to regard difference of race as indelible. In fact, all this school, which had considerable influence some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago, treated religious and social distinctions as inconvenient and decaying barriers against rational progress, or as fictions invented by indolent thinkers to save themselves the trouble of investigating the true causes that modify human character.

Ever cautious, we had studied the situation on encamping, and had tied our horses, cavalry fashion, to a heavy rope stretched from the protected side of the wagon to a high stake driven for the purpose.

We could easily hear the exultations of the redskins just below us in the shallow gorge, and an enfilade fire was poured into them at short range. Two guns were cutting the grass from underneath the wagon, and, knowing the Indians had crept up the depression on foot, we began a rapid fire from our carbines and six-shooters, which created the impression of a dozen rifles on their flank, and they took to their heels in a headlong rout.

One day, about mid-afternoon, the old capital lay glowing in the sunlight. Its hills were white with marble and green with gardens, and traced and spotted and flecked with gold; its thoroughfares were bright with color--white, purple, yellow, scarlet--like a field of roses and amarantus.

Five litters and some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> slaves, who bore and followed them, were waiting in the court of the palace of the Lady Lucia.

There were the hostess and her daughter; three young noblemen, the purple stripes on each angusticlave telling of knightly rank; a Jewish prince in purple and gold; an old philosopher, and a poet who had been reading love lines.

Between these furrows we burnt the grass, an operation that required great care and yet must be done as expeditiously as possible to save time, labour and expense. A certain amount of wind must be blowing so as to insure a clean and rapid burn; but a high gusty wind is most dangerous, as the flames are pretty sure to jump the furrows, enter the pasture, and get away from you.

In practical angling the act of casting, either with fly or bait, is preliminary and subordinate to the real uses of the rod. The poorest fly-rod made will cast a fly thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet, which is about as far as called for in ordinary angling.

At first the governess who had brought her up, and who had educated her in the old-fashioned, thorough, and perhaps rather limited way more usual <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago than now, had lived with her; but when Mabel was nineteen this lady had had to go back to her own people, and she had had no successor. To the scandal rather than to the surprise of the neighbourhood, Miss Digby decided that henceforth she would live alone.

The Larne affair had rendered the movement in support of the Irish Volunteers irresistible, and Redmond had decided to throw himself in with it. The result was an amazing upward leap in the numbers of the Volunteers. On June 15th a question brought out that they were estimated at 80,000 against 84,000 of the Ulster force; but the Nationalist body was increasing at the rate of 15,000 a week. By July 9th they were reckoned (on police information) at 132,000, of whom nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand were Army reservists. These facts now dominated the situation. It was now abundantly clear that if passing Home Rule meant civil war, so also would the abandonment of Home Rule. On June 16th Lord Robert Cecil raised a debate on the new danger.

More belts of wire protected the support line. Here a continuous tunnel had been constructed at a depth of over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet. Every thirty-five yards there were exits with flights of forty-five steps. The tunnels were roofed and lined and bottomed with heavy timber, and numerous rooms branched off.

The Hindenburg line was really only one of a series of twenty lines, each connected with the others by communicating trenches. The main lines were...", "...As one invention necessitates and begets others, so special forms of machines for sawing and working up wood into pegs were devised. Such machinery was for first sawing the selected log of wood into slices across the grain a little thicker than the length of a peg and cutting out knots in the wood; then planing the head of the block smooth; grooving the block with a V-shaped cutting tool; splitting the pegs apart, and then bleaching, drying, polishing and winnowing them.

When the elder Louis died in 840 and his eldest son Lothair claimed the whole Empire, Louis in alliance with his half-brother, king Charles the Bald, defeated Lothair at Fontenoy on the 25th of June 841. In June 842 the three brothers met on an island in the Saone to negotiate a peace, and each appointed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the treaty of Verdun concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands of the Carolingian empire lying east of the Rhine, together with a district around Spires, Worms and Mainz, on the left bank of the river. His territories included Bavaria, where he made Regensburg the centre of his government, Thuringia, Franconia and Saxony.

To render the iodized paper sensitive it is immersed for about six minutes in a bath containing a solution of nitrate of silver (thirty-five grains to the ounce of water, with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> drops of glacial acetic acid); the paper is now removed, and washed in two trays of common clear rain-water or distilled water, and is then dried off between folds of blotting-paper.

I told the chief I should be very glad, and we would pay the man for his services; he had better ask him what he expected.

Progress was specially manifest in two ways: in \"the manufacture of farms\" and in the introduction and use of steam. At the time of the inauguration of Washington in 1789, the center of population of the entire country was thirty miles east of Baltimore. The progress of settlements westward, which had already begun in the last period, became in an...", "...that occurred to him from the time he came up out of Egypt until he went down into Gerar, calculated to touch it, for had it been touched, it would no doubt have exhibited itself. We never can know what is in our hearts until circumstances arise to draw it out. Peter did not imagine that he could deny his Lord, but when he got into circumstances which were calculated to act upon his peculiar weakness, he showed that the weakness was there. It required the protracted period of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years in the wilderness to teach the children of Israel \"what was in their hearts\" (Deut. viii. 2); and it is one of the grand results of the course of discipline through which each child of God passes, to lead him into a more profound knowledge of his own weakness and nothingness. \"We had the _sentence of death in ourselves_, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead\" (2 Cor. i. 9).

He daily sent out detachments on scouting expeditions, or marches of ten or twelve miles, and had sketches and measurements made for a topographical map. By these means he varied the monotony of camp life, and infused hope and spirit into the command. He obtained furloughs for a limited number of men, those with families having the preference, and thus assisted some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> to visit their homes for fifteen days each. He was especially strict with the officers, taught them to assert their authority, and broke up the time-honored habit, the curse of militia organizations, of deferring to, and hobnobbing with, the rank and file.

As the Coroner's Inquest, after long and laborious investigation, has declared, that he was \"_killed_,\" we must assume it to be so. I have known this gentleman, for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years; and have had occasion to observe some of the peculiarities of his character, in the relations of business, as well as in those of ordinary intercourse--I say the _peculiarities_ of his character, for he certainly must be classed in the category of _eccentric_ men. Having heard much of this ill-fated gentleman, for many years, before the late awful occurrence, and still more since the event--for he was extensively known, and all, who knew him, have something to relate--I am...", "...the road between Radicofani and Montefiascone is very stony and disagreeable, I asked the banker Barazzi, if there was not a better way of returning to Florence, expressing a desire at the same time to see the cascade of Terni.

Had I taken the trouble to cast my eyes upon the map, I must have seen, that the road by Terni, instead of being <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles shorter, was much longer than the other: but this was not the only mistake of Signiore Barazzi. Great part of this way lies over steep mountains, or along the side of precipices, which render travelling in a carriage exceeding tedious, dreadful, and dangerous; and as for the public houses, they are in all respects the most execrable that ever I entered.

When her lover is slain, this true and tender queen of the North loosens the knot of life to accompany him. Synge belongs in the first rank of modern dramatists. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> Irish characters that he has created reveal the basal elements of universal human nature. His purpose is like Shakespeare's,--to reveal throbbing life, not to talk in his own person, nor to discuss problems. Synge has dramatized the primal hope, fear, sorrow, and loneliness of life. Although his plays are written in prose and have the distinctive flavor of his lowly characters, yet a recent critic justly says that Synge \"for the first time sets English dramatic prose to a rhythm...", "...his broad-brimmed country hat upon the ground and showed a frank and manly countenance. His complexion might in youth have been ruddy, but time and time's attendants, thought and passion, had paled it: his chesnut hair, faded, but not grey, still clustered over a noble brow; his features were regular and handsome, a well-formed nose, the square mouth and its white teeth, and the clear grey eye which befitted such an idiosyncracy. His time of vigorous manhood, for he was much nearer <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> than fifty years of age, perhaps better suited his athletic form, than the more supple and graceful season of youth. Stretching his powerful arms in the air, and delivering himself of an exclamation which denoted his weariness, and which had broken the silence, he expressed to his companion his determination to rest himself under the shade of the yew in the contiguous garden, and inviting his friend to follow him, he took up his hat and moved away.

Lady Cayley had (as her looking-glass informed her) both gone off and come on quite remarkably in the last three years. Her face presented a paler, softer, larger surface to the eye. Her own eye had gained in meaning and her mouth in sensuous charm; while her figure had acquired a quality to which she herself gave the name of \"presence.\" Other women of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> might go about looking like incarnate elegies on their dead youth; Lady Cayley's \"presence\" was as some great ode, celebrating the triumph of maturity. She took the place Mrs. Hannay had vacated, settling down by Majendie among the cushions. \"How delightfully unexpected,\" she murmured, \"to meet _you_ here.\" She ignored the occasion of their last meeting, just as she had then ignored the circumstances of their last parting.

They wore silk which was sold at its weight in gold. There was a kind of muslin so transparent that it was known as \"woven air.\" Tunics were ornamented with figures embroidered in gold thread, and encrusted with pearls and precious stones.

She carried with her the receipts to show that upon her person she wore a value of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> million sesterces; and this was not her best dress, for the occasion was only a second-class betrothal feast. At an entertainment given by Claudius on Lake Fucinus, Agrippina wore a garment which was woven entirely of gold thread.

On the upper part of the stem the whorls are very close together, but they are more widely separated at the lower portion. The main stems, which taper towards the apex, are marked with lines, and at intervals are enclosed in sheaths; these have long teeth and fit the stem very closely.

They are very frequently represented. It may not, perhaps, be unseasonable to remind you that, from twenty to twenty-five years ago, when the old operas of LULLI and RAMEAU were laid aside, and replaced by modern works, two parties were formed, which, from the name of the musician that each adopted, were called, the one, _Gluckists_; and the other, _Piccinists_. Their inveteracy was great, somewhat like that which, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years before, existed between the _Molinists_ and _Jansenists_: and few persons, if any, I believe, remained neuter. Victory seems to have crowned the former party. Indeed the music of GLUCK possesses a melody which is wonderfully energetic and striking.

Truth obliges me to say, that, of PICCINI'S works, no opera...", "...its history,--its wars, its mighty deeds, its prowess in battle, and its skill in the chase.

This stone was once the cause of a war. The Tuscaroras, residing some thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles down the river,--probably in Tuscarora Valley,--wished to declare war against the tribe at Standing Stone, for some real or fancied insult, and for this purpose sent them repeated war-messages, which the tribe at the Stone refused to give ear to, knowing as they did the strength and power of the enemy. Taking advantage of the absence of a large part of the tribe on a hunt, the Tuscaroras, in great force, came upon the village, captured the stone, and carried it off....", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

Opposite to it is the tomb of Turenne, and under the same roof at last repose the mortal remains of Napoleon. Could...", "...was most vague. M'tela was over yonder--a long distance--who knows how far? He possessed more or less mythical characteristics, ranging from a height of forty or fifty feet down to the mere possession of a charm by which he could kill at a distance. Then, as the journey went on, the vagueness began to define. M'tela took form as a big man with a voice like the lion at night. His surroundings began to be described. He lived in the edge of a forest; his people were many; he had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> wives, and the like. Still it was far, very far. Kingozi concluded that none of these people had in person visited the Kabilagani, but were talking at second hand. And finally direct information came to him--in the form of fear.

The birth of the bank and the birth of the English national debt were both in King William's time. In 1691, when England was at war with France, the national debt unfunded was L3,130,000, at an annual interest of L232,000. In 1697, at the Peace of Ryswick, this debt had swollen to L14,522,000. At the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, it had reached L34,000,000. The war with Spain in 1718 brought it up to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> millions sterling. And here it might have rested, had the advice of Shakspeare been followed: 'Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace.' But England went to war with Spain 'on the right of search.' From 1691 to this time the debt had increased on an average about a million sterling per year. As early as 1745 the credit of the bank was so identified with that of the state, that during the invasion of the Pretender, whose forces were at Derby, only one hundred and twenty...", "...lavas after that age. Let us now examine some of the more active volcanoes of Iceland and their eruptions. We will begin with the well-known volcano of Skaptar Joekul. The following description of this volcano has been taken from a book on Iceland by E. Henderson, published in Boston, 1831. Skaptar Joekul lies in the south central part of Iceland about forty odd miles from the coast. It takes its name from the Skaptar River, down whose channel the lava flowed its entire distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles from the ocean. Skaptar Joekul consists of about twenty conical hills lying along one of the fissures that extends from northeast to southwest. It appears from Henderson's account that people living in the neighborhood of Skaptar Joekul were greatly alarmed by repeated earthquakes that were felt at different times from the first to the eighth of June, 1783. These earthquake shocks increased in number and violence, so that the people left their homes and awaited in terror...", "...will long remain an insurmountable barrier. I cannot comprehend how Bonaparte (who is certainly no bad judge of men) could so long confide in Bourrienne, who, with the usual presumption of my countrymen, is continually boasting, to a degree that borders on indiscretion, and, by an artful questioner, may easily be lead to overstep those bounds. Most of the particulars of his quarrel with Napoleon I heard him relate himself, as a proof of his great consequence, in a company of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> individuals, many of whom were unknown to him. On the first discovery which Bonaparte made of Bourrienne's infidelity, Talleyrand complimented him upon not having suffered from it. \"Do you not see,\" answered Bonaparte, \"that it is also one of the extraordinary gifts of my extraordinary good fortune? \"Even traitors are unable to betray me. Plots respect me as much as bullets.\" I need not tell you that Fortune is the sole divinity sincerely worshipped by Napoleon....", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

Consequently, so far as life is concerned, the pictures should never be taken at less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> to fifty per second, unless one is contented to have a mere distorted impression of what actually takes place. Even moving-pictures of the snail or tortoise, generally considered to move very slowly, should never be photographed at a less speed, because these have actions which cannot be caught at sixteen pictures per second.

To understand that method one must begin a little way back. As the two planets, Mars and the Earth, turn on their axes the parts of their surfaces they present to each other are constantly changing. For a feature on Mars to be visible from a given post on earth, observer and observed must confront each other, and, furthermore, it must be day there when it is night here. But, as Mars takes about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> minutes longer to turn than the Earth, such confronting occurs later and later each night by about forty minutes, until finally it does not occur at all while Mars is suitably above the horizon; then the feature passes from sight to remain hidden till the difference of the rotations brings it round into view again. There are thus times when a given region is visible, times when it is not, and these succeed each other in from five to six weeks, and are called presentations.

The quantity of fruit is astonishing; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or fifty cart-loads of the finest pine-apples, packed as carelessly as turnips in England, are common, and other fruit in the same profusion.

Two of the Japanese ships were badly damaged, but none were lost, while their losses in killed and wounded were much less than those of the Chinese. An important lesson from the battle was the danger of too much wood-work in ironclad ships, and another was the great value in naval warfare of rapid-firing guns. But the most remarkable characteristic of the battle of the Yalu was that it took place between two nations which, had the war broken out <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years earlier, would have done their fighting with fleets of junks and weapons a century old.

The stronghold was thereupon abandoned by its garrison and occupied by the Japanese. The...", "...came asking me to spend an evening with him and talk over some new plans for Chautauqua.

They were still under the barrage, and the smoke made matters very difficult. Presently the 5th Durham Light Infantry came up the trench to take up an allotted position, which they found to be already taken by the enemy. They moved off to the right of the main trench, however, and the forty men under Capt. Lyon joined them.

Much of it was in this condition only thirty years ago. The improvements have been made by the following circumstances. First. By enclosing without the assistance of Parliament. Second. By a spirited use of marl and clay. Third. By the introduction of an...", "...in art and a mastery of his materials which in their way are not to be paralleled in the work of Sir Walter himself. Like Napoleon, he was 'a natural force let loose'; and if he had done no more than achieve universal renown as the prince of _raconteurs_ and a commanding position as a novelist wherever novels are read he would still have done much. But he did a vast deal more. A natural force, he wrought in the right direction, as natural forces must and do. He amused the world for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years and more; but he also contributed something to the general sum of the world's artistic experience and capacity, and his contribution is of permanent worth and charm. He has left us stories which are models of the enchanting art of narrative; and, with a definition good and comprehensive enough to include all the best work which has been produced for the theatre from AEschylus down to Augier, from the _Choephorae_ on to _le Gendre de M.

As saints, however, are often more venerated than the Deity himself, who it is well known accepts of no other offerings than a pure conscience or sincere repentance, and is therefore not so easily appeased; so the visit to Medina is nearly as much esteemed as that to the house of God, the Beitullah at Mekka; and the visiters crowd with more zeal and eagerness to this shrine, than they do even to...", "...certainly be a model of efficiency. We have to pierce through the crust of our national conceit and find there the truth that our people are painfully in need of more efficiency and that therefore it is a matter of the most vital concern that we should put the home in all its phases into a condition more adapted for producing the perfectly efficient human product. The Gospel of Efficiency has reached the farmer; he finds that with three men he can do the work that fifteen men did <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago. He realizes that the efficient farmer progresses, the inefficient falls behind. Will not the same thing be true of woman in the farmstead? To see how the principle of efficiency may be applied in the work of the farmstead, we have but to look, for instance, at that task of dish washing. Suppose that the worker were piling the dishes at the right of the dishpan and also trying to drain them at the same side.

Twenty-five nobles, well and richly clad in fine silk and scarlet cloth, bade him welcome and conducted him to a boat, large enough to seat <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> persons, covered with satin cramoisy and richly carpeted.

I have never seen any need of lying, in my practice.\" And yet another physician, who had been in a widely varied practice for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years, said that he had never found it necessary to tell a lie to a patient; although he thought he might have done so if he had deemed it necessary to save a patient's life. In other words, while he admitted the possible justification of an \"emergency lie,\" he had never found a first-class opening for one in his practice. And he added, that he knew very well that if he had been known to lie to his patients, his professional efficiency, as well as his good name, would have...", "...been in 1800, though in the succeeding decade the value of the annual harvest rose from $5,000,000 to $9,000,000, and the manufacturing of tobacco became an important industry in many localities. Rice culture was at a standstill during these years, and sugar was only making a beginning; but the total of these staples, including cotton, reaches almost to two thirds of the national exports. The annual _per capita_ income of the lower South ranged during the Jacksonian era from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> dollars, while that of the older Southern States like Virginia and Maryland was not half so great, and the average for the country as a whole fell much below that of the South. There was thus a marked contrast between the fortune of the average Middle States man and that of the cotton planters. The result was an extraordinary movement southwestward, especially from the older South and Kentucky, where population was almost stationary during a period of twenty years.

According to the system in vogue at the Chinese courts, the duty of recording historical events was confided to historians of the right hand and of the left. To the latter was given the duty of recording the speeches and edicts of the sovereigns and their ministers, and to the first that of compiling chronicles of events. The historians who had placed on record the documents which Confucius edited in the 'Shu King' or...", "...I have seen and learnt Since my poor nephew's misfortune-the more one has to do with men the worse one finds them But can one mend them?

Miller followed his orders to the letter, and the stipend was increased to the munificent sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> dollars per month. Meantime the case against Ammon languished and the District Attorney of New York County was at his wits' end to devise a means to procure the evidence to convict him. To do this it would be necessary to establish affirmatively that the thirty thousand five hundred dollars received by Ammon from Miller and deposited with Wells, Fargo & Co. was the _identical_ money stolen by Miller from the victims of the Franklin Syndicate.

Some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> students attended the academy, mostly from the town of Rossville. Mr. Rathburn, however, received a few boarders into his family.

In his prayers there was one note that always predominated. \"Give me strength and courage for Thy work, O...", "...such complete and technical institutions as the Museum of Geology, the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and such institutions which really have a motive in view--steadfastly adhered to--I saw, then as now, that every provincial museum was nothing if left to its own devices, and, if \"inspired,\" was, at the best, but a sorry and servile imitator of the worst points of our national museum. Everyone must have observed, no doubt, in any provincial museum which dates back thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years, that the great curse of the collection, so to speak, is sketchy versatility. In walking through the usually \"dry-as-dust\" collections you find numbers of very atrociously-rendered mammals, a greater sprinkling of funereal and highly-disreputable birds, some extremely-protracted fishes, some chipped insects, and a lot of shells, chiefly marine, which suggest association with the word \"stores.\" I allude to those odds and ends which people do not want themselves, and which...", "...sledges are used, one for travel and the other for transporting freight.

The result will be that the demand for labourers in that kind of trade will increase; the capitalists will bid against each other for workmen, and they will not, generally speaking, be able to get enough without raising the rate of wages. There is no reason whatever to think that trades-unions have had any permanent effect in raising wages in the majority of trades. No doubt wages are now much higher than they were thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago; but to a certain extent this is only a rise of money wages, due to the abundance of gold discovered in California and Australia. The rest of the increase can be easily accounted for by the great improvements in machinery, and the general prosperity of the country. It is certain, too, that the increase of wages is not confined to those trades which have unions; even common labourers who have no unions receive considerably more money wages than they did, and domestic...", "...act swept from the statute-books all previous legislation about the negro, slave as well as free.[179] In spite of the obstacles created by the statute of 1725-1726, the freeing of negroes continued.

In 1742 Judge Langhorne in Bucks County devised freedom to all of his negroes, between thirty and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> in number. In 1744 by the will of John Knowles of Oxford, negro James was to be made free on condition that he gave security to the executors to pay the thirty pounds if required.

In 1878 Mr. Linfield tested an apparatus in England consisting of a cigar-shaped car, to which was attached on each side frames five feet square, containing each twenty-five superposed planes of stretched and varnished linen eighteen inches wide, and only two inches apart, thus reminding one of a Spanish donkey with panniers. The whole weighed two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pounds. This was tested by being mounted on a flat car behind a locomotive going 40 miles an hour. When towed by a line fifteen feet long the apparatus rose only a little from the car and exhibited such unstable equilibrium that the experiment was not renewed.

Most of them began operations in the decade 1862-1872, but the most rapid growth in the magnitude and scope of their business operations has come in recent years. In 1899 there were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> institutions of this kind in operation in the German Empire. The number at the present time is probably considerably greater, since for obvious reasons combinations among them are not promoted by the same kind of economic pressure that in recent years has operated so efficiently in Germany in the field of commercial banking. Two other groups of German institutions merit attention in this connection, namely, the so-called Schulze-Delitzsch and the Raiffeisen Credit...", "...Hamburg and Luebeck, and the picturesque water route along the Swedish coast, ending with an account of what she saw of interest in Sweden's capital city.] Our route to Sweden was by Hamburg and Luebeck, for at the latter place we were to pick up some of our party; and, indeed, under any circumstances, it is the best route for a first visit to the country, for then you approach Stockholm by the Baltic. The average passage from London to Hamburg by steamer direct occupies <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> hours, but the waves and winds were favorable, and we accomplished the distance in four hours less. However, calm as the seas were, every tourist's soul felt more in sympathy with Nature when we were actually in the river Elbe. By daybreak we were steaming up towards Hamburg, past the pleasant suburb of Blankensee, which reminds one very much of Richmond. It is a collection of magnificent villas--indeed, one might say palaces--built among the hanging woods of the river-bank....", "...and in one of the windows of the lodge there shone a light. Again Radmore stopped the car and jumped out, Timmy still heavily asleep. He went up to the door of the lodge and rapped with his knuckles. It opened and revealed a young woman, fully dressed. \"What do you want?\" she exclaimed, in a frightened voice. \"I've lost my way,\" he said, \"and seeing a light in your window, I ventured to knock. I've no idea where I am--I want to get to Beechfield.\" \"Beechfield?

The family is eating under the shade of a pear tree planted in front of the door; father, mother, the four children, and the help--two women and three men are all there. All are silent. The soup is eaten and then a dish of potatoes fried with bacon is brought on. From time to time one of the women gets up and takes a pitcher down to the cellar to fetch more cider. The man, a big fellow about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years old, is watching a grape vine, still bare, which is winding and twisting like a snake along the side of the house. At last he says: \"Father's vine is budding early this year. Perhaps we may get something from it.\" The woman then turns round and looks, without saying a word.

After unloading a few groceries at Rock Harbor, they went pop-popping round Schoville's Point to Tobin's Harbor Landing, then round to Belle Isle at the north side of the island. Everywhere there was talk of fire, but to Florence's growing astonishment she caught no word suggesting that the fires might have been set. At last, she all but dismissed the thought from her mind. But not for long. Isle Royale is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles long. The east end broken up into points is like the fingers on a man's hand. Blake's Point, which forms the long middle finger, extends far out into Lake Superior. It is here that sturdy fishermen mumble a prayer on nights of storm and fog, for the roar of breaking waves is like the roar of the sea, and great gray walls seem to reach out hands to drag them in.

The University Arms is situated on the edge of a large common called \"The Field.\" Here in the evening were several open-air religious services.

The rafts are loaded with corn, and the pilgrims receive a free passage; or a small sum of money is given them, if they consent to row; from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> to sixty sailors being required for each, the oars consisting of a thin fir-tree. Piotrowski was only too happy to increase his small store of money by working. At the break of day, before starting, the captain cried--\"Seat yourselves, and pray to God.\" Every one squatted down like a Mussulman for a moment, then rose and made a number of salutations and crossings; and next, down to the poorest, each threw a small piece of money into the river to secure a propitious voyage....", "...keeps pace with the increase in number is a point to be maturely considered.

Probably fifty thousand persons now live within sight of the Rochester steeples, though not a human being inhabited this then dense and swampy wilderness <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago. And here, almost wholly from a region which had less than five thousand white inhabitants in 1810, not fewer than one hundred thousand persons, two-thirds of them adult males, were drawn together expressly to witness this exhibition. The number who entered the gates on Thursday alone exceeded seventy-five thousand, while the attendance on the two preceding days and on Friday, of persons who were not present on Thursday, must have exceeded twenty-five thousand.

In romance, English literature was strongly represented by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> volumes of novels, of course in translations. Besides a few works on arts and sciences, he also had with him twelve volumes of \"Barclay's Geography,\" and three volumes of \"Cook's Voyages,\" which show that his thoughts extended to the antipodes; and under the heading of Politics he included the Bible, the Koran, the Vedas, a Mythology, and Montesquieu's \"Esprit des Lois\"!

As the cold season advances in the temperate and frigid zones, the water in our lakes and rivers is reduced to the temperature of forty degrees; but at this point, by a beneficent provision of an All-wise Providence, the upper substratum becomes specifically lighter, and is converted into a covering of ice, which, resting upon the water beneath, protects it from freezing. Moreover, when water is converted into ice, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> degrees of heat are given out, a part of which, entering into the water below, retards the further formation of ice.[54] [54] I may here add, that exactly the _reverse_ is true in the _melting_ of snow and ice.

None off the applicants, I think, affected me more disagreeably than an old man who came, with his fourth wife hanging on his arm, to bespeak gravestones for the three former occupants of his marriage-bed.

So he worked and worked, to make a hollow; it was for dear life that he was working, and you may be sure that he never relaxed. Formed of detached pieces, he worked with five claws, which, always pushing together, united and formed an admirable pick. His pick of five teeth, of the finest enamel, is attached to a frame work, delicate, but very strong, and consisting of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pieces, which work in a sort of sheath, playing in and out, in the most perfect and regular manner, with an elasticity preventing too violent shocks, and self-repairing, in case of any accident.

In the end, Graham sat above the opposition gangway next to Lord John Russell and Cardwell. The Peelite body as a whole determined on giving the new government what is called a fair trial. 'Mr. Sidney Herbert and I,' says Mr. Gladstone, 'took pains to bring them together, in the recognised modes. They sat on the opposition side, but below the gangway, full, or about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> strong; and Sir James Graham, I recollect, once complimented me on the excellent appearance they had presented to him as he passed them in walking up the House.' Considerable uneasiness was felt among some of them at finding themselves neighbours on the benches to Cobden and Bright and Hume and their friends on the one hand, and 'the Irish Brass Band' on the other. It depended entirely on the Peelites whether the new government should be permitted to conduct the business of the...", "...The writer would not print a word that would disturb these improving conditions; and if he has erred at all in picturing the intercourse between Americans as enemies, he has made sure to do so in the interests of justice and magnanimity on both sides. In the series of which this volume is the last, the author has confined his narrative of adventures to the navy. It has been suggested to him that another series, relating exclusively to incidents in the army, should follow. After <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of labor in this particular field, and having already exhausted the threescore and ten of human life, he cannot be assured that he will live long enough to complete such a series, though still in excellent health; but he intends to make a beginning of the work as soon as other engagements will permit.

On our journey back we narrowly escaped colliding seriously with a herd of bullocks. We had just passed Robleria, when we noticed some distance ahead of us a solitary bullock standing quietly on the line. On the whistle being sounded he at once left the track, so that the steam, which had been momentarily turned off, was again put on, and the engine resumed her usual speed. We had now approached to within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> yards of the place where the animal had been, when suddenly from a dense clump of bushes to the light there emerged a herd of half-a-dozen bullocks, who with one accord began leisurely to cross the line. Quick as thought Clark with one hand turned on the whistle, while with the other he reversed the engine, leaving the steam valve wide open; and immediately there was a great rattle of machinery below the platform, and the engine checked her way considerably. And now at the last...", "...top, the whole furnished in the most superb style. The lower suite of apartments is equally splendid; the walls are decorated with paintings in fresco of several of the emperors of Germany. The magnificence of the decorations on the walls and ceilings of the new apartments in this palace are such that no one can form any idea of their grandeur without a visit. Adjoining to this, is the statue gallery of antiquities, which measures about three hundred and thirty six feet in length, by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> five in width, with a cove ceiling painted in fresco. I here saw a beautiful Florentine Mosaic table, for which Napoleon offered sixteen thousand florins. There is also a Bavarian almanack of the fifteenth and sixteenth century, in form of a circular table, about seven feet in diameter, inlaid with brass; but the letters and figures almost obliterated.

In fact the English general had despatched in the night <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> Frenchmen, of those he had made prisoners in Pondicherry, with orders to fill up the ditch with the ruins of the works, to examine the breach effectually, clear the way as much as possible, and give due notice of their progress.

The east bank of the Grand Canal, between Yangchow and Hwaianfu, is itself a great levee, holding back the waters to the west above the eastern plain, diverting them south, into the Yangtse kiang. But it is also provided with spillways for use in times of excessive flood, permitting waters to discharge eastward. Such excess waters however are controlled by another dike with canal along its west side, some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles to the east, impounding the water in a series of large lakes until it may gradually drain away. This area is seen in Fig. 53, north of the Yangtse river.

The chief difficulty lay in the forty tiers of oars and in the four thousand oarsmen. The engraving upon the opposite page gives a representation of the Ptolemy, as she may reasonably be supposed to have appeared. Instead of forty _tiers_, she has, when thus restored, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> _groups_ of oars: with this substitution, and a liberal diminution in the aggregate number, it is not improbable that she may have existed, and floated even. It is not, however, pretended by Callixenus that she was ever useful in war: she seems to have been regarded as a curiosity and a spectacle.

I cannot answer the question exactly because I did not make an experiment in the laboratory to know what part of the pollen was viable.

Under other conditions it may be several weeks; but we have to remember that, in dealing with pollen, we are dealing with a living, breathing...", "...wind is, and at what strength it is blowing.

Slowly, very slowly, the great bird lifted his terrible prey up and up--ten, twenty, thirty, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet, but no higher. That was the limit of his lift, the utmost of his strength; and at that height parallel with the ridge, he began to carry the wolverine along, the wolverine that was going mad with rage in his grasp. It was a mistake, of course--a mistake for the wolverine to be out on the open ridge in stark daylight; another mistake for the eagle, presuming on his fine, lustful pride of strength, to attack him. And then suddenly Gulo got his chance. It hit him bang in...", "...besieged of Lille, some of the most brilliant feats of valor were performed that ever illustrated any war. On the French side (whose gallantry was prodigious, the skill and bravery of Marshal Boufflers actually eclipsing those of his conqueror, the Prince of Savoy) may be mentioned that daring action of Messieurs de Luxembourg and Tournefort, who, with a body of horse and dragoons, carried powder into the town, of which the besieged were in extreme want, each soldier bringing a bag with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pounds of powder behind him; with which perilous provision they engaged our own horse, faced the fire of the foot brought out to meet them: and though half of the men were blown up in the dreadful errand they rode on, a part of them got into the town with the succors of which the garrison was so much in want. A French officer, Monsieur du Bois, performed an act equally daring, and perfectly successful.

The folklore of primitive races is a great storehouse whence a people can choose tales and heroic deeds to glorify its own national hero, careless that the same tales and deeds have done duty for other peoples and other heroes. Hence it happens that Hereward the Saxon, a patriot hero as real and actual as Nelson or George Washington, whose deeds were recorded in prose and verse within <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of his death, was even then surrounded by a cloud of romance and mystery, which hid in vagueness his family, his marriage, and even his death. Briefly it may be stated that Hereward was a native of Lincolnshire, and was in his prime about 1070. In that year he joined a party of Danes who appeared in England, attacked Peterborough and sacked the abbey there, and afterward took refuge in the Isle of Ely.

An arithmetical statement of this kind seems at first sight so conclusive that those who have since discussed the financial outcome of the war of 1870 have quite overlooked the fact that, if such a balance-sheet as that indicated be sound, the whole financial history of Germany and France during the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years which have followed the war is meaningless. The truth is, of course, that such a balance-sheet is meaningless--a verdict which does not reflect upon Sir Robert Giffen, because he drew it up in ignorance of the sequel of the war.

The percentage is surprisingly low, considering the defective organization of the military medical staff, and the length and hardships of the campaigns which were conducted in Italy (Mutina), Macedonia (Philippi), Acarnania (Actium), Sicily, Egypt, Spain, Germany, Armenia and other countries. The number of men-of-war of large tonnage, which were captured, burnt, or sunk in battle, is stated at six hundred.

The single railroad passing through Fredericksburg had no coast terminal. Throughout its short length it paralleled the coast, offering no means of shipping for export, which comprised most of the business of the day.

How then can spinning be introduced in every home? I have already suggested the introduction of spinning and systematic production of yarn in every national school. Once our boys and girls have learnt the art they can easily carry it to their homes. But this requires organisation. A spinning wheel must be worked for twelve hours per day. A practised spinner can spin two tolas and a half per hour. The price that is being paid at present is on an average four annas per <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> tolas or one pound of yarn _i.e._, one pice per hour. Each wheel therefore should give three annas per day. A strong one costs seven rupees. Working, therefore, at the rate of twelve hours per day it can pay for itself in less than 38 days. I have given enough figures to work upon. Any one working at them will find the results to be startling. If every school introduced spinning, it would revolutionize our ideas of financing education. We can work a school for six hours per day...", "...derive benefits from his services?

By the time the rising sun has ascended to the height of thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> degrees above the horizon the earth has acquired, and reflected on the body of air situated over it, a degree of heat sufficient to rarefy it and destroy its equilibrium; in consequence of which the body of air above the sea, not being equally, or scarcely at all, rarefied, rushes towards the land and the same causes operating so long as the sun continues above the horizon, a constant sea-breeze, or current of air from sea to land, prevails during that time.

In reply, a letter from the Company, in August, gave the encouraging news, that in the spring, the Company would send an excellent shipwright with thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> carpenters. In preparation, they were advised to fell a large number of black oak trees, and bark as many others. The Company expected the sawmill to provide the planks and suggested a place near the sawmill and ironworks for the shipyard.

The policy of saving China, the great English milch cow, from destruction, which had been patiently followed by Great Britain for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years, was thus suddenly submerged in a wave of warlike enthusiasm. Press-made feeling was both stronger and had more influence on the action of Government in England than in any other country.

But as night came on they found that the hills were dropping down, and the mountains seemed to be about as blue and as far ahead as ever. \"I should judge from these signs,\" said Breakstone, \"that there is a valley or narrow plain ahead, between us and the mountains.

At first Montcalm had not realized what was the deepest shadow in the life of Canada.

There were fair women and brave men, sumptuous dinners with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or fifty covers, brilliantly lighted salons, a vivid social life in which he was much courted. The Intendant Bigot was agreeable and efficient. Soon, however, Montcalm had misgivings. It was a gambling age, but he was staggered by the extent of the gambling at the house of the Intendant. He did not wish to break with Bigot, and there was perhaps some weakness in his failure to denounce the orgies from which his conscience revolted.

This, for a portion of his eventful life, was the sad destiny of Dr. Franklin. Scarcely had he passed his first <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years in his favourite philosophical labours, equally useful to the world, and delightful to himself, when he was at once stopped short--stopped by the voice of public gratitude. The wise and virtuous people of Pennsylvania, chiefly quakers, who estimate a man, not by the fineness of his coat, but the _usefulness_ of his life, were not to overlook such a man as Franklin. His astonishing industry, and his many valuable inventions, had long made him the favourite theme of their...", "...This he had managed to do, more or less completely, by the sale of the stones which Ezra had brought home, supplemented by the recent profits of the firm.

In the town of Ipswich the masters of these ships generally dwelt, and there were, as they then told me, above a hundred sail of them, belonging to the town at one time, the least of which carried fifteen score, as they compute it, that is, 300 chaldron of coals; this was about the year 1668 (when I first knew the place).

This channel, close inshore, could be readily defended, as it was the only passage for vessels of any draft, and consequently when the colony got established at Jamestown they built Fort Algernon at Point Comfort to protect the entrance to the James. In 1611 this fort was described as consisting of stockades and posts, without stone or brick, and containing seven small iron guns, with a garrison of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> men. After the British invasion of Chesapeake Bay, in 1814, when they burnt the Capitol and White House at Washington, it was quickly decided that no foreign foe should be again permitted to do such a thing, and that an elaborate work should be built to defend the entrance to the bay. General Simon Bernard, one of Napoleon's noted engineers, offered his services to the United States after the downfall of the Emperor, and he was placed in charge, with the duty of constructing,...", "...a similar voyage.\" It was, indeed, nearly sixty years before Drake, the second circumnavigator, entered the Pacific Ocean. Early in March, 1521, Magellan fell in with a cluster of islands, where he and his men went ashore to refresh themselves after the fatigues and privations of their voyage. The inhabitants, however, were great thieves, penetrating into the cabins of the vessels and taking every thing on which they could lay their hands. Magellan, exasperated at length, landed with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> men, burned a village and killed seven of the natives. The latter, when pierced with arrows through and through,--a weapon they had never seen before,--would draw them out by either end and stare at them till they died.

At another island the crew received from the...", "...thousands, don't you see.\" \"But they have to account, anyhow,\" replied Miss Moyne, with a perplexed smile. \"Account!\" exclaimed Ferris, contemptuously; \"account! yes, they have to account.\" \"But they account to me,\" Miss Moyne gently insisted. \"Who are your publishers?\" he demanded. \"George Dunkirk & Co.,\" was the answer. \"Well,\" said he, \"I'll wager you anything I can come within twenty of guessing the sales up to date of your book.

OF DYEING AS AN ART Dyeing is a very ancient art; from the earliest times of the ancient civilisations till within about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago there had been no essential change in it, and not much change of any kind. Up to the time of the discovery of the process of Prussian-blue dyeing in about 1810 (it was known as a pigment thirty or forty years earlier), the only changes in the art were the result of the introduction of the American insect dye (cochineal), which gradually superseded the European one (kermes), and the American wood-dyes now known as logwood and Brazil-wood: the latter differs little from...", "...o' mine was that sort.\" \"What was it, Ben? We have time to listen to it before having to start back, I guess, or you can tell it to us while you are rowing us out to the yacht.\" \"Well, we was cruisin' around the Guinea coast, and one day I went on shore to look about and got separated from the other fellows, and all to once got so tangled up in the jungle that I didn't know which way to go nor nothing.\" \"That's interesting,\" said Percival. \"Then all of a sudden about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> black niggers jumped out of the jungle and gave chase, for I didn't stop to calc'late which way I orter go when I seed them, but just laid a course what would take me away from 'em the quickest. \"I just put through the jungle as tight as I could jump, and suddenly come face to face with a scrouching lion as big as a elephant, all ready to pounce upon me, and there I was between two fires. \"You might say three, because I was on the edge of a swamp and there was a big...", "...it as a favor, and be very much obliged to you, and thankful.\" On the credit of the crier, the Prince accepted the conditions, and concluded the bargain; and, having got the master's leave, they went into his back shop; they both sat down on it, and as soon as the Prince formed his wish to be transported into his apartment at the khan he presently found himself and the crier there; and, as he wanted not a more sufficient proof of the virtue of the tapestry, he counted the crier out <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pieces of gold, and gave him twenty pieces for himself. In this manner Prince Houssain became the possessor of the tapestry, and was overjoyed that at his arrival at Bisnagar he had found so rare a piece, which he never disputed would gain him the hand of Nouronnihar. In short, he looked upon it as an impossible thing for the Princes his younger brothers to meet with anything to be compared with it. It was in his power, by sitting on his tapestry, to be at the place of meeting...", "...the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child [Ishmael], and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs\" (14, 15). When Isaac was weaned, and Hagar was sent into the wilderness, Ishmael, who was about sixteen years old, is represented as a babe in his mother's arms. 10. \"And Esau was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite\" (Gen. xxvi, 34). \"Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; and Bashemath Ishmael's daughter\" (xxxvi, 2, 3).

Was his first wife Judith, the daughter...", "...events of the year were the terrible massacre of the inhabitants of the Island of Scio by the Turks in April; the defeat of the latter in the Morea, where more than twenty thousand of them were slain; the successes of the Greek fire-ships, by which many Turkish vessels were destroyed; and the surrender to the Greeks of Nap'oli di Roma'nia, the ancient Nauplia, the port of Argos. By the destruction of the Island of Scio a paradise was changed into a scene of desolation, and more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand persons were killed or sold into slavery. Soon after, one hundred and fifty villages in southern Macedonia experienced the fate of Scio; and the pasha of Saloni'ca boasted that he had destroyed, in one day, fifteen hundred women and children. Goaded to desperation, rather than disheartened by their reverses and the remorseless cruelties of the Turks, the Greeks struggled bravely on, and during the year 1823 the results of the contest were generally in their favor....", "...cruisers and prizes of the pirates, one brig, a prize, and two armed schooners under the Carthagenian flag, both in the line of battle with the armed vessels of the pirates, and apparently with an intention to aid them in any resistance they might make against me, as their crews were at quarters, tompions out of their guns, and matches lighted. Colonel Ross (with seventy-five infantry) at the same time landed and took possession of their establishment on shore, consisting of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> houses of different sizes, badly constructed and thatched with palmetto leaves. \"When I perceived the enemy forming their vessels into a line of battle, I felt confident from their number, and very advantageous position, and their number of men, that they would have fought me.

This had lasted some time, when I thought that among all the noise I heard an irregular sound coming from the outside of the Palace. I have a very quick ear, and I was not slow in distinguishing the sound of a drum approaching and beating the charge; for in our days of civil disorder, everyone has learnt to know the language of these warlike instruments. I at once hurried to the door by which these new arrivals would enter. It was, in fact, a drum preceding some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> Gardes Mobiles. These lads pierced through the crowd with a certain air of resolution, although one could not clearly say at first what they proposed to do. Soon they disappeared from sight and remained as though submerged; but a short distance behind them marched a compact column of National Guards, who rushed into the House with significant shouts of \"Long live the National Assembly!\" I stuck my card of membership in my hat-band and entered with them. They first cleared the...", "...of it.

It adds greatly to one's interest in Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, Charlotte Bronte, Bulwer, James and George Eliot, to read them amidst the scenes where they lived and died. Thus in my leisure hours, after the fatigues of sight-seeing and visiting, I re-read many of these authors near the places where they spent their last days on earth. As I had visited Ambleside <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years before and seen Harriet Martineau in her prime, I did not go with Miss Anthony to Lake Windermere. She found the well-known house occupied by Mr. William Henry Hills, a liberal Quaker named after William Henry Channing.

It is farther obvious that the connection between nuisances and the public health was clearly apprehended. The sanitary doctrines of modern times were undreamt of; nor did the circumstances altogether call for them. The sewers of those days were banked-up watercourses, or shores, as the word was pronounced, which ran uncovered down the various declivities of the city to the town ditch and to the Thames. They would have sufficed to carry off the refuse of a population of some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or sixty thousand; they were, at all events, freely open to the greatest of all purifying agents, the oxygen of the air; and they poisoned neither the water of the town ditch (which abounds in excellent fish within John Stow's memory), nor the waters of Thames.'[192] This seems exactly to explain the sanitary condition of the city, and we must never forget that the streets were cleared by means of surface drainage, which carried the refuse of the city to the river, to find its...", "...with lovely sunshine, and only an enormous sullen ground sea. This is no uncommon game of Dame Nature's; she seemed to be only mocking at the destruction which she had wrought. Knowing that there must be many comrades in trouble, we were early away, and dancing like a bubble, we ran north, keeping as close inshore as we could, and watching the coast-line with our glasses. The coast was littered with remains. Forty-one vessels had been lost; in one uninhabited roadstead alone, some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles away from Indian Harbour, lay sixteen wrecks. The shore here was lined with rude shelters made from the wreckage of spars and sails, and the women were busy cooking meals and \"tidying up\" the shacks as if they had lived there always. We soon set to work hauling off such vessels as would float. One, a large hardwood, well-fastened hull, we determined to save. Her name was Pendragon. The owner was aboard--a young man with no experience who had never previously owned a...", "...and drinking go, they have been far better off than we are ourselves. Indeed, with the exception of captivity and light chains, the captives do not appear to have been ill-treated for many months. They have their separate houses, their servants, and anything they could buy with the supplies of money sent to them. A horrible business took place in Magdala on the very day before our arrival. Theodore had all the European captives out, and before their eyes put to death three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> prisoners, many of whom he had kept in chains for years. Among them were men, women, and little children. They were brought out chained, and thrown down on the ground, their heads fastened down to their feet.

Then, getting tired, he called out six of his musketeers, who continued to fire among the wretched crowd until all were despatched....", "...that suffered in this tempest; for next day, a signal of distress was made by the Anna pink, and on speaking her, we found she had broken her fore-stay and the gammon of her boltsprit, and was in no small danger of all her masts coming by the board; so that the whole squadron had to bear away to leeward till she made all fast, after which we again hauled upon a wind. After all our solicitude, and the numerous ills of every kind, to which we had been incessantly exposed for near <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days, we now had great consolation in the hope that our fatigues were drawing to a close, and that we should soon arrive in a more hospitable climate, where we should be amply rewarded for all our past toils and sufferings; for, towards the latter end of March, by our reckoning, we had advanced near ten degrees to the west of the westermost point of Terra del Fuego; and, as this allowance was double what former navigators had thought necessary to compensate the drift of the...", "...says I.

In those days it was regarded as having in it possibilities of vastly greater things than mere cheese-making. Its success among us had stirred up in men's minds big sanguine notions of...", "...by force. In three days, however, he came to himself, and immediately went and bowed his head to the ground in the midst of the monks, to show his repentance of the evil thought. As a sequel to this, he informed the monks of what had been in his mind, and desired them to make a regulation that from that day forth the king should not be allowed to enter the treasury and see what it contained, and that no bhikshu should enter it till after he had been in orders for a period of full <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. In the city there are many Vaisya elders and Sabaean merchants, whose houses are stately and beautiful. The lanes and passages are kept in good order. At the heads of the four principal streets there have been built preaching halls, where, on the eighth, fourteenth, and fifteenth days of the month, they spread carpets, and set forth a pulpit, while the monks and commonalty from all quarters come together to hear the Law.

And so the words that follow, and the angels ministered to Him, are to be taken in sequence, which is clear from the words of Matthew (4:11): \"Then the devil left Him,\" i.e. after the temptation, \"and behold angels came and ministered to Him.\" And as to the words inserted by Mark, \"and He was with the beasts,\" according to Chrysostom (Hom. xiii in Matth.), they are set down...", "...little time they joined; after which the water appeared to me to ascend out of the sea into the cloud, with great velocity.

By 1836, at thirty-three years of age, he stood in the front rank of that brilliant group where Grymes was still at his best. Before he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> he had been made attorney-general of the State. Punctuality, application, energy, temperance, probity, bounty, were the strong features of his character. It was a common thing for him to give his best services free in the cause of the weak against the strong.

Now, what achievements did he make? First, as to wealth: According to the census of 1900 he has <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> million dollars in church property, and twelve millions in school property. He has 140,000 farms, worth $750,000,000, and 170 million dollars in personal property. This is the result of thirty-six years of freedom. One noticeable feature is that the great bulk of his wealth has been accumulated in the South, where the large majority of the American Negroes live.

Yet, as Huxley pointed out long ago, his mind sufficed to pay the entire indemnity exacted from France after the...", "...and to be sure on this point, I went to the slopes between the Z'Muttgletscher and the Matterhorngletscher, above the chalets of Staffel, whence the face could be seen in profile. Its appearance from this direction would be amazing to one who had seen it only from the east. It looks so totally different from the apparently sheer and perfectly unclimbable cliff one sees from the Riffelberg that it is hard to believe the two slopes are one and the same thing. Its angle scarcely exceeds <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> degrees. A great step was made when this was learned. This knowledge alone would not, however, have caused me to try an ascent by the eastern face instead of by the south-west ridge. Forty degrees may not seem a formidable inclination to the reader, nor is it for only a small cliff. But it is very unusual to find so steep a gradient maintained continuously as the general angle of a great mountain-slope, and very few instances can be quoted from the High Alps of such an angle...", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

There is one text in Galatians (iii. 20), which, Christian writers inform us, has received no less than two hundred and forty interpretations at different times by different writers; that is, two hundred and forty guesses have been made at the meaning of this one text. \"Revelation\" is defined as \"the act of making known.\" But what is made known by a book, one text of which you have to guess two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> times at the meaning of, and then don't know whether it is right or not? And this is but a sample of many texts scattered through the Book, which have been overburdened with meanings in a similar manner in order to get a sufficient amount of science and sense into them to make them acceptable to the enlightened minds of the age.

He was a man of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of age, of medium stature, fair-complexioned, with broad shoulders and hips, with a bare head, and a glossy, happy, clean-shaven face.

Hearing all the unquestionable tributes to the beauty and value of this Walla Walla region, I could not but recall some of Chief Joseph's...", "...we had much communication together, the subject of what was termed in 1840 Cathedral Reform. My part was superficial, and was performed in the House of Commons. His was of a very different character. As a hearer, and a rapt hearer, I can say that Dr. Newman (p. 10) has not exaggerated the description of the speech which he delivered, as counsel for the Chapters (I think) before the House of Lords in 1840.[Footnote: See ch. xi. vol. i. p. 198.] I need not say that, during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years, I have heard many speeches, and many, too, in which I had reason to take interest, and yet never one which, by its solid as well as by its winning qualities, more powerfully impressed me.

Two men of company K, of the 17th Illinois Infantry, who knew me, heard what I said to the Captain, and, not liking very well to be captured, fell back a short distance to the rear of the squad, and watched the motion of things.

Antar was the father of knighthood. He was the champion of the weak and oppressed, the protector of the women, the impassioned lover-poet, the irresistible and magnanimous knight. \"Antar\" in its present form probably preceded the romances of chivalry so common in the twelfth century in Italy and France.[7] This national classic of the Arabian world is of great length in the original, being often found in thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> manuscript volumes in quarto, in seventy or eighty in octavo. Portions of it have been translated into English, German and French. English readers can consult it best in a translation from the Arabic by Terrick Hamilton in four volumes published in London in 1820. This translation, now rare, covers only a portion of the original; a new translation, suitably abridged, is much needed. The fact that its hero is of Negro blood may have chilled the ardor of English translators to meet...", "...growth. Elate silvestris and Borassus caudata of Loureiro were here common.

Through the darkness we could see lights in the direction of the shore, as if borne by human hands. With the dawn of day, our eyes were turned eagerly in that direction. Nor did we look in vain. The shore swarmed with human forms.

In a little time they came. Their canoes were some of them large enough to carry <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> warriors, though made from a single tree. They came to us in order of battle; a hundred boats, holding each from ten to fifty warriors. These carried spear and shield, huge lances, and well-curved bows, drawn with powerful sinews of the deer. Their arrows were long shafts of the feathery reed, such as flourish in all these forests. The feather from the eagle's wing gave it buoyancy, and the end of the shaft was barbed with a keen flint, wrought by art to an edge such as our best...", "...he would live and die for \"old George.\" Edinburgh was won, but the day's work was not yet over. As he left the parade-ground a despatch was put into his hand. It was from his friend Colonel Myers, the governor of Berwick. The key of the London road was of the first importance to Monk, and Myers declared he could not hold it against the numerous Anabaptist officers in his command. Monk immediately ordered a troop of horse to his assistance; but a new difficulty arose. Berwick was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles away. Not a trooper was in Edinburgh who had not ridden twenty that day. The roads were deep in mire, and every one declared the march impossible. It was a word Monk did not often listen to. The march must be made. The general appealed to Johnson as he only knew how, and as the night fell the captain and his troop were spurring for the Border through the Nether Bow Port. Monk's drastic proceedings at Edinburgh were but a type of what happened all over Scotland.

'O Commander of the Faithful,' replied the Vizier, 'am I inspector of murdered folk, that I should know who killed her?' The Khalif was enraged at his answer and commanded to hang him before his palace-gate and that proclamation should be made in the streets of Baghdad, 'Whoso hath a mind to witness the hanging of Jaafer the Barmecide, Vizier of the Khalif, and of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> of his kin, before the gate of the Khalif's palace, let him come out to see!' So the people came out from all quarters to witness the execution of Jaafer and his kinsmen, not knowing the reason. Then they set up the gallows and made Jaafer and the others stand underneath in readiness; but whilst they awaited the Khalif's signal for the execution and the people wept for Jaafer and his kinsmen, behold, a handsome and well-dressed young man, with shining face and bright black eyes,...", "...I went to some women grouped at a little distance, and we had no trouble as long as we were there.

The complete edition of Madame Guyon's works, including the autobiography and five volumes of letters, runs to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> volumes (1767-1791); the most important works are published separately, _Opuscules spirituels_ (2 vols., Paris, 1790). They have been several times translated into English. See also the literature of the article on QUIETISM; and H. Delacroix, _Etudes sur le mysticisme_ (Paris, 1908). (St C.)

Two men went up to him and crossed their hands under his chest to raise him. His blood was gushing out and forming a pool on the floor. As we dashed out into the road I saw an artilleryman standing alone on the cobbles and looking around in a scared fashion. There was another deafening explosion and dense clouds of smoke issued from a building <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or fifty yards away. Suddenly the artilleryman clutched his face with his hand. The blood began to stream through his fingers and down his wrist into his sleeve. He hurried away with staggering steps. We left the town behind us and waited near a barn in the open fields.

They were some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> in number, and varied in age from the little fags of the Under School, ten or twelve years old, to brawny muscular young fellows of seventeen or eighteen, senior Queen's Scholars, or Sixth Form town boys.

Indeed, obstruction is now seldom seen; I have more than once had the curiosity to count, and cause to be counted, all the _private_ carriages in waiting at the grand French opera, on a night when the boxes were filled with the most fashionable company. Neither I nor my _valet de place_ could ever reckon more than from <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> to fifty; whereas, formerly, it was not uncommon to see here between two and three hundred; and the noise of so many equipages rattling through the streets, from each of the principal theatres, sufficiently indicated that the performance was ended.

CHARLES CALL, DAUGHTER OF EDWARD TRELAWNY, BYRON'S COMPANION IN GREECE, I DEDICATE THIS WORK AS A MARK OF AFFECTION AND ESTEEM PREFACE This book has no pretensions; it is merely a record of events and impressions which nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of close study have accumulated. There seems to be a general agreement that the closing scenes of Byron's short life have not been adequately depicted by his biographers. From the time of Byron's departure from Ravenna, in the autumn of 1821, his disposition and conduct underwent a transformation so complete that it would have been difficult to recognize, in the genial, unselfish personality who played so effective a role at Missolonghi, the gloomy misanthrope of 1811, or...", "...resolve that they will be farmers, as that is a labor with which they are acquainted.

The second one says, 'I will put in twenty acres. I can care for that amount and not work very hard; and I want to forge ahead a little.' The third one says, 'Boys, I want to make all that I can while I am young and strong. I am going to plant <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> acres.' \"Now, we will suppose that they keep up their fences, and properly care for the crops. When the harvest comes, which man receives the greatest reward? You will all answer, 'The man who planted the forty acres.'

At one time he had between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> and fifty of them locked up in Gloucester Castle, among them Roberts and his sons, on the charge of attending conventicles.

There were also some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> congresses held in smaller halls for speakers who could not find room on the great platforms. One of these meetings was held by Jewesses, of whom nineteen spoke. Some of them were also heard from the platform of the Parliament; as were many clergy women.

They settle into a more solid mass than large bulbs, and if too deep they are liable to start into growth. This should be carefully guarded against. Small quantities of bulbs may be stored in half-bushel baskets, from two to four inches deep, according to size, and hung up in the cellar. Bulblets may be packed in boxes or barrels...", "...driven where he did not mean to go. He blamed Harding for this, and thought it was time he put a stop to the fellow's encroachments.

But, as Mars takes about forty minutes longer to turn than the Earth, such confronting occurs later and later each night by about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> minutes, until finally it does not occur at all while Mars is suitably above the horizon; then the feature passes from sight to remain hidden till the difference of the rotations brings it round into view again.

Two boats soon appeared with wreaths upon their prows, and these had won the first and second prizes at the last year's _regatta_. The private gondolas fell away from the middle of the canal, and left them free space for a trial of their speed. They were the most airy things I ever saw afloat, about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet long, and as slender and light as they could well be, and hold together. Each boat had six oars, and the crews stood with their faces to the beak of their craft; slight, but muscular men, and with a skill and quickness at their oars which I had never conceived.

A few of them only understood Arabic; but none of them write or read it. Being of the lower orders of society, and educated only in convents, they are extremely ignorant. Few of them read even the modern Greek fluently, excepting in their prayer-books, and I found but one who had any notion of the ancient Greek. They have a good library, but it is always shut up; it contains about fifteen hundred Greek volumes, and seven hundred Arabic manuscripts; the latter, which I...", "...would readily sell at fifteen cents in the orchard.

La Salle fulfilled all the conditions upon which he had received the seigneury at Fort Frontenac, and found financial profit in maintaining the post.

But for La Salle this was not enough. He was a pathfinder, not a trader. Returning to France after two years of labour and success at Fort Frontenac, he secured a royal patent authorizing him to explore the whole continent from the Great Lakes to Mexico, with the right to build forts therein and to enjoy a monopoly of the trade in buffalo skins. The expenses of the undertaking were, of course, to be borne by La Salle and his associates, for the king never invested money...", "...check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.

To an Englishman familiar with the strawberry and its growth, one knowing the botanical character of the plant and the love of its roots for a rich clay land, it seems surprising that it should flourish so well in the sandy soil of Egypt. But, of course, this is explained by the yearly deposit of rich silt, or warp, the result of the annual floods.

I have already mentioned, that, in the progress of revision, I had probably written the book, not twice, but twenty times over; and this I believe to be true. I had grown too fastidious, over-anxious, nervous, and fidgety. I could not endure the coming together of the same or similar sounds,--_d_s and _t_s, for example, or _v_s and _f_s,--and wrote some pages or paragraphs at least <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or fifty times over to prevent this, and thereby sacrificed all freedom and naturalness. When Mr. Blackwood wrote me, therefore, as follows, it only served to confirm me in my evil habit,--a disease, in fact,--and the result was further alterations and corrections, so numerous and so troublesome, though trivial in themselves, that, in going through the press, the printer himself, Mr. Spottiswood, got alarmed, and charged accordingly.

Much of the picturesque quality of the city is owing to its irregularity and the remains of its past. Wren rebuilt no less than sixty churches, all showing great variety of design.

They had some of Woden's own strength and were armed with helmet and shield and spear. Like Woden, they rode unseen through the air and their horses were almost as swift as Sleipnir himself. They swiftly carried Woden's favorite warriors to Valhalla, the hall of the slain. The walls of Valhalla were hung with shields; its ceiling glittered with polished spearheads. From its five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> gates, each wide enough for eight hundred men abreast to march through, the warriors rushed every morning to fight a battle that lasted till nightfall and began again at the break of each day.

There was no question of ratifying the opinion of Parisian critics: those Southerners formed and delivered an opinion of their own. In other words, the defiance of conventions was an artistic victory, a decentralizing success. Then it was that the Felibres--the poets of Languedoc and of Provence who for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years have been combating the Parisian attempt to focus in Paris the whole of France--perceived how the Orange theatre could be made to advance their anti-centralizing principles, and so took a hand in its fortunes: with the avowed intention of establishing outside of Paris a national theatre wherein should be given in summer dramatic festivals of the highest class.

Another device to prevent others from establishing settlement in a parish was for its farmers to hire laborers for only fifty-one weeks. Also, some apprentices were bound by means other than indenture to avoid settlement. Laborers who came to work in industries were refused settlement and sent back to their original parishes whenever they seemed likely to become dependent on the rates. Statutes then provided that a parish must give settlement to apprentices bound for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days there, not only by indenture, but by deed, writings, or contracts not indented. In 1722, parishes were authorized to purchase houses in which to lodge or employ the poor and to contract with any person for the lodging, keeping, maintaining, and employing of the poor. These persons could take the benefit of the work, labor, and service of these poor, which would then be used for the relief of other poor. The poor refusing such lodging could not then get relief.

It is a glade of circular shape, with a colossal tree standing in its centre,--a live-oak with trunk full <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> feet in girth, and branches spreading like a banyan. Though an evergreen, but little of its own foliage can be seen, only here and there a parcel of leaves at the extremity of a protruding twig; all the rest, great limbs and lesser branches, shrouded under Spanish moss, this in the moonlight showing white as flax.

I gave the order to move at sunrise the next morning. The entire neighbourhood was deserted, and during our five hours' march to Bir Delwei we met no one.

Four mountain peaks were then in sight to the eastward, at an estimated distance of between <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> and fifty miles. By the time that the ship was moored luncheon was on the table; and at the conclusion of the meal Sir Reginald Elphinstone, Colonel Lethbridge, the professor, and Colonel Sziszkinski took their rifles and left the ship upon what they termed a preliminary exploration of the forest in their immediate vicinity.

She was also glad that Bessie, who was now old enough to understand deep spiritual truths for herself, was in perfect harmony and fellowship with her. About <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> souls were saved in the meetings; some gained the experience of sanctification; and the Spirit of the Lord worked mightily upon the hearts of many others.

The house of the forest of Lebanon was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> cubits longer than was the temple at Jerusalem, to show that the church in the wilderness would increase more, and be far larger than she that had peace and prosperity.

But I can't write much more to-day; so I shall merely tell you what part of the play set me thinking of all this, and leave you to consider of it yourself, till I can send you another letter. The pantomime was, as I said, 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.' The forty thieves were girls. The forty thieves had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> companions, who were girls. The forty thieves and their forty companions were in some way mixed up with about four hundred and forty fairies, who were girls. There was an Oxford and Cambridge boat-race, in which the Oxford and Cambridge men were girls. There was a transformation scene, with a forest, in which the flowers were girls, and a chandelier, in which the lamps were girls, and a great rainbow which was all of girls. 23.

Probably the most enlightened woman in all this period was the nun Florentina, sister of Bishop Leander of Seville, who was far-famed for her good works. At the time of her death in 603, she had risen to such distinction on account of her character and her ability that she was made the general director of a system of over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> convents, which were under her continual inspection and control. Such, in brief, is her story; further details are wanting, but even this is enough to impress us with the fact that she must have been a great woman and representative of all that was good and noble in her day.

Yet Tip's father was old John Scammon, the highly respected janitor at the High School, where he had served for some <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. \"I say, fellows, I wonder if we can let Tip go---now that we know the whole story?\" breathed Dick. \"Say, I'll make it worth yer while,\" proposed Tip, eagerly. \"How about the law?\" asked Dave Darrin, seriously. \"Have we any right to let the fellow go, when we know he has committed a serious crime?\" \"I don't know,\" replied Prescott. \"All I'm thinking of is good, honest old John Scammon.\" \"It'd break me old man's heart---sure it would,\" put in Tip, cunningly....", "...the lives of young Englishmen of the present generation. It is not too much to say that among large sections of the students at our Universities, and at a time when intellectual ambition ought to be most strong and when the acquisition of knowledge is most important, proficiency in cricket or boating or football is more prized than any intellectual achievement. I have heard a good judge, who had long been associated with English University life, express his opinion that during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> or fifty years the relative intellectual position of the upper and middle classes in England has been materially changed, owing to the disproportioned place which outdoor amusements have assumed in the lives of the former. It is the impression of very competent judges that a genuine love, reverence and enthusiasm for intellectual things is less common among the young men of the present day than it was in the days of their fathers. The predominance of the critical spirit which...", "...set up such a plea? or where, except in countries doomed to eternal barbarism, are patients labouring under consumption avoided now, as they were in several parts of the world at one time, just as if they laboured under plague, and all for the simpleton's reason that the disease _often runs through families_?

The union of the journalist and the parliamentary spirit produced, however, in Paul Louis Courier a master of style. Courier spent the greater part of his life, tragically cut short, in translating the classics and studying the older writers of France, in which study he learnt thoroughly to despise the pseudo-classicism of the 18th century. It was not till he was past <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> that he took to political writing, and the style of his pamphlets, and their wonderful irony and vigour, at once placed them on the level of the very best things of the kind. Along with Courier should be mentioned Benjamin Constant (1767-1830), who, though partly a romance writer and partly a philosophical author, was mainly a politician and an orator, besides being fertile in articles and pamphlets.

At the end, then, of the year 1660, the insurgents of Pangasinan elected as their leader an Indian chief of the village of Binalatongan, one Don Andres Malong. He having usurped the title of king, went to Campana, escorted by nine thousand Indian warriors. This number was increased enormously within a few days; for it was either a boast of the rebels and they so published it, or it was a fact, his army was composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> thousand men. An Indian noble, by the name of Don Francisco Sumulay, a very near relative of Malong, was living in Bolinao, a village within our administration. On account of that relationship he looked upon his progress as his own, and helped him as much as he could to attain his purposes. He, in order to incite Bolinao and its environs to revolt, spared no effort that he considered fitting. But the father prior, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios (or Blancas), opposed him openly and...", "...statements directly based upon Scripture. We have mentioned that the Scriptures supposed to indicate the third day, do not really apply to the Messiah at all, but this does not affect the question before us. Now believing this epoch to be defined in prophecy, this is precisely one of those points upon which memory would, in the lapse of time, be most likely to adjust itself to the prophecy. We will assume that Jesus was not \"seen\" before the third day. It is obvious that if he was seen <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> days after, it might be affirmed that he had been actually raised long before, on the third day. The vision occurring on the third day itself, even, could not prove that he had not \"risen\" before. There is, in fact, no way that we can see of fixing the third day except the statement ol \"Scripture,\" and, the moment we accept that, we must recognize the force of dogmatic influence.(2) The fact that the third day has from early 2 We do not go into any argument based on the...", "...art--fine metal-work of all kinds. The exquisite skill of the ancient Irish brasiers is best proved by the articles they made, of which hundreds are preserved in our museums.

While this ridiculous exchange of signals was going on it had gradually become dark, so that it really was difficult now to read the signals. The _Bluebell_ noticed this, for we now saw a man with a huge megaphone preparing to shout something to us from the bridge. In order to forestall him, I shouted, 'Shall I let down a ladder for your prize crew?' Instead of answering my question, the _Bluebell_ sheered off about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> yards from us, and her officers showed us by all sorts of pantomime that they had no intention of sending a boat. My very friendly invitation had failed. If we had only known what a mysterious ship we were supposed to be, the armament and U-boat escort that we were credited with, many things would have been more intelligible to us. As I read to-day the English papers of those days, I come upon the most incredible reports in regard to our little _Aud_.

There was that in the room which suggested education and refinement. A telephone was on the desk, and loose papers partly written upon bore evidence that the detective had been busy at work when I arrived. At a motion from my host I seated myself in one of the large arm chairs facing him, while he remained standing. I saw that he was a man about thirty-eight or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years old, straight as an arrow and splendidly proportioned. He was dressed in a well-fitting gray suit. The light was from above, and Oakes's face showed well--the clear-cut nose and generous mouth of the energetic American. He looked at me critically with deep-set, steady blue eyes, then smiled slightly in a well-controlled, dignified manner. \"Mr. Stone, I am very glad that you were able to come tonight.

Baltimore was then a thriving fishing centre, but it has never recovered from this raid. The south coast of Ireland and the Bristol Channel seem to have been a favourite hunting-ground at this period. Murad had already been harrying the English coast before he carried out his coup at Baltimore. The year before the \"Turks\" had taken six ships _near Bristol_, and had something like <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> ships operating in English waters. But the Government of King Charles was so feeble and so incompetent that even the Sack of Baltimore failed to rouse it to the necessary action. The navy was willing enough to deal with the pirates, but it was in a very poor way itself, its men robbed, starved, and stinted, its ships and many of their commanders anything but efficient. It is even stated that two of the King's ships lying at Kinsale had word of Murad Reis's attack, but did not...", "...and a better price might be bid for them. From such reasoning, or perhaps from accidental circumstances, Jeffreys associated himself with the popular leaders, and in the hour of revelry would drink on his knees any toasts to \"the good old cause,\" and to \"the immortal memory of old Noll.\" He was often put to great shifts from the embarrassed state of his finances, the ten pounds for \"decent clothing\" for a year being expended in a single suit of cut velvet, and his grandmother's <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pounds being insufficient to pay his tavern bills. But he displayed much address in obtaining prolonged and increased credit from his tradesmen. He borrowed adroitly; and it is said that such an impression was made by his opening talents, that several wealthy men on the popular side voluntarily made him presents of money, in the hope of the important services they were speedily to receive from his support.

Conway told me this about the 'gentry':--'John Conway, my husband, who was a pilot by profession, in watching for in-coming ships used to go up on the high hill among the Fairy Hills; and there he often saw the _gentry_ going down the hill to the strand. One night in particular he recognized them as men and women of the _gentry_; and they were as big as any living people. It was late at night about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years ago.' _Ghosts and Fairies._--When first I introduced myself to Owen Conway, in his bachelor quarters, a cosy cottage at Upper Rosses Point, he said that Mr. W. B. Yeats and other men famous in Irish literature had visited him to hear about the fairies, and that though he knew very little about the fairies he nevertheless always likes to talk of them. Then Owen began to tell me about a man's ghost which both he and Bran Reggan had seen at different times on the road to...", "...shoulders of the boys with no kind results.

All new regiments were similarly afflicted. Experience, however, taught in the army as at home. Col. Brown, it is meet to record, was thoroughly disgusted with this first march of his men on a complete war-footing. Yet he was blameable. He should have known that <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> pounds of regulation outfit was a full load, and that thirty pounds of additional weight in albums, revolvers and gim-cracks handicapped his heroes on the road. Even without sacrificing those stores of novelties, if the colonel had moved slowly, halting frequently and resting his men, he would have saved himself great humiliation. But he was getting schooled, learning something that he had overlooked or forgotten, at every public exhibition of his knowledge. He had called the men...", "...of objects when seen by this species of firework. In the present instance it was held aloft on a boat-hook, and cast a strong spectral light on the band of lawless ruffians, who were so crowded together that they entirely filled the boats, no part of which could be seen.

I don't pretend to know much about international affairs but one thing you can put down as settled is that Germany will be a Hohenzollern empire for the next <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years.

This surgical operation has been inflicted upon thousands of texts; and so frequently and so generally has this expedient been adopted by churches to get rid of the errors of the \"Holy Book,\" that the meaning of some texts has been changed hundreds of times. There is one text in Galatians (iii. 20), which, Christian writers inform us, has received no less than two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> interpretations at different times by different writers; that is, two hundred and forty guesses have been made at the meaning of this one text. \"Revelation\" is defined as \"the act of making known.\" But what is made known by a book, one text of which you have to guess two hundred and forty times at the meaning of, and then don't know whether it is right or not?

The public should distinguish between a rise in prices and profiteering, for with increasing prices to the farmer--who is himself paying higher wages and cost--and with higher wages and transport, prices simply must rise. An example of what this may come to can be shown in the matter of flour. The increased cost of transportation from the wheat-producing regions to New York City amounts to about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> cents per barrel. The increased cost of cotton bags during the last fourteen months amounts to thirty cents per barrel of flour. The increase in wholesalers' costs of drayage, rents, etc., amounts to ten cents, or a total of eighty cents without including the increased costs of the miller or retailer. Such changes do not come under the category of profiteering. They are the necessary changes involved by the economic differences in the situation.

We can now look out to sea toward the Pacific Ocean; but a short journey plunges us into one of the many passages ahead of us, the smallest, or one nearest the mainland, being taken, called Fitzhugh Sound. It was named in 1786 by Captain Hanna, is about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> miles long, and with a width of about three miles. The first island to our left on entering is Calvert Island. About ten miles from its southern cape is an indentation in the island, called Safety Cove or Port Safety, probably a mile deep. It was while delayed in this picturesque little harbor, in 1885, that Mr. Charles Hallock, the well-known author on piscatorial pursuits, penned the following lines, descriptive of the inland passage, which we find in the _American Angler_ of...", "...fate, the future life in Hades--though largely due to his turn of mind and temperament, was doubtless connected with the place where his childhood was passed. Eleusis was the centre of the most famous worship of Demeter, with its processions, its ceremonies, its mysteries, its impressive spectacles and nocturnal rites; and these were intimately connected with the Greek beliefs about the human soul, and the underworld. His dramatic career began early, and was continued for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. In 499, his 26th year, he first exhibited at Athens; and his last work, acted during his lifetime at Athens, was the trilogy of the Oresteia, exhibited in 458. The total number of his plays is stated by Suidas to have been ninety; and the seven extant plays, with the dramas named or nameable which survive only in fragments, amount to over eighty, so that Suidas' figure is probably based on reliable tradition.

The real genius displayed in the designs could only be born of one inspired by a true love of art, together with a devoutly religious spirit. The excellence of the designs and the naturalness of the army of figures challenge both surprise and admiration.

The whole was the patient work of one prolific artist, Mattia Preti, an accomplished and enthusiastic Calabrian, who spent <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years of his life in the special adornment of the church of St. John, refusing, it is said, all pecuniary remuneration for the same. He was quite content to live frugally, exercising strict self-denial, that he might thus exemplify his art and his religious devotion. Preti studied the rudiments of his chosen calling with his brother, who was director of the Academy of St. Luke, at Rome, and brought with him to Malta not only ability and experience, but a devout love of art for...", "...with ours.\" A bottle, containing an account of this deplorable accident, was buried at the foot of the monument. The Port des Francais, which is situated in 58 degrees 37 minutes N. lat., and 139 degrees 50 minutes W. long., presents many advantages, but also many inconveniences--foremost amongst them the currents of the channel. The climate is much milder than in Hudson's Bay, which is in the same latitude. The vegetation is vigorous; pines six feet in girth, and a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> in height, are not rare. Celery, sorrel, lupine, wild pea, chicory, and mimulus are met with in every direction, as well as many pot-herbs, the use of which helped to keep the crews in health. The sea supplied abundance of salmon, trout, cod, and plaice. In the woods are found black and brown bears, the lynx, ermine, weasel, minever, squirrel, marmot, beaver, fox, elk, and the wild goat.

He spent the afternoon vigorously, walking miles through streets, exploring here and there, seeing the sights all new to him. He was growing just a bit weary, and very hungry, and was thinking of returning to the hotel for supper, when he emerged from a side street upon a street that ran along the water front. A sight that made his pulses beat faster met his eyes. Almost at his feet, a little more than the width of the street away, lay a fleet of some thirty or <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> fishermen, snuggled all in together, close to a large float that intervened between them and the wharf. Himself a good sailor of bay craft, and fond of the water, the picturesqueness of these boats attracted Harvey greatly. They were of an odd type, for the most part, unlike anything he had ever seen in Maine waters, or anywhere else. They were long, shallow, light draft fellows, with no bulwarks; so that as they lay, broadside to the float, one might walk across from one to...", "...have been wrong to expose you to the chance of having a consumptive husband.

He was the tenant, I found, of the old manor-house, which he held at a ridiculous rent, and he had lived here nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">forty</span> years. He had found the place as a young man, wandering about in search of the picturesque. I gathered that he had bright dreams and wide ambitions. He had a small independence, and he had meant to paint great pictures and make a name for himself.
