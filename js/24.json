In order to effect this, the watch from four to eight P.M. is divided into two half-watches, one from four to six, and the other from six to eight. By this means they divide the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours into seven watches instead of six, and thus shift the hours every night.

For one thing, Shakespeare's life was not confined to Stratford. His professional career was spent in London, and those, who strictly insist that memorials to great men should be erected only in places with which they were personally associated, can hardly deny that London shares with Stratford a title to a memorial from a biographical or historical point of view. Of Shakespeare's life of fifty-two years, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years were in all probability spent in London. During those years the work that makes him memorable was done. It was in London that the fame which is universally acknowledged was won. Some valuable details regarding Shakespeare's life in London are accessible.

There is evidence that during the early part of his London career he lived in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, and during the later part...", "...and effort.\" Waldo Edgar's eyes brightened. \"You're going to do, my boy.

From his earliest years he was passionately fond of stories of travel, and the older he grew the more cramped he felt in the civilization of Europe; like the mettled mustang of the vast prairies of America, he longed for the immensity of unknown plains, for the imposing majesty of forests which the foot of man had not yet trod. Maturity and reason gave a more definite aim to these aspirations; at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> he came to New France to try his fortune. He entered into relations with different Indian tribes, and the extent of his commerce led him to establish a trading-post opposite the Sault St. Louis.

As to what regards Lucius Scipio, I suspect some mistake of the transcriber, rather than a falsehood of the historian, respecting the amount of the gold and silver. For it is more probable that the weight of silver was greater than that of gold, and that the fine was laid at four millions,[37] than at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> millions of sesterces,[38] the more on this account, as they record that an account of that sum was demanded from Publius Scipio himself, in the senate; and that when he had desired his brother Lucius to bring the book of his accounts, he tore it to pieces in the view of the senate, at the same time expressing indignation at being called to account for four millions after he had brought two hundred millions[39] into the treasury.

This was the only accident we met with, however; the gale blew out in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours and the wind having settled light from the southward, we were compelled to make out our log for four or five days at least. So we made all sail, and boarded our tacks, standing off and on.

At last, when I opened my eyes, daylight was streaming down on me through the open hatchway. The doctor came and felt my pulse.

This would naturally be considerable as I could not reckon on doing more than an average of eight to twelve miles every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, as it was only safe to march by night and the hours of darkness at that time of the year were only about five and a half. Although the actual distance was a hundred and forty-five miles, allowances to be made for detours and an indirect line, as well as for delays occasioned by such large obstacles as broad rivers and smaller, but more formidable ones in the shape of German guards, would necessitate preparations for a greater distance. The food required would have...", "...whose hut was near the end of the bridge across the river, and for which murder Prettyboy was hanged in Melbourne.

Ambassadors from the Duke of Savoy and the King of Denmark appeared in support of the propositions and demands of Charles V. The diet did not separate until it had voted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> thousand foot and four thousand horse to be employed against France, and had forbidden Germans, under severe penalties, to take service with Francis I. In 1544 the war thus became almost European, and in the early days of April two armies were concentrated in Piedmont, near the little town of Ceresole, the Spanish twenty thousand strong and the French nineteen thousand; the former under the orders of the Marquis del Guasto, the latter under those of the Count d'Enghien;...", "...of an hour, or our machine will never reach town on time.\" I hurried with Elizabeth to her apartment, where we woke and dressed two very astonished children, while the little maid literally threw the toilet necessities and a few clothes into a huge Gladstone bag. \"Leon evidently doesn't think us safe down here!

It is impossible to urge too strongly the importance of saving, at regular intervals, all the urine passed in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, of protecting it from decomposition, and of sending a sample to the physician. The intervals may be longer at first, for the kidneys have very little extra work to do until the sixth month.

Wellington had calculated that he should require <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> days, but the uncertainties were great, for besides the prospect of Marmont coming to its relief, there was always the risk that heavy rain might raise the river Agueda in flood prematurely, which would have stopped the siege by intercepting communication across it.

This consisted of synovial fluid admixed with a varying proportion of blood. The degree of synovitis was apt to vary with the amount of force expended in the production of the injury; for this reason both high velocity and irregular impact were of importance in this relation. The constant feature, however, depended on the effusion of blood; this was not rapid, or, as a rule, very abundant, but tended to increase during the first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours.

At first elastic and resilient, it slowly decreased in volume with the assumption of a soft doughy character on palpation.

This time we got specimens of the sea-bed from about 4,500 metres (about 2,500 fathoms); but the heaving in and taking of water samples and temperatures occupied eight hours, from 7 a.m. till 3 p.m., or a third part of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. In this way we should want at least nine months on the route that had been laid down; but as, unfortunately, this time was not at our disposal, we at once gave up taking specimens of the bottom and samples of water at greater depths than 1,000 metres (546 fathoms). For the remainder of the trip we took temperatures and samples of water at the following depths: 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, and 1,000 metres (0, 2 3/4, 5 1/2, 13 1/2, 27,...", "...consikence was a sudden an' extraor'nary increase in the conwictions for arson, followed by a remarkable decrease in the number o' fires!

We remained five months at this harbour, occupied in building the fort, and in loading our ships with Brazil-wood; our stay being protracted by the small number of our hands and the magnitude of our labour, so that we only made slow progress. Having finished our labours, we determined on returning to Portugal, for which we required a wind that would allow us to hold a N.N.E. course.

I was attracted by a notice, that the English newspapers were taken in at the Cabinet Litteraire of M.

After charging me with sundry violations of the neutrality of Brazil, it ordered me to depart the island, within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. Instead of sending a ship of war, to examine into the facts, and enforce his order, if necessary, the President had been satisfied to send this paper bullet after me.

But the dark cells are another story altogether, and their existence can no more be denied successfully than that of the prison itself. A man named H.B.

Often they were thus chained up during the day, but at night the chain attached to the frame of the door was loosened; the other chain was attached to a vertical rod, the ring sliding up and down, so that the man was able to lie on the bare cement floor. There were no cots. The food was generally one slice of bread and a cup of water a day, sometimes two or three.

Yet these are the people whom Mr. Storrs Turner would put in the same category as the savages of Africa? Well, then, is it likely that a people so abstemious in respect of spirit drinking would indulge to excess in opium, especially if the drug has the intoxicating and destructive qualities ascribed to it by the missionaries? The Chinese, I have also said, are a very frugal people. Six dollars, or about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> shillings of our money, per month are considered splendid wages by a coolie. On two dollars a month he can live comfortably. He sends, perhaps, every month, one or two dollars to his parents or wife in his native village; for generally a Chinaman, be he never so poor, has a wife, it being there a duty, if not an article of religion, for the males, to marry young. The remainder they hoard for a rainy day. Now, I say again, if the Chinese are such abstemious and frugal...", "...garrisoned by infantry and artillery.

The site of the city is a diversified surface, with the river whose name it bears winding gracefully through it, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> miles from its mouth; though in a direct line it would be but half that distance to where it empties into Moreton Bay, one of the largest on the coast of Australia. It was discovered by Captain Cook in 1770, and is formed by two long sandy islands running north and south, named respectively Standbroke and Moreton Islands, enclosing between them and the mainland a spacious sheet of water more than thirty miles long and six or eight wide, beautified by fertile islands.

It has already been told how I was married at the home of my brother in Wilhelmshaven to my boyhood sweetheart, Miss Prete of Hamburg, on Aug. 16. Before that I had been steadily on duty with my boat, and I had to leave again the next day after my marriage. But both my bride and I wanted the ceremony to take place at the appointed time, and it did, although within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours thereafter I had to go away on a venture that gave a good chance of making my new wife a widow. But she was as firm as I was that my first duty was to answer the call of our country, and she waved me away from the dock with good-luck wishes.

For though they had a multiplicity of difficulties to struggle with, what above all things utterly consumed their vigour was the want of sleep, as the Romans, having plenty of men, relieved each other regularly in their posts; while among the Aetolians, their numbers being small, the same persons had their strength consumed by unremitting labour night and day. During a space of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> days, without any time being unemployed in the conflict, their toil was kept up against the attacks carried on by the enemy in four different quarters at once. When the consul, from computing the time, and from the reports of deserters, judged that the Aetolians were thoroughly fatigued, he adopted the following plan:--At midnight he gave the signal of retreat, and drawing off all his men at once from the assault, kept them quiet in the camp until the third hour of the next...", "...and hear again sounds which occurred, or feel again movements which you performed?

It may be impossible to conceive, without actual experience, the singular effect opium has upon the system in making itself a necessity. Being no physician, I am unable to give a technical description of that effect, but, with the reader's indulgence, I shall try, however, to describe it in my own language. When opium is not taken by the _habitue_ for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, his whole body commences to sag, droop, and become unjointed. The result is precisely like taking the starch out of a well-done-up shirt. The man is as limp as a dish-rag, and as lifeless. He perspires all over,--feels wet and disagreeable. To take opium now is to brace the man right up; it tightens him up like the closing of a draw-string. Such is the effect in the internal man, and it pervades thence the entire system.

Her conservative parents would not allow her to continue her studies away from home, and in order to obtain her freedom, she married early and went abroad to study her favorite subject. For two years she attended lectures on mathematical subjects in Heidelberg, studied in Berlin under Weierstrass, and, in 1874, at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age, took her doctor's degree at Gottingen. Seven years later, Madame Kovalevskaya was elected a member of the Moscow mathematical society.

Accordingly, having settled everything at home, and appointed governors to each province, he set out with an army of six hundred thousand foot, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> thousand horse, and twenty-seven thousand armed chariots. With these he invaded the Ethiopians to the south; whom he defeated, and made tributaries to Egypt. He then built a fleet of ships upon the Red sea: and he is recorded as the first person who constructed vessels fit for distant navigation.

The reading concluded, the king presented a paper to the deputies, which he first read to them in the clear and commanding tones of a monarch upon his throne, demanding a respite of three days, in order to prepare to appear before God; also permission to see his family, and to converse with a priest. The Convention, angry at these requests, informed the king that he might see any priest he pleased, and that he might see his family, but that the execution must take place in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours from the time of the sentence.

But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt and oblivion; the vast silence of the palace was disturbed only by the cattle and poultry of the neighborhood, [101] which roved with impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced allowance of ten thousand pieces of gold [11] was all that he could ask, and more than he could hope.

The House of Peers takes its origin from the body of lords and barons who were summoned to the king's councils in olden times. Besides the peers who sit in the House of Lords by right, and who are distinguished as the lords temporal, there are twenty-six other lords who also form a part of this body, and who are known as the lords spiritual. These are the two English archbishops and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> bishops. The House of Commons is composed entirely of men who are elected by the vote of the people. There are no restrictions whatever of birth, education, or religion. Any freeman who is elected can sit in the House.

He also obtained antimony from an old woman, aged 80, who twelve hours before had taken .6 grm. (9-1/4 grains)--a large dose, which had neither produced vomiting nor purging.

The escape from civilian clothes was, at that era, one of the prime lures to enlistment. I had attempted to escape before, and failed. Now at last I had found a branch of the army which would accept me. It needed my services instantly. I was to start work at once. Nothing better. I was ready. This was what I had been seeking for months past. But--I confess it--I had always pictured myself dressed as a soldier. The postponement of this bright vision for even <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, now that it had seemed to be within my grasp, was damping. However--! The Sergeant-Major had told me that I was to go on duty as orderly in Ward W--an officers' ward--at 2 p.m. prompt. I did not know where Ward W was; I did not know what a ward-orderly's functions should amount to. And I had no uniform. I was attired in a light grey lounge suit--appropriate enough to my normal habit, but quite too flippant, I was certain, for a ward-orderly. Whatever else a...", "...his house!

Then, there was the abortive sortie of the Port Arthur fleet, three days after the destruction of the _Kasanumi_. True, the ships were only at sea for about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, and did nothing, narrowly escaping capture only by Togo's over-eagerness to engage them, thus discovering himself to the Russians in time to allow the latter to make good their retreat back to Port Arthur; but, all the same, I felt that I was losing much in not being present.

Nor is the identification of Jeremiah's family with that of the ruling high priest helped by the observation that the father of the high priest was named Shallum (1 Chron. v. 39), and that the prophet had an uncle of this name (Jer. xxxii. 7). The names Hilkiah[3] and Shallum are too common to justify any conclusions from such data. If the prophet's father was head of one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> classes or guilds of the priests, that might explain the influence which Jeremiah could exercise with some of the grandees of the court. But we are not told more than that Jeremiah ben Hilkiah was a member of the priestly community settled at Anathoth. It is, however, a gratuitous disparagement of one of the greatest names in Israel's history, to suggest that, had Jeremiah belonged to the highest ranks of his caste, he would not have been equal to the self-renunciation...", "...man in society and politics, not a dauber and a mason; but when he found that young Michael was determined to be an artist or nothing he gave way, though most ungraciously. He would not say that he consented to place his son with Ghirlandajo; he would not admit that the study of art was study, or the studio of an artist anything but a shop. He said to the artist: \"I give up my son to you. He shall be your apprentice or your servant, as you please, for three years, and you must pay me <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> florins for his services.\" In spite of the insulting words and the insulting terms, Michael Angelo consented thus to be hired out as a servant to the artist, who should have been paid by his father for teaching him.

His fellow-pupils were jealous of his ability, and ill-treated him constantly, one of them going so far as to break...", "...gave signs of comfort and taste.

Not even Tahiti had drawn him to it. Since he arrived, at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years, he had dwelt contentedly in Oomoa.

If this happens, there is increase of pain which may be followed by numbness of the limb and, what is still more significant, coldness and blueness of the extremities below the bandage, particularly of the fingers and toes. In such cases the bandage must be removed and reapplied with less force. If the ankle or knee be sprained the patient must go to bed for at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, and give the limb a complete rest. When the wrist or shoulder is sprained the arm should be confined in a sling. In the more serious cases the injured joint should be fixed in a splint before bandaging. An injured elbow joint is held at a right angle by a pasteboard splint, a bandage, and a sling, while the knee and wrist are treated with the limb in a straight line, as far as possible. In the case of the knee, the splint is applied to the back of the leg; in...", "...out, and the regular troops were already heard talking of \"where booty is to be found, and where the young women live who wear gold chains.\" The city, entirely open along both rivers, was shut on the northern side by a breastwork and palisades, which, though sufficient to keep out the savages, afforded no defence against a military siege.

I had only to remove this partition wall, supporting the ceiling by a strong beam, and I had a room about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> long by fifteen in breadth. At the back of this room were two small kitchens, only one of which was needed. By widening the doorway leading to one of them to double its breadth, I gained another room about ten feet square.

I often used to fancy her gliding about that room, her pallid face rouged, her eyes on fire, and she, laughing and anxious, studying the faces of the men and women before her, and wishing she could see those behind her.

Yes, most certainly, the writing of the novel _did_ fall in with Mr. Morley's literary plans. But what about his other plans? He caught himself up suddenly. How did he know what <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours might bring forth? What if, through some terrible error, he was not granted a new hearing? But Noah Wicker was confident. He had discovered a point in the former trial which was technically inadmissible.

Presently--in all about an hour and a half after the little boat had left us--we saw emerging from the river or harbour a large number of boats, ranging up to ten or twelve tons burden. One of these was propelled by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> oars, and most of the rest sailed. Looking through the glass we soon made out that the row-boat was an official vessel, her crew being all dressed in a sort of uniform, whilst on the half-deck forward stood an old man of venerable appearance, and with a flowing white beard, and a sword strapped to his side, who was evidently the commander of the craft. The other boats were apparently occupied by people brought out by curiosity, and were rowing or sailing towards us as...", "...up to twenty-seven atmospheres, the highest pressure attained in the experiments, Boyle's law holds good.

The original intention was to push the experiments to a pressure equivalent to thirty atmospheres, but owing to the signs of failure exhibited by the boiler the limit actually reached was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> atmospheres, at which pressure the thermometers indicated a temperature of about 224 deg.

I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the wind slackened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient,[15] and discharged a gun.

They had been guilty of many crimes, but no one ever succeeded in overtaking them until Dave Cook was elected city marshal of Denver, and made it his duty to track them down, which he did, almost unaided, and brought them to town in four days after their crime. When Cook was elected marshal of Denver for the first time, in 1866, he printed a notice, saying that he would agree to find stolen stock when notified <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours after its disappearance, and that if he did not find it, he would pay for it himself, after such notification. One day in December, 1867, a well-known ranchman named McIntyre came to the city and put up at McNassar's corral, which then stood on the present site of the American House. The next morning the horses had disappeared, and Mr. McIntyre was quite in despair. The animals were very fine ones, and the loss would have been very severe upon him.

The disulphonate is more readily obtained by moistening the nitrilosulphonate with dilute sulphuric acid and letting it stand for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, after which it is recrystallized from dilute ammonia. It forms monosymmetric crystals which by boiling with water yield amidosulphonic acid. (See also E. Divers, Jour. of Chem. Soc., 1892, lxi. p. 943.)

Night was when the sun was going round the other side of the mountain. He also proved, entirely to his own satisfaction, that the sun, instead of being greater, was very much smaller than the earth.

In the morning I saw a red deer, a buck with a fine spread of antlers, standing in the rain on the top of the island; but he had scarce seen me rise from under my rock, before he trotted off upon the other side. I supposed he must have swum the straits; though what should bring any creature to Earraid, was more than I could fancy. A little later, as I was jumping about after...", "...which they had captured from Korovin's massacred hunters; but the shots fell wide of the mark. Then they brought sulphur from the volcanic caves, and set fire to the long grass on the windward side of the tents. Again, Korovin sallied out, drove them off, and extinguished the fire. May, June, and half July he lay stranded here, waiting for his men to recover, and when they recovered, setting them to build a boat of skin and driftwood. Toward the third week of July, a skin boat <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> feet long was finished. In this were laid the wounded; and the well men took to the paddles. All {104} night they paddled westward and still westward, night after night, seeking the third vessel--that of Denis Medvedeff, who had come with them the year before from Bering Island. On the tenth day, Russian huts and a stone bath-house were seen on the shore of a broad inlet. Not a soul was stirring. As Korovin's boat approached, bits of sail, ships' wreckage, and...", "...the blood. But even of what was passing under cover of the darkness, he could learn little; and after standing awhile with a hand on either side of the window he found the night air chill. He stepped back, and, descending to the floor, uncovered the lantern and set it on the table. His thoughts travelled back to the preparations he had made the night before with a view to securing Mademoiselle's person, and he considered, with a grim smile, how little he had foreseen that within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours he would himself be a prisoner. Presently, finding his mask oppressive, he removed it, and, laying it on the table before him, sat scowling at the light. Biron had jockeyed him cleverly. Well, the worse for Armand de Gontaut de Biron if after this adventure the luck went against him! But in the meantime? In the meantime his fate was sealed if harm befell Biron. And what the King's real mind in Biron's case was, and what the Queen-Mother's, he could not say; just as...", "...and, as she preferred civilization as it goes in New Mexico to the hardships of a trip through the Sonora desert, I left her behind. Later I came south on a prospecting trip through the Sierra Madres, and have never seen her since.\" All through he had spoken with the furious vehemence of a man easing a load off his mind. Thrusting a letter into Billy's hand, he finished, walking away: \"Read that--I got it at the station yesterday. It reveals more than I could tell you in the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours.\" And it surely did. The stiff round hand, as much as the bald statement of want and desires, revealed a nature blind to all but its own ends. Every phrase was a cry or complaint.

When our youngest boy was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours old, his father went to St. Paul, in obedience to a summons from Governor Ramsey, and was soon after commissioned Colonel of the \"2d\" Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers, which was rendezvoused at Fort Snelling for thorough organization and drill.

At the close of his term at Fond du Lac, he took a location and entered secular pursuits. In 1847 Rev. Henry R. Colman was sent to Fond du Lac, and also remained two years. Brother Colman entered the New York Conference in May, 1831, and his first appointment was Warren Circuit, with Rev. Joseph McCreery as his colleague. This charge was located forty miles from his residence and included <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hundred square miles. His visits to his family were few, and the year was one of most severe labor. His receipts were only one hundred and forty dollars, showing that pioneer work had not at that period wholly ceased in the older States. Luzerne, his next field, gave him one hundred and twenty dollars. The next year he traveled Bridgeport, a large, four weeks circuit, and had for colleague Rev. J.G. Whitford. On this charge the receipts for the first two quarters were not...", "...line of retreat so rapidly that he had only time to throw himself and his handful of men into the farm before the two hostile bands united and closed upon him. He had kept them off for three days; there was food enough to last another week, but his ammunition was running short, and, worst of all, the water supply had almost given out. His men had been put upon the smallest possible allowance, but in spite of their care and self-denial there was barely enough left to last for another <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, and the horses were already suffering terribly. He had been hoping that Ah Lum would send a force to relieve him; but the chief was moving northward when he last saw him, and he doubted whether the man he had sent could reach him in time. In default of relief, his only course when the water failed would be to make a sortie by night; but the odds against him were so heavy that very few of his men could possibly escape. \"That is why I am here,\" said Jack. \"I was...", "...to our afflictions a real sympathy. It is true that everybody thought the king dead when Mme. de Maintenon left him; but he had only lost consciousness for a time, and afterwards recovered it. I do not want to say anything more about these sad matters, which affect me cruelly. The king showed the greatest firmness up to his last moment. He said to Mme. de Maintenon, smiling: \"I have always heard it said that it was difficult to die; I assure you that I find it very easy.\" He remained <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours without speaking to any one; but during that time he prayed and repeated constantly: \"My God, have pity upon me; Lord, I am waiting to appear before you; why do you not take me, my God?\" He then repeated with much fervour the Lord's prayer and the Creed, and he died recommending his soul to God.

In the meantime a total change had taken place among the occupants of the Government camp. Commissioner Rede had retired, Dr. Williams, the coroner, and the district surgeons had received notice to quit in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, and they left behind them twenty-four patients in and around the camp hospital. Dr. Carr left the colony, and the next report about him was from Manchester, where he made a wild and incoherent speech to the crowd at the Exchange. His last public appearance was in a police-court on a charge of lunacy. He was taken away by his friends, and what became of him afterwards is not recorded.

In <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours he was sixty-five miles from the Moravian town. A few of the mounted men pursued him, and at one time were within one hundred yards of him, but they were too weak to attack his guard. His carriage and papers were taken.

The lads were soon put to bed at the sailors' home, a man being at once despatched on horseback to Deal, to inform those there of the arrival of the lifeboat, and of the rescue of the four boys who had been blown to sea. Early next morning Frank and Handcock returned to Deal, the other two lads being so exhausted by their fatigue and exposure that the doctor said they had better remain in bed for another <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. It is impossible to describe the thankfulness and relief which Mrs. Hargate experienced, when, about two in the morning, Dr. Parker himself brought her news of the safety of her boy. She had long given up all hope, for when the evening came on and Frank had not returned, she had gone down to the shore. She learned from the fishermen there that it was deemed impossible that the boys could reach shore in face of the gale, and that although the lifeboat had just put...", "...March to Banza Nkulu. But revelry at night brings morning headache, and we did not set out, as agreed, at dawn. By slow degrees the grumbling, loitering party was mustered. The chiefs were Gidi Mavunga, head guide, and his son Papagayo, a dull quiet body; Chico Mpamba, \"French landlord\" of Banza Nokki, and my interpreter Nchama Chamvu. Fourteen armed moleques carried our hammocks and our little viaticum in the shape of four bottles of present-gin, two costa- finas, (= <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> yards of fancy cotton), and fourteen fathoms of satin-stripe, the latter a reserved fund.

THE COURSE OF LABOR.--The current view that labor begins in the early evening and generally ends during the night is incorrect. This impression has grown out of the fact that the whole process frequently consumes twelve hours and must in such an event include some part of the night. Statistical evidence indicates that almost as many births occur at one hour of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> as another; to be precise, only five per cent. more children are born between 6 P.M. and 6 A.M. than between 6 A.M. and 6 P.M. As already pointed out, labor commonly begins with transient discomfort in the lower part of the back. At first the uterine contractions are far apart; they last but a moment and cause only twinges of pain. Gradually, the preliminary contractions give place to others of more definite character, which appear at intervals of five to ten minutes....", "...least space, and requiring the least quantity of matter.

Some of the cells are filled with honey, and some are found to contain the young bee in the condition of larva.

As the formation of correct tables of the motion of Jupiter's satellites was a necessary preliminary to its introduction, he had occupied himself for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years in observations for this purpose, and he had made considerable progress in this laborious task. After the publication of his \"Dialogues on Motion,\" in 1636, he renewed his attempts to bring his method into actual use. For this purpose he addressed himself to Lorenzo Real, who had been the Dutch Governor-General in India, and offered the free use of his method to the States-General of Holland.[36] The Dutch government received this proposal with an anxious desire to...", "...describe natural days of _twenty-four_ hours; of these there are four great classes of commencement, from the four principal quarters of the day; viz. from midnight, from mid-day, from sun-setting and from sun-rising.

What, then, can be more probable than that he intended this day also, like the rest, to be of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours' duration; and that the words \"holding till sun-setting\" ought, perhaps, to have been printed \"holding till sun-_rising_?\" This way of reconciling seeming anomalies, by the supposition of probable misprints, receives great encouragement in the occasional occurrence of similar mistakes in the most carefully printed modern books.

And she meant more than ordinary breeding. She was under the impression that Kara revealed rare tact and sweetness in a difficult situation. Now and then she considered that her attitude bore a quality of high courage. But not until after Kara's accident was Miss Fenton convinced that courage was the characteristic that lay behind her other attributes. In the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours the young girl had been her guest with the prospect of such a test of patience and fortitude before her, Miss Victoria had surrendered completely. Silently Tory Drew had been aware of Miss Victoria's state of mind.

This afternoon on the day before Kara's departure, when Miss Victoria entered Kara's bedroom, with a...", "...not forgotten. He had a mysterious reverence for that country. A wealthy Meccan widow Chadizah, had intrusted him with the care of her Syrian trade. She was charmed with his capacity and fidelity, and (since he is said to have been characterized by the possession of singular manly beauty and a most courteous demeanor) charmed with his person. The female heart in all ages and countries is the same. She caused a slave to intimate to him what was passing in her mind, and, for the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of her life, Mohammed was her faithful husband. In a land of polygamy, he never insulted her by the presence of a rival. Many years subsequently, in the height of his power, Ayesha, who was one of the most beautiful women in Arabia, said to him: \"Was she not old? Did not God give you in me a better wife in her place?\" \"No, by God!\" exclaimed Mohammed, and with a burst of honest gratitude, \"there never can be a better.

I know that every nation in Europe would join in sincere amity with the latter, and hold the former at arm's length, by jealousies, prohibitions, restrictions, vexations, and war. No earthly consideration could induce my consent to contract such a debt as England has by her wars for commerce, to reduce our citizens by taxes to such wretchedness, as that laboring sixteen of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, they are still unable to afford themselves bread, or barely to earn as much oatmeal or potatoes as will keep soul and body together. And all this to feed the avidity of a few millionary merchants, and to keep up one thousand ships of war for the protection of their commercial speculations.

The bicarbonate of soda must be pure, and perfectly free from any neutral carbonate or sesquicarbonate of soda. To ensure this, the bicarbonate of commerce is reduced to a uniform powder, put into a glass jar, and covered with its own weight of cold distilled or rain water, and allowed to stand for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, with frequent stirring. It is then placed upon a funnel, the tube of which is stopped with loose cotton, so as to allow the lye to drain off. It is next washed several times with small quantities of cold distilled or rain water, and after being dried by pressure between some sheets of blotting-paper, without the aid of heat, is kept for use in a well-closed glass bottle.

To test this belief, I placed on several stigmas of a long-styled cowslip plenty of pollen from the same plant, and after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours added some from a short-styled dark-red Polyanthus, which is a variety of the cowslip. From the flowers thus treated 30 seedlings were raised, and all these, without exception, bore reddish flowers; so that the effect of pollen from the same form, though placed on the stigmas twenty-four hours previously, was quite destroyed by that of pollen from a plant belonging to the other form.

She performed her duties quietly and in silence, and seldom spoke unless she were first addressed. She did not take the trouble to render herself agreeable to me, or to win my affection. This was entirely to my liking, as I was of a retired habit of mind and disposition. It was not unusual for weeks to pass without our exchanging a word. We were surrounded by...", "...several sheets of cartridge paper, and tested the correctness of our work by laying it on the floor, with its north coinciding with the real north, and requesting our Dutch visitors to stand as if they were about commencing the same journey, and indicate how much they turned to the right or left as they proceeded.

It therefore follows that 15 deg. of longitude will represent one hour of time; consequently, as you travel towards the east, when you have journeyed over 15 deg., you will have gained one hour on the sun, which will rise just one hour earlier than it did at the starting point.

Henry took a superficial view of all this. Sharp young men of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> understand a great many things; but they can't quite measure their mothers yet.

One result of the incompletion, as Brunetiere has pointed out, is to give disproportionate treatment to certain phases of life, to the military, for instance, for which Balzac has <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> stories on his list, whereas only two, \"The Chouans\" and \"A Passion in the Desert,\" were executed. But surely, sufficient was done, looking to the comedy as a whole, to force us to describe the execution as well as the conception as gigantic.

In the wide realm of philanthropy Liverpool has had many active workers, for the most part unknown to fame, who plod away day after day in our slums, with no prospect of reward, save the satisfaction of doing something to ameliorate and brighten the lives of others.

There is one circumstance, which, if I am not mistaken, has not as yet been published by the newspapers, and it is this. There was a fight on the 25th on a place at the north of Roverbella, between the Italian regiment of Novara cavalry and a regiment of Hungarian hussars, whose name is not known. This regiment was so thoroughly routed by the Italians that it was pursued as far as Villafranca, and had two squadrons put hors de combat, whilst the Novara regiment only lost <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> mounted men. I think it right to mention this, for it proves that, the day after the bloody affair of the 24th, the Italian army had still a regiment of cavalry operating at Villafranca, a village which lay at a distance of fifteen kilometres from the Italian frontier. A report, which is much accredited here, explains how the Italian army did not derive the advantages it might have derived from the action of the 24th.

I was determined to keep the speeches going and not to let Burnand say another word.

Supplying themselves with bits of bread or fragments of meat, they fling these upon the river, and watch the birds eagerly pursue the food. Seagulls will also give chase to birds of other species they may come across. Not long ago the Cunard steamer _Campania_, from New York, was nearly due south of Nova Scotia, when the look-out observed a bird close at hand flying rapidly. In fact, it went faster than the ship, which was then moving <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> statute miles an hour. A great number of seagulls were chasing the fugitive, but could not make enough speed to catch it. At length the bird settled upon the deck, wearied, and proved to be a fine specimen of the snowy owl.

The bill is hooked like a hawk's, having round the base a few stiff feathers. Its plumage is...", "...parts may be attributed to 1680. Some of the many harpsichord things may also belong to this period. We cannot follow Purcell's development step by step, year by year, as we can, for instance, Beethoven's. When we come to survey his work as a whole, we shall be able to compare the three-part sonatas issued in 1683 with the sonatas in four parts published in the year after his death. We shall learn that towards the end of his life he was a more magnificent master, than he was when <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years old. That is the most we can see.

One significant thing must be noted here: the music itself--its style, spirit, even...", "...north pole of the heavens, and the south pole of the earth exactly beneath the south pole of the heavens. We have seen that the earth rotates upon its imaginary axis once in about every twenty-four hours. This means that everything upon the surface of the earth is carried round once during that time. The measurement around the earth's equator is about 24,000 miles; and, therefore, an object situated at the equator must be carried round through a distance of about 24,000 miles in each <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. Everything at the equator is thus moving along at the rapid rate of about 1000 miles an hour, or between sixteen and seventeen times as fast as an express train. If, however, one were to take measurements around the earth parallel to the equator, one would find these measurements becoming less and less, according as the poles were approached. It is plain, therefore, that the speed with which any point moves, in consequence of the earth's rotation, will be greatest at...", "...I., was closely watching the trend of affairs in Scotland and was invited to settle this dispute. It is doubtful what rights, if any, the English kings had over Scotland, but when Edward met the Scottish nobles at Norham in May 1291, he demanded a formal recognition of his position as overlord of Scotland. After some delay this was tacitly admitted by the nobles, and acknowledged by Baliol and the other competitors, who all agreed to abide by his decision. A court of eighty Scotsmen and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> Englishmen was then appointed to try the question. Traversing the statements made in favour of Bruce, Baliol claimed by the principles of feudal law for an indivisible inheritance, and on the advice of the court Edward decided in his favour. Having sworn fealty to the English king, Baliol was crowned king of Scotland at Scone on the 30th of November 1292; in his new capacity he did homage to Edward at Newcastle, and in January 1293 released the English king from all promises...", "...\"I don't claim much credit, however, as I have some interests in Chicago to which I can attend with advantage personally.

Then five of the men set out for Lawrence, which was reached at the end of a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours' march. The town of Lawrence, a collection of many rude log houses, was filled with crowds of excited men and women. John Brown, looking like a patriarch with his long hair and beard, arrived at sundown, accompanied by his stalwart sons armed with guns and pistols. He was at once put in charge of a company, and set to work fortifying the town with earthworks, and preparing for a battle.

Automobiles were not to be had even if I had been able to pay for one. So I set out at dusk on foot toward Dieppe, which was forty miles or more distant.

Finding scarcely any one at that time who thought of it, I was turned frequently to myself. But here many difficulties arose. It struck me, among others, that a young man of only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age could not have that solid judgment, or knowledge of men, manners, and things, which were requisite to qualify him to undertake a task of such magnitude and importance;--and with whom was I to unite? I believed also, that it looked so much like one of the feigned labours of Hercules, that my understanding would be suspected if I proposed it. On ruminating however on the subject, I found one thing at least practicable, and that this also was in my power. I could...", "...vessel, on her initial trip, to the gunwales. Now cargo, on arriving at Wilmington at that time, used to be loaded into cars, brought to Los Angeles and left in the freight shed until we removed it at our convenience; but when the _Newport_ arrived, the vessel was unloaded and the merchandise put into the warehouse at Wilmington, where it was held several days before it was reshipped. On its arrival in Los Angeles, the Railroad Company gave notice that removal must be effected within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, or demurrage would be charged; and since, with the small facilities in those days at our command, so prompt a withdrawal of an entire cargo was a physical impossibility, our expenses were straightway heavily increased. Subsequent to this first shipment, we adopted a more conservative policy, in spite of which our troubles were to multiply. The Southern Pacific Railroad Company named a rate of three dollars a ton in less than carload lots between San Francisco and...", "...off an excursion, said, \"What's this faw?\" and seemed to think some new movement was afoot, which would probably be beneficial in the main ultimately.

Most folk think mainly about themselves and their own affairs. Even a matter which \"everybody is talking about\" is really talked about by each for a very small portion of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. And a name which is \"in everybody's mouth\" is not in each separate mouth for more than a few minutes at a time. And during those few minutes, it is talked of with an interest very faint, when compared with that you feel for yourself.

This is what the senator from Mississippi tells us that he has seen; and would to God that we had all seen it. Would to God that the whole American Congress had seen it.

All over the Hotel de Soto was this same kind of sumptuous magnificence; and Peter experienced the mental effect which it was contrived to produce upon him--a sense of bedazzlement and awe, a realization that those who dwelt in the midst of this splendor were people to whom money was nothing, who could pour out treasures in a never-ceasing flood.

The cost of these works complete to the city was a trifle over $6,000. In November last a wind mill 18 feet in diameter was erected over a coal mine at Richmond, in this State. The conditions were as follows: The mine produces 11,000 gallons of water every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. The sump holds 11,000 gallons. Two entries that can be dammed up give a storage of 16,500 gallons, making a total storage capacity of 27,500 gallons. It takes sixty hours for the mine to produce this quantity of water, which allows for days that the wind does not blow. The average elevation that the water has to be raised is 65 feet, measuring from center of sump to point of delivery.

Within the past <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours I had been within an ace of losing my life; I had seriously wounded if not actually killed a fellow-creature in order to escape; I had endured the bitter mortification of police detention; and had returned to Berlin to take up the thread of an exciting struggle. And now on the top of all had come the murder of the Jew, with its consequences of personal hazard to myself and its disastrous menace to my plans. The examination by the police had, moreover, been a great...", "...with, and illustrative of, the stern decision afterwards shown in meeting and suppressing mutiny of the most threatening description. The crew of the _Albany_, it is said, from some motives of discontent refused to sail. Jervis had brought with him a few seamen from his late command. These he ordered to cut the cables which held the ship to her anchors, and to loose the foresail. Daunted more, perhaps, by the bearing of the man than by the mere acts, the mutineers submitted, and in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> days, an extraordinarily short passage for that time, the _Albany_ was at New York. Here Jervis was unfortunately delayed, and thus, being prevented from rejoining Sir Charles Saunders, lost the promotion which a British commander-in-chief could then give to an officer in his own command who had merited his professional approval. It was not until October, 1761, when he was twenty-six, that Jervis obtained \"post\" rank,--the rank, that is, of full, or post, captain. By the...", "...so much of any measure passing the two Houses of Congress as his judgment may dictate, without approving the whole, the disapproved portion or portions to be subjected to the same rules as now, to wit, to be referred back to the House in which the measure or measures originated, and, if passed by a two-thirds vote of the two Houses, then to become a law without the approval of the President.

The advantages to be gained by these two amendments are...", "...was that he considered that girls were a nuisance on the links and in the tennis-court. I suppose a plus two golfer and a Wildingesque tennis-player, such as Wilton was, does feel like that. Personally, I think that girls add to the fun of the thing. But then, my handicap is twelve, and, though I have been playing tennis for many years, I doubt if I have got my first serve--the fast one--over the net more than half a dozen times. But Mary Campbell overcame Wilton's prejudices in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. He seemed to feel lonely on the links without her, and he positively egged her to be his partner in the doubles. What Mary thought of him we did not know. She was one of those inscrutable girls. And so things went on. If it had not been that I knew Wilton's story, I should have classed the thing as one of those summer love-affairs to which the Marois Bay air is so peculiarly conducive. The only reason why anyone comes away from a summer at Marois Bay unbetrothed...", "...Forest is pledged to me, I will tolerate no love in her to any one but her future husband; at least to no _living_ man!\" Walter recoiled in horror. \"Does that mean a challenge?\" \"Yes; do not start back, Lieutenant Fernow, I waive all your German proprieties as to witnesses, seconds and preliminaries, I offer you a far simpler method. We will draw lots, or throw dice, we two alone, and fortune shall decide. The losing one shall pledge his word of honor not to be among the living <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours after, and the thing is done.\" There was an expression of contempt on Walter's face as he coldly replied; \"I regret, Mr. Alison, that this sort of satisfaction does not accord with my ideas of honor. If we must be arrayed against each other, let it be in the orthodox way, eye to eye with weapon in hand. I would fight for my life; not cast lots for it.\" Alison's eyes flashed in annihilating scorn. \"It certainly may not be so poetical as your German duel, but it is...", "...words in question since my arrival, and asked him point blank if I was to assume by implication that the other ships of the Fleet were only dismal prisons of steel in comparison. \"Perhaps the men would try to make you believe something to that effect,\" he laughed, \"but so also would those of the '----,' and the '----,' and the '----' regarding each other, the rest of the squadron and the whole of the Grand Fleet. As a matter of fact, if you had been on any one of them during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, you would probably have seen and heard and experienced just about what you have seen and heard and experienced here.

Then there came a mistiness in the air, making the noonday sun red and unradiant And the woodsman knew that there were forest fires somewhere up the wind. A little anxious, he studied the signs minutely, and concluded that, the wind being light, the fires were too far distant to endanger the Quah-Davic region. Thereupon he decided to make a hurried trip to the settlement for a sack of middlings and other supplies, planning to return by night, making the round trip within the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours in order that the little red cow should not miss more than one milking. On the afternoon of the woodsman's going, however, the wind freshened into a gale, and the fires which had been eating leisurely way through the forest were blown into sudden fury. That same evening a hurricane of flame swept down upon the lonely cabin and the little wild meadow, cutting a mile-wide swath through the woods, jumping the Quah-Davic, and roaring on to the north. It was days before...", "...at the best rate at which boys of that age and strength have been sold within the year; and the said negro so purchased shall be under the entire guardianship of the said protector of negroes, who shall send him to the Bishop of London for his further education in England, and may charge in his accounts for the expense of transporting him to England; and the Bishop of London shall provide for the education of such of the said negroes as he shall think proper subjects, until the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years, and shall order those who shall fall short of expectation after one year to be bound apprentice to some handicraft trade; and when his apprenticeship is finished, the Lord Mayor of London is hereby authorized and directed to receive the said negro from his master, and to transmit him to the island from which he came, in the West Indies, to be there as a free negro, subject, however, to the direction of the protector of negroes, relatively to his behavior and...", "...day, and the number of those who were obliged to walk was continually increasing, till there were several hundred. Near Sabini, the first river we came to after leaving Leydsdorp we secured twenty-four mules which were of very great use to us under the circumstances. But the difficulty was how to distribute them amongst the field-cornets. The men all said they wanted them very urgently, and at once found the cattle belonging to each cart to be too thin and too weak to move. Yet the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> could only be put into two carts, and I had to solve the difficulty by asserting my authority. It was no easy task to get over the Agatha Mountains and we had to rest for the day near the big Letaba, especially as we had to give the whole file of carts, guns, etc., a chance of forming up again. Here we succeeded in buying some loads of mealies, which were a real God-send to our half-starved horses. I also managed to hire some teams of oxen from Boers who had taken up a...", "...the woods, where they lay concealed on the other side of the rivulet; for the plain round St. Catharine being entirely cleared of every thing that could screen them, they durst not shew themselves any more. However, the commandant of Fort Rosalie sent to treat with the _Stung Serpent_; in order to prevail with him to appease that part of his nation, and procure a peace. As that great warrior was our friend, he effectually laboured therein, and hostilities ceased. After I had passed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours in St. Catharine, I was relieved by a new detachment from the inhabitants, whom, in my turn, I relieved next day. It was on this second guard, which I mounted, that the village we had been at war with sent me, by their deputies, the _calumet_ or _pipe of peace_. I at first had some thoughts of refusing it, knowing that this honour was due to the commandant of the fort; and it appeared to me a thing so much the more delicate to deprive him of it, as we were not upon...", "...(_By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks._) Herr HERMANN FERNAU's _Because I am a German_ (CONSTABLE) is a sort of postscript to the widely-outside-Germany-circulated _J'accuse!_, that vigorous indictment by an anonymous German of the Prussian clique as the criminal authors of the War. Herr FERNAU summarises the argument of _J'accuse!_ and if anyone cares to have at his finger-tips the essential case against the enemy he could not do better than absorb the six pages in which <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> questions put by the anonymous author to the directors of his unhappy country's destiny are most skilfully compressed. Four attempted German answers are shown by our author to have in common an amazing reluctance to deal with any single definite point at issue; and a most unjudicial appeal to popular hatred of the traitor critic. Of course it is a cheap line to welcome as a miracle of wisdom every German who takes a pro-Ally view. But I honestly detect no shadow of pro-Ally...", "...guns were with great labor hauled from the fleet, and on December 27 the Carolina's crew were forced to abandon her, and the Louisiana was with difficulty got out of range; but meanwhile Commodore Patterson had mounted a battery across the river which in a measure made up for the ships.

The British used at least <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> guns, throwing some three hundred and fifty pounds of metal; the Americans, fifteen guns, throwing two hundred and twenty-four pounds. On both sides novel defences were employed,--cotton bales by the Americans, barrels of sugar by the British. The bales quickly caught fire, and from that time were discarded; the barrels proved as useless as if they had been empty. The result of the action would have been utterly surprising but for the discovery already made in Canada that...", "...by the coast-lines of the Mediterranean and Black seas, was a far vaster world than ours of today, which we weigh, measure, and compute as accurately and as easily as if it were a child's play-ball.

The admiral, however, making a feint with his boats, drew the enemy down to the shore, when he ran up past the batteries, and ravaged the country round the town.

The Legations may almost be said to have sat with open doors, so easy were their interchanges of informal visits.

But this good fortune in some measure renovated me for the moment and, putting out my whole strength, I contrived to collect a few heads and with incredible difficulty carried them singly about thirty paces to the fire. Darkness stole on us apace and I became extremely anxious about Beauparlant; several guns were fired to each of which he answered. We then called out and again heard his responses though faintly, when I told St....", "...go down, and the ends of the yards might catch on the ice and break, with the weight of the water-filled hull, as was the case with the ill-fated _Jeannette_.

The bottom was sliced off as one would slice a cucumber with a knife, so that the iron blubber tanks in the hold dropped out of her. The ship became nothing but the sides and ends of a box. She remained some <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, gripped between the floes, and then went down.

Though my hopes were high, the experience of former journeys reminded...", "...him.\" Raniero gave a start at these words. Now, at last, he was angry with the fool, and reached out his hand for a heavy wine pitcher to throw at his face, but he controlled himself that he might hear whether the fellow wished to speak to his credit or discredit. \"Saint Peter saw now,\" narrated the fool, \"that, although the tent was lighted mostly by torches, one of the knights really had a burning wax candle beside him. It was a long, thick candle, one of the sort made to burn <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. The knight, who had no candlestick to set it in, had gathered together some stones and piled them around it, to make it stand.\" The company burst into shrieks of laughter at this. All pointed at a candle which stood on the table beside Raniero, and was exactly like the one the fool had described. The blood mounted to Raniero's head; for this was the candle which he had a few hours before been permitted to light at the Holy Sepulchre.

He looked like one accustomed to command, and suggested a big banking account.

Tavannes and his master now reminded each other, like two school-boys, of certain pranks they had played in Paris, and the evening's amusement was soon arranged. The two Italians, challenged to climb roofs, and jump from one to another across alleys and streets, wagered that they would follow the king wherever he went. They and Tavannes went off to change their clothes. The Comte...", "...until the day's allowance was reduced to about two tablespoonfuls for each person.

But we took on board a host of mosquitoes at Saigon, and the nights are consequently so intolerable that I weary for the day. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours spent at Saigon broke the monotonous pleasantness of our voyage very agreeably to me, but most of the passengers complain of the wearisome detention in the heat. In truth, the mercury stood at 92 degrees!

In the battle of the Dobrudja the Serb division had gone into the fight 14,000 strong; they were in the centre, with the Roumanians on the left and the Russians on the right. The Roumanians and Russians broke, and the Serbs, who had fought for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours on two fronts, came out with only 4,000 men. Further slaughter such as this would have been the fate of the Serbian division if left in Russia. \"The men want to fight,\" said General Zivkovitch to Dr. Inglis; \"they are not cowards, but it goes to my heart to send them to their death like this.\" In July there had seemed to be a hope of the division being liberated and sent via Archangel to another front; however, later the decision of the Russian Headquarters was...", "...the reach of insolvency, the impulse to succor the unfortunate remained as strong as ever among them. CHAPTER III THE REOPENING OF THE EXCHANGE The fact that the Stock Exchange closed on July 31st and did not reopen fully until December 15th, might lead to the supposition that the question of reopening was not taken up before December. Far from this being the case, the truth is that reopening began to be discussed immediately after the institution was closed. Within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours of the closing the minority, who had not been at first convinced of the wisdom of that action, joined with the majority in urgently advising that the Exchange be not reopened soon. All through the month of August a growing anxiety over the possibility of some hasty action by the Exchange authorities showed itself among brokers, bankers, and even some government officials. For this anxiety there was never any basis, because the officers of the Exchange having...", "...eyes. No sooner had the Christians reached the maple grove, when from all over the clearing appeared hostile Indians, who took positions near the knoll where the missionaries stood. Heckewelder's faithful little band awaited him on the platform. The converted Indians seated themselves as usual at the foot of the knoll. The other savages crowded closely on both sides. They carried their weapons, and maintained the same silence that had so singularly marked their mood of the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. No human skill could have divined their intention. This coldness might be only habitual reserve, and it might be anything else. Heckewelder approached at the same time that Simon Girty and his band of renegades appeared. With the renegades were Pipe and Half King. These two came slowly across the clearing, passed through the opening in the crowd, and stopped close to the platform. Heckewelder went hurriedly up to his missionaries. He seemed beside himself with...", "...of hot broth made from the Liebig Company's extract of meat we restored him to his senses. On the road in front of the rear guard two Madis died, and also one Zanzibari of the rear column stricken instantaneously to death by the intensely cold rain. We made a march of two hours the next day, and then despatched forty-five choice men ahead to try and obtain meal for the salvation of the Banalya men and the Madis, whose powers were too weak for further effort. The scouts returned within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours with a goat, which was at once slaughtered to make thirty gallons of soup. When thickened with two pounds of wheaten flour, the soup made a most welcome meal for over sixty men. We reached Indemau by 10 A.M. on the 25th. The village was situated in a hollow at the base of a mount, and was distant from the Dui branch of the Ihuru six miles. [Sidenote: 1888. Nov. 25. Indemau.] At Indemau the long-enduring members of the Expedition received another respite...", "...forward a pace. \"Hello!--Here at last, are you?\" he saluted. \"Aren't you pretty late tonight?\" Old Jerry swallowed hard at the cheery ease of the words, but his fluttery heart began to pump even faster than when he had sat outside in the buggy debating the advisability of his further advance. That warning premonition had not been a footless thing, after all, for this self-certain, vaguely amused person who stood steadily contemplating him was not the Denny Bolton he had known <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours before--not from any angle or viewpoint. Behind the simulated cheer of his greeting there was something else which Old Jerry found disturbingly new and hard to place. In his perplexity the wordless accusation that morning had been correct at that. And Young Denny was smiling widely at him now--smiling openly. The old man shuffled his feet and shifted his gaze from the open wound upon the boy's face as though he feared his suspicion might be read in his eyes.

Abandoning a mood of amused laughter, these gentlemen suddenly became very serious. Their hoary customs did not seem so sacred then, and they ended by throwing a complete somersault, and granting us full permission to light up the Liverpool docks at night. Of course this made a tremendous difference to all of us. We could now load our ships at night, thus saving one half of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, which we had been losing. I understand that the Morgan combination, fifty-two years after this, has again forced concessions from the Liverpool dock board by threatening to take the ships to Southampton. Our principal freight from Liverpool at that time consisted of crockery from the Staffordshire potteries, Manchester dry-goods, and iron and steel, and what were known as \"chow-chow,\" or miscellaneous articles.

Two hundred houses were overthrown in the village of the Indians. But what caused most fear to those natives (and the old men say that they have never seen such a thing, or heard it told by their ancestors), is that the hurricane carried into the air the small boats that they use, which are called bancas and resemble canoes.

Then Saniel continued his walk like an ordinary passer- by until she had time to reach the first story; then, turning, he returned to the porte-cochere and entered quietly. By the gaslight in the vestibule he saw by his watch, which he held in his hand, that it was fourteen minutes after five o'clock. Then, if his calculation was right, at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> or twenty-five minutes after five he must pass before the lodge, which should still be empty at that moment. On the staircase above him he heard the heavy step of the concierge; she had lighted the gas on the first story, and continued on her way slowly.

In doing this her head turned slightly and she saw me. Instantly the spell under which she sat frozen yielded to a recognition of something besides her own terrible brooding.

I saw that in another moment she would speak. \"You have come,\" she panted out at last, \"to hear my decision. It is too soon.

He satisfied himself that it 'would pay in the end.' His calculations of profits were 'clear as mud.' He would have a thousand hens. The improved breeds were warranted to lay five eggs apiece a week; and eggs were worth--that is, _he was paying_--six dollars a dozen. His thousand hens would lay twenty thousand eight hundred and thirty-three dozen eggs per annum, which, at six dollars per dozen, would amount to the sum of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight dollars. Even deducting therefrom the original cost of the hens and their keep,--say thirty-six thousand dollars,--the very pretty trifle of eighty-eight thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight was the remainder--clear profit.

These were lost from Versailles in 1790, and have not been recovered, except two which M. Cartier discovered some years since. Notwithstanding that Andrew Amati was the first maker of any note, except Gaspar di Salo of Brescia, it is clear that he had attained an astonishing amount of skill, as there is an account of a violoncello which was offered by auction at the sale of the celebrated Sir Wm.

He took the water glass and rowed the boat until it was directly over a sponge. \"Yo' all keep de boat dere a li'l while,\" he said to Colin, and the lad took the oars. Then very deftly the boatman pushed the long unwieldy pole into the water and nicked a sponge from the bed, bringing it up intact.

There were several occasions in April when the velocity of the wind exceeded ninety miles an hour. On the evening of the 26th, the wind slackened, and for part of the 27th had almost fallen to a calm. This brought the optimists to the fore, once again, with the theory that the worst was over. The prediction was far from being fulfilled, for, as the days passed, the average velocity steadily rose. On May 11 the average for the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours was eighty miles per hour. By that time the Hut had been further protected by a crescent of cases, erected behind the first break-wind. In height this erection stood above the Hangar, and, when the snow became piled in a solid ramp on the leeward side, it was more compact than ever. Inside the Hut extra struts were introduced, stiffening the principal rafters on the southern side. It was reassuring to know that these precautions had been taken, for, on May 15, the...", "...Norlinguen, and Fribourg, to insult both the place and the governor, ordered the trenches to be mounted at noon-day by his own regiment, at the head of which marched four-and-twenty fiddlers, as if it had been to a wedding. \"Night approaching, we were all in high spirits: our violins were playing soft airs, and we were comfortably regaling ourselves: God knows how we were joking about the poor governor and his fortifications, both of which we promised ourselves to take in less than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. This was going on in the trenches, when we heard an ominous cry from the ramparts, repeated two or three times, of, 'Alerte on the walls!' This cry was followed by a discharge of cannon and musketry, and this discharge by a vigorous sally, which, after having filled up the trenches, pursued us as far as our grand guard. \"The next day Gregorio Brice sent by a trumpet a present of ice and fruit to the Prince de Conde, humbly beseeching his highness to excuse his not...", "...sometimes rising particularly at night to the height of colicky feelings but always on the left side, were indulging to excess in tea or coffee.

But when a child suffering from acute febrile intestinal trouble (cholera infantum), loses a tenth of his weight in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, the illness is mortal. Now from the point of view of the educator this fact ought to be of serious interest, because we very frequently find among the recorded details of sickly children, or those suffering from arrested or retarded development, a mention of some _intestinal_ malady incurred in early infancy. Still one further observation: Meunier has noted a fact of extreme importance: that while children are passing through the period of incubation of an...", "...steamboat pilot, printer, miner, and frontier journalist.

Those who cannot do this should at least keep the doors and windows of the room fully open at all times. The air is our food for all the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours of the day. Why, then, should we be afraid of it? It is a most foolish idea that we catch cold by inhaling the cool breeze of the morning.

In saying that he built it, I mean that he knew how to get men to help him build it. The same determination that he had in building that bridge, the same character, came out in his determination that his railroad line, so far as he could effect it, must be free of the riffraff population which was disturbing it.

It is not among the tallest in the world, being three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> feet high, but is very symmetrical and impressive. In the preservation of its pyramidal purpose it is scarcely inferior to that most consummate work, the tower of St. Stephen's in Vienna. It is composed of three superimposed structures, gradually diminishing in solidity and massiveness from the square base to the high-springing octagonal spire, garlanded with thorny crowns.

Some, to be sure, are not regularly enrolled, and a few do not habitually attend services; but, practically, a proscribed people must have a social centre, and that centre for this people is the Negro church. The census of 1890 showed nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> thousand Negro churches in the country, with a total enrolled membership of over two and a half millions, or ten actual church members to every twenty-eight persons, and in some Southern States one in every two persons.

These are the \"rhabditiform embryos,\" which measure about 0.40 by 0.02 mm.

His body was buried in the chancel of the parish church of Berkeley, where there is a memorial window placed by public subscription. In person, Edward Jenner was short and rather heavily built; his expression of face was pleasant with a touch of sadness.

Also the corps of under-officers is subject to hampering regulations with regard to marriage, and require besides the consent of their superior officers. These are very drastic proofs of the _purely materialistic conception_ that the State has of marriage. In general, public opinion is agreed that marriage is not advisable for men under <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> or twenty-five years of age. Twenty-five is the marriageable age for men fixed by the civil code, with an eye to the civic independence that, as a rule, is not gained before that age.

By the middle of August they had all arrived, and his united forces amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> thousand men. Washington's army, though it nominally numbered twenty thousand five hundred, still was composed of only about eleven thousand effective men, and these imperfectly provided with arms and ammunition.

When he came there, he alighted at the stair- case, which led up to the hall with the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> windows, and went directly up to it, without giving previous notice to Alla ad Deen; but it happened that at that very juncture Alla ad Deen was opportunely there, and had just time to receive him at the door.

An English gentleman, for instance, is never seen in the morning (which means abroad all that portion of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours devoted to business, out-door amusements and pursuits, &c.;--it is always _morning_ until the late dinner hour has passed) in the half-worn coat of fine black cloth, that so inevitably gives a man a sort of shabby-genteel look; but in some strong-looking, rough, knock-about \"fixin,\" frequently of nondescript form and fashion, but admirably adapted both in shape and material for use--for work. Of this, by the way, every man, worthy of the name, has a daily portion to...", "...or burying-place, which we had observed to be almost close by the house, and was much more extensive, and seemingly of more consequence, than any we had seen at the other islands. We were told, that it belonged to the king. It consisted of three pretty large houses, situated upon a rising ground, or rather just by the brink of it, with a small one, at some distance, all ranged longitudinally. The middle house of the three first, was by much the largest, and placed in a square, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> paces by twenty-eight, raised about three feet. The other houses were placed on little mounts, raised artificially to the same height. The floors of these houses, as also the tops of the mounts round them, were covered with loose, fine pebbles, and the whole was inclosed by large flat stones of hard coral rock, properly hewn, placed on their edges; one of which stones measured twelve feet in length, two in breadth, and above one in thickness. One of the houses, contrary to...", "...mentioned my land scrip to any one, and wishing to see if it had any value, I produced and tendered the certificates to the surveyor. He looked them over, made a computation, and informed me that they were worth in his county about five cents an acre, or nearly one thousand dollars. He also offered to accept them as security, assuring me that he could use some of them in locating lands for settlers. But it was not my idea to sell the land scrip, and a trade was easily effected on the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> oxen, yokes, and chains, I paying what money I could spare and leaving the certificates for security on the balance. As I look back over an eventful life, I remember no special time in which I felt quite as rich as the evening that I drove into the Edwards ranch with twelve yoke of oxen chained together in one team. The darkies and Mexicans gathered about, even the family, to admire the big fellows, and I remember a thrill which shivered through me as Miss Gertrude passed...", "...conciliation, and magnanimity,\" this sounded like a harsh conclusion of the position he had sought to sugar-coat with much rhetoric, and, in reply, he pushed bloodshed into the far-off future by restating what he had already declared in fine phrases, closing as follows: \"Does not the honourable senator know that when all these [suggestions for compromise] have failed, then the States of this Union, according to the forms of the Constitution, shall take up this controversy about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> negro slaves scattered over a territory of one million and fifty thousand square miles, and say whether they are willing to sacrifice all this liberty, all this greatness, and all this hope, because they have not intelligence, wisdom, and virtue enough to adjust a controversy so frivolous and contemptible.\"[706] [Footnote 706: W.H.

Not unfrequently they combined the BALLS (a favourite sign of the quacks) with Lilly's head, as the BLACK BALL AND LILLYHEAD, the sign of Thomas Saffold, \"an approved and licensed physician and student in astrology: he hath practised astronomy for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years, and hath had the Bishop of London's licence to practise physick ever since the 4th day of September 1674, and hath, he thanks God for it, great experience and wonderful success in those arts.\" He promised to perform the usual _tours de force_. ----\"foretell what s'ever was By consequence to come to pass; As death of great men, alterations, Diseases, battles, inundations, Or search'd a planet's house to know Who broke and robb'd a house below....", "...in high-sounding promises, but whose performances did not by any means come up to their predictions as to what they would do if they ever met the enemy face to face.

It was a difficult matter, so the owner declared, to keep that dog from devoting the entire <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours of each day to the destruction of his enemies. He just 'hankered' to get at them. \"One day a party of this dog-owner's friends thought to have some sport. These friends heartily disliked wolves, and were anxious to see the dog eat up a few thousand. So they organized a hunting party and invited the dog-owner and the dog to go with them. They desired to be personally present when the wolf-killing was in progress. \"It was noticed that the dog-owner was not...", "...it is exactly thirty seconds to midnight. Listen!\" And thirty seconds later, from the Pleasantville court house tower, the town bell rang out twelve musical strokes.

It was three o'clock in the morning, and the scene was the little express office where so many unusual and exciting happenings had transpired within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. The colonel's announcement was given in the tone of a man facing a hard proposition and forced to accept it--or something worse. Bart's reply was calm and off-handed. During a two hours' siege with the military man he had never lost his temper or his wits, and had come off the victor. When Bart had concluded his very creditable piece of business with Mr. Martin of the pickle factory, he had sent Darry and Bob Haven back to bed, and had forthwith returned to...", "...heaven and earth to do it.\" \"That is easier said than done, Padre _mio_,\" she answered quietly. \"God never wholly abandons his children to the evil of the world,\" he returned firmly. \"Don Felipe has deceived the Church once, but he shall not do so a second time.

All this pilgrimage and prayer was repeated three times each day--morning, noon, and evening--during the first seven days; on the eighth day it was repeated six times; confession and communion followed on the morning of the ninth day; and then the pilgrims entered the cave, where twenty-four hours were devoted to fasting and meditation.

Another model may be stamped in exactly the same way and it may indicate that all watches of that particular grade have been tested in exactly the same way and that the extreme extent of variation from one position to any other, did not exceed twenty-five seconds. The statement regarding the number of positions to...", "...Eric failed to destroy them as soon as received? When the last paper had been reduced to ashes, I stamped out the embers of fire under my boot heel, and, with lighter heart, rode down the hill toward the ford.

A brief interview with Colonel Hamilton revealed his appreciation of my work, and that my hastily made notes of the Philadelphia defences had been received <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours earlier. They had been delivered at headquarters by an officer of Lee's staff; no, not a boyish-looking fellow, but a black-bearded captain whose name had been forgotten. All Hamilton could remember was that the notes had been originally brought in by an Indian scout. Eager to discover Eric Mortimer I asked a week's release from duty, but there was so much sickness in the camp, that this request was refused, and I was ordered to my regiment. Busy days and nights of...", "...and in a very few minutes the Oracle was prepared. The answer was very simple, but the exordium was sublime. It professed that the Vraibleusian nation was the saviour and champion of the world; that it was the first principle of its policy to maintain the cause of any people struggling for their rights as men; and it avowed itself to be the grand patron of civil and religious liberty in all quarters of the globe. Forty-seven battalions of infantry and eighteen regiments of cavalry, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> sail of the line, seventy transports, and fifteen bombketches, were then ordered to leave Vraibleusia for the North in less than sixty minutes! 'What energy!' said Popanilla; 'what decision! what rapidity of execution!' 'Ay!' said the Aboriginal, smacking his thigh; 'let them say what they like about their proportions, and mixtures, and metals--abstract nonsense! No one can deny that our Government works well. But see! here comes another messenger!' 'O thou wisest...", "...sense--the relation of the life of man to a taper. A candle will burn some four, five, six, or seven hours. What, then, must be the daily amount of carbon going up into the air in the way of carbonic acid? What a quantity of carbon must go from each of us in respiration! A man in twenty-four hours converts as much as seven ounces of carbon into carbonic acid; a milch cow will convert seventy ounces, and a horse seventy-nine ounces, solely by the act of respiration. That is, the horse in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours burns seventy-nine ounces of charcoal, or carbon, in his organs of respiration to supply his natural warmth in that time. All the warm-blooded animals get their warmth in this way, by the conversion of carbon; not in a free state, but in a state of combination. And what an extraordinary notion this gives us of the alterations going out in our atmosphere! As much as 5,000,000 pounds of carbonic acid is formed by respiration in London alone in twenty-four hours.

Accordingly, leaving a body of musketeers to hide the movement by their fire, he withdrew the rest of his army and took up another strong position, partly on a height known as the Black Mountain, covering the entrance of the valley of St. Pierre and partly in the valley itself, thus covering his line of retreat. Had the French been able to attack early the next morning before the Bavarians had time to intrench themselves they might have won an easy victory; but for the past <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours the rain had been falling incessantly, Turenne's army had been marching on the previous day, and had been fighting for seven hours, and was incapable of further exertions, while that of Enghien was in little better plight, having passed the night in the rain on the ground it had won. After such hard fighting both commanders agreed that a twenty-four hours' halt was absolutely necessary. The day could not be termed one of rest, for there were thousands of wounded to...", "...but they now, to use his lordship's expression, barely \"crawled\" about thirty miles every twenty-four hours. \"My only hope is,\" writes the hero, \"that the enemy's fleet are near us, and in the same situation.\" By a Spanish log and chart, taken out of a small bark from La Guira to Cadiz, his lordship found that the combined fleets went in sight of Cape Blanco, and passed over to the Salvages.

The wind, however, now coming foul, his lordship expressed himself dreadfully apprehensive that the enemy would have too greatly the start of him.

He bore two sealed letters from the princess. One briefly informed him that General Braze was his successor as commander-in-chief of the army of Graustark. He hesitated long before opening the other. It was equally brief and to the point. The Iron Count's teeth came together with a savage snap as he read the signature of the princess at the end. There was no recourse. She had struck for Beverly Calhoun. He looked at his watch. It was eleven o'clock. The edict gave him <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours from the noon of that day. The gray old libertine despatched a messenger for his man of affairs, a lawyer of high standing in Edelweiss. Together they consulted until midnight. Shortly after daybreak the morning following. Count Marlanx was in the train for Vienna, never to set foot on Graustark's soil again. He was banished and his estates confiscated by the government. The ministry in Edelweiss was not slow to reopen negotiations with Dawsbergen. A proclamation...", "...he retired to bed, and slept better than he had slept for weeks, ay, for months. The elixir was his, as good as his; if he did not presently have Messer Basterga by the nape he was much mistaken. He had had the scholar watched and knew whither he was gone and that he would not return before noon. At nine o'clock, therefore, the hour at which he had directed Claude to come to him at his house, he approached the Royaumes' door. Pluming himself on the stratagem by which twice in the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours he had rid himself of an inconvenient witness, he opened the door boldly and entered. On the hearth, cap in hand, stood not Claude, but Louis. The lad wore the sneaking air as of one surprised in a shameful action, which such characters wear even when innocently employed. But his actions proved that he was not surprised. With finger on his lip, and eyes enjoining caution, he signed to the Syndic to be silent, and with head aside set the example of listening.

His own anger and hatred, too, like mists drawn up and dispersed by the sun of love that had dawned on him, had altogether vanished; the attempt against him had, as it turned out, been so futile, and he genuinely wished to have some assurance of the safety of the man, the thought of whom had so blackened his soul only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours ago. His errands took Martin the best part of an hour, and he returned with two notes, one for Mrs. Assheton, the other for Morris.

But countless ages must elapse before another critical stage of the history shall be reached. It is needless for me to ponder over the tedious process by which this interesting epoch is reached. I shall rather sketch what the actual condition of our system will be when that moment shall have arrived. The day will then have expanded from the present familiar <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours up to a day more than twice, more than five, even more than fifty times its present duration. In round numbers, we may say that this great day will occupy one thousand four hundred of our ordinary hours.

From its present distance of two hundred and forty thousand miles, the moon will describe an ever-enlarging orbit; and as it does...", "...'Moscow' the town.

Subsequently to the year 1300, however, Halley found <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> comets on which observations had been made and recorded, with a degree of precision sufficient to enable him to calculate the actual paths which these bodies followed while they were visible.

In London and Westminster over 330 books are known to have been printed; in Oxford and St. Albans only twenty-five.

The movement of the spindle is so slow that a casual observer would not notice it, there being only one revolution made in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. The object of this movement is to continually present new surface to be heated, as that which is exposed to the high temperature wears away, similarly to the carbons used in electric lighting, though much more slowly.

Great care must be exercised in preparing the pig by fasting it for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours.

He was able to combat the schemes of the Southern oligarchy composing and controlling the Cabinet of President Polk; unsuccessfully, it is true, yet with but slight diminution of his popularity at home. Nevertheless, the seeds of disunion had been borne to his State; they had taken root; and, like all evil in life, they proved self-perpetuating...", "...me I should always have an open fire, and how she wouldn't let Jacob put in the air-tight in the sitting-room, but had the fireplace kept on purpose.

The agent pitched upon by Lee for the purpose, was the sergeant-major of cavalry in his legion, John Champe by name, a young Virginian about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age. By many promises and much persuasion, Lee brought him to engage in the attempt. Champe was to make a pretended desertion to the enemy at New York. There he was to enlist in a corps which Arnold was raising, insinuate himself into some menial or military situation about his person, and watching for a favorable moment, was, with the aid of a confederate from Newark, to seize him in the night, gag him, and bring him across the Hudson into Bergen woods, in the...", "...two or three hours; the more acute the attack, the more frequently the dose is repeated; this method generally suffices to effect a cure more or less rapidly. As long as the improvement progresses satisfactorily, all we have to do is to let the medicine act without interfering.

After the lapse of this period the improvement will either have resumed its course, or else it will continue unsatisfactory. In the latter case we should give another dose of the above-mentioned solution of Apis 3. Not unfrequently I have met with patients upon whom Apis acts too powerfully, causing pains in the bowels, interminable diarrh[oe]a, of a dysenteric character, extreme prostration and a sense of fainting. In such cases the tumultuous action of Apis is...", "...in the middle of the street.

Next, the natives sent a volley of boomerangs on board, but without any result. Some of these curious weapons hit the sails and fell impotently on the deck, whilst some returned to their throwers, who were standing on the rocks about fifty yards away, near the edge of the water. I afterwards secured the boomerangs that came on board, and found that they were about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> inches in length, shaped like the blade of a sickle, and measured three or four inches across at the widest part. They were made of extremely hard wood, and were undoubtedly capable of doing considerable injury when dexterously and accurately thrown. The blacks kept up a terrific hubbub on shore, yelling like madmen, and hurling at me showers of barbed spears. The fact that they had boomerangs convinced me that I must be nearing the Australian mainland. All this time...", "...beggars shouldn't be choosers. Well, I'm not quite a beggar yet.

In general, flat and flaky clouds, clouds forming and disappearing rapidly, and clouds changing to forms at a higher level precede dry and cooler weather. It will be seen that this modern study of clouds as prognostics simply adds to the weather proverbs that have come down to us from the time of Theophrastus. It does not appear, however, that cloud forms alone can usually serve to predict rain for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, but for a few hours in advance the appearance of certain cloud forms frequently furnishes the observer more trustworthy signs of coming rain than does the synoptic weather map. To a forecaster in possession of telegraphic data, the prevalence of rapidly-moving cirrus over a wide area indicates a rapid storm movement, with sudden and marked changes of weather and of temperature, while slowly-moving cirrus indicate slight changes of temperature and dry weather.

Polaris revolves around the true pole once in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours in a little circle 2-1/2[deg] in diameter. Within this circle two hundred stars have been photographed. The North Star is always elevated as many degrees above the horizon as the observer is north of the equator.

The risk involved in attempting to save a limb should always be explained to the patient or his guardian, in order that he may share the responsibility in case of failure. Whether or not the amputation should be performed at once, depends upon the general condition of the patient. If the injury is a severe one, and attended with a profound degree of shock, it is better to wait for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> or forty-eight hours. Meanwhile the wound is purified, and the limb wrapped in a sterile dressing. Means are taken to counteract shock and to maintain the patient's strength, and evidence of infection or of haemorrhage is carefully watched for. When the shock has passed off, the operation is then performed under more favourable auspices. Clinical experience has proved that by this means the mortality of primary amputations may be materially diminished, especially in...", "...January 4, Napoleon wrote to Prince Eugene: \"My Cousin,--Within twelve hours at the most, after the receipt of this letter, you will start with all speed for Munich.

According to the report of General Donnadieu, commander of the garrison, which brought the news to the Government, the revolt had only been put down after the most desperate fighting. \"The corpses of the King's enemies,\" said the General in his despatch, \"cover all the roads for a league round Grenoble.\" [275] It was soon known that <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> prisoners had been condemned to death by court-martial, and sixteen of these actually executed: the court-martial recommended the other eight to the clemency of the Government. But the despatches of Donnadieu had thrown the Cabinet into a panic. Decazes, the most liberal of the Ministers, himself signed the hasty order requiring the remaining prisoners to be put to death. They perished; and when it was too late the Government learnt that Donnadieu's narrative was a mass of...", "...of the boat. On quitting the ship the distance of Fayal was two hundred and sixty leagues, or about nine hundred English miles. Their provisions were a bag of bread, a small ham, a single piece of pork, two quart bottles of water, and a few of French cordials. One biscuit, divided into twelve morsels, was served for breakfast, and the same for dinner; the neck of a bottle broken off, with the cork in, supplied the place of a glass; and this filled with water was the allowance for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours for each man. On the fifteenth day, they had only one day's bread, and one bottle of water remaining of a second supply of rain; on this day Matthews, a quarter-master, the stoutest man in the boat, perished of hunger and cold. This poor man, on the day before, had complained of want of strength in his throat, as he expressed it, to swallow his morsel; and, in the night, drank salt-water, grew delirious, and died without a groan. Hitherto despair and gloom had been...", "...to obtain the true spirit of love for God and man, \"purity of heart and simplicity of intention,\" than it is to carry out the cold letter of the law. The Lord has instituted the fast on a reasonable and intelligent basis, and none of his works are vain or unwise. His law is perfect in this as in other things. Hence, those who can are required to comply thereto; it is a duty from which they cannot escape; but let it be remembered that the observance of the fast day by abstaining <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours from food and drink is not an absolute rule, it is no iron-clad law to us, but it is left with the people as a matter of conscience, to exercise wisdom and discretion. Many are subject to weakness, others are delicate in health, and others have nursing babies; of such it should not be required to fast. Neither should parents compel their little children to fast. I have known children to cry for something to eat on fast day. In such cases, going without {307} food will...", "...one of them died of it about the same time. Medical writings leave the same impression of smallpox attacking many after the age of childhood. Willis gives four cases, all of adults. Morton gives sixty-six clinical cases of smallpox, the earliest record of the kind, and one that might pass as modern: twelve of the cases are under six years of age, nine are at ages from seven to twelve, eleven from thirteen years to twenty, seven from twenty-two to forty, and all but two of the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> clearly indicated in the text, in one way or another, as adolescents or adults, the result being that 23 cases are under twelve and 43 cases over twelve[830]. That ratio of adults to children may have been exceptional.

But if Morton had practised in...", "...moving to a new and milder climate would have been fatal, the subjects dying of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae at the end of a few minutes--and a rope.

They mostly recovered on reaching Austin, and many invalids began to feel better and consider themselves out of danger as soon as they crossed the Brancos River.

Did you ever sun yourself, at midnight, at a picnic? Or try to sleep in a land where there is no such thing as night?

But he was a Protestant by education, a thinker by nature, a rationalist by conviction. That was one bitter grief. Another was her childlessness. She had been married <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years; no child had sprung from the union. This was a continual grief which imbittered her whole existence. Since then I have seen a portrait of her at twenty--a splendid brunette, with high spirit and resolute will and noble beauty in every line. Ah, me! What wretches we become! Sadness and bitterness, proud aloofness and a yearning wistfulness were subtly mingled in the demeanor of Graefin von Rothenfels. She bowed to us, as Frau Mittendorf introduced us.

Three were sent to the penitentiary, seven to the reform school and fourteen let go temporarily on good behavior. A friend of mine interested in criminology tells me the great bulk of hold-ups, thefts, burglaries and murders are committed by boys between 16 and 22 years of age. These <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> boys I mentioned were just ordinary boys, capable of making good citizens if they had had the right kind of home treatment and surroundings. Most of them got in trouble through their association with the \"gang\" or the \"bunch,\" or the \"crowd,\" and this because daddy didn't have his hand on the rein.

Thus a cubic foot of water weighs sixty-two and a half pounds, or 1000 ounces avoirdupois, but changed to gold, the cubic foot weighs more than half a ton, and would be equal to about 19,300 ounces--hence the relation between the cubic foot of water and that of [Page 51] gold is nearly as 1...", "...ones.

Sir Thomas Maitland died suddenly while yet in the prime of life, and was succeeded by Sir Horace, then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age. In the enjoyments of society, of travel, and of those thousand luxuries, mental and physical, which fortune secures, three years passed rapidly away with the young, handsome, and accomplished Baronet.

As for his dimensions, they should not be taken too literally. In their rapid and anxious march the Greek commanders had no time to wield the plumb-line or the measuring-chain; they must have trusted mainly to their eyes in arriving at a notion of the true size of the buildings by which their attention was attracted.

For that day at least he lost heart; for nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a hunted man.

Jim considered at first whether it wouldn't rather even up things if he went without his supper, but the biscuits and the boiled beef were so tempting, and in those days boys could eat the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours round.

On the 24th August, 1623, a case occupied the attention of the members of the Kirk-Session of Kinghorn. It was proved that a man named William Allan had been guilty of abusing his wife on the Sabbath, and for the offence was condemned to be placed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours in the stocks, and subsequently to stand in the jougs two hours on a market day. It was further intimated to him that if he again abused his wife, he would be banished from the town.

We will leave the reader to imagine what passed between Francisco and Edward after the discovery of their kindred, and proceed to state the contents of the packet, which the twin-brothers now opened in the presence of Clara alone. We must, however, condense the matter, which was very voluminous. It stated that Cain, whose real name was Charles Osborne, had sailed in a fine schooner from Bilboa, for the coast of Africa, to procure a cargo of slaves; and had been out about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours when the crew perceived a boat, apparently with no one in her, floating about a mile ahead of them. The water was then smooth, and the vessel had but little way. As soon as they came up with the boat, they lowered down their skiff to examine her. The men sent in the skiff soon returned, towing the boat alongside. Lying at the bottom of the boat were found several men almost dead, and reduced to skeletons, and in the stern-sheets a negro woman, with a child at her...", "...sentry, \"_Qui vive!_\" \"_France_,\" replied one of Wolfe's officers, who spoke French. \"_A quel regiment?_\" \"_De la Reine_,\" was the reply, and thinking the boats were under the control of Frenchmen carrying provisions to Montcalm, the sentry let them pass. Later when challenged by another sentry, the same English officer said in French: \"Provision-boats.

It was with much difficulty that Wolfe's army succeeded, by seizing hold of trees and bushes, in getting to the top with muskets, cannons, and supplies. At daybreak, Wolfe chose as the field of battle the Plains of Abraham, a high stretch of land extending along the river just above the town. The brave Montcalm,...", "...and so on, and water-cylinders were put on from 0 to 2,000 metres. This, however, took six hours. Next day, on account of the heavy sea, only a few samples from 0 to 100 metres (54 fathoms) were taken. On the third day we made another attempt to get the bottom. This time we got specimens of the sea-bed from about 4,500 metres (about 2,500 fathoms); but the heaving in and taking of water samples and temperatures occupied eight hours, from 7 a.m. till 3 p.m., or a third part of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. In this way we should want at least nine months on the route that had been laid down; but as, unfortunately, this time was not at our disposal, we at once gave up taking specimens of the bottom and samples of water at greater depths than 1,000 metres (546 fathoms). For the remainder of the trip we took temperatures and samples of water at the following depths: 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, and 1,000 metres (0, 2 3/4, 5 1/2, 13 1/2, 27,...", "...Another day the head man had disappeared.

After marriage the rules which ordered her life were not nearly so restricting. In 1614 certain regulations were passed with regard to dress and household extravagances--the amount of money to be spent on dress, liveries, gondolas, jewellery, feasts and entertainments, gold and silver plate, and even the dishes and the menus of dinner-parties. All these were limited. The earliest nobility consisted of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> families who ruled as tribunes over the twelve islands of the lagoons that formed the Venetian State. Some of these families are still represented in Venice. In the year 1296 a rigid and definite aristocracy was formed.

He was commander-in-chief from the start. When he didn't look more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age he was already an old general--ever since the taking of Toulon, where he first began to show the rest of them that they didn't know anything about the handling of cannon.

I soon discovered what it was--that it came from the promulgation of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> regular toasts, which savored of the new doctrine of nullification; and which, acting on some previous misgivings, began to spread the feeling, that the dinner was got up to inaugurate that doctrine, and to make Mr. Jefferson its father.

One of them, Schultz, immediately asked me if we were not the parties who had held a meeting in a school-room in this place <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years ago. We entered very fully into the awakening that had taken place in this neighborhood. The spiritual seed of Tersteegen has never died out; and they told us of a person, Muehlenbeck, in Sarn, who represents those who are acquainted with the interior life. The youngest minister said directly, I will fetch him. In an hour's time he came again, accompanied by a middle-aged man, much like a good old Friend.

In 1662 the commendatory abbot of La Trappe, Armand Jean le Bouthilier de Rance', a nobleman who abandoned wealth and a brilliant career, visited La Trappe, undertook a new reform of the Cistercian rule, and thus became the founder of that branch of this Order which became known as the congregation of La Trappe. In consequence of the Revolution of 1789, one of the Trappist Fathers, Dom Augustin conducted <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> of his brethren from France to Valsainte, in Switzerland. Here they decided to adopt a rule still more strict than that which they had hitherto observed. This step occasioned a division in the Trappist Order: some monasteries following the rule of Valsainte, others that of de Rance'. An appeal to Rome resulted in a decree dated October 3rd, 1834, by which all Trappist monasteries were placed under one government. The decree not having however had the desired effect, the...", "...And Titania told him: \"By the Lord,\" said Bradstock, \"they are damned good chaps! but where the devil are we?\" He went down-stairs when the doctor came and told everything to Goring.

One of these methods is to place some substance, such as barium chloride, in a calorimeter, noting at what point the mercury remains stationary. Radium is then introduced, whereupon the mercury in the tube gradually rises, falling again when the radium is removed. By careful tests it has been determined that a gram of radium emits about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hundred gram-calories in twenty-four hours. On this basis a gram of radium in a year emits enough energy to dissociate about two hundred and twenty-five grams of water.

This latent energy must be enormous, but is only manifested when the atom is breaking up.

At the beginning of this century, according to Caire, they were worth no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> francs (or about five dollars) the carat, and for a long time antecedent to 1850 they were valued at only fifteen dollars the carat. Since this period they have become very rare, and their valuation has advanced enormously. In fact, the value of the emerald now exceeds that of the diamond, and is rapidly approaching the ratio fixed by Benevenuto Cellini in the middle of the sixteenth century, which rated the emerald at four times, and the ruby at eight times, the value of...", "...enjoy.

At least, these were her principal objections. I said, on mature consideration, I didn't see why Mrs. Simmons shouldn't come to tea, that there were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours for all necessary thinking, and that a gallon of nerve tincture, if required, could be at her disposal in ten minutes. \"Being Protestants,\" I added, \"I suppose a convent wouldn't be of any use to us--what do you think?\" Momma thought she could go.

He will probably be arrested within the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. It appears to be a clear case. He threatened her--in front of us all.

Frithiof, the son of Thorsten, went to his father's hall, the mighty Framness. For twelve miles in all directions stretched his broad acres. The hilltops were covered with birch forests. On the sloping sides grew the golden corn and the tall rye. Many blue lakes gleamed like mirrors. Streams rippled over the pebbly beds. In the wide valleys herds of oxen and sheep were quietly grazing, and in the stables were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> steeds swift as the whirlwind. In the great hall built of choicest fir more than five hundred warriors gathered at Yule-time. A great table of oak, polished and shining, ran through the middle from end to end. The floor was covered with straw, and on the hearth in the centre of the hall a warm and cheerful fire was always burning. On the great nails in the hall hung helmets and coats-of-mail. Between them flashed swords and sparkling shields. Round the table sat...", "...one behind fatally wounded, the other dead. But the man upon the stretcher leaped up and ran away as fast as his legs could carry him, never stopping to look behind at his unfortunate companions.

The unexpected encounter with the rebels in the Wilderness had hindered the two corps thus long, and as might have been expected the time was not left unimproved by General Lee.

Our army was brought into position on the north side of the stream, and arrangements commenced for a general assault. Sharp picket...", "...of prudence to prepare for that event. On the 12th of March, Mr. Sedgewick moved several resolutions, the objects of which were to raise a military force, and to authorize the President to lay an embargo. The armament was to consist of fifteen thousand men, who should be brought into actual service in case of war with any European power, but not until war should break out. In the mean time, they were to receive pay while assembled for the purpose of discipline, which was not to exceed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> days in each year. After stating the motives which led to the introduction of these resolutions, they were laid on the table for the consideration of the members. Two days afterwards, a motion was made to take up that which related to an embargo; but this motion was negatived for the purpose of resuming the consideration of the commercial regulations which had been offered by Mr. Madison. On the motion of Mr. Nicholas, those resolutions were amended so as to subject the...", "...that Archelaus spoke the truth when he announced that he had come home. His legs were old and stiff, but after pottering all the morning after his brother, who suddenly felt years younger through sheer force of contrast, he followed him obstinately out to the four-acre field, where Ishmael had hoped to get away from him. And Ishmael watched the rolling, as he had only the day before watched the sowing, but with a sinking of the heart instead of the lightening that had been his only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours earlier. The mere presence of Archelaus, though they were now both old men, past rivalry, held for him an antagonism he could hide but could not keep himself from feeling. As the ridgy clods flattened out to a level of purplish fawn beneath the one passing of the cumbrous roller, that yet looked so small behind the huge mare, Ishmael felt his spirits being as flattened as the four-acre itself.

It was, however, scanty. He took only six-eighths of a grain of sulphate of morphine in the first twenty hours. It was then increased, so that in the next <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours he took two grains of the sulphate in divided doses--a quantity which has been greatly exceeded in hundreds of cases with the best results; but in this case coma was the result. At 10 A.M. on Sunday he was comatose, but not profoundly; he could be aroused. The breaths were five in the minute, the pulse increasing in frequency; secretion of urine next to none. The galvanic battery was used.

In the majority of cases, however, it is ushered in by vomiting once or oftener, accompanied by headache, heaviness, of head, great heat of skin, and some measure of sore-throat. The brain is easily disturbed in children, as has already been said, and delirium at night during the first <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours of an attack of scarlet fever need not excite anxiety, for it then often passes away, and the disease runs a perfectly favourable course.

At last he tempted the longed-for question from Osra's shy smiling lips. \"Why would you not mourn, sir, if you were a Prince?\" said she. \"For Princes and Princesses have their share of sighs.\" And with a very plaintive sigh Osra looked at the rapid running river, as she waited for his answer. \"Because then I would go to Strelsau and so forget her.\" \"But you are at...", "...of the Renaissance. The students who carve the first gashes in the new desks will learn, if perchance they listen in intervals of whittling, that this World on which they live is perhaps not flat, but actually round, like a ball.

All physiologists agree that from twenty to forty ounces pass off through the skin of an adult in usual health every twenty-four hours.

We can thus see ample reason why checked perspiration proves so detrimental to health; for every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours during which such a state continues, we must either have this amount of useless and hurtful matter accumulating in the system, or some of the other organs of excretion must be greatly overtasked, which obviously can not happen without disturbing their regularity and well-being.

A hardening of the plants, by leaving the sash off the hotbeds, or setting the plants in shallow boxes and placing the boxes in a sheltered position through May, not forgetting a liberal supply of water, will fit the plants to take kindly to the final planting out. Plant out roots or started plants when there is no longer danger of frost. For mass effects, the plants may stand twelve to eighteen inches apart; for individual bloom twenty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> inches or more.

No other dietetic or hygienic change was made at the time, by which the direct effects of the tobacco might have been complicated and obscured.

They are then immersed in a solution of the chloride of potash, originally of the strength of 1.0625, and afterwards reduced with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> times its measure with water. When the preparation is good, these proportions will whiten cotton goods completely in eight hours. In this steep they are, however, generally suffered to remain twelve hours.

I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first illegitimately, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours afterwards legitimately, with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate pollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen.

Never, never before, did I have such a wearisome task! It makes me shudder to think of it now, and that was not all. In the same way I had to carry the twenty-four handfuls of hay to the stable, and then it was supper time, and I had to wait upon all the others.

There was one case brought to us that afternoon, however, that was quite beyond our skill.

A couple of battalions lined the shore; the guns fired the usual salute as we started on our voyage; the flotilla, composed of two steamers, respectively of thirty-two and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> horsepower, and thirty-one sailing vessels, with a military force of about 800 men, got away in tolerable order. The powerful current of the Blue Nile quickly swept us past Khartoum, and having rounded the point, we steamed up the grand White Nile.

These facts which geology unquestionably demonstrates have thrown sectarian theologians into dismay. The dogmas concerning the creation formulated with so much pomp and circumstance by the apostate churches of Christendom, respectable only for their antiquity, are going to pieces before the facts discovered by geologists and churchmen, or theologians, call them which you will, are filled with alarm lest all confidence be lost in revelation; and many of...", "...about 140,000. About 13,000 of these were slaves. Nearly 30,000 of the best citizenship were fighting in the Confederate ranks. The city was on the verge of starvation. More than a third of the population had no money and no means of earning it. Prices rose enormously. Butler contributed a thousand dollars of his own money to relieve the suffering. Supplies were hurried from all sources and sold under Butler's orders at cost to those who had funds. The price of flour fell from sixty to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> dollars a barrel. Butler proved to be a great organizer. The people were set to work cleaning and improving their city. His administration was always humane. The execution of a gambler who tore down the American Flag from the mint, and the condemning of a gang of thugs was his only show of the iron hand.

Originally written in Icelandic, it was translated into Danish and submitted to the Royal Theatre, a fortress difficult of access to the newcomer. This theatre did not even fully recognise such masters as Ibsen and Bjornson until they stood on the heights of achievement. Our author was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years old, unknown, and offering his first play. From the outset \"Hadda Padda\" caused the directors unexpected trouble. It took them four times as long as usual to come to a decision. They finally accepted it \"on account of its literary merit,\" but without any obligation on their part to produce it, as the scenery of the last act was of \"such daring and dangerous character.\" There was but one thing to do and Mr. Kamban did it.

So few indeed did it possess in the eyes of Europeans that none ever went there save those whom an inexorable fate compelled. The rickety, wooden bungalows scattered about the cantonment were temporary lodgings, not abiding-places.

But that was a <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours' journey away, and the men had to be content with an occasional week's leave from the depths of their inferno, unless, as Tommy Denvers put it, they were lucky enough to go sick, in which case their sojourn in paradise was prolonged, much to the delight of the angels.

It is a strange coincidence that the representatives of Seymour, after his death, claimed for him some share in the invention of _Pickwick_.

Seymour never originated nor suggested \"an incident, a phrase, or a word,\" and died when only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> pages had been published. The very name originally belonged to a celebrated coach proprietor of Bath; and even the immortal figure of Mr. Pickwick is but a faithful portrait of Dickens's model, a Mr. Foster, who lived at the time at Richmond.

The Pacific mail steamers connecting with a railroad across the isthmus at last shortened the time of this trip of six thousand miles to twenty-five days. For ten years all the Eastern mail came this way twice a month.

To do this a rider, with the mail-bag slung over his shoulder, rode a horse <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> miles to the next station, where a fresh pony was ready. Hardly waiting to eat or sleep, the rider galloped on again. Five dollars was often charged at that time to bring the letter railroads carry now for two cents.

BARNES, Chapman, Dickinson county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-seven years; have an apple orchard of six acres old enough to be at their best. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan, and Winesap, and for family use Early Harvest, Red June, Maiden's Blush, and Missouri Pippin. I prefer a low bottom with a black loam, and a north slope. I prefer two-year-old, well-balanced trees, set in holes large enough to receive them, twenty-four by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> feet. I cultivate my young orchard to corn and potatoes, using a disc harrow, and cease cropping when they begin to bear. I plant nothing in a bearing orchard.

A white flag is raised on the British works. The roar of the cannon ceases. Cornwallis sends an officer to ask that fighting be stopped for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. Twenty-four hours! No! \"No more fighting for two hours,\" says Washington. Held in an iron grasp both by land and by sea, the British commander knows that all is lost. He can do nothing but surrender. At two o'clock on the afternoon of October 19, in a field not far from Washington's headquarters, the formal surrender takes place. This ceremony, so joyful to the one side, so painful to the other, is carried out in stately form. The officers on both sides wear...", "...in without losing the precious moment: \"Who set my house on fire, Tex?\" he demanded.

On this ship Paul Jones claims to have hoisted with his own hands the original flag of the Revolution--the pine-tree and rattlesnake flag--the first time it was ever displayed.

The bow of the sledge was almost at my feet, when--whizz! I was dropping down through space. The length of the hauling rope was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> feet, and I was at the end of it. I cannot say that \"my past life flashed before me.\" I just had time to think \"Now for the jerk--will my harness hold?\" when there was a wrench, and I was hanging breathless over the blue depth.

Sixty-one of the remaining cases were for murder, thirteen for being suspected of murder, six for theft, etc. During one week last spring, when I kept a careful record, thirteen Negroes were lynched in three of our Southern States; and not one was even charged with rape. All of these thirteen were accused of murder or house-burning; but in neither case were the men allowed to go before a court, so that their innocence...", "...very small parroquets, of beautiful green and red colors, which talk as little.

There are many very large scorpions in the rivers and creeks, and a great number of crocodiles, which are very bloodthirsty and cruel. They quite commonly pull from their bancas the natives who go in those boats, and cause many injuries among the horned cattle and the horses of the stock-farms, when they go to drink.

For that reason, the natives...", "...white in the limpid water as the mass was jerked out of our sight. \"The bowmen, however, attracted my attention, and one of them sang out, as he pointed with his finger, 'I say, Mr. Cleveland, here's the captain and his priest lying in the belly of the top-sail!' \"I walked forward, while the men fired a few pistols to scare away the birds, and looked in.

One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> steps were dug to accomplish the ascent, and enable the good people to go to prayers.

After being washed in cold water, the hides are treated with a weak solution of lactic, boracic, or butyric acid, or butyrate of ammonia, to remove all trace of lime, when they are ready to be chrome-tanned. After chroming them, neutralisation of the acid chrome salts is effected with borax, and the leather is ready for dressing. The principal...", "...movement, of duration and extent inexpressible in figures, in which the Supreme Spirit alternately emits and reabsorbs the universe. As a rule the higher religious life aims at some form of union or close association with the deity, beyond the sphere of this process. In the evolutionary process the Vaishnavas interpolate between the Supreme Spirit and the phenomenal world the phases of conditioned spirit known as Sankarshana, etc.; in the same way the Sivaite schools increase the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> _tattvas_ of the Sankhya to thirty-six.[785] The first of these _tattvas_ or principles is Siva, corresponding to the highest Brahman. The next phase is Sadasiva in which differentiation commences owing to the movement of Sakti, the active or female principle. Siva in this phase is thought of as having a body composed of _mantras_. Sakti, also known as Bindu or Suddhamaya, is sometimes regarded as a separate _tattva_ but more generally as inseparably united with Siva. The...", "...Ante-rooms. M. Committee Waiting-room. N.

It will be well to mention here that the horizontal measure of 24 feet, which we have seen as the unit in the plan of the Building Committee, is also preserved in the present plan; every horizontal dimension of which is either a certain number of times or divisions of twenty-four feet. The avenues into which the plan is divided are formed by hollow cast-iron columns <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> feet apart, which rise in one, two, and three storeys respectively, to support the roof at the different heights given above; in the lower storey these columns are nineteen feet high, and in the two upper ones seventeen feet. Between the different lengths of the columns short pieces are introduced, called \"connecting-pieces,\" from the office they perform; these are three feet long, and are so contrived that they serve to support girders in horizontal tiers, dividing the...", "...to embark upon the Charente, I crossed the furrows, and gathered a few blue-bottles and poppies. We soon arrived at the place of embarkation, where we found some of our fellow passengers, who, like myself, seemed casting a last look to Heaven, whilst they were yet on the French soil.--We embarked, however and left these happy shores. In descending the tortuous course of the Charente, contrary winds so impeded our progress, that we did not reach the Medusa till the morrow, having taken <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours in sailing four leagues. At length we mounted the deck of the Medusa, of painful memory. When we got on board, we found our berths not provided for us, consequently were obliged to remain indiscriminately together till the next day. Our family, which consisted of nine persons, was placed in a berth near the main deck. As the wind was still contrary, we lay at anchor for seventeen days. On the 17th of June, at four in the morning, we set sail as did the whole...", "...which you may know by taking up some in your spoon, put it in moulds; when cold, turn it out into your dish; it should be so transparent as to let you see all the flowers of your china dish through it, and quite white. _Crab Jam or Jelly._ Pare and core the crabs; to fifteen pounds of crabs take ten pounds of sugar, moistened with a little water; boil them well, skimming the top.

But it must be recollected that his first letter asking terms was received about 10 o'clock A.M., July 3d. It then could hardly be expected that it would take <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours to effect a surrender. He knew that Johnston was in our rear for the purpose of raising the siege, and he naturally would want to hold out as long as he could. He knew his men would not resist an assault, and one was expected on the fourth. In our interview he told me he had rations enough to hold out for some time--my recollection is two weeks. It was this statement that induced me to insert in the terms that he was to draw rations for his men from his own...", "...Margaret once more embarked for lake travel, and her next chapter describes Wisconsin, at that time \"a Territory, not yet a State; still nearer the acorn than we were.\" Milwaukee was then a small town, promising, as she says, \"to be, some time, a fine one.\" The yellow brick, of which she found it mostly built, pleased her, as it has pleased the world since. No railroads with mysterious initials served, in those days, the needs of that vast region. The steamer, arriving once in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, brought mails and travellers, and a little stir of novelty and excitement. Going a day's journey into the adjacent country, Margaret and her companions found such accommodation as is here mentioned:-- \"The little log-cabin where we slept, with its flower-garden in front, disturbed the scene no more than a lock upon a fair cheek. The hospitality of that house I may well call princely; it was the boundless hospitality of the heart, which, if it has no Aladdin's lamp...", "...or engraver of the cuts.[VI-38] As Holbein is not certainly known to be the painter or designer of any other Dance of Death which might merit the high praise conveyed in Bourbon's verses, to what other work of his will they apply? Even supposing, as I do, that the alphabet of the Dance of Death was designed by Holbein, I conceive it \"next to impossible,\" to use the words of Mr. Douce, that Bourbon should have described Holbein as having attained immortality through the fame of those <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> small letters, a perfect set of which I believe is not to be found in any single volume. That Bourbon _did_ know who was the designer of the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death there can scarcely be the shadow of a doubt; he was at Lyons in the year in which the work was published; he was connected with the printers; and another work, the Icones Historiarum Veteris Testamenti, also published by them in 1538, has at the commencement a copy of verses written by Bourbon, from...", "...were suspended in the air really above the spectators, and not simply a pattern painted on the surface of the plaster; this method was perfected by Correggio, but was never practised successfully by a Florentine.

Less than ten days afterwards he inquired for his artist. The Cardinal of Pavia wrote an autograph letter to the Signory of Florence on the 21st, urgently requesting that they would despatch Michael Angelo immediately to that town, inasmuch as the Pope was impatient for his arrival, and wanted to employ him on important works. On November 27 Soderini wrote to the Cardinal of Pavia introducing Michael Angelo and praising the cartoon the artist had to leave...", "...insurrection broke out in Scotland, and King James III., as well as Mary, the queen-mother, were prayed for in the churches. When Mary Beatrice heard this she was in an agony of suspense, because she had had no news of her son for nearly three weeks. She knew that he had left Lorraine, and vague reports had reached her of his being in different parts of France in disguise, when suddenly one day he appeared before her at Chaillot in the habit of a monk. The chevalier spent only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours with his mother, and then bade her farewell to set out on a journey fraught with danger. Spies were everywhere, and the identity of the strange monk was soon made known to his enemies. He started from Chaillot in one of the post carriages belonging to the Baron de {327}Breteul, a warm partisan of the Stuarts. The chevalier was still disguised as a monk, and travelled attended by some horsemen who wore the livery of his friend, the baron. At the village of Nonancourt a...", "...Khartoum. The whole army broke camp at Royan on the 28th of August at four o'clock in the afternoon, and marched to Wady el Abid six miles further south. We now moved on a broad front, which could immediately be converted into a fighting formation. This was the first time that it had been possible to see the whole force--infantry, cavalry, and guns--on the march at once. In the clear air the amazing detail of the picture was striking. There were six brigades of infantry, composed of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> battalions; yet every battalion showed that it was made up of tiny figures, all perfectly defined on the plain. A Soudanese brigade had been sent on to hold the ground with pickets until the troops had constructed a zeriba. But a single Dervish horseman managed to evade these and, just as the light faded, rode up to the Warwickshire Regiment and flung his broad-bladed spear in token of defiance. So great was the astonishment which this unexpected apparition created that the...", "...but a very fertile country, resembling that we passed yesterday, the people on shore, on our landing and demanding whereabouts Dongola was, informed us that we were in Dongola, meaning the country so called. On our asking where was the city or town of Dongola, they pointed to a large village in the distance on the west bank of the river, and told us that village was called \"New Dongola,\" and that Old Dongola was farther up the river. They informed us that the Pasha had left a guard of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> soldiers here, and had proceeded with the army three days' march farther up the river, where we should find him. We determined to proceed to his encampment. We saw to-day, for the first time, a small sail boat, constructed by the people of the country; it was very clumsy, resembling a log canoe. The river, in some places which we passed to-day, appeared to be about three miles from bank to bank, but shallow; the islands and shores presenting the same spectacle of luxuriant...", "...the preceese word--except as a passenger, ye'll understand, Janet.\" * * * * * McPhee kept his word. He and Janet went for a voyage as passengers in the first-class saloon. They paid seventy pounds for their berths; and Janet found a very sick woman in the second-class saloon, so that for sixteen days she lived below, and chatted with the stewardesses at the foot of the second-saloon stairs while her patient slept. McPhee was a passenger for exactly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. Then the engineers' mess--where the oilcloth tables are--joyfully took him to its bosom, and for the rest of the voyage that company was richer by the unpaid services of a highly certificated engineer.

Because, as he himself says, he has so vivid an imagination that what he lacks he can \"make believe\" he has, and the pleasure of possession is his. Kinney gives a great deal of thought to his clothes, and the question of what he should wear on his vacation was upon his mind. When I said I thought it was nothing to worry about, he snorted indignantly. \"YOU wouldn't!\"...", "...no there were such things in the second cellar belonging to her store!... Who had been most surprised then? Why who but Mother Toulouche, who, until that very minute, had not known that this second cellar existed! How then was she to know that it communicated with the sewer, still less that the sewer opened on to the Seine, and that by the Seine arrived bales of smuggled goods, which were concealed in her cellar by the smugglers?... Fortunately, the judges had understood this, and after <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours' detention on suspicion, Mother Toulouche had been set at liberty! At first, she had declared that she did not know the accused persons summoned to appear that day, the Cooper in particular; to tell the truth, she had made a mistake; she did know them, through having met them a long time ago, when she lived near la Capelle; so long ago was it that she had forgotten all about it!

The French admiral, Latouche Treville, had moored in front of the pier a line of gun-vessels, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> in number, fastened together from end to end. At these, and at the shipping in the small port, some bombs were thrown. Not much injury was done on either side. Prevented by an easterly wind from going on to Flushing, as he had intended, Nelson returned to Margate on the 6th of August, issued a proclamation to the Fencibles, assuring them that the French undoubtedly intended an invasion, that their services were absolutely required at once on board the defence-ships, and...", "...I do not care for death.

In the opposite angle of the chimney-place, a lad of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years, no other than Claudet, called by the friendly nickname of the grand chasserot, kept company with the notary, while he toyed, in an absent fashion, with the silky ears of a spaniel, whose fluffy little head lay in his lap.

Great excitement prevailed throughout the United States, for there had been a leak and the news had gone abroad regarding the message from the enemy. There was widespread panic and disorder and the government was besieged with demands for authentic news. The <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours of grace had nearly expired.

They seemed to be waiting for him to come, and led the way to the secret passage in the earth. Ha'penny went down, staff in hand, and easily passed through the first iron door. As he neared the second door, he heard a confused noise beyond it of cries and lamentations. He opened the door softly, and crept into the garden unobserved. There he saw the dying witch, who, as witches always require <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours to die in, was lying on the ground writhing horribly, groaning, and shrieking to her snakes to multiply, which they did until almost the whole garden was one seething, wriggling mass of the horrible creatures.

The day after the brother and sister reached the city where they lived, they summoned a goldsmith, and had him make a gold chain, and fasten the bird with it. The next time the aunts looked out they saw in the window of the palace opposite the Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird. \"Well,\" said they, \"the real trouble is coming now!\" The bird directed the brother and sister to procure a carriage finer than the king's, with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> attendants, and to have the service of their palace, cooks, and servants, more numerous and better than the king's. All of which the brother and sister did at once. And when the aunts saw these things they were ready to die of rage.

For some reason it was spared in the general destruction of pagan monuments which took place in 1819, and it was still almost intact when the missionary Ellis visited and described it a few years later. It was a compact building, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> feet long by sixteen feet wide, built of the most durable timber, and thatched with leaves. It stood on a bed of lava jutting out into the sea, and was surrounded by a strong fence, leaving a paved area in front and at the two ends.

One day out of ten amounts to thirty six days and a half in a year. Hence, if we suppose the practice to be persisted in forty years, two entire years of the snuff-taker's life will be devoted to tickling his nose, and two more to blowing it.\" The same author proposes in a subsequent essay to show, that from the expense of snuff, snuff-boxes, and handkerchiefs, a fund might be formed to pay off the English National...", "...me--to lend him the sap of energy, why who knows?

He was now <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age, of brilliant parts, no mean scholar, an admirable athlete, and ambitious to raise the name of Scotland among the nations. His weakness lay mainly in a boyish impulsiveness, which often caused him to mar well-laid plans on the spur of the moment, and in an exaggerated fondness for chivalric ideas more appropriate to a knight-errant than to a king or a leader of armies. Perkin appealed to him as early as 1492; and before the pretender's expedition sailed,...", "...are excellent, but moving pictures are so trying upon the eyes, and the air of the theaters is so bad, that a deaf child whose eyes are his only salvation, and whose health is doubly important, should not even know of their existence till he is seven or eight years old.

At the end of the manuscript is the date: \"28 October, 1913\"; place: \"Yasnaya Polyana,\" and signature: \"Countess Sophie Tolstoy.\" All this is in typewriting. [F] This is a mistake of S. A. T.

She re-wrote Chapter 4. In her new...", "...and regiment re-enlisted. They sent us home in squads, and when it came my turn I was laid up with the mumps and could not go with my father. While I was north on my furlough Gen. Grant assumed command of the army confronting Gen. Lee and preparations were made for active operations. My father wrote me that our regiment had received orders to be ready to go to the front at an hour's notice. My furlough had several days to run but I took the first train for Washington and in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours walked into camp. I found our regiment all ready and awaiting orders. Field tents, rubber blankets and other things were issued to us which indicated that we were to take the field. CHAPTER VII. OFF FOR THE FRONT. The next day we assembled at Fort Corcoran. The regiment had been filled up with recruits until there were about 1,800 men on the rolls. Probably 1,500 were present for duty when we left to join the Army of the Potomac. We were ordered to...", "...Mrs. Gibson a liar, and added her solicitations to have that part of the history suspended. On a subsequent visit, the sister who had represented herself as only a neighbor, repeated the statements that been previously made by her and her brother with a few more variations and contradictions. For instance she remarked that the papers said John was a boy of eight years old when he was first put in the cage, or little room, \"Now that is false, for he was between twenty-three and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> when he went insane.\" On the previous day she had said that he went crazy when he was trying to get into the High School. TRYING TO GET GIBSON AWAY. On June 16th, Alderman Kerr gave one of the sisters, Mary Ann Hurtt, who resides at 707 Girard Avenue, a hearing on the charge of tampering with the witness, Mrs. Gibson's son. Mr. Thomas J.

Why, they figured it up, and the thing could crush enough stone in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours to pave the streets a foot thick all over town and thirteen miles in the country. To run it a week would bankrupt the State of Wisconsin, It could go up to the stone quarry and tunnel a hole right through the hill.

This pasha had risen to his post from the humble position of woodcutter at the palace, through the intrigues of his wife, who had been a slave in the Sultan's harem. The Czar, on his part, had collected his forces in the south of Poland and marched into Moldavia. The two armies met on the River Pruth. The Russian army, already greatly reduced in number by want of food and disease, numbered no more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> thousand men. The Ottomans, who had been reinforced by a large body of Tartars, under the Khan of the Crimea, were at least five times more numerous. The Czar Peter, unaware that the Ottomans had crossed the Danube, advanced rashly on the right bank of the Pruth, and was posted between that river and an extensive marsh not far from Zurawna. The position was dominated by hills, which the Grand Vizier occupied in force, and his numerous and powerful guns swept the position of...", "...sentences.

Poisson in a paper read on the 20th of June 1808, was once more attacked by Lagrange with all his pristine vigour and fertility of invention.

In Rhyd Ddu a man might know the complete tragic or joyous meaning of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, with solemn passages from starlight to dawn and manifold song from sunrise to dusk. There was no illusion in such a day, so that when he came to the Edge of the Great Confine, sharper than the ridge of his own thatched roof, that, too, seemed merely a part of the general illusion.

He began to apprehend the access of an inflammatory disorder; but in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours the symptoms entirely subsided. In four days afterwards he experienced an attack precisely similar; and he then recollected, that having, on both occasions, arrived from the country late in the evening, he had ordered a plate of toasted Gloucester cheese, of which he had partaken heartily; a dish which, when at home, regularly served him for supper. He attributed his illness to the cheese. The circumstance was mentioned to the mistress of the inn, who expressed great...", "...angry. \"Do not believe him, your Majesty!\" he cried. \"It is a trick, and meant to deceive you.\" \"I did not accuse you,\" answered the king, sternly. Then he added: \"I wish to be alone with this young gentleman.\" The minister left the room with an anxious face and hanging head. \"Now,\" said Rob, \"let's look over the record of the past day and see if that fellow has been up to any mischief.\" He turned the cylinder of the Record to \"England,\" and slowly the events of the last <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours were reproduced, one after the other, upon the polished plate. Before long the king uttered an exclamation. The Record pictured a small room in which were seated three gentlemen engaged in earnest conversation. One of them was the accused minister. \"Those men,\" said the king in a low voice, while he pointed out the other two, \"are my avowed enemies.

A short consultation among themselves followed this proposal, at the end of which they declared themselves quite willing, but stipulated that they should have <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours clear after signing, in which to provide themselves with an outfit for the voyage. To this I also assented, and we then separated, they to make their way to the shipping-office, and I to hurry down to the barque for the necessary papers and cash prior to joining them there. It was just noon when, the work of signing the articles and paying the advances having been completed, I jumped into a cab to drive to the hotel at which the Desmonds were staying, to acquaint...", "...of trying to maintain a barrier between Essen and Constantinople.

It is not before the period when the weakling Honorius transferred his court from Rome to Ravenna that we find any traces of the city's glorious past.

It had a moderately long snout, curved downwards, and extremely small eyes. It remained nearly all the time without motion except when irritated, in which case it reared itself on its hind legs from the back of a chair to which it clung, and clawed out with its forepaws like a cat. Its manner of clinging with its claws, and the sluggishness of its motions, gave it a great resemblance to a sloth. It uttered no sound, and remained all night on the spot where I had...", "...and knew that she was safe. It was well that I took this precaution, for on the very next morning, before I had turned out, an officer came below to inform me that an enemy's ship-of-war had appeared off the harbor!

Darrell's protestations of his innocence went for very little, and in the course of another <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours he found himself a prisoner in Kimberley jail, awaiting a trial for buying a diamond illicitly. On his trial it was proved that Seers had been searched before he went into the tent, and had no money upon him; when he came out he had ten sovereigns in his possession.

In 1872 Arthur Hughes supplies nine delightful designs for _Gutta-Percha Willie_, by the Editor; <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> to _Innocent's Island_, a long-rhymed chronicle by the author of _Lilliput Levee_, and a curiously fantastic drawing to George Mac Donald's well-known poem, _The Wind and the Moon_. Some one, with the initials F. E. F. (not F. A. F.), illustrates _On the High Meadows_ in nineteen sketches; with the exception of two by J. Mahoney, the rest of the pictures are chiefly by F. A. Fraser, T. Green, F. S. Walker, W. J. Wiegand, and J. B. Zwecker. In 1873 the magazine changed...", "...is kept there five or six minutes. In young children, however, neither of these is practicable, and I prefer to place the instrument in the groin, and crossing one leg over the other, to maintain the thermometer there for the requisite five minutes. The temperature of the body in health is about 98.5 deg. Fahr. in the grown person, and very slightly higher in childhood; but any heat above 99.5 deg. may be regarded as evidence that something is wrong, and the persistence for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours of a temperature of 101 deg. and upwards, may be taken as almost conclusive proof of the existence of some serious inflammation, or of the onset of one of the eruptive fevers. At the same time it is well to bear in mind that temporary causes, such as especially the disorders produced by over-fatigue, or by an over-hearty or indigestible meal, may suddenly raise the temperature as high as 102 deg., or higher, but the needed repose or the action of a purgative may be...", "...you cannot get him to talk rationally?\" \"Certainly, Harding, but where is he?\" Landlord Larry asked his clerk about the man, but he had not seen him all day, and, the miners being questioned, not one recalled having seen him since the day before. In some dread that harm had befallen him, Harding then went out in search of the poor fellow. He went from miner to miner and camp to camp in his vain search, for not anywhere could he find any one who had seen the missing man for over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. Becoming really alarmed, when he realized the shock it would be to Celeste Seldon, whose hazardous and costly trip to the West would be utterly useless, Harding went back to the hotel to consult Doctor Dick and Landlord Larry about giving a general alarm. Then alarms were only given in times of direct need, for the miners were sworn to obey the call, and come from every camp and mine within the circuit of habitation about Last Chance. The alarm was given by...", "...and tricks, while I pleaded vainly and hungrily with the mistress at the front door. Dickens was a drug in the market. A curious fatality had given me a copy of \"Hard Times\" to canvass with. I think no amount of good fortune could turn my head while it stands in my bookcase. One look at it brings back too vividly that day when Bob and I had gone, desperate and breakfastless, from the last bed we might know for many days, to try to sell it and so get the means to keep us for another <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. It was not only breakfast we lacked. The day before we had had only a crust together. Two days without food is not good preparation for a day's canvassing. We did the best we could. Bob stood by and wagged his tail persuasively while I did the talking; but luck was dead against us, and \"Hard Times\" stuck to us for all we tried.

It is most justly called the Stinking Beast, for its odour is so strong, that it may be pursued upon the track <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours after it has passed. It goes very slow, and when the hunter approaches it, it squirts out, far and wide such a stinking urine, that neither man nor beast can hardly approach it.

In his book of 1543, he also expressed his belief that the earth also revolved around the sun. This idea so shocked the world that the word \"revolution\" became associated with radical change. He thought it more likely that the earth rotated than that the stars moved with great speed in their large orbits. He proposed that the earth spins on its own axis about once every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, with a spin axis at about a 23 1/2 degree tilt from the orbital axis, thus explaining a slow change in the overall appearances of the fixed stars which had been observed since the time of Ptolemy.

It first takes for granted that the Sabbath-day during which God rested was a day of but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, and then argues from the supposition that, in order to keep up the proportion between the six previous working days and the seventh day of rest, which the reason annexed to the fourth commandment demands, these previous days must also have been twenty-four hours each. It would, I have begun to suspect, square better with the ascertained facts, and be at least equally in accordance with Scripture, to reverse the process, and argue that because God's working days were...", "...Roman nobles throughout the church the cry was echoed back: \"To Charles Augustus, crowned of God, great and peace-bearing emperor of the Romans, life and victory!\" The title was thrice proclaimed before the Confession of St. Peter.

And the same day the Pope anointed with the holy oil Charles and the king his son. Three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years had passed since at the bidding of Odoacer the Herule and Ariun, the Roman senate had sent a message to the eastern emperor Zeno, declaring that no western emperor was needed.

His watch enabled him to keep an accurate account of the passing hours. In the course of his life, Ben Zoof had read a few books. After pondering one day, he...", "...an urinometer. A simple device for this purpose, which requires only about 3 c.c. and is very satisfactory in clinical work, has been designed by Saxe (Fig. 15). The urine is placed in the bulb at the bottom, the instrument is floated in distilled water, and the specific gravity is read off from the scale upon the stem.

The normal for a man of 150 pounds is about 60 grams, or 950 grains. The principal factors which influence this amount are body weight (except with excessive fat), diet, exercise, and age, and these should be considered in making an estimation. After about the forty-fifth year it becomes gradually less; after seventy-five years it is about one-half the amount given. In disease, the amount of...", "...or shed light upon, to illumine\") The statement seems to teach that the Sun People--the men--were using torches to illumine the depth of the hot Canyon.

Of course, for the greater part of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, the darkness, particularly in the cave dwellings should be most intense. One visitor, quoted already, tells of \"darkness thicker than that of Egypt.\" Such gloom should be particularly and painfully felt by \"Sun People,\" and we are not surprised to find that they made use of torches or artificial lights.

Gold-bearing quartz is pulverized, and treated with Hg to dissolve the precious metal, which is then separated from the alloy by distillation. Compare this with the preparation of Ag. Such is the malleability of Au that it has been hammered into sheets not over one-millionth of an inch thick; it is then as transparent as glass. Gold does not tarnish or change below the melting-point. On account of its softness it is usually alloyed with Cu, sometimes with Ag. Pure gold is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> carats fine. Eighteen carat gold has eighteen parts Au and six Cu. Gold coin has nine parts Au to one part Cu.

What baneful influence he exercised over Spenser in this last respect will be shown presently. Kirke was Spenser's other close friend; he was one year junior academically to the poet. He too, as we shall see, was a profound admirer of Harvey. After leaving the university in 1576, Spenser, then, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age, returned to his own people in the North. This fact is learnt from his friend 'E.K.'s' glosses to certain lines in the sixth book of the _Shepheardes Calendar_. E.K. speaks 'of the North countrye where he dwelt,' and 'of his removing out of the North parts and coming into the South.' As E.K. writes in the spring of 1579, and as his writing is evidently some little time subsequent to the migration he speaks of, it may be believed that Spenser quitted his...", "...feathers, and you shall be executed in the market-place for the entertainment of my courtiers.'

And, although, after reaching Ancona, he had the pleasure of seeing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> Venetian ships enter the harbour for his service, he was so worn out by sickness that he died on the next day but one (Aug. 14, 1464).

Capt. Carey, during a passage of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours through a branch of the canyon hitherto unexplored, made an exact geographical map of this terrible chasm, and discovered many side canyons hitherto unknown. About one hundred Indians came in to him and declared that 'the Navajo nation was no more;' that they were tired of fighting and nearly starved, and that they wished to be permitted to advise their friends and families in the mountains; many of whom were willing to leave the land forever, and go to a country...", "...from the drones could be used to construct extensions running along the floor of the rill and these, in turn, covered with ash.

And if any one doubts the power of trees cultivated in the streets to change the temperature of a city let him calculate the amount of foliage which the seventy-eight thousand trees, when full-grown, will furnish the city of Washington, taking as his basis the fact that a single tree, the Washington elm, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, when in full leafage, equals five acres of foliage, and that one acre of grass emits into the atmosphere 6.400 quarts of water in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, a powerfully cooling process. We have, finally, to consider through what agency the proposed cultivation of trees in the city of New York can be accomplished most rapidly and successfully. Three methods may be suggested, viz.: 1.

The drainage of the interior of Greenland is thus partly given off in the solid form of icebergs, partly by the melting of the snow and ice on the surface of the ice-cap, especially near its western margin, and to some slight extent also by the melting produced on its under side by the interior heat of the earth.

The _astronomical clock_ is the constant companion of the transit instrument. This clock is so regulated as to keep exact pace with the stars, and of course with the revolution of the earth on its axis; that is, it is regulated to _sidereal_ time. It measures the progress of a star, indicating an hour for every fifteen degrees, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours for the whole period of the revolution of the star. Sidereal time commences when the vernal equinox is on the meridian, just as solar time commences when the sun is on the meridian.

The ship in which the ladies and their suite were conveyed was placed under the command of a brave and faithful knight named Stephen of Turnham, and the two princesses were committed to his special charge. But, although Richard's regard for the sacred season of Lent would not allow of his celebrating the marriage, he made a grand celebration in honor of his betrothment to Berengaria before he sailed. At this celebration he instituted an order of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> knights. These knights bound themselves in a fraternity with the king, and took a solemn oath that they would scale the walls of Acre when they reached the Holy Land. Acre was one of the strongest and most important fortresses in that country, and one which they were intending first to attack. Also, before he went away, Richard made King Tancred a farewell present of a very valuable antique sword, which had been found, he said, by his father in the tomb of a famous old...", "...steady torture of an utter want of rest? Ffoulkes had to smother a cry of horror, which surely must have drawn the attention of that fiend on himself had he not been so engrossed in the enjoyment of his own devilry. As it is, he ran out of the stuffy eating-house, for he felt as if its fetid air must choke him. For an hour after that he wandered about the streets, not daring to face Marguerite, lest his eyes betrayed some of the horror which was shaking his very soul. That was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours ago. To-day he had learnt little else. It was generally known that the Englishman was in the Conciergerie prison, that he was being closely watched, and that his trial would come on within the next few days; but no one seemed to know exactly when. The public was getting restive, demanding that trial and execution to which every one seemed to look forward as to a holiday. In the meanwhile the escape of the Dauphin had been kept from the knowledge of the public; Heron...", "...journey was put off month after month, and it was not till May 9th, 1835, that he was at last able to start. He arrived at Vienna on the 16th; having hired a post carriage for the journey, a little extravagance which cost him 15,000 francs. His stay there was not a rest, as, to Madame Hanska's annoyance, he worked twelve hours a day at \"Le Lys dans la Vallee,\" and explained to her that he was doing a good deal in thus sacrificing three hours a day for her sake--fifteen hours out of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> being his usual time for labour. He visited Munich on his way back, and arrived in Paris on June 11th, to find a crowd of creditors awaiting his arrival, and his pecuniary affairs in terrible confusion. Owing, he considered, to the machinations of his enemies, articles had appeared in different papers announcing that he had been imprisoned for debt--a report which naturally ruined his credit, and caused a general gathering of those to whom he owed money.

He, and only he, was destined, by combining the finish of the classics with the freshness of a language still in use, to inaugurate the golden age of form.

When Poliziano composed _Le Stanze_ he was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age.[492] He had steeped himself in the classic literatures. Endowed with a marvelous memory, he possessed their spirit and their substance. Not less familiar with Tuscan poetry of the fourteenth century, he commanded the stores of Dante's, Petrarch's and Boccaccio's diction. Long practice in Greek and Latin composition had given him mastery over the metrical systems of the ancient languages.[493] The daily habit of inditing songs for music to please the ladies of...", "...to a thorough debate before the general congregation or, committee of the whole, or under the by-laws, it is placed in the hands of each one of the bishops, and every one who thinks it proper gives in writing his remarks on it, and proposes his emendations. 3.

The government were persuaded by M. Arago to persevere, if necessary, to the depth of more than 2000 feet; but when they had descended above 1800 English feet below the surface, the water rose through the tube (which was about ten inches in diameter), so as to discharge half a million of gallons of limpid water every <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. The temperature of the water increased at the rate of 1.8 degrees F. for every 101 English feet, as they went down, the result agreeing very closely with the anticipations of the scientific advisers of this most spirited undertaking.

In the evening Bennett and Ferriss took a long walk or rather climb over the ice to the southwest, picking out a course for the next day's march.

He accused me of a vile intercourse with a slave, and almost maddened me with ignoble reproaches. It was in vain that I swore to him most solemnly, the man he had seen was my father; a being whom motives of prudence compelled me to receive in private, even although my heart abhorred and loathed the relationship between us. He treated my explanation with deriding contempt, bidding me either produce that father within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, or find some easier fool to persuade--that one, wearing the hue and features of the black could, by human possibility, be the parent of a white woman. Again I explained the seeming incongruity, by urging that the hasty and imperfect view he had taken was of a mask, imitating the features of a negro, which my father had brought with him as a disguise, and which he had hastily resumed on hearing the noise of the key in the door. I even admitted, as an excuse for...", "...indeed.

For Madame du Deffand rarely rose till five o'clock in the evening; at six she began her reception; and at nine or half-past the central moment of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours arrived--the moment of supper. Upon this event the whole of her existence hinged. Supper, she used to say, was one of the four ends of man, and what the other three were she could never remember. She lived up to her dictum. She had an income of L1400 a year, and of this she spent more than half--L720--on food. These figures should be largely increased to give them their modern values; but, economise as she might, she found that she could only just manage to rub along....", "...as he could in the darkness.

The plucky lad sorely needed rest and refreshment. For two days and a night he had been without sleep and for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours without food. This, with the strenuous labor and excitement through which he had passed, had rendered him nearly as weak as his unconscious companion. Sleep was out of the question until they were safe from their enemies, but food was handy and he lost no time in making a hearty meal on a can of corned beef, crackers and a tin of milk. The repast brought fresh strength and courage, although his head felt very heavy and he could hardly keep his eyes open.

To avoid the pretended improbability which would lie in springing from one time and one place to another, they have often involved themselves in real and grave improbabilities. A thousand times have we reason to repeat the observation of the Academy, in their criticism on the _Cid_, respecting the crowding together so many events in the period of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours: \"From the fear of sinning against the rules of art, the poet has rather chosen to sin against the rules of nature.\" But this imaginary contradiction between art and nature could only be suggested by a low and narrow range of artistic ideas.

She lived pretty much in the open air, walking about in the woods, reading, or painting; and the woods, her books, and her paint-brushes, to say nothing of her poor people, so agreeably occupied her time that she never experienced a quarter of an hour's _ennui_. She was too content with her lot to have the slightest inclination to change it; therefore she was in no hurry to marry. She had completed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of her existence, had refused several desirable offers, and wished nothing better than to retain her maidenhood. It was the sole article concerning which this heiress had discussions with those around her.

The school has lately been re-modelled by the Dean and Chapter, in order to bring it up to the requirements of the age, and extensive alterations have been made to provide accommodation for boarders.[54] The school is not restricted to the foundation boys, but is open to all who are prepared to accede to the terms, and is now in a flourishing...", "...her reinforcements came up only in time to see the ruin of the army in the field. Successive generals followed, only to relieve each other's reputation by sharing a common defeat; until Italy was torn by 50,000 Frenchmen from the hands of 100,000 Austrians. Yet the Germans have been always brave; their national calamity was tardiness. It clings to them still. They have now been gazing for a month at the army of Charles Albert; they ought to have driven it into the Mincio within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours. The Italian spirit of hatred to the German has exhibited itself in a thousand forms for a thousand years. It has murmured, conspired, and made vows of vengeance, since the days of Charlemagne. It has sentenced the \"Teuton\" in remorseless sonnets, has fought him in sinfonias, and slaughtered him in ballets and burlesques. But the German returned, chained the poets to the wall of a cell, and sent the writers to row in the galleys. For the last hundred years, Italy...", "...stood in the way of such preferment, and which must be explained, he was chosen in his father's place. The father's services had been too recent, too well appreciated, too thoroughly in unison with the feelings of those around him to allow of any other choice; and in this way young Frank Gresham found himself member for East Barsetshire, although the very men who elected him knew that they had but slender ground for trusting him with their suffrages. Frank Gresham, though then only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> years of age, was a married man, and a father. He had already chosen a wife, and by his choice had given much ground of distrust to the men of East Barsetshire. He had married no other than Lady Arabella de Courcy, the sister of the great Whig earl who lived at Courcy Castle in the west; that earl who not only voted for the Reform Bill, but had been infamously active in bringing over other young peers so to vote, and whose name therefore stank in the nostrils of the staunch...", "...inglorious flight, and scampered off at the top of his speed. The jest was admirably managed; and nothing could exceed the unction with which he related his encounter with the villains. In fact, upon Falstaff's principle, he had discharged his pistols on the way home, as a proof of the desperate contest he had had with the blood-thirsty scoundrels. Like all his other exploits, however, it was added to the catalogue of his daring conflicts with the Whiteboys, and, ere the lapse of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, was in possession of \"his friend the Castle.\" CHARTER XV.--Scene in a Parsonage--An Anti-Tithe Ringleader. Hitherto we have described the tithe-agitation as one which was externally general as well as deep-rooted; and so far we were perfectly correct. Our readers, however, are not to understand by this that there did not exist among the people--ay, and the priesthood too--a strong under-current of sympathy for the sufferings of the protestant clergy. The...", "...of Delmonico's hailed an auto-bus. Buttoning his coat closely around him he climbed to the roof, where he rode in solitary state through the thin, persistent rain, stung into alertness by the cool moisture perpetually reborn on his cheek. Somewhere in his mind a conversation began, rather resumed its place in his attention. It was composed not of two voices, but of one, which acted alike as questioner and answerer: Question.--Well--what's the situation? Answer.--That I have about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> dollars to my name. Q.--You have the Lake Geneva estate. A.--But I intend to keep it. Q.--Can you live? A.--I can't imagine not being able to. People make money in books and I've found that I can always do the things that people do in books. Really they are the only things I can do. Q.--Be definite. A.--I don't know what I'll do--nor have I much curiosity. To-morrow I'm going to leave New York for good. It's a bad town unless you're on top of it. Q.--Do...", "...is a still better example of heredity. The family was descended from a Revolutionary soldier, who had an illegitimate feeble-minded son by an imbecile young woman. The line continued by feeble-minded descent and marriage until four hundred and eighty descendants have been traced. Of these one hundred and forty-three were positively defective, thirty-six were illegitimate, thirty-three sexually immoral, mostly prostitutes, eight kept houses of ill repute, three were criminal, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> were confirmed drunkards, and eighty-two died in infancy. On the other hand, there are striking examples of what good birth and breeding can do. It happened that the ancestor of the Kallikak family, after he had sown his wild oats, married well and had about five hundred descendants. All of them were normal, only two were alcoholic, and one sexually loose. The family has been prominent socially and in every way creditable in its history. In contrast to the Jukes family,...", "...for some time, his hand lifted up, his eyes fixed on the Admiral, who still retained his menacing attitude. At last the Emperor threw his whip on the floor. M. Bruix took his hand off his sword, and with uncovered head awaited in silence the result of the painful scene. Rear-Admiral Magon was then ordered to see that the Emperor's orders were instantly executed. \"As for you, sir,\" said the Emperor, fixing his eyes on Admiral Bruix, you leave Boulogne within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours and depart for Holland. Go!\" M. Magon ordered the fatal movement of the fleet on which the Emperor had insisted. The first arrangements had scarcely been made when the sea became very high. The black sky was pierced by lightning, the thunder rolled and every moment the line of vessels was broken by the wind, and shortly after, that which the Admiral had foreseen came to pass, and the most frightful storm dispersed the vessels in each a way that it...", "...taken of the dramatic method, without otherwise conforming to the stringent rules of theatrical composition, or seeking the dubious advantage of stage adaptation. It must be admitted as somewhat inconsistent that three very remarkable people, whose acts are dependent on perhaps a thousand contingencies, should be completely developed within three hours, considering that it would scarcely be possible, in the ordinary course of events, that three such remarkable people should, even in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours, fully reveal their characters to the most penetrating inquirer. A greater amount of incident is here crowded together than it was possible for me to confine within the narrow limits prescribed by Aristotle and Batteux. It is, however, not so much the bulk of my play as its contents which banish it from the stage. Its scheme and economy require that several characters should appear who would offend the finer feelings of virtue and shock the delicacy of our manners....", "...made at Parma, and took its name thence; but none is made there now. It is made through all the country extending from Milan, for one hundred and fifty miles. The most is made about Lodi. The making of butter being connected with that of making cheese, both must be described together. There are, in the stables I saw, eighty-five cows, fed on hay and grass, not on grain. They are milked twice in twenty-four hours, ten cows yielding at the two milkings a _brenta_ of milk, which is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> of our gallons. The night's milk is scummed in the morning at daybreak, when the cows are milked again, and the new milk mixed with the old. In three hours, the whole mass is scummed a second time, the milk remaining in a kettle for cheese, and the cream being put into a cylindrical churn, shaped like a grind-stone, eighteen inches radius, and fourteen inches thick. In this churn, there are three staves pointing inwardly, endwise, to break the current of the milk. Through...", "...Thanks, Mike. If I find anything new in here, I'll let you know.\" \"Do that,\" said Mike the Angel. \"And, as a personal favor, I'll show you how to build my own super-duper, extra-special, anti-vibroblade defense unit.\" Old Harry grinned, crinkling up his wizened face in a mass of fine wrinkles. \"You'd better think up a shorter name than that for it, laddie; I could probably build one in less time than it takes you to say it.\" \"Want to bet?\" \"I'll bet you twenty I can do it in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours.\" \"Twenty it is, Harry. I'll sell you mine this time tomorrow for twenty bucks.\" Harry shook his head. \"I'll trade you mine for yours, plus twenty.\" Then his eyes twinkled. \"And speaking of money, didn't you come down here to buy something?\" Mike the Angel laughed. \"You're not going to like it. I came down to get a dozen plastic-core resistors.\" \"What size?\" Mike told him, and Old Harry went over to the proper bin, pulled them out, all properly boxed, and...", "...in which by a stratagem the Spanish were utterly defeated. Declaring himself a Protestant, William returned and took the field. Read the story of Egmont and Hoorn and their fate in Motley and in Goethe's drama. Have selections from these novels bearing on the time: Lysbeth, by H. Rider Haggard, and Jan van Elselo, by G. and M. Coleridge. Alva fought and defeated William at Geta and dispersed his army. Believing victory his, he had a great statue of himself erected at Antwerp; but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> vessels of the little new navy manned by the \"Water Beggars\" turned the tide against him, and at this point the great struggle really began. Only the few leading events can be touched upon here, but clubs should take up the whole wonderful story of the conflict, in many respects the most interesting war of history. The seven months' siege of Haarlem, with its heroic defense and final destruction, was followed by the siege of Alkmaar, when women and boys helped fight in...", "...say, damn him, can he eat iron? After that, a small padlock was fixed to the hand-cuff, instead of the nail; and as they were mean-spirited in their treatment to me so it appeared to me, that they were equally timorous and cowardly. I was after sent, with the prisoners taken with me, to an armed vessel in the river, which lay off against Quebec, under the command of Capt. M'Cloud, of the British, who treated me in a very generous and obliging manner, and according to my rank; in about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-four</span> hours I bid him farewell with regret; but my good fortune still continued. The name of the Captain of the vessel I was put on board, was Littlejohn; who, with his officers, behaved in a polite, generous, and friendly manner. I lived with them in the cabin, and fared on the best, my irons being taken off, contrary to the order he had received from the commanding officer; but Capt Littlejohn swore, that a brave man should not be used as a rascal, on board his ship. Thus I..."]
