In 1912 Wilson received forty-two per cent of the popular vote, and eighty-two per cent of the electoral vote.

Sometimes, however, the bunches are cut off. Some dates contain so much sap that the bunches must be hung up to allow it to drain off before they can be shipped. This sap is called _date honey_, and is saved. They are sent to the coast towns in bags or boxes called _frails_. Where dates are to be sold in small quantities, they are repacked in the small boxes such as you have seen. You know that dates are very sweet, and it is no wonder that they are, for they contain from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to sixty per cent of sugar. The trees are often tapped, and the sap which flows out is made into sugar. Vinegar and a liquor called _arrack_ are also made from it. The leaves of the tree are made into bags and mats; from the stones a drink is made which takes the place of coffee. From the leafstalks baskets are made, while the trunk furnishes material for houses and for fences.

The _Library_ is a large and lofty room, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet by thirty-one and a half, and twenty-three and a half high, divided by a screen of columns and pilasters of scagliola, into two unequal parts, the first forming a sort of ante-library to the other; both are surrounded by bookcases of oak, and a gallery runs round the whole, above which is another range of bookcases.

On the 3d of July was fought the decisive battle of Koniggratz, or Sadowa, as it is sometimes called, from the village of that name, a cluster of pine-wood cottages, enclosed by orchards, with a wood-crowned hill at the back, which was fiercely disputed by the contending parties. On that day, General von Benedek had taken his position with the Austrian army in front of the frontier fortress of Koniggratz, on the right bank of the Elbe, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles east of Prague, to oppose the passage of the crown prince from Silesia. In his front lay the marshy stream of Bistritz, upon which Sadowa and a few other villages are situated.

We found him at the hotel, ready to take charge of us. I asked him if he was \"all fixed.\" He said he was. That was very true. He had a trunk, two small satchels, and an umbrella. I was to pay him <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> dollars a month and railway fares. On the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same it is on a man.

It was famous for the stature of its nine members, which, combined, was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet. The delegation was known as \"the Long Nine.\" When the law was signed the citizens of Springfield tendered a banquet to their representatives, and among the toasts was this: \"Abraham Lincoln: one of Nature's noblemen; he has fulfilled the expectations of his friends and disappointed the hopes of his enemies.\" In 1838 and again in 1840 Lincoln was the Whig candidate for Speaker of the House of Representatives, which was the highest tribute his colleagues could pay...", "...of Genesis, for to this day you can see in some of the oldest Egyptian temples pictures of the gods making men out of lumps of clay.

Almost immediately afterwards the door was opened, and Miss Faithful and her niece Miss Angela Faithful, were announced. Miss Faithful looked about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty years of age; she was tall and slight, and had evidently been a beauty in her day. Such was her niece now; there could be no two opinions about it. Even Isaac, who had no great appreciation of feminine charms, was sensible of it the instant she entered the room. She was tall, and her figure was beautifully shaped; she had dark hair and eyes, a brilliant complexion, and features almost faultless. Moreover, she was dressed quietly, but in excellent taste.

I was in hopes that a few miles might bring about a change of country, and so it did, but not an advantageous one to us. At ten miles from camp the horizon became flatter, the sandhills fell off, and the undulations became covered with brown gravel, at first very fine.

On the 4th of July, 1776, the Declaration of Independence, drawn up in the main by _Thomas Jefferson_, and of which _John Adams_ was the most eloquent advocate on the floor of Congress, passed that body. It was signed by the President, _John Hancock_, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> members. The colonies easily converted themselves into States, nearly all of them framing new constitutions. Thirteen _Articles of Confederation_ made them into a league, under the name of the _United States_ of America, each State retaining its sovereignty (1777). _Franklin_, an old man, and respected in Europe as well as at home for his scientific attainments as well as for his sturdy sagacity, went to France as their envoy.

That movement would seem to have presented the sole and only chance of success for the Federal arms, as the successful advance of General Franklin's <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty thousand men up the old Richmond road would have compelled Lee to retire his whole right wing, to protect it from an assault in flank and reverse. What dispositions he would have made under these circumstances must be left to conjecture; but, it is certain that the blow would have proved a serious one, calling for the display of all his military ability. In the event, however, that this was the main great aim of General Burnside, his method of carrying out his...", "...head.

The old fellow had a temper that he could not manage, and so he was always on the move; but all places were alike, he said--there was always some trick by which a miner was cheated of his earnings. A miner was a little business man, a contractor who took a certain job, with its expenses and its chance of profit or loss. A \"place\" was assigned to him by the boss--and he undertook to get out the coal from it, being paid at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> cents a ton for each ton of clean coal. In some \"places\" a man could earn good money, and in others he would work for weeks, and not be able to keep up with his store-account. It all depended upon the amount of rock and slate that was found with the coal. If the vein was low, the man had one or two feet of rock to take off the ceiling, and this had to be loaded on separate cars and taken away. This work was called \"brushing,\" and for it the miner received no pay.

Of course, this is prevented either by checking population to the amount of the subsistence; by sending off the surplus population; or by bringing in food from new lands. In the United States to 1860 population has doubled itself about every twenty years, while in France there is practically no increase of population.

Ireland is situated in the North Atlantic, between the degrees fifty-one and a half and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> and a half North, and five and a quarter and ten and a third West longitude from Greenwich. It is the last land usually seen by ships leaving the Old World, and the first by those who arrive there from the Northern ports of America. In size it is less than half as large as Britain, and in shape it may be compared to one of those shields which we see in coats-of-arms, the four Provinces--Ulster, Connaught, Leinster, and Munster--representing the four quarters of the...", "..._his dignity_, or the slippery nature of his causeways, permit him to adopt.

The best way to obtain a good view of Ningpo and the surrounding country is to ascend the pagoda, which forms one of its most striking objects. It is one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet high, of an octagonal form, having windows all the way up, with a lantern in each; so that, if lighted up, the effect would be very striking. The lower part of it is built of stone, but the upper part of brick. In other respects it differs but little from other structures of the same description. It appears to be connected with a public burial-ground, as numerous graves and monuments lie scattered round it. From the top of it you get quite a panoramic view of the city...", "...while Colonel O'Hara, under orders, advanced to take the barracks where four hundred Spanish troops were garrisoned. The Kentuckians under Colonel O'Hara numbered one hundred and eighty, and in addition he was reinforced by the Louisiana regiment of one hundred and thirty, and the Mississippi regiment of one hundred and forty-five, so that he had in all, for the business in hand, four hundred and fifty-five men, thus outnumbering the Spanish force which they were to oppose, by about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> men. They advanced rapidly and charged the garrison, which promptly opened fire, and Colonel O'Hara was wounded, not seriously, but sufficiently so that he was obliged to surrender his command to Major Hawkins. The engagement was resumed, but only for a short time, when General Lopez came up and at once directed the firing to cease. He then proceeded to do a thing which plainly showed the spirit of the man, his resourcefulness and his undaunted courage. He marched up to the...", "...Yamaguchi. He knew that the sub-lieutenant on his recovery had been promoted and appointed to a torpedo vessel, but until this moment he had been unaware to which. Their meeting was very cordial; Yamaguchi looked on Bob as his preserver, and Bob on his part was delighted to find that he was to make the passage to Chemulpo in company with one whom he already regarded as a friend. Besides Yamaguchi, the officers on board were two sub-lieutenants, a doctor, and an engineer. \"We are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> all told,\" added Yamaguchi, after introducing their new mess-mate. \"Where do you stow them all?\" asked Bob in surprise. \"Come and see.\" The lieutenant showed him first his own cabin, in the after part of the vessel--a room about ten feet square by seven high, with about as much accommodation as a small bathing-machine. Next to it was the ward-room, a trifle larger in area, in which Yamaguchi proposed that Bob should make his sleeping quarters on a small settee....", "...about negro equality ever permit us to hear the last of it?

While one division of the Caliph's army defeated Theophilus, who had taken the field in person, another headed by Motassem himself marched straight on Amorium, and took it after a brave defence of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> days. Thirty thousand of its inhabitants were massacred, and the town was burnt, but the Caliph then turned home satisfied with his revenge, and the empire suffered nothing more from this most dangerous invasion. The Saracen war dragged on in an indecisive way, but no further disaster was encountered. There are other things to be recorded of Theophilus beside his persecution of image-worshippers and his war with the Caliph. He was long remembered for his taste for gorgeous...", "...is still in good preservation. A grand staircase, forty-five feet wide, and containing twenty steps, rises to the platform of this terrace.

It amounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> dollars. He slipped it into his pocket and stood up on the stepladder. He had even proceeded so far as to put one foot on a lower step, when Mrs. Wilmerton entered the kitchen. She was a stout woman, and she was almost out of breath.

She spent twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not. The rent was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum. Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone. She thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong. Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the thought that came to her. It was the only decent thing to do.

There is another side to this feature which is also unique and curiously full of interest. These romances are the only instances in which any statesman of the first rank, who for years was the ruling spirit of a great empire, has thrown his political conceptions and schemes into an imaginative form.

Of dark complexion, and with piercing hazel eyes; he was a Mississipian, or, as he was used to say, he \"came from old Massisip.\" In a word, a native, as he himself told me, of Arkansas, he was a splendid specimen of the class of men raised between civilized life and the extreme frontier of that civilization. Thus he had been made a backwoodsman by nature and predisposition, as well as necessity....", "...from 1652 to 1654, the date 1653 appears to be very plausible.

Morgand had an uncut copy, measuring a hundred and forty-three millimetres, in 1878. The Benzon copy sold in 1875 for three thousand two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> francs. It is to be remarked that the Elzevirs frequently avoided dating or even signing their books, for reasons easy to comprehend. Publishing numerous works, they were afraid of compromising themselves in the eyes of the powerful, and they let them go forth without any trade mark. These artists in typography were, besides, the most prudent and subtle of men.

Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees; and our men being dexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made.

About fifty thousand people died of the disease in that city, and great alarm was felt in London lest the infection should reach England.

Stoughton, Lieutenant Governor, a man of small mind and bigoted temper, was president. The business began by the condemnation and hanging of a helpless woman. A jury of women had found on her person a wart, which was pronounced to be unquestionably a \"devil's teat,\" and her neighbors remembered that many hens had died, animals become lame, and carts upset by her dreadful \"devilism.\" By September 23d, twenty persons had gone to the gallows, eight more were under sentence, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> had \"confessed\" and turned informers as their only hope.

The fact was that Bijou, in her cotton dress, with wide pink stripes, and her little apron trimmed with Valenciennes, was really very pretty to look at, foraging about amongst the flowers. When she discovered that she was being gazed at in this way, her tea-rose complexion took a deeper tint, and she looked confused and embarrassed, as she stood there facing the gentleman, who was still contemplating her without saying a word. He was a man of between <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> and sixty, tall, slender, distinguished-looking, and elegant, and with a very young-looking figure for his years. His face, which was intelligent and refined, had also an almost youthful expression about it, just tinged with a shade of melancholy.

All these later poems are vigorous, learned, and full-blooded. They are thoroughly characteristic of their author.

Here was a man covered with glory and near to the doors of death, who was prepared to give himself the elaborate trouble of reconstructing the mood, and rebuilding the verses of a long juvenile poem which had been forgotten for fifty years in the blaze of successive victories.

It was of such things that Elizabeth Barrett wrote in one of...", "...died, leaving his children in some distress. Salieri took care of the family and educated the two daughters as opera singers. His generosity was shown in numberless ways, and if by mishap he did not especially approve of Mozart, he was on most cordial terms with Haydn and Beethoven.

I doubt if they ever interbreed except in rare instances. The fact that these animals can develop such an extraordinary speed was a great surprise to me, as undoubtedly it will be to most naturalists. Had we not been able to determine it accurately by means of the speedometers on our cars, I should never have dared state that they could reach <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty miles an hour. It must be remembered that the animals can continue at such a high speed only for a short distance--perhaps half a mile--and will never exert themselves to the utmost unless they are thoroughly frightened. They would run just fast enough to keep well away from the cars or our horses, and it was only when we began to shoot that they showed what they were capable of doing.

The cost of moving by land a few years later is illustrated by the case of a Maryland family, consisting of fifteen persons, of whom five were slaves.

In the same year of the Lord 1456, on the Feast day of St. Lucia, Virgin and Martyr, and in the morning when High Mass for her festival was already begun, died that fervent lover of discipline, Brother William Coman.

The stranger was tall, almost as tall as Frobisher himself, but not nearly so heavily built, and appeared to be about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to sixty years of age, so that the young Englishman did not anticipate any serious difficulty in mastering him.

Froude is a waif of that marvellous Oxford movement which began some forty years ago, and of which the strange, diversely operating influence still radiates through English thought and society.

Hundreds of thousands of Peruvians pouring up from the numberless provinces of the empire would be thrown in a never-ceasing succession of armies against his little band of Spaniards, and the latter would infallibly be driven back to the coast by starvation and fatigue if not by defeat in the field. Apparently foolhardy, in fact Pizarro's plan offered the only chance of success. Never dreaming that such a step was in contemplation, Atahuallpa took no precautions. Leaving <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> men at the little post of San Miguel in the Paita valley to secure his retreat, Pizarro marched south with one hundred and two foot soldiers, sixty-two horses, and two small cannon two hundred miles along the coast plain to a point opposite Cajamarca, and ascended along an Inca military road, meeting a friendly reception from the wondering natives, and being supplied with provisions by Atahuallpa's orders.

In order to arm and equip the recruits, Napoleon had recourse to his private treasure, drawing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> million francs from the vaults of the Tuileries for that purpose. The remaining ten were transferred at intervals to Blois. But all his treasure could not buy what did not exist. The best military stores were in the heart of Europe; the French arsenals could afford only antiquated and almost useless supplies. The recruits were armed, some with shot-guns and knives, some with old muskets, the use of which they did not know; they were for the most part without uniforms, and...", "...he would make later in the carriage.\" And the good Madame Marmet added, with a sigh: \"It is true that I liked to dance. But I had to renounce going to balls; it made him suffer too much.\" Countess Martin expressed astonishment.

But the excellent widow confided to her that, at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age, when she was fifty-three, Louis was just as jealous as on the first day of their marriage. And Therese thought that Robert had never tormented her with jealousy. Was it on his part a proof of tact and good taste, a mark of confidence, or was it that he did not love her enough to make her suffer? She did not know, and she did not have the heart to try to know. She would have to look through recesses of her mind which she preferred not to open. She murmured...", "...noting the several approaches.

Suddenly he halted and stepped out of sight behind some bushes not far away from the brook. He heard a splashing, which told him that somebody was near. CHAPTER V THE MAN AT THE BROOK Beside the brook stood a shabbily-dressed man, apparently <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty years old. He wore an old rusty black coat and a soft hat with a hole in it. His face was tanned and partly covered with a beard. The man was acting in a manner to excite anybody's curiosity.

On the view which has now been taken of the Missouri mines, it may be proper here to remark-- 1. That the ores of these mines are of the richest and purest kind, and that they exist in such bodies as not only to supply all lead for domestic consumption, but also, if the purposes of trade require it, are capable of supplying large quantities for exportation. 2. That although at different periods the amount of lead manufactured has been...", "...errors, and absolutely wicked, sinful, and dangerous to admit the possibility that the Holy Book can con-tain errors.

The proof and a full elucidation of this subject will be found in \"The Biography of Satan.\" 7.

The first hysterical report of the flurry came from the Air Defense Command. On September 23, 1951, at seven <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> in the morning, two F-86's on an early patrol were approaching Long Beach, California, coming in on the west leg of the Long Beach Radio range. All of a sudden the flight leader called his ground controller--high at twelve o'clock he and his wing man saw an object. It was in a gradual turn to its left, and it wasn't another airplane. The ground controller checked his radars but they had nothing, so the ground controller called the leader of the F-86's back and told him to...", "...points without them, but that is far from the whole of Paris.

However, the history reached the chronicler in a more satisfactory form. Manasseh was duly punished, and his long reign fully accounted for.(429) When, in spite of Divine warning, Manasseh and his people persisted in their sin, Jehovah sent against them \"the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters,(430) and carried him to Babylon.\" The Assyrian invasion referred to here is partially confirmed by the...", "...said; and Jean fairly loved the new girl from that moment onwards.

After this Turner never saw many of his men any more. They had killed <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> whites but the tide had turned. Turner concealed himself in the woods but was not dismayed, for by messenger he directed his forces to rally at the point from which on the previous Sunday they had started out on their bloody work; but the discovery of white men riding around the place as though they were looking for some one in hiding convinced him that he had been betrayed.

At the middle of the century they numbered in all, from Georgia to Maine, about eleven hundred and sixty thousand white inhabitants. By the census of 1754 Canada had but <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand.[1] Add those of Louisiana and Acadia, and the whole white population under the French flag might be something more than eighty thousand.

But this preponderance itself grew out of a difference of systems. We have said before, and it...", "...as to his life as a single thing.

Nine months later he sold them for sixty shekels.(698) (M649) A common case is where the debtor pledges all he has to the creditor, a pledge usually greatly in excess of the value of the loan and its interest for a reasonable term, but remains in possession himself. Hence the creditor has only a right over the pledge, a lien upon it, but no usufruct. For this he had the bond. This also gives only an eventual possession.

We demonstrated beyond a doubt that the Mongolian antelope can reach a speed of from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to sixty miles an hour. This is probably the maximum _which is attained only in the initial sprint_ and after a very short distance the animals must slow down to about forty miles; a short distance more and they drop to twenty-five or thirty miles, and at this pace they seem able to continue almost indefinitely.

But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more, equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty. Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step...", "...mischief, the lieutenant and two remaining officers also fell a few seconds after him. Astonished and terrified, the men stopped short in their career of success, and wildly looked round for a leader. The French, who had retreated to the forecastle, perceiving our confusion, renewed the attack, our few remaining men were seized with a panic, and throwing down our arms, we asked for quarter where a moment before victory was in our hands--such was the finale of our bloody drama. Out of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> men twenty-two had been killed in this murderous conflict, and almost all the survivors desperately or severely wounded. Most of the remaining crew after we had cried for quarter jumped down the hatchway, to avoid the cutlasses of their enraged victors. I and about eight others, having been driven past the hatchway, threw down our arms and begged for quarter, which we had little reason to expect would be shown to us.

I had two weeks of perfect peace and happiness, and then, just as I was thinking of returning to Glasgow, I received a letter from Mrs. Humphreys, telling me that the government had removed Mr. Humphreys to Liverpool, and that they were on the point of leaving for that city. She said further, that she had had a conversation with Mrs. Semple about me, and that Mrs. Semple was anxious I should stay...", "...about that robbery?\" \"Oh,\" replied Stuart, \"the Bank will lose the money.\" \"On the contrary,\" broke in Ralph, \"I hope we may put our hands on the robber.

Indeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them, had already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the formal summons came.

In May, 1787, it assembled in Philadelphia. =The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable convention were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> men, at least half of whom were acknowledged to be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field of statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in Washington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in Franklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad; finance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of Pennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the \"father...", "...told Canby I did not know the country.

The oldest of her soldiers of legal age were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age when the war closed. The youngest were twelve years of age when the war opened. Older men and younger boys were in the war, ay, and were killed on the field of battle.

Consequently everything is at a standstill, until God shall remedy it. Hence, Sire, as I have said, the obligation of conscience makes me give account to your Majesty; and I think, for a conclusion of this matter, that I am not excused from some particulars. The first is the news that has reached this city, by way of India, that the enemy is sending reenforcements of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> warships. Because the governor's disposition during this time is so worthy of resentment, as above related, it is stated publicly that, on receiving this news, the archbishop told the governor to try to prepare some warships, to whom he responded that he would gladly sell the few that he had. Hence it is feared that the enemy will have been informed of that as soon as they reached this country; and that with this opportunity, they would write, and they thought it good to...", "...from their chambers. The number of judges in the courts of Westminster was by no means certain. Under Henry VI. there were at one time eight judges in the court of common pleas. Each judge took a solemn oath that \"he would take no fee, pension, gift, reward, or bribe, from any suitor, saving meat and drink, which should be of no great value.\" In 1402, the salary of the chief justice of the king's bench was forty pounds per annum. In 1408, the chief justice of the common pleas had <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> marks per annum. In 1549, the chief justice of the king's bench had an addition of thirty pounds to his salary, and each justice of the same bench and common pleas, twenty pounds.

There are differences of opinion about the length of the cubit: most probably it was about eighteen inches; but taking it at twenty-two inches, the largest estimate that I believe theologians have made, the ark was then five hundred and fifty feet long, ninety-one feet eight inches broad, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet high. Leaving space for the floors, which would need to be very strong, each story was about seventeen feet high; and the total cubical contents of the ark were about one hundred and two thousand cubic yards.

Each floor of the ark contained five thousand six hundred and one square yards, and the three floors...", "...their sides as they fired; but he was glad they were having a hot time. The next time he saw them they seemed to have turned shorewards, while the British, still firing heavily, steamed in pursuit. Then, in the after-part of the middle German destroyer, the one the _Mariner_ was firing at, he suddenly noticed a wicked red flash and a cloud of oily black smoke. A shell had gone home. He could have shouted in glee had he not been so breathless. The long-range action lasted for a full <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> minutes, with both sides blazing away merrily the whole time. What damage was done to the enemy it was impossible to say, but it was clear that they suffered considerably, and that they were forced back to their own coast.

His armament consisted of 9000 Portuguese, 2000 Spaniards, 3000 Germans, and some 600 Italians--in all, about 15,000 men, with twelve pieces of artillery, embarked on <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> vessels.

Among the killed were Lieutenant Stansbury of the Ticonderoga, and Lieutenant Gamble of the Saratoga. The Saratoga was twice set on fire by the enemy's hot shot, and received <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> shots in her hull. At the close of the action, not a mast was left in either squadron on which a sail could be hoisted.[97] The result, so glorious to the Americans, was due to the superior rapidity and accuracy of their fire.

Some years after the mother had died, and Mr. Jones had since lived as a widower. It may be as well to state here that in 1880 he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years old. When his wife had died, the nature of the man had apparently been changed. Of all men he had been the most cheerful, the most eager, and the most easily pleased. He had worked hard at his property, and had loved his work. He knew every man and woman about the place, and always had a word to say to them.

The boldness of this can scarcely be overestimated. The French admirals, with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> ships of the line, hung on to their anchors, not caring to risk an encounter with the fleets of England, manned by her mighty captains and heroic crews; but Paul Jones, alone, in a weak vessel, lightly armed, took all the chances of destruction, and bearded the lion in his den.

The latest restoration was carried out by the municipal authorities as a preparation for the International Exposition held at Ghent in 1913 and was carefully and intelligently done. There are three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> steps in the staircase by which visitors ascend the tower, and the climb is one that richly repays those who make it. On a clear day one can see beyond Bruges to the northwest, as far as Antwerp to the east and Audenaerde to the south.

The wooden bridge was set in flames, and before nightfall that portion of the Russian army which had not yet crossed was virtually annihilated. About eighty thousand French and about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand Russians took part in this battle; the former lost seven thousand men, the latter sixteen thousand, with eighty field-pieces.

She says-- 'The table was laid for fifty persons, and was nearly full. They ate in perfect silence, and with such astonishing rapidity that their dinner was over literally before ours was begun; the only sounds heard were those produced by the knives and forks, with the unceasing chorus of coughing, _etc_.' 'Coughing, etc.' The 'etc.' stands for an unpleasant word there, a word...", "...a great stir, a spirit of inquiry, and a searching of the Scriptures, whether these things were so. And, what is more than all, God set his seal upon the work, in converting sinners. Twelve weeks I stood in this same position, whilst the Lord graciously supplied my temporal wants, through two brethren, unasked for. After this time, the whole little church, eighteen in number, unanimously gave me an invitation to become their pastor. They offered to supply my temporal wants by giving me <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> pounds a year, which sum was afterwards somewhat increased, on account of the increase of the church. That which I now considered the best mode of preparation for the public ministry of the word, no longer adopted from necessity, on account of want of time, but from deep conviction, and from the experience of God's blessing upon it, both as it regards my own enjoyment, the benefit of the saints, and the conversion of sinners, is as follows: First, I do not presume to know...", "...I extinguished my light and opened my door cautiously. As they passed on their way down the corridor I succeeded in obtaining a very good view of the interesting pair. They were talking together, and I distinguished the man who had first called upon Edna by his deep voice. He was a short, thick-set, black-bearded man of forty, well-dressed in black, with a heavy gold albert across his ample vest. His companion, whose name was apparently Roesch, was considerably older, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or so, of spare build, erect, thin-faced, with long grey whiskers descending from either cheek, and shaven chin. He wore a frock-coat and silk hat, and was of a type altogether superior to his companion. The woman Grainger's coffee was brought to her as usual in the morning, but about ten o'clock she rang again, and when the chambermaid responded, said-- \"Here are two letters. Post them for me in the box in the bureau, and tell them to send my bill at once. I leave...", "...Then came a telegram from New York, driving temporarily from Jim's mind the matter of freight-cars.

Have order 15,000 boxes if can ship ten days. Money on dock. Welliver fill order you cannot. Seventy cents for pins with the New York market at forty-four cents or thereabouts! A clean killing of nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> hundred dollars! Jim snatched up Grierson's report. It showed seven thousand boxes packed in the warehouse, and estimated twelve thousand boxes unpacked in the bins. He did not wait to weigh consequences or to offset difficulties. Accept order.

The depot master seated himself by the door of the ticket office and fell into a reverie. It was interrupted by the entrance of Hiram Baker. Captain Hiram was an ex-fishing skipper, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age, who, with his wife, Sophronia, and their infant son, Hiram Joash Baker, lived in a small, old-fashioned house at the other end of the village, near the shore.

Ain't goin' to leave us, are you? Not goin'...", "...[Illustration: HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING.] In 1719 the first church was built, near the present Old South Church, on Main street. Previous to that time the inhabitants had held service in their different houses, where their prayers were often interrupted by the presence of hostile Indians, who took the occasion when the people were absorbed in their devotions to molest them. In 1763 the present Old South Meeting-House was built. The original dimensions were seventy feet long, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> wide, with a tower on the north side surmounted by a spire one hundred and thirty feet high. It was commenced June 21, 1763, and first occupied Dec. 8, 1763. There were sixty-one large square box pews and seven long ones on each side of the broad aisle, which were free. The building committee consisted of John Chandler, Joshua Bigelow, Josiah Brewer, John Curtis, James Putnam. Daniel Boyden, James Goodwin, Jacob Hemmenway, David Bigelow, Samuel Moore, and Elisha Smith. The...", "...kissed his wife's hand and delivered into her keeping fifty florins for household expenses. He then asked leave to absent himself for a few hours on business, and Edith told him he might stay out until one o'clock, when she should have dinner ready for him.

I began to see why a courier could afford to work for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> dollars a month and his fares. A month or two later I was able to understand why a courier did not have to pay any board and lodging, and why my hotel bills were always larger when I had him with me than when I left him behind, somewhere, for a few days. Another thing was also explained, now, apparently. In one town I had taken the courier to the bank to do the translating when I drew some money. I had sat in the reading-room till the transaction was finished. Then a...", "...about that robbery?\" \"Oh,\" replied Stuart, \"the Bank will lose the money.\" \"On the contrary,\" broke in Ralph, \"I hope we may put our hands on the robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he'll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers.\" \"But have you got the robber's description?\" asked Stuart. \"In the first place, he is no robber at all,\" returned Ralph, positively. \"What! a fellow who makes off with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand pounds, no robber?\" \"No.\" \"Perhaps he's a manufacturer, then.\" \"The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman.\" It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers, who made this remark.

A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had...", "...he named Phasaelus, from his brother, was of equal length and breadth, forty cubits each, and the same in solid height.

The President, with his staff and some of the bodyguard, remained behind; while General De la Rey, Commandant Davel and I, with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> men, hurried off.

In some parts the estate is of no width, that is to say, the land cannot be irrigated, and therefore is valueless, like the surrounding rocky desert. The small quantity of cultivated land in the whole line of valley does not...", "...that they showed conclusively that Elise was not what old Mrs. Waddington called \"a nice woman.\" \"They say she led Frank Levitt an awful life. The Benhams, my dear, won't have her in the house.\" But all this was trivial compared with the correspondence that now passed between Mr. Waddington and Elise. He admitted now that old Corbett had known what he was talking about when he had warned him that he would be landed--landed, if he didn't take care, to the tune of five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> pounds. His letters to Mrs. Levitt, dictated to Barbara Madden, revealed the care he had to take. From motives which appeared to him chivalrous he had refrained from showing Barbara Mrs. Levitt's letters to him. He left her to gather their crude substance from his admirable replies. \"'MY DEAR MRS. LEVITT: \"'I am afraid I must advise you to give up the scheme if it depends on my co-operation.

He told Emerson he was never in haste to publish, but he seems to have been in haste to write, and wrote on all occasions, producing much dull and trivial work. We speak of a man's work as being heavy. Let us apply the test literally to Wordsworth and weigh his verse. The complete edition of his poems, edited by Henry Reed and published in Philadelphia in 1851, weighs <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> ounces; the selection which Matthew Arnold made from his complete works, and which is supposed to contain all that is worth preserving, weighs ten ounces. The difference represents the dead wood. That Wordsworth was a poor judge of his own work is seen in the remark he made to Emerson that he did not regard his \"Tintern Abbey\" as highly as some of the sonnets and parts of \"The Excursion.\" I believe the Abbey poem is the one by which he will longest be remembered. \"The...", "...Theatre--Women by Themselves--The Play--The Stage--The Actors--The Orchestra and the Music--The Audience--A Death on the Stage--The Theatre a Gathering Place--No Women Actors--A Wise Provision--Temptations--Real Acting--Men the Same Everywhere.

If the papers of the Virginius were irregular or fraudulent, and frankly they probably were, the offense was one against the laws of the United States, justifiable only in their tribunals. However, to return to facts, on the morning of the 31st of October, the Virginius was seen cruising near the coast of Cuba. She was chased by the Spanish man-of-war Tornado, captured, and brought into the harbor of Santiago de Cuba on the following day. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> persons were on board, many of whom bore Spanish names. This was made a great point of by the Spanish authorities, although as a matter of fact it proved nothing. This action was not only in violation of international law, but it was in direct contravention of the provisions of the treaty of 1795. Mr. E. G.

This would require four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> palisades; for the palisades were to be formed of logs, of a foot in diameter upon an average, and eighteen feet long.

But he was by this time calm enough to reply that he was wedded to his art. This conclusion of the romance reminds one of Handel--a thing which Bellini very rarely does. He died when he was only thirty-three years of age, and at that age Handel had not written a single one of the oratorios by which he is remembered. In fact, he did not begin until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> with the success which made him immortal.

Stanford and his company carried the line forward as fast as possible. More land-grants were given, which doubled the company's holdings, and in '65 the road was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles past Sacramento and had climbed over much difficult work.

Today the U.S. Steel Company produces only forty-five per cent. of the iron and steel, and in place of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand owners of the iron and steel business, there are now over three hundred and fifty thousand owners.

Of course, there are also marked differences to be accounted for. The Hebrew law appears to have legislated for a small people, among whom human life was precious and property scanty. The Babylonian law protects property with far severer penalty, and makes little account of a criminal's life.

Its literature possessed neither original nor adopted writings, no profound philosophical systems, no Rousseau or Goethe, no Franklin or Kant, not even any practical information with which to reward the student.

The royal library, which had been founded by the Jewish court physician Sanchez, contained only eight Russian books during the reign of Alexander I, and not many more were added by his successor.

The wisdom of this course is fully demonstrated by the fact that, although we soon began the manufacture of these classes of guns at home, there were no guns of the calibers mentioned manufactured in America on our front at the date the armistice was signed. The only guns of these types produced at home thus far received in France are 109 seventy-five millimeter guns. In...", "...\"It is what I preach.

So high a degree of popularity could not rest on an insufficient foundation.[2] The book is a species of novel or story, designed to portray in vivid colours negro-life in the slave states of America; and such is the graphic and truth-like way in which the authoress, Harriet Beecher Stowe, has strung the whole together, that the production has not only enlisted the sympathy of the Abolitionists, but roused something...", "...increase man shows between fifty-five and sixty-five; and after seventy proceeds to decrease again.\" Incidentally, it may be remarked that the total increase of mortality after forty-five in man is only about six per cent; besides which, the race need not worry much about what happens to the individual after fifty-five or sixty, provided he has done his share of the world's work.

And as early as the tenth century France itself was split up into <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> independent sovereignties; and these small sovereignties were again divided into dukedoms and baronies.

A pair of connected little incidents of that month have served to keep the memory of it green for me all this time; incidents of no consequence, and not worth embalming, yet my memory has preserved them carefully and flung away things of real value to give them space and make them comfortable. The truth is, a person's memory has no more sense than his conscience, and no appreciation whatever of values and proportions. However, never mind those trifling incidents; my...", "...on the literature as well as the art of the age. Bermudez also accuses him of having corrupted and degraded Spanish art, by introducing a new and false style, which his great reputation and royal favoritism, brought into vogue. Still, he deserves praise for the great facility of his invention, the force and richness of his coloring, and a certain grandeur of conception and freedom of execution which belong only to a great master. The royal gallery at Madrid possesses no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> of his pictures, selected from the multitude he left in the various royal palaces.

The Confederate army, its corps under Generals Polk, D. H. Hill, and Buckner, was stationed on the east side of the stream, its right wing below Lee and Gordon's Mills, and the left extending up the creek toward Lafayette. On the Federal side Thomas was moved to the left, with Crittenden in the center and McCook on the right. Their strength has been estimated at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to sixty-nine thousand men. On the 18th, Longstreet's troops were arriving from Virginia, and by the morning of the 19th the greater part of the Confederate army had crossed the Chickamauga. The two mighty armies were now face to face, and none could doubt that the impending struggle would be attended by frightful loss to both sides. It was Bragg's intention to send Polk, commanding the right wing, in a flanking movement against the Federal left under Thomas, and thus...", "...would you, can you use us?

He might live as long as Father Peter (Father Peter was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> when he died); if so, twenty-one years of existence by the lake's side awaited him, and these years seemed to him empty like a desert--yes, and as sterile.

The _Conversationshaus_ is rented by the government to a company, who pay <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand dollars a year for the monopoly of the gaming tables, and pledge themselves to spend one hundred thousand dollars annually upon the walks and buildings. Of course players must lose vast sums of money to enable the keepers of the establishment to pay these large prices.

It may, therefore, be of interest to compare the expenditures of the three war periods--the war with Great Britain, the Mexican War, and the War of the Rebellion. In 1814 the annual expenses incident to the War of 1812 reached their highest amount--about thirty-one millions--while our population slightly exceeded 8,000,000, showing an expenditure of only $3.80 per capita. In 1847 the expenditures growing out of the war with Mexico reached <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> millions, and the population about 21,000,000, giving only $2.60 per capita for the war expenses of that year. In 1865 the expenditures called for by the rebellion reached the vast amount of twelve hundred and ninety millions, which, compared with a population of 34,000,000, gives $38.20 per capita. From the 4th day of March, 1789, to the 30th of June, 1861, the entire expenditures of the Government were $1,700,000,000.

The flock was sold and Isaac was left without sheep, and with little to do except to wait from Michaelmas to Candlemas, when there would be sheep again at the farm. It was a long time to Isaac, and he found his enforced holiday so tedious that he made himself a nuisance to his wife in the...", "...should be, For when his legs were hewn in two, He knelt and fought on his knee.

Eighty percent of the women's hat-makers and milliners were out of work, seventy-two percent of the workers in glass and fifty-eight percent in china. The Frauendienst investigated two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand needy cases, and in Berlin alone found sixty thousand women who had lost their employment. Charity had to render help. Here, again, it is an example of the alertness of the organization and its close connection with the government that the Berlin magistracy deputed to twenty-three Hilfscommissionen from the Frauendienst the work of giving advice and charity relief to the unemployed. Knitting rooms were opened, clothing depots, mending rooms, where donated clothing...", "...in to Mr. Brandon, who came into the office immediately and crossed to where Frank sat. \"Look at this,\" he said.

I shall be very glad, therefore, if you will arrange to cash the inclosed check. Yours faithfully, REX A. HOLLAND. The \"inclosed check\" was for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand pounds and was within five thousand pounds of the amount standing to Mr. Holland's account in the bank. There was a postscript to the letter: You will accept this, my receipt, for the sum, and hand it to my messenger, Sergeant George Graylin, of the corps of commissionaires, and this form of receipt will serve to indemnify you against loss in the event of mishap.

He told his brother and David to make haste and put the quails into the cabin; and when that was done and they came into the shop, he set them at work on the coops. There was much yet to be done, but they had ample time to do it in, with more than a day to spare. When the next Wednesday night arrived <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> dozen quails, boxed and marked ready for shipment, were at the landing, waiting to begin the journey to their new home in the North, and Don carried in his pocket a letter addressed to the advertiser, which Captain Morgan was to mail at Cairo.

From among the green trees of the high bluff a mansion, which exhibited the taste of its builder, rose imposingly. This was, however, but one of the many edifices that are tombs of buried hopes. The proprietor, a northern gentleman, after the war purchased one-third of Sapelo Island for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand dollars in gold. He attempted, as many other enterprising northerners had done, to give the late slave a chance to prove his worth as a freedman to the world. \"Pay the negro wages; treat him as you would treat a white man, and he will reward your confidence with industry and gratitude.\" So thought and so acted the large-hearted northern colonel. He built a large mansion, engaged his freedmen, paid them for their work, and treated them like men. The result...", "...daughters remained with their mothers[9]. Having answered all the questions, partly by signs, and partly by means of what little of their language the Indians from St Salvador could understand, the admiral gave this person to eat, and presented him with some baubles, such as glass beads and slips of green and red cloth, and sent him on shore, desiring that his companions would bring gold to barter as had been done by the other Indians. When our people landed with this man, they found <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> other Indians among the trees near the shore, all of them armed with bows and arrows, perfectly naked and having their long hair tied into a large knot on the crown of the head, as worn by the women in Spain, and decorated with plumes of various feathers.

In other cases precautions are taken to prevent cross-fertilisation, as in the numerous cleistogamous or closed flowers. These occur in no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> different genera, belonging to twenty-four natural orders, and in thirty-two of these genera the normal flowers are irregular, and have therefore been specially modified for insect fertilisation.[152] These flowers appear to be degradations of the normal flowers, and are closed up by various modifications of the petals or other parts, so that it is impossible for insects to reach the interior, yet they produce seed in abundance, and are often the chief means by which the...", "...Educational questions have great prominence on the pages of his journal; he gives frequent notes upon the best modes of teaching the elementary branches, and proposes to publish in a serial form treatises adapted to use in the school-room.

General di Cesnola, whose work upon the antiquities of Cyprus must remain unrivalled, describes the tombs as from forty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet beneath the present surface, and even those great depths had not secured them from disturbance, as many that he opened had already been ransacked by former explorers.

For instance: were it possible for a person to journey to the sun in a single day, basing the calculation upon a corresponding degree of speed, it would require <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years to reach this fixed star! Probably not one-half of those who have sailed beneath its tranquil beauty are aware that near the upper middle of the cross there is a brilliant cluster of stars which, though not visible to the naked eye, are brought into view with the telescope.

The Copts are considered fine representatives of the old Egyptians, and they have succeeded in preserving their language and liturgy through twelve centuries of fierce oppression.

The Church of St. George will illustrate the peculiar arrangement of their religious edifices. Following the example of the older Egyptian Byzantine churches, the nave and tribune are uncovered and the side aisles have galleries. The nave has three divisions: first, a vestibule; second, a section set apart for women; and third, another section for men.

The opening of these railroads, however, had brought the West and East in much more intimate connection.

Lowndes also mentions \"Illustrations to the Book of Common Prayer by Richard Westall, London,...", "...on eleven desks (_poulpitres_). These were set round a room, with the exception of two which were placed in the middle of it. It is interesting to note respecting one of these, that it had a cupboard at the end, for the contents are entered as follows: _au bout dudit poulpitre sont enclos les livres qui s'ensuivent_, and sixteen volumes are enumerated. There was also a shelf set against the wall, described as _le plus hault poulpitre le long de la dite muraille_, which contained <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> volumes. This desk was probably high up, like the one in the library of the Duchess Margaret. The books upon it are noted as being all covered with red velvet, and ornamented with clasps, bosses, and corner-pieces of metal. There were also in this library an astrolabe, and a sphere with the signs of the Zodiac. [Illustration: Fig. 139. S. John writing his Gospel.

A week ago he had bought the thing in a sudden fit of enterprise, and now he shaved in five minutes, where before he had taken twenty, and no longer confronted his fellows, at least one day in three, with a countenance ludicrously mottled by sticking-plaster. Calculation revealed to him the fact that in his <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years, having begun to shave at eighteen, he had wasted three thousand three hundred and seventy hours--or one hundred and forty days--or between four and five months--by his neglect of this admirable invention.

The old black mammy, with her head tied up in a white cloth, was loved, respected and honored by every inmate of the home, regardless of color. The following incident will be of interest: Hon. John Randolph Tucker, one of Virginia's most gifted and learned sons, who represented his State in the U.S. Senate, always celebrated his birthday. I remember to have attended one of these celebrations. It was shortly after the close of the war. Mr. Tucker was then between <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> and sixty years of age. He had grown children. Fun making was one of his characteristics. On these annual occasions, it was his custom to dress himself in a long white gown and bring into the parlor his old black nurse, whom he called \"mammy.\" She sat in her rocking-chair with her head tied up in the conventional snow-white cloth. Mr. Tucker, dressed up as a child in his nightgown, would toddle in and climb up into her lap, and she would lull him to sleep with an old-time...", "...Don Romualdo Gimeno, who is governing the diocese worthily to the honor and glory of God, and the gain of the metropolitan see, having begun his office February 27, 1847.

The station at Berlin comprised five boilers, and six vertical steam-engines driving by belts twelve Edison dynamos, each of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> horse-power capacity. A model of this station is preserved in the Deutschen Museum at Munich. In the bulletin of the Berlin Electricity Works for May, 1908, it is said with regard to the events that led up to the creation of the system, as noted already at the Rathenau celebration: \"The year 1881 was a mile-stone in the history of the Allgemeine Elektricitaets Gesellschaft.

As early as May, 1776, Washington was advised of the following facts:-- First, That the contracts at that time made with continental States, including that with Hesse and Brunswick, would place at British disposal a nominal strength of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand men. Second, That, with all due allowance for deficiencies, the effective force, as claimed by the ministry, could not exceed, but might fall below, forty thousand men. The debate in Parliament was so sharp, and the details of the proposed operations were so closely defined and analyzed, that Washington had full right to assume, as known, the strength of his adversary.

A great deal of work still required to be done off Macquarie Island, but, as the uneven and rocky nature of the bottom prevented dredging, I decided to sail on the 25th, continuing the voyage towards the Auckland Islands. Several people had expressed belief in a submarine ridge connecting Macquarie Island with the Auckland group. Three soundings which we obtained on this voyage did not support the suggestion, ranging as they did from one thousand eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to two thousand four hundred and thirty fathoms, eighty-five miles south-west of the Auckland group. We were the more glad to obtain these soundings, as, during the winter cruise, in the same waters, the weather had forced us to abandon the attempt. On November 28 we took several soundings on the eastern side of the Auckland Islands, but did not prolong our stay as we wished to investigate the ridge south of Tasmania--the Mill Rise. The course was therefore directed...", "...of historical interest are so near together, that the automobilist who covers his hundred kilometres a day must be a scorcher indeed.

They had not discovered the secret of its power; and, therefore, its locks remained unshorn, its strength unabated. The institution advanced as triumphantly as if no opposition existed. The planters were progressing steadily, in securing to themselves the monopoly of the cotton markets of Europe, and in extending the area of slavery at home. In the same year that Gerritt Smith declared for abolition, the title of the Indians to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> millions of acres of land, in the slave States, was extinguished, and the tribes removed. The year that colonization was depressed to the lowest point, the exports of cotton, from the United States, amounted to 595,952,297 lbs., and the consumption of the article in England, to 477,206,108 lbs.

At forty, most of them become gray haired, and covered with wrinkles; and but few of them survive the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty. They calculate the years of their lives, as I have already observed, by the number of rainy seasons, (there being but one such in the year,) and distinguish each year by a particular name, founded on some remarkable occurrence which happened in that year. Thus they say the year of the _Farbanna war_; the year of the _Kaarta war_; the year on which _Gadou was plundered_, &c. &c.; and I have no doubt that the year 1796 will in many places be distinguished by the name...", "...for so many of them.

Nothing could be more decided than his conduct; and his attack was made with so much vigour and judgment, that a ship of very superior force to _l'Unite_ must have rewarded his gallantry. To his extreme vigilance and zeal, the squadron are indebted for this prize. It is not improper for me to say, that on all occasions I have found much...", "...kindly household.

The Copt fast is no joke, neither butter, milk, eggs nor fish being allowed for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> days. They made Sally dine with us, and Omar was admitted to wait and interpret. Wassef's younger brother waited on him as in the Bible, and his clerk, a nice young fellow, assisted. Black slaves brought the dishes in, and capital the food was. There was plenty of joking between the lady and Omar about Ramadan, which he had broken, and the Nasranee fast, and also about the number of wives allowed, the young clerk intimating that he rather liked that point in Islam.

In the event of its failure to do so, it must pay a monthly penalty amply sufficient in amount to cover the cost of maintaining the Benguet Road.

Palmerston's death, of course, dissolved this compact; and, though the General Election of 1865 had again yielded a Liberal majority, the change in the Premiership had transformed the aspect of political affairs. The new Prime Minister was in the House of Lords, seventy-three years old, and not a strong man for his age. His lieutenant in the House of Commons was Gladstone, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years old, and in the fullest vigour of body and mind. Had any difference of opinion arisen between the two men, it was obvious that Gladstone was in a position to make his will prevail; but on the immediate business of the new Parliament they were absolutely at one, and that business was exactly what Palmerston had for the last six years successfully opposed--the extension of the franchise to the working man.

Its size is not commonly accredited great, but for a fact its nave is over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet in width; greater than Chartres, and nearly as great as Amiens in the north. This is a comparison which will show how futile it is not to take into consideration the peers, compeers, or contemporaries of architectural types when striving to impress its salient features upon one's senses.

In 1813 Audubon says that during his whole journey from Hardensburg to Louisville, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles, countless masses of Pigeons continued to pass over, and also did so during the three following days. \"At times they flew so low, that multitudes were destroyed, and for many days the entire population seemed to eat nothing else but Pigeons.\" Where they roosted in millions, the dung soon covered the ground and destroyed the grass and undergrowth, limbs and even small trees broke down from the weight of the birds. \"One of the breeding places visited by Wilson, not far...", "...You open the purse, and see that all the money is safe.\" Cecile did as she was bid, and out fell the fifteen sovereigns and the four Bank of England notes. \"'Tis all there, Jane,\" she said, \"even to the little bit of paper under the lining.\" \"What's that, child?\" \"I don't know, there's some writing on it, but I can't read writing.\" \"Well, but I can, let me read it, darling.\" Cecile handed the paper to her, and Jane read aloud the following words: \"'This purse contains <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> pounds.

The great empire of Charlemagne was divided at his death (in A.D. 814) among his three sons,--one of whom had France, another Italy, and the third Germany. In forty-five years afterwards we find seven kingdoms, instead of three,--France, Navarre, Provence, Burgundy, Lorraine, Germany, and Italy. In a few years more there were twenty-nine hereditary fiefs. And as early as the tenth century France itself was split up into <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> independent sovereignties; and these small sovereignties were again divided into dukedoms and baronies. All these dukes and barons, however, acknowledged the King of France as their liege lord; yet he was not richer or more powerful than some of the dukes who swore fealty to him. The Duke of Burgundy at one time had larger territories and more power than the King of France himself. So that the central authority of kings was merely nominal; their power extended scarcely...", "...from bread to beer, may be guessed from the fact that in London, for which the beer ordinance was first made, there were in 1309, brewhouses to the number of 1334, and taverns to the number of 354[102].

To show what that really meant let me cite a few factors that are easily grasped. The population of the German Empire was then, roundly, 70,000,000 persons. Of this number 35,000,000 were women. Of the 35,000,000 men all individuals from birth to the age of fifteen were virtually consumers only, while those from fifty years onward were more or less in the same class. Accepting that the average length of life in Central Europe is <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years, we find that the male producers in 1915 numbered about 20,000,000, and of this number about one-half was then either at the fronts or under military training. Of these 10,000,000 roughly 4,200,000 had formerly occupied themselves with the production and distribution of food. I need not state that this army formed quite the best element in food production for the simple reason that it was composed of men in the prime of life.

From exposure there were one hundred and one cases of bones and locomotion. Trench feet were bad to treat. From external causes there were two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> cases. Of these two were burns, two dislocation, twenty-six severe frost bite cases, two exhaustion from exposure, twenty-three fractures and sprains, and two hundred wound cases.

Although opposed by such unequal numbers the Englishmen skilfully secured a windward position, bore down upon the enemy as they shaped their course for the English coast, threw quicklime in their eyes, poured into the enemy a volley of arrows from the long bows for which the English were famous, and scattered and destroyed the enemy's ships, so that only about seventeen escaped; <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> were captured, and the rest were sunk. The credit of this signal victory in an engagement at sea which may rank as almost the first in English history, certainly the first subsequently to the time of King Alfred, belongs to the men of the Cinque Ports. The strength of the Cinque Port forces in the fourteenth century may be gathered from the fact that at the Siege of Calais (1347), when the fleet was called out to assist in the blockade and to defend the Channel, the...", "...that they had no reason for delaying matters. Since it had been decided as best to invade the wolf den, the sooner they started, the better.

But then Hank was directing matters now, and whatever he said must be done. Besides, Hank had known wolves ever since he first \"toted\" a gun, now more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years ago. Perhaps he understood how difficult it is to smoke out a pack of wolves, that invariably seek a cave with a depth sufficient to get away from all the influences of the smudge.

Still more terrible and treacherous were the tragedies enacted at Cawnpore, a city situated on the Ganges about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles to the southwest of Lucknow. Cawnpore had been in the possession of the English ever since the beginning of the century, and for many years was one of the most important military stations in India; but the extension of the British Empire over the Punjab had diminished the importance of Cawnpore; and the last European regiment quartered there had been removed to the northwest at the close of the previous year.

There is generally an inequality in the balances used for weighing there in the field, where only God is witness, and the cabeza or collector, who weighs according to his pleasure.

Jules Andre Gueret, when twenty-five years old, became the possessor of a large fortune. He remained a bachelor, and turned his estate into hard cash. An epicurean, a man of some taste, and a bit of a philosopher, he began a calculation to ascertain how he could best enjoy himself. Making no investments, he kept his cash at home. Gueret came to the conclusion that a sober man's life averaged seventy years, but that a pleasure-seeking, gay man's life might only last <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty years. He then divided his finances into so many equal portions. Each portion was to be an annual allowance, the pleasure-seeker arranging that the money should last five-and-thirty years. Gueret, in conclusion, made a compact with himself that if he lived beyond sixty years of age, suicide would prevent his suffering ills at the hands of poverty. But when turned sixty years of age, and when his money was exhausted, either love of life or fear of death prevented the...", "...ceased to be.

Then it must be quickly reaped and stored away out of the reach of the rain and wet. For a few weeks in each year there was a great demand for labor on the wheat farms. And there was little labor to be had. Cyrus H. McCormick solved this problem for the wheat growers by inventing a horse reaper. The invention was made in 1831, but it was not until 1845 that the reaper came into general use. By 1855 the use of the horse reaper was adding every year <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> million dollars to the wealth of the country. Each year its use moved the fringe of civilization fifty miles farther west. Without harvesting machinery the rapid settlement of the West would have been impossible. And had not the West been rapidly settled by free whites, the whole history of the country between 1845 and 1865 would have been very different from what it has been. The influence of the horse reaper on our political history, therefore, is as important as the...", "...down he arrived at the place where the Spaniard had remained. He told him that he had gone \"above thirty leagues into the country\" beyond.

He says he went up eighty-five leagues (this would be <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> the first time and thirty more the second), which, counting in Mexican leagues of two and three quarter miles each, gives a distance of 233 3/4 miles, or about one hundred miles above the mouth of the Gila.

The number of land-forces, including the British troops in Germany, and the invalids, they fixed at fifty-seven thousand two hundred and ninety-four men, and granted for their subsistence one million three hundred and eighty-three thousand seven hundred and forty-eight pounds and tenpence.

It was one of the happy points about Moscheles' Sunday afternoons that if you cared to continue talking with another caller and the other caller cared to continue to listen, or to talk with...", "...Quercy, after having returned to its legitimate sovereigns, has testified to them the greatest loyalty; yet have its inhabitants been grievously injured, assailed, beaten, robbed, pillaged, imprisoned, killed, maltreated by the English in divers ways, which enemies have since taken and occupied the greater part of the finest towns and fortresses of the land; on which account the land of Quercy has since continued in a condition of mortal warfare with the said enemies for the space of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years; and this carried on without aid from us, or from any one:--This unfortunate land has resisted to the utmost of its powers and is doing so still; and it has been surrounded for long by our said enemies, and is as it were destroyed and uninhabitable, and the greater number of its towns, castles, and strongholds have become desert and wild, covered with forest and scrub, inhabited by wild beasts, with the exception of some few small places that are very poor and...", "...request that he would select a number. Cagliostro took the manuscript and studied it, but, as he himself informs us, with no confidence in its truth. He, however, predicted twenty as the successful number for the 6th of November following. Scot ventured a small sum upon this number out of the two hundred pounds he had borrowed, and won. Cagliostro, incited by this success, prognosticated number twenty-five for the next drawing. Scot tried again, and won a hundred guineas. The numbers <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> and fifty-seven were announced with equal success for the 18th of the same month, to the no small astonishment and delight of Cagliostro, who thereupon resolved to try fortune for himself, and not for others. To all the entreaties of Scot and his lady that he would predict more numbers for them, he turned a deaf ear, even while he still thought him a lord and a man of honour; but when he discovered that he was a mere swindler, and the pretended Lady Scot an artful woman of...", "...were friends of the intellect merely; altogether, he seemed led by destiny to the place he was to fill.

That the city draws mainly those of the working period of life is also generally conceded. The number of children in this Negro group under 15 years of age is 19 per cent, below normal for great cities, and the upper age limit is also quite low, being only 6.6 per cent between forty-five and fifty-four years, and 3.2 per cent over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years. Thus the bulk of the population, 70.8 per cent, both male and female, excluding 0.4 per cent doubtful and unknown, falls between fifteen and fifty-four years, or within the vigorous working period of life.

He was a thoroughly good, sensible man, and had been a faithful friend to the Mission and to the Government. He died in July 1885, and I think he must then have been about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age.

In case the octroi is not suppressed altogether, the communes are obliged to diminish the tax in certain proportions, according to their population and their locality,--the cider-producing departments standing on a different footing from the wine-growing ones. To replace the octroi, they are given their choice of five other taxes--upon alcohol, or...", "...of ours flew on.

His length was about forty inches, and he would add five or six more to it before he got his full size. His head and body would then be two feet and three quarters or three feet of his length, and the other foot would be the queerest kind of a paddle shaped tail you ever saw.

Scott had recently spent large sums on the enlargement of Abbotsford, in settling his sons in life, and for other people; and he held the bills of Constable for four novels to be written in the future; the novels were written, but the bills were not honored.

The Decapolis, or region of ten Gentile cities, was the northeastern part of Palestine, extending eastward from the Jordan to the desert. Perea lay south of the Decapolis, and east of the Jordan and Dead Sea. The kingdom of Herod the Great, whose reign ended B.C. 4, included all of this territory. After his death the country was divided into tetrarchies.

Again, in 1664 the council had decided that the merchants might charge <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> per cent above cost price on dry goods, one hundred per cent on the more expensive wines and spirits, and one hundred and twenty per cent on the cheaper, the cost price in France being determined by the invoice-bills.

They were conducted at the lighthouse at Rochedouvres, situated about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> kilometres from the coast, during and after the long continuance of a good breeze directly inshore from the Atlantic. The air was drawn through a long tube containing glasswork, and this well then analyzed. He found that in a litre of air there was only 0.022 of a gramme of chloride of sodium.

The depth of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to sixty centimeters to which these men cause their instruments to penetrate, and which seems extraordinary to spectators, is explained by the dimensions of the organs traversed.

But any wind at once affects its velocity over the surface, which will be the composition of the speed of the plane through the air with the speed of the air over the surface. You see, a plane which stalls at forty miles an hour will, when landing into a fifteen-mile wind, make contact at twenty-five miles an hour. The same plane headed down-wind would land at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles an hour. And that difference of thirty miles an hour in landing speed might easily spell the difference between a good landing and a wrecked plane.\" His father smiled in the darkness. \"You talk like a textbook, Bill.

It appears that the total production of cotton yarn each day in all the mills together would be on the average about one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> million miles. In fact, if they would only spin about one-fifth more, we could assert that Great Britain produced enough cotton yarn every day to stretch from the earth to the sun and back again!

Altogether, though not at any one time, there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> delegates in attendance from twelve States. Rhode Island was never represented. The average attendance was hardly more than thirty. It was possible, therefore, to adopt simple rules of procedure and to permit full discussion.

The power of congress to make these requisitions was seriously contested, and it was gravely urged that such a power, connected with the rights to borrow money, and to emit bills of credit, would be dangerous to liberty, and alarming to the states. The motion for raising this small number of regulars did not prevail; and an order was made that except twenty-five privates to guard the stores at fort Pitt, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> to guard those at West Point and other magazines, with a proportionable number of officers, no one to exceed the rank of captain, the troops already in service should be discharged, unless congress, before its recess, should dispose of them in some other manner.

A recent invention, the perfection of which is due to the work of Mr. William Dubilier, an American electrical engineer, and of Professor Tissot, a member of the French Academy of Science, is the microphone. Few details are known about this instrument except that it records sound waves at as great a distance as <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles. This would permit in most cases the calling of patrol boats or the use of other defensive means before the submarine would be able to execute an attack. At the present moment it would appear that the most dangerous enemy of the submarine yet discovered is the airplane or the dirigible. Some figures as to the mortality among submarines due to the efforts of aircraft have been published in an earlier chapter. The chief value of aircraft in this work is due to the fact...", "...the family circle. He studied Greek with Pierre Danes and Hebrew under Vatable.

He quotes, and that aptly, from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> separate Latin authors--from thirty-three separate works of Cicero, from all the works of Horace and Ovid, from five comedies of Terence, and from all the works of Virgil.

This was but a lame and impotent conclusion after the vigorous movement with which the French credit themselves.

Certainly, with eighty-one ships and the weather-gage they might well have done more against <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> enemies to leeward. The Dutch admiral may perhaps have hoped to do sufficient injury to a portion of his enemy's fleet to induce him to return home in order to refit. But the allies continued on the coast, and De Ruyter, who must by this time have seen clearly that he was not called upon to contend against great energy or faculty, decided not to wait to be attacked.

Farther on she met three carts, which, being fastened in front of her, she pushed on before her without the slightest delay or difficulty; when I add that this pretty little creature can run with equal facility either backwards or forwards, I believe I have given you an account of all her capacities. Now for a word or two about the master of all these marvels, with whom I am most horribly in love. He is a man from fifty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age; his face is fine, though careworn, and bears an expression of deep thoughtfulness; his mode of explaining his ideas is peculiar and very original, striking, and forcible; and although his accents indicates strongly his north country birth, his language has not the slightest touch of vulgarity or coarseness. He has certainly turned my head. Four years have sufficed to bring this great undertaking to an end. The railroad will be opened upon the fifteenth of...", "...which was assumed to be present in the mind of every man. Whatever laws or rules therefore were in existence were not for the information of the people, but for the guidance of the magistrates. The _Legacy of Ieyasu_ consists of one hundred chapters, arranged without any attempt at logical order. Each chapter treats of a single, separate subject, and is usually of a very moderate length. As Professor Grigsby has pointed out: \"Sixteen chapters consist of moral maxims and reflections; <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> are connected with politics and administrations; twenty-two refer to legal matters, and in seven Ieyasu relates episodes of his own personal history.\" The moral maxims are quoted chiefly from the works of the Chinese sages, Confucius and Mencius. While the collection on the whole has a military aspect, and plainly encourages and promotes the well-being of a military class, yet we see in it the mild and peaceful nature of Ieyasu. The fifteenth chapter says: \"In my youth my...", "...this time, as we all do, that mother's bark may be sharp, but her bite is nothing.\" \"I hope you are not very dull, darling Piers?\" Joyce asked. \"Dull! No, thank goodness! I don't know what dullness means.

But I must not stay; remember you and mother are to spend Christmas with us in Great George Street.\" The Clifton of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> year's ago might not present such an appearance of gaiety on a fine afternoon as it does now; but, nevertheless, the Downs and Observatory were sprinkled with people, well dressed, in carriages, or Bath chairs, or on foot. It was decided that the carriage should be ordered by Joyce from the stables at the back of Sion Hill, as she went to Windsor Terrace; that Mrs. Falconer, Piers, and Charlotte should drive to the turnpike on the Down, and then come to the top of Granby...", "...This is needed between him and Francisco Nunez, who collects one hundred and ninety tributes in Buri. ...

I had risked more money than that on the fact that Slater looked worried and Bawker was very cross when at his office, and it had won immensely. But here, what a prospect, what a far-reaching, all-encircling prospect it was! No time was to be lost; besides, there was pleasure to me in driving a good bargain and driving it quickly. \"And if I give you the ten thousand dollars, what do I get in return?\" I asked, mentally placing my part at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> per cent. of the shares at the lowest, so that I might control the company. \"You may organize the corporation yourself. The projectile must bear my name, and I must have the credit for all discoveries and inventions. Then you may give me such a part of the shares of the company as you think right,\" he replied. On hearing this, I mentally advanced my portion to seventy-five per cent.

Goobbe is a large market town in the kingdom of Mysore, and Singonahully is a small village about two miles from Goobbe. The Wesleyan Mission premises are situated between these two places.

Many years ago,--it is not known exactly how many--a man of the Washerman caste left his native village and came to Singonahully. He brought his family with him, but left behind a box containing an idol and some other sacred things, in charge of the village priest. This man was Daniel's grandfather.

To get the brigs over this bar was a work of time and great difficulty; an attack at that hour by the British would certainly have ended in the total destruction of the fleet. This feat accomplished, Perry, in his flagship, the _Lawrence_, headed a fleet of ten vessels, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> guns and four hundred men. Opposed to him was Captain Barclay with six ships, sixty-five guns, and also about four hundred men. The British for several weeks avoided the conflict, but in the end were cornered and forced to fight.

In peace, the earls of Devon resided in their numerous castles and manors of the west; their ample revenue was appropriated to devotion and hospitality; and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed from his misfortune, the _blind_, from his virtues, the _good_, earl, inculcates with much ingenuity a moral sentence, which may, however, be abused by thoughtless generosity.

In one month the Union army had lost <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand men, while the Confederate losses had been comparatively small.

Her voice was high and rather shrill, and she often spoke with an anxious inflection, for she was exceedingly desirous that everything should go with due order and decorum. Her laugh, too, was high, and perhaps a little strident, but there was a lively intelligence in it.

In what manner he drove out the foreigners we are not told, but so much is clear that the decisive victory was that which he gained over the Elamite king of Larsam.

The question at issue was whether this structure represented one or a pair of bundles, or whether it might not be a segment of the fibro-vascular ring of the stem. A study of the early stages shows that the first change in the stem is to divide...", "...place where her mother was. As fast as she goes, let us precede her there, and find out what we can of Mrs. Marston.

A piece of white cloth is tied about her head; her sleeves are pushed beyond her elbows, and she is wearily rubbing away at the clothes, a settled look of pain being upon her fast wrinkling face. She is now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age, and her whole life--both the part that lies in the time of slavery and the part that has come afterwards--her whole life has been one long day of toil, with no prospect of a sunset and an hour of rest before the coming of the eternal sleep.

The stores of the expedition were clothing, working tools, fire-arms, food supplies, powder, ball, lead for bullets, and flints for the guns then in use, the old-fashioned flint-lock rifle and musket being still in vogue in our country; for all of this was at the beginning of the present century. As the party was to begin their long journey by ascending the Missouri River, their means of travel were provided in three boats. The largest, a keel-boat, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet long and drawing three feet of water, carried a big square sail and twenty-two seats for oarsmen. On board this craft was a small swivel gun. The other two boats were of that variety of open craft known as pirogue, a craft shaped like a flat-iron, square-sterned, flat-bottomed, roomy, of light draft, and usually provided with four oars and a square sail which could be used when the wind was aft, and which also served as a tent, or night shelter, on shore. Two horses,...", "...in character. Sound is made by horizontal waves, for example, while electricity and light are made by transverse waves.

If the composition of the other corps is similar, it may be assumed that the present efficiency of the enemy's forces is in no way comparable with what it was when the war commenced.

A brigade is stated to be commanded by a Major; some companies of food guards by one-year volunteers; while after the battle of Montmirail one regiment lost <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> out of sixty officers.

They held out until three-fourths of them were slain, when the survivors, seventy-five wounded men, accepted the quarter offered them from the first. The English lost ten killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> wounded, and the Chinese more than a thousand. After this the expedition proceeded northward for the Great River, and it was found necessary to attack Woosung, the port of Shanghai, en route. This place was also strongly fortified with as many as 175 guns in position, but the chief difficulty in attacking it lay in that of approach, as the channel had first to be sounded, and then the sailing ships towed into position by the steamers.

At the same time, the corresponding Allied army, commanded by Eugene, arrived at Brussels, so that both sides were largely reinforced.

In so far as it has not entirely destroyed the drink traffic, prohibition is not a success; but it has succeeded in diminishing crime, pauperism and drunkenness, and in greatly in-creasing the wealth of the people. In 1857, a few years after the law came into force, there were only eleven savings banks in the State, with 5000 depositors, and a total of deposits and accrued profits of about a million dollars. In 1882 there were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> savings banks, with 90,000 depositors; and the Hon. J. G. Blaine estimated the aggregate deposits and accrued profits at 30,000,000 dollars or more. Pauperism has shown a steady decrease.

The day of the first start, says Colonel Majors, on the 3d of April, 1860, at noon, Harry Roff, mounted on a spirited half-breed broncho, left Sacramento on his perilous ride, covering the first twenty miles, including one change, in fifty-nine minutes. On reaching Folsom he changed again and started for Placerville at the foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles distant. There he connected with \"Boston,\" who took the route to Friday's Station, crossing the eastern summit of the Sierra Nevada. Sam Hamilton next fell into line and pursued his way to Genoa, Carson City, Dayton, Reed's Station, and Fort Churchill, seventy-five miles.

From this it appears that the house is a single very large dwelling of which the dimensions on the ground may be taken at one hundred feet of frontage by sixty feet or rather less of depth.

The wisdom of this course is fully demonstrated by the fact that, although we soon began the manufacture of these classes of guns at home, there were no guns of the calibers mentioned manufactured in America on our front at the date the armistice was signed. The only guns of these types produced at home thus far received in France are 109 seventy-five millimeter guns....", "...the nations is in some sort promoted by this shaking down together of their goods and chattels.

On the 17th of April, an ordinance was adopted providing for Virginia's secession from the Union and submitting this action of the Convention to the people for ratification or rejection at a special election to be held on the 23d of May. In the Convention the tentative ordinance was passed by a vote of eighty-eight ayes to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> noes (nine not voting), and before the people a month later it was confirmed by a vote of 128,884 against 32,134. Mr. Rhodes records that, in the concluding hours of the Convention, strong men spoke for or against secession, with sorrowful hearts and in voices trembling with emotion.[388] This action of the Convention was the logical and inevitable result of the President's proclamation.

But the eight who \"took the stump\" in Sangamon in the summer of 1836 were supported as loyally and as energetically as if they had been nominated with all the solemnity of modern days. They became famous in the history of the State, partly for their stature and partly for their influence in legislation. They were called, with Herndon, the \"Long Nine;\" their average height was over six feet, and their aggregate altitude was said to be <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet.

His companion, a little shorter, but unusually square and thick-set, seemed to be about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years old, and presented that type of the sailor familiar to the eyes of Parisians. An oilcloth hat, low in shape, with a wide brim, placed on the back of his head, revealed a brow ornamented with five or six corkscrew curls, known as heart-catchers, while the rest of his hair was cut very close. This manner of wearing the hair, called the sailor style, was, if traditions are true, quite popular in 1825 among crews of the line sailing from the port of Brest.

The dates of opening of these thirty-three private asylums, so far as known, were: three in the last century, to wit, in 1744, 1758, and 1759; one in each of the following years, 1802, 1811, 1814, 1816, 1823, 1825, 1826, 1829, 1832, 1833, 1834, 1836, 1837, 1840, 1842, and 1843; and two in 1830, 1831, 1838, and 1839.

As can be imagined, snow will vanish like a dream under a wind of such temperature, or even one at fifty degrees or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> degrees, which is more common.

Even the first magistrates of that city were not ashamed to enrich themselves by so odious a commerce.

We can hardly suppose the number of persons in a house to have been greater than in the city of London; and in the city of London we learn from the best authority that there were then <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> persons to ten houses. The population of Bristol must therefore have been about twenty-nine thousand souls. [90] Norwich was the capital of a large and fruitful province. It was the residence of a Bishop and of a Chapter.

The best estimate that can be obtained gives to New England, in 1675, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand souls. Of these it is supposed that Plymouth contained not less than seven thousand, Connecticut, nearly fourteen thousand, Massachusetts proper, more than twenty-two thousand, and Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, each perhaps four thousand.

But even this was nothing to what some of them secured later by holding several offices at once. At one time Berthier had a yearly income of a million three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand francs; Davout, of nine hundred and ten thousand; Ney, of seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand; Massena, of six hundred and eighty-three thousand.

The out-migration, mostly of young people, from agriculture brought about a deterioration in the age structure of the remaining farm population.

Conversely, the proportion of persons <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years and older was 29.1 percent in agriculture, compared to 8.6 percent in industry. The program for the modernization and intensification of agricultural production and, more particularly, the planned high level of mechanization demand the employment of large numbers of highly skilled young people.

Had his motive been self-preservation he could have gained the shore more easily without a rope; but his motive was not selfish--it was truly generous.

At first sight Ferdinand Lind appeared to be about fifty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age; his closely cropped hair was gray; and his face, in repose, somewhat care-worn. But then when he spoke there was an almost youthful vivacity in his look; his dark eyes were keen, quick, sympathetic; and there was even a certain careless ease about his dress--about the turned-down collar and French-looking neck-tie, for example--that had more of the air of the student than of the pedant about it.

It was Warner who conferred the name of Eschol Sellers on the chief figure of the collaborated novel. Warner had known it as the name of an obscure person, or perhaps he had only heard of it. At all events, it seemed a good one for the character and had been adopted. But behold, the book had been issued but a little while when there rose \"out of the vasty deeps\" a genuine Eschol Sellers, who was a very respectable person. He was a stout, prosperous-looking man, gray and about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years old.

The murder of the disgraced Sennacherib \"within <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> days\" of his return to Nineveh, seems to be an invention of the Alexandrian Jew who wrote the Book of Tobit. The total destruction of the empire in consequence of the blow, is an exaggeration of Josephus, rashly credited by some moderns.

No small matter would have detained him, even if the Pasha after all thought that a long journey to Fort Bodo was unnecessary. But the fact that neither had been heard of placed us in a dilemma. We had <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> extra loads to carry, over and above the number of carriers, of absolutely necessary property. After a little midnight mental deliberation I resolved to make double marches between Fort Bodo and the Ituri River on the edge of the plains, leave Lieutenant Stairs and officers and sick at the well-furnished clearing of Kandekore, and march to the Nyanza to search for Emin Pasha and Mr. Mounteney Jephson.

My friends there, who considered I had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable job, and a great help to me; this was another advantage gained by my being able to write. The utility of this currency became by time and experience so evident, that the principles upon which it was founded were never afterward much disputed; so that it grew soon to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand pounds; and in 1739, to eighty thousand pounds, trade, building, and inhabitants all the while increasing: though I now think there are limits beyond which the quantity may be hurtful.

The _Echo_ corvette was chosen for this purpose, which sailed on the 29th of July, in the evening.

The water-system of the capital was commenced by Appius Claudius (about 313 B.C.), who secured the building of an aqueduct which led water into the city from the Sabine hills. During the republic four aqueducts in all were completed; under the emperors the number was increased to fourteen. [Footnote: Several of these are still in use.] The longest of these was about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles in length. The aqueducts usually ran beneath the surface, but when a depression was to be crossed, they were lifted on arches, which sometimes were over one hundred feet high.

The water-system of the capital was commenced by Appius Claudius (about 313 B.C.), who secured the building of an aqueduct which led water into the city from the Sabine hills. During the republic four aqueducts in all were completed; under the emperors the number was increased to fourteen. [Footnote: Several of these are still in use.] The longest of these was about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles in length. The aqueducts usually ran beneath the surface, but when a depression was to be crossed, they were lifted on arches, which sometimes were over one hundred feet high. These lofty arches running in long broken lines over the plains beyond the walls of Rome, are the most striking feature of the Campagna at the present time.

His dress was of the coarsest description, consisting of a cloth of a dusky grey color, the upper garment being a loose sort of surtout, falling almost to the knees, and secured round the waist by a dark woollen sash. His age it was difficult to determine. It might have been anywhere between forty-five and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years. The attitude and appearance of the man, were that of devotion and expectancy. His body was bent forward, his hands clasped, and his eyes intently fastened on the eastern sky, along the horizon of which layers of clouds, a moment before of a leaden hue were now assuming deeper and deeper crimson tints. As the clouds flushed up into brighter colors his countenance kindled with excitement. His form seemed to dilate, his eyes to flash, his hands unclasped themselves,...", "...his behalf.

He jumped into it at once, so that I had no time to take notice of anything except that he talked without an accent, was probably French only in name and that he wore clothes which were superfine. I never saw such a dresser for a man with iron-gray hair and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years to contend against in the youth-preserving business, which I calculated was one of his pleasures in life, if not his vocation. Nothing I figured on coming up-town happened except that I found my man. A sixty-year old boy brought me to the room on the third floor.

At first he would not have them do this, but at last, when he was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years old, he began to find the treatment he had formerly contemned very pleasant; and reckoning himself the mainstay of all monasticism, he gave more care to the preservation of his health than had heretofore been his wont.

This condition of affairs, together with other causes, produced a crisis, as will be seen. The advance of Amalric and the Crusaders, in 1168, not only resulted in the downfall of the Fatimids, but in the destruction of old Fustat, Shawar, the ruler, having issued a mandate for it to be burned in order to prevent the city from becoming a refuge for the Crusaders.

A man ought to insure his life when he's married; it'll cost me fifteen pounds a year.\" \"Oh, what a greedy world!\" cried Marie, despairing tears running down her face. Osborn kissed them away, but remained much preoccupied. \"It leaves <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> pounds between us for my clothes and lunches, and travelling, and your pocket money.\" \"How about your commission, Osborn? Your 'extras'?\" \"With luck they'll pay for a decent holiday once a year or so.\" Marie suddenly readjusted her scheme of life while she sat blindly gazing before her into that too-costly fire. \"Osborn,\" she said quietly, \"I--I shouldn't think of wanting any of your fifty-five pounds. You'll need it all; you must keep up appearances. I'll squeeze...", "...* NATURAL WONDERS OF AMERICA. PART I. Within the vast extent of territory belonging to the United States, there are many wonderful natural curiosities which attract visitors from all parts of the world. A short description of some of the principal attractions is here given, with the hope that many who read this lesson, may at some time visit a part or all that are noticed. GEYSERS OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK. The Yellowstone Park is a tract of country <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> by sixty-five miles in extent, lying mainly in the northwest corner of the Territory of Wyoming, but including a narrow belt in southern Montana. It contains nearly thirty-six hundred square miles, and is nearly three times as large as the State of Rhode Island. No equal extent of country on the globe comprises such a union of grand and wonderful scenery. Numerous hot springs, steam jets, and extinct geyser cones exist in the Yellowstone basin. Just beyond the western rim...", "...stupidly. 'She sent off the Count with a flea in his ear, and a poor return it was. But she can explain it to him, and after all, she has got the Waldgrave back, safe and sound. That is the main thing.' Marie sighed, and moved restlessly. 'Is it?' she said. 'I wish I knew.' 'What?' I asked, drawing her little head on to my shoulder. 'What my lady wishes?' 'Eh?' 'Which?' My jaw fell. I stared into the darkness open-mouthed. 'Why,' I exclaimed at last, 'he is sixty--or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> at least, girl!' Marie laughed softly, with her face on my breast. 'If she loves him,' she murmured. 'If she loves him.' And she hung on me. I sat amazed, confounded, thinking no more of Marie, though my arm was round her, than of a doll. 'But he is fifty five,' I said. 'And if you were fifty-five, do you think that I should not love you?' she whispered. 'When you are fifty-five, do you think that I shall not love you? Besides, he is strong, brave, famous--a man; and...", "...hull,\" said the captain in a softer tone. \"The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?\" \"Agreed.\" And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket. During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit. Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft! It was true, however, that <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank. When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, \"Don't let this astonish you, sir. You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December. I missed the steamer at New York, and as you refused to take me to Liverpool--\" \"And I did well!\" cried Andrew Speedy; \"for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it!\"...", "...things sometimes happen there uncut to pattern and unfettered by metes and bounds.

The past tense is used, for now he is Commissioner of Insurance alone. Statistics and history are no longer proper nouns in the government records. In the year 188--, the governor appointed Luke Coonrod Standifer to be the head of this department. Standifer was then <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of age, and a Texan to the core. His father had been one of the state's earliest settlers and pioneers. Standifer himself had served the commonwealth as Indian fighter, soldier, ranger, and legislator. Much learning he did not claim, but he had drank pretty deep of the spring of experience. If other grounds were less abundant, Texas should be well up in the lists of glory as the grateful republic. For both as republic and state, it has busily heaped honours and...", "...from an inner room. A heavy curtain on the further side shuts out this other room.

If Ahab reigned twenty-two years and Jehoshaphat began to reign in the fourth year of Ahab's reign, Jehoshaphat had reigned eighteen years when Ahab died, and twenty years when Ahaziah died.

Brooke county had the lowest per cent. of illiteracy--two per cent. while it was eight and three-tenths per cent. in the State at large.

Another element working toward the suffrage defeat was the use made by the opposition of the negro question. They told the...", "...tears.

The coins are not of the same weight as those of Greece; but Ptolemy followed the Egyptian standard of weight, which was that to which the Jewish shekel was adjusted, and which was in use in the wealthy cities of Tyre and Sidon and Beryttus. The drachma weighs <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> grains, making the talent of silver worth about seven hundred and fifty dollars. Ptolemy's bronze coins have the head of Serapis or Jupiter in the place of that of the king, as is also the case with those of his successors; but few of these bronze pieces bear any marks from which we can learn the reign in which they were coined. They are of better metal than those of other countries, as the bronze is free from lead and has more tin in it. The historian, in his very agreeable...", "...saying: \"I don't want yer money.

The only line of advance from Pocahontas which gave promise of important results, or which, indeed, was practicable, was by Greenville, distant some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty miles from Pocahontas, and Frederickton, to Ironton, and thence along the Iron Mountain Railroad by the most practicable roads to St. Louis. The country between Pocahontas and Ironton is rugged and heavily wooded. It is penetrated by few roads, and, in 1861, by no means abounded in supplies. General Hardee advanced as far as Greenville, and threatened Ironton. This latter place, the terminus of the Iron Mountain Railroad, is ninety-seven miles from St. Louis.

The man read the flush. \"May I ask you, did you pawn it,...", "...thinking over.\" Missy's Room Mrs. Falconer and Miss Bailey walked home together through the fine blue summer afternoon from the Ladies' Aid meeting at Mrs. Robinson's. They were talking earnestly; that is to say, Miss Bailey was talking earnestly and volubly, and Mrs. Falconer was listening. Mrs. Falconer had reduced the practice of listening to a fine art. She was a thin, wistful-faced mite of a woman, with sad brown eyes, and with snow-white hair that was a libel on her <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years and girlish step. Nobody in Lindsay ever felt very well acquainted with Mrs. Falconer, in spite of the fact that she had lived among them forty years. She kept between her and her world a fine, baffling reserve which no one had ever been able to penetrate. It was known that she had had a bitter sorrow in her life, but she never made any reference to it, and most people in Lindsay had forgotten it. Some foolish ones even supposed that Mrs. Falconer had forgotten it....", "...She had one eye and the top of one cheek covered by an ugly stain as of wine; otherwise she was well made, proud, impertinent in her conversation and in her manners, receiving compliments, giving next to none, paying but few visits, these rare and selected, and exercising authority in her household.

Moreover, the ancients had no accurate almanacs, since the care of the calendar belonged to the priests rather than to the astronomers, who tampered with the computation of time for temporary and personal objects. The calendars of different communities differed. Hence Julius Caesar rendered a great service to science by the reform of the Roman calendar, which was exclusively under the control of the college of pontiffs. The Roman year consisted of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> days, and, in the time of Caesar, the calendar was in great confusion, being ninety days in advance, so that January was an autumn month. He inserted the regular intercalary month of twenty-three days, and two additional ones of sixty-seven days. These, together of ninety days, were added to three hundred and sixty-five days, making a year of transition of four hundred and forty-five days, by which January was brought back to the first month in the year after the winter...", "...words here are identical in the two Gospels, the order also being the same. It stood in Q. JONAH AND THE NINEVITES (Mt xii, 38-42; Lk xi, 29-32) Each evangelist has supplied his own introduction. Matthew's vs. 40 is probably an interpolation, or at least a late addition. Beginning with Matthew's vs. 41 and Luke's vs. 32 (the order of Luke's verses has been reversed, perhaps by error of a scribe, since no motive appears for the change), there are fifty-three words in Matthew, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> in Luke, and fifty-three of them are identical. The verses are therefore universally assigned to Q. A SPEECH ABOUT BACKSLIDING (Mt xii, 43-45; Lk xi, 24-26) The correspondence here also is very close; out of sixty-two words in Matthew and fifty-five in Luke, fifty-four are identical. Matthew's surplus of eight words is accounted for by the addition of a clause not found in Luke, and probably a later addition in Matthew; it does not disturb the practical identity...", "...to the facts, or, at least, seems to do so, and yet a contemptible falsehood is implied. The instance of the truant boy is in point who entered the school-building five minutes before the close of the exercises, and on being asked at home whether he had been at school, promptly answered \"Yes\"; and so he had been for five minutes. But in this case the boy suppressed a part of the facts--and, moreover, the essential part--namely, that he had been absent from school for five hours and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> minutes. Cases of mental reservation and the like fall under the same condemnation. The person who took an oath in court, using the words, \"As truly as I stand on this stone,\" but who had previously filled his shoes with earth, suppressed the essential fact--viz., that he had filled his shoes with earth. Shall we then formulate the rule in this wise: Intend to make thy words correspond to the essential facts? But even this will not entirely satisfy.

Then prospecting parties went down the river, forming large camps at Delporthope, Esterhanger, Blue Jacket, Forlorn Hope, Keisikamma, Union Coppie, Gong Gong, Webster's Kops, Waldeck, Plant, and down the river from Barkly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles to Siffonel.

Men were ordered to tear off roofs and pull down houses; but the flames drove them from their work, and at four o'clock in the morning <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> buildings were burnt to the ground.

Alongside of the bishop stands a permanent synodal board of five priests and seven laymen. The bishop and synodal board have the right of vetoing doubtful decrees of synod.

It was not the romance defined in the dictionary as an action or adventure of an unusual or wonderful character, soaring beyond the limits of fact and real life and often of...", "...of the economic factor in recent Chinese history is made clear.] Little attention was attracted to what is a turning-point in Chinese history. There cannot be the slightest doubt that in 1894 the Manchus wrote the first sentences of an abdication which was only formally pronounced in 1912: they had inaugurated the financial thraldom under which China still languishes. Within a period of forty months, in order to settle the disastrous Japanese war, foreign loans amounting to nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> million pounds were completed. This indebtedness, amounting to nearly three times the \"visible\" annual revenues of the country--that is, the revenues actually accounted for to Peking--was unparalleled in Chinese history. It was a gold indebtedness subject to all sorts of manipulations which no Chinese properly understood. It had special political meaning and special political consequences because the loans were virtually guaranteed by the Powers. It was a long-drawn coup...", "...full bloom. At this time, and during the whole growing season, it requires abundant water. The best way to make sure of giving it a thorough one, is to stand it for half an hour in a pail of water. Keep it in a rather cool place, say forty-five at night, and the flowering season, which should last several weeks, will be prolonged. With the azaleas you must do the work for next year's success as soon as the flowering season is over. After repotting, keep in a temperature of fifty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> degrees at night. There are three types of azalea suitable for winter blooming, the Indian, Ghent and Mollis, of each of which there are several kinds. The Indian type has the advantage of not blooming without its leaves, as the others do. The best way to select the varieties wanted is to purchase when in bloom.

Considerable money and work have been expended in dredging Lake George, a beautiful lake about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> acres in extent, lying in the heart of the city, and surrounding it with parks.

Richardson mentions a case, happening in 1848, of a man of thirty-three who voluntarily fasted for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> days. His reason for fasting, which it was impossible to combat, was that he had no gastric juice and that it was utterly useless for him to take any nutrition, as he had no means of digesting it. He lived on water until the day of his death. Richardson gives an interesting account of the changes noticed at the necropsy.

Then there were the buildings for the public service: the immense cisterns of the East and the Malga, the great aqueduct, which, after being carried along a distance of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles, emptied the water of the Zaghouan into the reservoirs at Carthage. Finally, there were the Baths, some of which we know--those of Antoninus and of Maximianus, and those of Gargilius, where one of the most important Councils known to the history of the African Church assembled. There were likewise many Christian basilicas at the time of Augustin. The authors mention seventeen: it is likely there were more.

III WOMAN'S POSITION IN THE ARMY We write in a matter-of-fact way that Captain Lucy and Lieutenant Kate Lee received an appointment to this or that corps, and the statement is received as it was written--without surprise or reflection. But, in truth, behind such a sentence lies one of the most notable achievements of The Salvation Army as a world force--the right to public service for women. Looking over the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years of the life of The Army, and further back still, we can trace clearly the guiding hand of God in the formation and direction of this instrument of His choosing. When, in the order of Divine providence, William Booth was chosen to be Founder of the Salvation Army, by strange, devious, suffering ways, God led him, chastened him, disciplined him in preparation for his great work. At the same time, Catherine Mumford, by the hand of God, was being fitted to be the Mother...", "...soon as the sticks are full, place them carefully on wagons and carry them to the barn.

There have been scarcely any other events in his life, nor other benefice, than that of Etrepigny. He died in the odor of sanctity in the year 1733, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years old. It is believed that, disgusted with life, he expressly refused necessary food, because during his sickness he was not willing to take anything, not even a glass of wine. At his death he gave all he possessed, which was inconsiderable, to his parishioners, and desired to be buried in his garden. They were greatly surprised to find in his house three manuscripts, each containing three hundred and sixty-six pages, all written by his hand, signed and entitled by...", "...to the present day.

The last of these poetical works which it is necessary to mention is the _Sutta Nip[=a]ta_, containing <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> poems, all except the last merely short lyrics, many of great beauty.

The cablegram had only left London thirty-six hours previously. It had been re-transmitted by telephone from Lome to Mangu, whence it had been dispatched by relays of runners to our camp. The date stamp showed that it had left Mangu at ten o'clock that morning, and it reached us at eight o'clock in the evening, the distance from Mangu to Sumbu being approximately <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles. When it is remembered that there is no proper road between the two places, nor even a trail in many parts, that the heat in the daytime up here is so terrific that even the natives ordinarily do not care to move about in it, and that the letter had to be carried up hill and down dale, as well as across rivers and streams, it must be admitted that the performance was a good one.

It was just at this moment that I, for the first time, perceived the rather remarkable figure who had waited upon us at dinner, and who, while I chronicle so many things of little import, deserves a slight mention. He was a little old man of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty years, wearing upon his head a barrister's wig, and habited in clothes which originally had been the costume of a very large and bulky person, and which, consequently, added much to the drollery of his appearance.

He seemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old gentleman of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that probably belonged there. He was very simply dressed and was just taking off a straw hat as we entered.

After breakfast it was arranged that those outside should have their meals separately, digging down at intervals to let us know the state of the weather. It was not pleasant for us, congested as we were in the Cave, to have visitors sliding down through the opening with a small avalanche of snow in their train. Further, to increase their own discomfort, they arrived covered in snow, and what they were unable to shake...", "...the horses, to me secretly is an advantage, since it compels us to recover this last hour amongst the next eight or nine.

The first five of these, dated from Manchester, terminated in Lancaster, which was therefore <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles north of Manchester, and the same distance exactly from Liverpool. The first three terminated in Preston, (called, by way of distinction from other towns of that name, _proud_ Preston,) at which place it was that the separate roads from Liverpool and from Manchester to the north became confluent. Within these first three stages lay the foundation, the progress, and termination of our night's adventure.

Fifteen minutes later the porter stuck his head in between the curtains, saw that Taylor was still absorbed, and withdrew. At nine <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> the porter entered the compartment. \"We'll be in Dawes in five minutes, boss,\" he said. \"I've toted your baggage to the door.\" The porter withdrew, and a little later Taylor got up and went out into the aisle. At the far end of the car, near the door, he saw Marion Harlan, Parsons, and Carrington.

This number, fifty-five, might fairly be taken to represent the annual per centage of accumulation of the insane in asylums, were the data employed sufficient and satisfactory.

It was rather funny; and the locomotive got out of gear.\" Mr. Latrobe says of the Tom Thumb:-- \"The machine was not larger than the hand cars used by workmen to transfer themselves from place to place; and as the speaker now recalls its appearance, the only wonder is that so apparently insignificant a contrivance should ever have been regarded as competent to the smallest results....", "...yet I cannot say that he spoke any very kindly words; but we understood that, if ever we needed a helping hand, his would be stretched forth. That night when we were ready to get into our hammocks, Philip said to me with a certain tone of triumph:-- \"This has been a lucky day for the _Essex_. She has captured a prize that will bring all hands money with which to tassel our handkerchiefs, if it be so the _Nocton_ reaches a home port, and Captain Porter has the credit of gathering in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand dollars from the enemy; but I question if any aboard have been so fortunate since sunrise as you and me, for we have suddenly become shipmates with the one man among all the crew who is able to put us on a better footing with those who have lorded it over us.\" CHAPTER II.

If we take the arm of Mr. Smith, who is one of many perplexed at this time by the cost of living, and go round with him to rebuke the tradesmen who oppress and devour him by overcharges of every kind, we shall find these obdurate persons very quick upon their defence, and full of admirable justification of their supposed extortion. The wicked grocer, who in these piping times of peace makes Mr. Smith pay twenty cents a pound for sugar, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> cents for coffee, and a dollar and a half for tea, replies, when reproached with his heartlessness, that Mr. Smith gives him depreciated paper, not gold, for his sugar, while he must pay the importer for prime cost, freight, and duty, with the added premium on gold, and the importer's profit on the aggregate, as well as the new duty on refining; and that as to coffee, it has actually risen in price at Java through the Dutch government's monopoly of the entire product, while...", "...that they are largely grown for the decoration of glass structures and rooms. There are several methods adopted for raising the fine plants so often seen nowadays, which are generally young specimens grown from seeds. The following plan is followed by many successful growers. The seeds are sown from the beginning of August to the end of November, in pans of fibrous loam, some silver sand, and a fifth of leaf-soil. They are placed in an intermediate house, or a temperature of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> degrees, and in a little shade until the seedlings have begun to appear, when they may be placed near the glass and pricked off when they can be handled. They may be grown on in a similar temperature during the winter, but a little increase may be given immediately after potting off in February or March into three-inch pots. They should be placed in frames turned towards the north for the summer, receiving a potting into five-inch pots in July, and being kept close for a few...", "...one hundred feet, and twenty seven to the ceiling, which is supported by twelve well arranged and substantial pillars.

The wily fellow was far too clever ever to file two messages from the same telegraph office, and very seldom from the same city. However, the town of Claymore, from which the last message had been sent, was only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles away. It had occurred to her that by going there she might obtain from telegraph officials the original message filed. \"In that way I'd at least have Ben Bowman's signature,\" she reflected. \"While it wouldn't be much, it represents a start.\" Always, Penny's greatest problem was insufficient time. Greatly as she desired to drive to Claymore, she knew it would be out of the question for several days.

But the transfer was made so skilfully and expeditiously that it was practically a surprise. Probably Lee expected to find Grant battering away at his intrenchments at some point between the Chickahominy and the James; but he must have been astonished when he heard of him <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> miles distant, menacing his lines on the south side of Richmond. General Butler, with the army of the James, was at Bermuda Hundred, on the river. He had been directed to capture Petersburg while it was feebly defended. He had made the attempt, but it had failed.

A still earlier opera of his, \"The Fairies,\"--the first one he completed,--was not produced till 1888, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years after it had been written, and five years after Wagner's death. This has been performed a number of times in Munich, but it is so weak and uninteresting in itself that it required a splendid stage setting, and the \"historic\" curiosity of Wagner's admirers to make it palatable. It is significant that already in these early works, Wagner wrote his own librettos,--a policy which he pursued to the end.

McClellan fell into the trap and instead of pressing forward to attack Richmond, which was now only guarded by a small force, he, as usual, waited for reinforcements and allowed his antagonists to march around him and start flanking battles which threatened to cut off his line of communications. The battle of Gaines Mill was fought in which battle General Fitz John Porter with thirty-one thousand men stubbornly faced Lee and Jackson's forces of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand and with sullen obstinacy only retreated when it was absolutely impossible longer to hold his ground. This defeat, which occurred simply because McClellan could not bring himself to send Porter the necessary reinforcements, made General McClellan resolve to withdraw, although even then, with a superior army, he could have fought his way to Richmond. From June 25th to July 1, 1862, occurred the Seven Days' Battles fought by the retreating Union Army. By one of the...", "...got to hustle, we have.

Dr. Playfair says that amongst the upper class 18 per cent. of the children die before they reach five years of age; of the tradesman...", "...of General Lee, he was aware that his army was in no condition for an enlarged or energetic campaign. No small part of his men, as they marched over the sandy soil, were leaving bloody marks of their bare feet. It had been impossible to provide many of his soldiers with shoes.

As a consequence it is said, by those who are competent to judge, that not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> thousand men were in the army of the brilliant Southern general when he crossed the Potomac River. Much as the men were suffering, the animals of the camp were in no better condition. The horses were weakened by lack of food and by the hardships of the recent days.

Strange, indeed, when it was only a hundred and ten feet long, thirty-six feet wide, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet high! (1 Kings vi. 2.) Some of our modern churches are much larger buildings, and generally erected in less than a year by less than a dozen workmen. It is certainly very damaging to the exalted pretensions of \"the Lord's peculiar people\" that they possessed minds and intelligence so far below the heathen, that no workmen could be found amongst them, and they had consequently to go to these same heathen to hire workmen to build the Lord's house. Such facts sink the...", "...uncle,\" he said. \"I wish you had come a few minutes before.

These quarries are at least thirty miles distant from the Red Sea; but, as the ground affords a continual descent, and some traces of the road exist, there cannot be a doubt that these immense columns were destined to be carried to Philotera, and there shipped for Arsinoee, and that, like the porphyry vases, they were to find their way to Rome, by the canal, the Nile, and the port of Alexandria.

Besides these, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> sub-artesian wells--those whose water did not rise above the surface--yielded 21/2 million gallons a day; and perennial springs gave an ascertained continuous flow of nearly 4,000,000 gallons a day. The report calls attention to a serious diminution in the yield of certain wells, and says that it has been ascertained in some cases that the loss was due to loss of head, and not to any leakage or obstruction in the casing.

That night the consul had champagne at dinner, and drank a silent toast: \"Good luck to him, poor old devil!\" FORTY YEARS BETWEEN \"What am I to enter in the log, sir?\" asked Mr. Francis, the first lieutenant. \"There's an old-fashioned word for it,\" said Captain Hadow grimly. \"Had it been my...", "...furnished by its invaluable census report,[A] we see that the number of insane persons, which was 15,610 in 1850, 24,042 in 1860, and 37,432 in 1870, rose in 1880 to 91,994; while the population, from 23,191,876 in 1850, increased to 38,558,371 in 1870, to 50,155,783 in 1880--that is, while the population doubled in a little more than thirty years, the insane increased sixfold; so, in the last decade the increase in population was thirty per cent, and that of insane one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> per cent. In France[B] there were 131.1 insane per 100,000 inhabitants in 1883, 133 in 1884, 136 in 1888. These figures indicate that the number of insane is larger in the most civilized countries, and is increasing every year. It may indeed be said that many of these insane are not produced but are only revealed by civilization, and that the opening of the large asylums has caused a considerable number to be brought into the light who were not known of before. It is true...", "...around which were several piles of pine boards which the Indians had not destroyed. Franklin set his troops at work to make huts of these boards, and thus in a short time his whole army was comfortably sheltered. All this was done on the day and evening of their arrival, and on the following morning the whole force was employed in commencing operations upon the fort. The fort was to be built of palisades, and it was marked out of such a size that the circumference was four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet. This would require four hundred and fifty-five palisades; for the palisades were to be formed of logs, of a foot in diameter upon an average, and eighteen feet long. The palisades were to be obtained from the trees in the neighborhood, and these trees were so tall that each tree would make three palisades. The men had seventy axes in all, and the most skillful and able woodmen in the company were immediately set at work to fell the trees. Franklin says that he was...", "...in his face the necessities of others--the necessity is his; he must have it--he will have it--talk of necessity! Wait a bit: is there no way of managing some better end to all this? no mode of giving the right turn to that wheel of fortune, round which his cares and calculations have been hovering so long? Is there no conceivable method of possessing that vast hoard? Bless me! how huge it must be! and Simon turned whiter at the thought: only add up Mother Quarles's income for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years: she is seventy-five at least, and came here a girl of twenty. Simon's hair stood on end, and his heart went like a mill-clapper, as he mentally figured out the sum. Is there no possibility of contriving matters so that I may be the architect of my own good luck, and no thanks at all to the old witch there? Dear--what a glorious fancy--let me think a little. Cannot I get at the huge hoard some how? CHAPTER XXIV. THE DEVIL'S COUNSEL. \"STEAL it,\" said...", "...this employment, he devoted his leisure principally to perambulating the bookstalls, where he read books by snatches which he could not buy, and thus picked up a good deal of odd knowledge. Then he shifted to another office, at the advanced wages of twenty shillings a week, still reading and studying. At twenty-eight he was able to write a book, which he published under the title of 'The Enterprising Adventures of Pizarro;' and from that time until his death, during a period of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> years, Britton was occupied in laborious literary occupation. The number of his published works is not fewer than eighty-seven; the most important being 'The Cathedral Antiquities of England,' in fourteen volumes, a truly magnificent work; itself the best monument of John Britton's indefatigable industry. London, the landscape gardener, was a man of somewhat similar character, possessed of an extraordinary working power. The son of a farmer near Edinburgh, he was early...", "...levelled. The school-room at Brecknocks was also rendered unsafe. There were 172 sugar-mills upon the island, most of which upon that eventful morning had been \"put in the wind,\" and were merrily going with the breeze, crushing between their powerful machinery the golden canes, and sending a rich stream of luscious juice through the several pipes into the boiling-houses; of these thirty-five were entirely levelled with the ground, eighty-two split from top to bottom, and the remaining <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> almost all of them injured, requiring numerous repairs. Among those most seriously injured may be mentioned-- \"Bellevue, Messrs. Shand's--down. Renfew's--down. Belmont's--down. Bath Lodge, property of Walters--down. Green Castle's, Sir Henry Martin's works and mansion--down. Lower Freeman's--down. Sir Geo. Thomas's works, and part of the mansion--down; the manager was obliged to take up his quarters under a shed. Little Duers--down. Big...", "...was present and that rare Irish musician, Denis O'Sullivan. It was another choice afternoon, with a mystical quality which came of the music made by O'Sullivan on some Hindu reeds-pipes of Pan. But we shall have more of O'Sullivan presently--all too little, for his days were few and fleeting. Howells could not get away just yet. Colonel Harvey, who, like James Osgood, would not fail to find excuse for entertainment, chartered two drawing-room cars, and with Mrs. Harvey took a party of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> or sixty congenial men and women to Lakewood for a good-by luncheon to Howells. It was a day borrowed from June, warm and beautiful. The trip down was a sort of reception. Most of the guests were acquainted, but many of them did not often meet. There was constant visiting back and forth the full length of the two coaches. Denis O'Sullivan was among the guests. He looked in the bloom of health, and he had his pipes and played his mystic airs; then he brought out the...", "...Tessier practised the new doctrine in his wards in the Hospital St Marguerite, and in the Children's Hospital up to the year 1862, when he retired. The first homoeopathic society was established in 1832 (the Societe Gallicain), Hahnemann becoming president in 1835; in 1845 the Societe de Medecine Homeopathique was organized; and in 1860 the two were united for the better interests of the school. In 1901 there were at Paris three hospitals--the Hospital St Jacques with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> beds, the Hahnemann Hospital with thirty-five beds, and the new Protestant Hospital for Children with twenty-five-beds. At Lyons there is the Hospital St Luc. The medical journals include _L'Art medical, La Revue homeopathique belge, Journal belge d'homeopathie, La Therapeutique Integrale, La Revue homeopathique francaise_. In the year 1900 the medical officers of the republic having supervision over the medical department of the International Exhibition...", "...human experiences that the new performance takes on \"record\" proportions. It is at least doubtful whether any member of the animal kingdom ever passed through a mile of space at such a speed as that attained by Mr. Oldfield. The fastest quadruped on the globe is almost unquestionably the thoroughbred horse. But the fastest mile ever compassed by a horse--Salvator's straightway dash in 1:351/2--is a snail's pace in comparison with Mr. Oldfield's speed. Salvator covered a little over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty-five</span> feet per second; the racing motor covered a trifle over 193 feet--thus gaining 138 feet in each second. The trotting horse at its best--a mile in 1:581/2--is of course much slower still; Lou Dillon's record mile being made at the rate of 441/2 feet per second. Dan Patch, the swiftest pacer, in his mile in 1:56 made just one foot per second more than the trotter. Both pacer and trotter, it should be added, made their records with the aid of a wind-shield, without which..."]
