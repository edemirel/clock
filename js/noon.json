There--there ain't--there ain't nothing I c'n say! But--but----\" Incontinently Jeff Titus bolted around the side of the house and out of sight into the woods. When he returned, an hour later, he was carrying a half-armful of kindling. Circumstantially and at some length he explained to Stair that he had spent the entire hour in looking for it. Stair accepted the explanation in grave credulity and forebore to glance towards the high-piled heap of kindling in the woodshed. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Eve awoke. She was very weak, very tired, very thin and big-eyed. But she was _alive_. And in Jeff's heart there was something that made him yearn to howl aloud in rapture and roll on the grass, and to join the church all over again, and to thrash some mythical man for speaking mythical ill of Ephraim Stair; and to turn over his farm and his savings to foreign missions, and to get very drunk indeed, and to buy Eve a gold watch.

The brother-in-law consented readily, and the two {158} set off. Travelling in the Star-country was very pleasant. The foliage was richer than that of the earth, the flowers more delicately coloured, the air softer and more fragrant, and the birds and beasts more graceful and harmless. As the day wore on to <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Cloud-carrier became very hungry. \"When can we get something to eat?\" he asked his brother-in-law. \"Very soon,\" was the reassuring reply. \"We are just going to make a repast.\" As he spoke they came to a large opening, through which they could see the lodges and lakes and forests of the earth.

Both seemed perfectly natural in appearance and to be of ordinary flesh and blood. There was no mistaking her certain identity. This occurred in the full sunshine of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and under a heavy Palladian Porch in the presence of a crowd. The bridegroom turned deathly pale in a moment, trembled violently, and then, staggering, fell forward down the steps. This occasioned a vast stir and sensation amongst the crowd. It seemed incomprehensible. The bridegroom, said the church officials in answer to inquiries, was in a fit. He was carried down the steps and taken in the bridal carriage to his father-in-law's house. But it was reported that he never spoke...", "...at eight o'clock, as we were steering S.S.E. we saw a light ahead. Not knowing but it might be on some low detached isle, dangerous to approach while dark, we hauled the wind, and spent the night standing off and on, or rather driving to and fro; for we had but very little wind. At sun-rise on the 2d, we saw no more land than the coast we were upon; but found that the currents had carried us some miles to the north, and we attempted, to little purpose, to regain what we had lost.

With this view, having hoisted out two boats, one of them was sent ahead to tow the ship; in the other Mr Gilbert went...", "...got a supply of muscles. I rather think their going so frequently into the water engenders a catarrh, or renders them more liable to it than they otherwise would be. In the afternoon the wind shifted to the S.W.

In the morning, when we moved away, the most of them started with fire-sticks to keep themselves warm; but they dropped off one by one, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we found ourselves totally deserted. DREARINESS OF THE LANDSCAPE. It is impossible for me to describe the kind of country we were now traversing, or the dreariness of the view it presented. The plains were still open to the horizon, but here and there a stunted gum-tree, or a gloomy cypress, seemed placed by nature as mourners over the surrounding desolation.

He found the place where a horse had clawed its way out of the stream to the clay bank. From here it had wandered into the sage and turned toward the home ranch. The tracks showed that Powder River was moving slowly, grazing as it went. \"I reckon by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we can say 'Hello!' to yore bronc,\" Dud prophesied. \"No need to trail it. All we got to do is follow the river.\" An hour later he drew up and swung from the saddle. \"Now I wonder who we've had with us this glad mawnin'.\" Dud stooped and examined carefully tracks in the mud.

The prosaic pursuit of a stray mount had of a...", "...Brown on the 23d fell back to the Chippewa. In case Riall did not follow, he expected to unlimber and fight wherever the enemy might be found; the night of the 24th, the army encamped on the battle-ground of the 5th, unconscious of the laurels to be won in a few short hours at far-famed Lundy's Lane. The morning of the 25th dawned clear and beautiful. Unconscious of the proximity of the enemy, the Americans were enjoying a much-needed rest behind the village of Chippewa, when about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> news came that the British were in force at Queenston and on the heights, and that Yea's fleet had appeared in the river. Next came information that the British were landing at Lewiston and were threatening the supplies at Fort Schlosser. These reports were partly true. Pearson had advanced, unknown to the Americans, and taken position at Lundy's Lane a short distance from the Falls. Brown seemed impressed with the idea that the British were after the supplies at Schlosser and he...", "...that might have happened in Kedsty's room would keep his arms from reaching, to her. Such was his faith, potent as the mighty flood hidden in the gray-ghost gloom of approaching dawn. Yet he did not expect to win easily.

He figured that the men at Barracks would not enter Kedsty's bungalow until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at the earliest. The Police gasoline launch would probably set out on a river search soon after. By mid-afternoon the scow would have a fifty-mile start.

On this particular morning the fancy took them to wander off again into the wood. This was Master Ruebezahl's opportunity.

The red rocks had become white marble and alabaster; the stream that murmured and struggled before in its rocky bed, flowed in silence now in its smooth channel, from which a clear fountain leapt, to fall again in showers of diamond drops, now on this side now on that, as the wandering breeze scattered it. Daisies and forget-me-nots fringed its brink, while tall hedges...", "...Between the decks of many of the French and Russian ships the carnage was frightful. Among wrecked guns and mountings lay headless and armless bodies; human limbs shattered by shells were strewn in all directions upon decks slippery with blood. The shrieks of the dying were drowned by the roar and crash of the guns, the deafening explosion of shells, and the rending of iron and steel as the projectiles pierced armourplates, destroying everything with which they came in contact. The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> had passed, and as the day wore on other catastrophes occurred involving further loss of life. One of these was the accidental ramming of the _Sfax_ by the French battleship _Redoubtable_, which managed, however, to save the greater portion of the crew, although her engines broke down.

But their precaution failed to serve their purpose entirely. A little before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> two filthy, bearded knights of the road clambered laboriously over the fence and headed directly for the very tree under which Billy and Bridge lay sleeping. In the minds of the two was the same thought that had induced Billy Byrne and the poetic Bridge to seek this same secluded spot. There was in the stiff shuffle of the men something rather familiar.

The 20th was the eighth fair day we had had successively; a circumstance, I believe, very uncommon in this place, especially at this season of the year. This fair weather gave us an opportunity to complete our wood and water, to overhaul the rigging, caulk the ship, and put her in a condition for sea. Fair weather was, however, now at an end; for it began to rain this evening, and continued without intermission till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day, when we cast off the shore fasts, hove the ship out of the creek to her anchor, and steadied her with an hawser to the shore.

It is commonly called the Solar Myth. Quite plainly, of course, the case was just the other way. The god was never a symbol or hieroglyph representing the sun. The sun was a hieroglyph representing the god.

Then he saw the sun in some glorious crisis of the dominance of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the distress of nightfall, and he said, \"That is how the face of the god would shine when he had slain the dragon,\" or \"That is how the whole world would bleed to westward, if the god were slain at last.\" No human being was ever really so unnatural as to worship Nature. No man, however indulgent (as I am) to corpulency, ever worshipped a man as round as the sun or a woman as round as the moon.

Apparently Santa Anna was drawing all his forces to the city. Dense fields of corn six feet high or more almost hid the works at the convent.

She had approached the twins about it at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that day. \"Did you get my application?\" she had whispered nervously. But the twins had stared her out of countenance, and Connie realized that she had committed a serious breach of secret society etiquette. But here was the letter!

We four were most together; but the whole company was very simple and innocent. A good-dinner, and, what was best, good...", "...Taimur Island. During the forenoon we had splendid clear weather, and often we could see from the vessel no trace of ice. We saw a large number of walruses, and to judge by the fire which this sight kindled in the eyes of our hunters, it will not be long till the Norwegian hunting voyages are extended to the sea north and east of the north point of Asia. We saw besides a large number of looms and black guillemots, the former accompanied by young of the year, as large as rotges. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we sighted \"land ahead to larboard.\" It was evidently Preobraschenie Island. I determined to land on it for a few hours to carry on researches in natural history, and to fix the position of the place by astronomical observations, if the weather should permit. The distance of this high-lying island was however greater than we expected. So that it was not until six o'clock in the evening that we could anchor off its south-west side, near the almost perpendicular face of cliffs...", "...The skins are divided into parchment, or those of the old animals; and cub, or those of the young ones.

Kalm says that he ate beaver flesh, and thought it any thing but delicious, as he had been told it was. He says that it must be boiled in several waters from morning till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to make it lose the bad taste it has. Charlevoix says the same. The flesh is reckoned best when the beaver has lived only on vegetables; when he has eaten fish it does not taste well. It was a popular food among the French Roman Catholics, as the only meat they could indulge in on fast days, his holiness, in his system (Kalm says), having ranked the beaver among the fish. This arrangement is attributed by Charlevoix to two numerous and learned bodies in France. \"Le Castor a ete...", "...blusht the Day? 115 Why ran the started aire trembling away?

The hadjis therefore began their journey, escorted by Kulkhan-le-Pir, who, thanks to the introduction of Kulkhan, neglected nothing for the security of his guests.

They are very shy, and plunge into the water as soon as any one approaches. Towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the scattered sportsmen usually re-assembled, with their booty, round a cheerful fire, under ancient plane trees, on the bank of Fox River. Our frugal repast, which we had brought with us, was seasoned by the exercise in the open air, in the fine forests of Indiana and Illinois. Tortoises, shell-fish, birds, &c., were deposited in our boat. Mr. Lesueur frequently accompanied us in these excursions.

Men thrust their hands into their pockets, or drew on gloves while they stamped their feet upon deck to keep themselves warm in the open air. Soon to our right lay a great semi-circular field of ice, in places piled high, looking cold, jagged and dangerous. In the distance those having field-glasses saw two clumsy, slow-moving objects which they could easily...", "...a good deal about the military works there which was of the greatest interest. The hotel-keeper, a stout Alsatian, was a talkative person, and told Walter nearly all he wished to know. Since leaving Charing Cross five days before he had been ever active. On his arrival in Paris he had gone to the apartment of Colonel Maynard, the British military attache, and spent the evening with him. Then, at one o'clock next morning, he had hurriedly taken his bag and left for Dijon, where at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he had been met in the Cafe de la Rotonde by a little wizen-faced old Frenchwoman in seedy black, who had travelled for two days and nights in order to meet him. Together they had walked out on that unfrequented road beyond the Place Darcy, chatting confidentially as they went, the old lady speaking emphatically and with many gesticulations as they walked. Truth to tell, this insignificant-looking person was a woman of many secrets. She was a \"friend\" of the Surete Generale in...", "...morning, greeting Salesman Hatfield with the remark: \"Well, I will take those goods.\" The bill was presented, and Simonds, stepping to the cashier's desk, pulled out a big roll of bills of large denominations, tens and twenties predominating. \"Now I will give you the address,\" he added, as he pocketed the change. \"You can send those things to J. B. Simonds, 117 South Clark street, rooms 12 and 15, and send a man to put the carpet down.\" IN THE CLARK STREET FLAT. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the same day the carpet-layer accompanied the furniture to the address that had been given. This building was directly opposite the ten-story Chicago Opera-House structure, in which the offices of both Dr. Cronin and Alexander Sullivan were located. There were two rooms bearing 12 as their number in the building. One room, the door of which was covered with Turkish characters, was on the second floor. This was not the room occupied by Simonds, and another flight of stairs...", "...he found conditions as usual. For reasons best known to himself Umballa had not disturbed anything. In fact, he had always had the coming of the younger sister in mind and left the bungalow and camp untouched, so as not to alarm her. She had not yet arrived. So Ahmed flung himself down upon his cotton rug, telling the keepers not to disturb him; he would be able to wake himself when the time came. But Ahmed had overrated his powers; he was getting along in years; and it was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the next day when a hand shook him by the shoulder and he awoke to witness the arrival of Winnie and her woman companion. For the first time in many years Ahmed cursed his prophet. He that had had time to warn the child, had slept like the sloth of Ceylon! He went directly to the point. He told her briefly what had happened. He had not the least doubt that Umballa was already aware of her arrival. She must remain hidden in the go-down of the bungalow; her maid also....", "...remarked, \"You always knew she was there.\" Miss Lottie Meyers, who worked in the office of Mr. Orcutt, the superintendent across the hall, experienced a brief infatuation that turned to hate. She chewed gum incessantly, Janet found her cheap perfume insupportable; Miss Meyers, for her part, declared that Janet was \"queer\" and \"stuck up,\" thought herself better than the rest of them. Lottie Meyers was the leader of a group of four or five which gathered in the hallway at the end of the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour to enter animatedly into a discussion of waists, hats, and lingerie, to ogle and exchange persiflages with the young men of the paymaster's corps, to giggle, to relate, sotto voce, certain stories that ended invariably in hysterical laughter. Janet detested these conversations. And the sex question, subtly suggested if not openly dealt with, to her was a mystery over which she did not dare to ponder, terrible, yet too sacred to be degraded.

But home he must, and as the award had been, Yield up his body captive to the queen.

When full before him, at the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of night, (The moon was up, and shot a gleamy light) He saw a quire of ladies in a round That featly footing seem'd to skim the ground: Thus dancing hand in hand, so light they were, He knew not where they trod, on earth or air.

It is getting late.\" Jane brushed her hand across her eyes, and stitched away again. Then, she threw the gloves to Hugh without looking at him, and ran to get ready to go to the coach. The bustle of the inn-yard would not do for little Harry. He could not go. Hugh was extremely surprised to find that all the rest were going;--that even his father was smoothing his hat in the passage for the walk,--really leaving the shop at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on his account! The porter was at his service too,--waiting for his box! It was very odd to feel of such consequence. Hugh ran down to bid the maids good-bye. The cook had cut a sandwich, which she thrust into his pocket, though he told her he had some biscuits. Susan cried so that little Harry stood grave and wondering. Susan sobbed out that she knew he did not care a bit about leaving home and everybody. Hugh wished she would not say so, though he felt it was true, and...", "...worried, and I want to see you.\" \"Very well, sir. I'll be round at eleven. Will that suit you?\" \"Yes, eleven will do well. _Au revoir_ till then,\" and Sir Richard rang off with a promptitude which forbade further discussion for the moment. As he went back to his cooling coffee Anstice wondered vaguely what Sir Richard could have to say; but since speculation was mere idle waste of time he dismissed the matter from his mind and finished his breakfast in haste. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when he drove his car up to the great hall door of Greengates; but the words of apology for his tardy arrival died on his lips when he caught sight of Sir Richard's face. \"I say, I'm afraid you're ill, after all!\" Anstice was genuinely concerned; and Sir Richard's strained features relaxed into a smile. \"No, I'm perfectly well. Only, as I told you, I have been upset this morning; and--well, I'll explain and you will see there _is_ something to worry about.\" Without more ado...", "...noon, and from noon to night, and couldn't eat her then, she was so tough! \"May the dogs take the old grizzle-gizzard! I'm not going to break my teeth on this old buzzard any more,\" shouted the corporal, as he flung the whole cartilaginous mass into a pile of brush near by. \"It _was_ a fowl trick, after all, Harry, wasn't it?\" Thus it chanced that, when we marched out of Warrenton early one sultry summer morning, we started with empty stomachs and haversacks, and marched on till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> with nothing to eat. Halting then in a wood, we threw ourselves under the trees, utterly exhausted. About three o'clock, as we lay there, a whole staff of officers came riding down the line--the quartermaster-general of the Army of the Potomac and staff, they said it was. Just the very man we wanted to see! Then broke forth such a yell from hundreds of famished men as the quartermaster-general had probably never heard before nor ever wished to hear again: \"Hard-tack!\"...", "...dining room table has always been a mystery. She did it, however, and successfully. Mr. Alex Bufford, an ex-slave, lives at 1823 Seneca street, St. Joseph, Missouri. Mr Bufford, (everyone calls him Uncle Alex) does not know how old he is, but says he does remember that he was a grown man at the time of the Civil War. I heard about Uncle Alex from one of the ladies in the reference room at the Public Library in St. Joseph, Mo. She told me I would have to see Uncle Alex right at the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour or in the evening, as he would be at work during working hours. I didn't ask her what kind of work he did but I heeded her advice about seeing him at the noon hour. I arrived at his place about 11:50 A.M. As I got out of my car I happened to look up the alley. An old Negro driving a one-horse wagon was just entering it. I guessed in a minute that this was the old gentleman I wanted to see. When he approached I did not tell him at first what I wanted but started talking about...", "...to the left. A few minutes later the smaller trail joined the one Slim had followed through the mountains, the path the rustlers used in running the cattle out of the Creeping Shadows over to the railroad. Chuck had stumbled on the hiding place where they held the stolen livestock until time to ship them out from the railroad. Still following the trail of the cattle, Chuck swung toward the railroad. He rode steadily, ever watchful lest he run into another trap of the rustlers. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he was well down the east side of the Cajons and he saw the local freight pulling down the main line and stop, but he was still some miles away, too great a distance to see what happened after the freight stopped. Chuck spurred his cayuse into a full gallop, rocketing down out of the Cajon foothills. The trail straightened out and a lone rider, coming at a furious pace, came into sight. Chuck swung his cayuse off the trail, slid from the saddle, and found shelter behind a...", "...8 minutes West; at noon, Bonavista, South-East point, North 3 degrees East, 168 leagues.

She rested her head on her left; hand the right lay on her knee. It was stripped of any ring--unadorned white. Her cheeks were pale--the olive reigned unchallenged; her lips were set tight, her eyes downcast. She made no movement when Lord Lynborough entered. He bowed low, but said nothing. He stood opposite to her some two yards away. The clock ticked. It wanted still a minute before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> struck. That was the minute of which Lynborough had raved and dreamed the night before. He had the fruit of it in full measure. The first stroke of twelve rang silvery from the clock. Lynborough advanced and fell upon his knee. She did not lift her eyes, but slowly raised her hand from her knee. He placed his hand under it, pressing it a little upward and bowing his head to meet it half-way in its ascent. She felt his lips lightly brush the skin.

Breakfast over, my brother started off with his rifle to explore the peaks at the end of the valley, whilst we others stretched ourselves on our furs under the shade of some tall bushes, and with the help of books and pipes, a little desultory conversation, and the lazy contemplation of the fair scenery before us, we managed to pass away the hot hours of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> pleasantly enough. When it got cooler, and we had drank our fill of idleness, we found plenty to occupy ourselves with. There were guns to be cleaned. I had my journal to write up; and, although I am no good hand with the needle, the rough usage my apparel had lately received made some attempts at sewing and patching imperative. The guides busied themselves in repairing saddle-gear, making reins or lassos from guanaco hide, and similar work.

You say there will be a special meeting at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> tomorrow---- \"I said there could be one,\" Plowden corrected him. \"All right. There CAN be one. And do you say that there can be proof,--proof against me of fraud,--produced at that meeting?\" \"Yes--I say that,\" the nobleman affirmed, quietly. \"And further still--do you say that it rests with you whether that proof shall be produced or not?\" Lord Plowden looked into the impassive, deep-eyed gaze which covered him, and looked away from it again. \"I haven't put it in just...", "...tremendous quantity that was already on the ground. If it would only begin to slacken how thankful they would be. On several occasions some one would exclaim that it looked as though the snow might be coming down in lessened quantities, but no sooner did they begin to pay close attention than the storm seemed to start in again as furiously as ever.

Then came the great fire. Gray Wolf caught the scent of it when it was still two days to the west. The sun that night went down in a lurid cloud. The moon, drifting into the west, became blood red. When it dropped behind the wilderness in this manner, the Indians called it the Bleeding Moon, and the air was filled with omens. All the next day Gray Wolf was nervous, and toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Kazan caught in the air the warning that she had sensed many hours ahead of him. Steadily the scent grew stronger, and by the middle of the afternoon the sun was veiled by a film of smoke.

With a familiarity of old knowledge, Falkner descended the winding streets to the water front.

Our latitude was now 58 deg. 29', and our longitude 191 deg. 37'. At six, the next morning, the weather clearing up a little, we weighed, and, with a small breeze at east, steered north, our soundings being from twenty-eight to twenty-five fathoms. After running nine leagues upon this course, the wind returned back to the north, which obliged us to steer more westerly. The weather continued for the most part foggy till toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the 28th, when we had a few hours clear sunshine; during which we made several lunar observations. The mean result of them, reduced to noon, when the latitude was 59 deg. 55', gave 190 deg. 6' longitude; and the time-keeper gave 189 deg. 59'. The variation of the compass was 18 deg. 40' E.

Five men were then detailed to hold the herd as compact as possible, and the remainder, twenty-seven all told, cut off about three hundred head and started for the river. I took the lead, for though cattle are less gregarious by nature than other animals, under pressure of excitement they will follow a leader.

When the cattle were once inside the wing we went rapidly, four vaqueros riding outside the fence to keep the cattle from turning the chute on reaching swimming water.

It might be foolish, but it was on that account none the less delightful. They sent out scouts to watch for the approach of an imaginary enemy; they had secret pass-words and signs; they swore (Viking style) by Thor's hammer and by Odin's eye. They talked appalling nonsense to each other with a delicious sentiment of its awful blood-curdling character.

The wide highland plain, eight or ten miles long, was bounded on the north and west by throngs of snow-hooded mountain peaks, which rose, one behind another, in glittering grandeur; and in the middle of the plain there were two lakes or tarns, connected by a river which was milky white where it entered the lakes and clear as...", "...And it ruins a man's disposition.\" The mill was at the outskirts of the town. It was a busy place, perhaps the busiest in the whole of the Eighth District, and in it were employed a large number of men.

The manager was in, Kenneth and Beth learned, but could not see them until he had signed the letters he had dictated for the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> mail. So they sat on a bench until a summons came to admit them to Mr. Marshall's private office.

But MacFarlane gave no heed, nor did he even notice that though there were no clouds in the sky, the low-hung sun showed dull and coppery through a steel-blue fog. He bolted his food and pressed on. Before him was no guiding landmark. He laid his course by the compass and held straight North across the treeless rock-ribbed plain.

The fowls, ducks, and goats all looked fat and thriving on the refuse food of a dense population, and the Chinamen's pigs were in a state of obesity that foreboded early death. Parrots and Tories and cockatoos, of a dozen different binds, were suspended on bamboo perches at the doors of the houses, with metallic green or white fruit-pigeons which cooed musically at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and eventide. Young cassowaries, strangely striped with black and brown, wandered about the houses or gambolled with the playfulness of kittens in the hot sunshine, with sometimes a pretty little kangaroo, caught in the Aru forests, but already tame and graceful as a petted fawn.

Nettled at this, he declared that another sun should not go down over his head, without obtaining some satisfactory account of this mysterious visitant. The third day came, and with it a partial change in the conduct of the stranger. He appeared to have in some measure shaken off his indolence, and sallied forth betimes in the morning, apparently to examine the beauties of the coast, towards the rocky wilds of which he was seen to wend his way. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he again returned to the Mermaid. This conduct partially disarmed the suspicion which had been excited; however it was agreed that though nothing had hitherto occurred which could authorize any direct interference with his movements, yet that a watch should be kept over them for the present. The afternoon threatened to turn out stormy. Vast masses of clouds were continually driven across the sky: and the increasing agitation and deep furrows of the ocean foretold a night fraught...", "...Heracleitos had raised a chill no later than yesterday,--the chill of the unknown. They had not attended the lectures on the \"Greek bucks.\" Indeed, profiting by their privilege of voluntary recitations, they had dropped in but seldom on Philosophy 4. These blithe grasshoppers had danced and sung away the precious storing season, and now that the bleak hour of examinations was upon them, their waked-up hearts had felt aghast at the sudden vision of their ignorance. It was on a Monday <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that this feeling came fully upon them, as they read over the names of the philosophers. Thursday was the day of the examination. \"Who's Anaxagoras?\" Billy had inquired of Bertie. \"I'll tell you,\" said Bertie, \"if you'll tell me who Epicharmos of Kos was.\" And upon this they embraced with helpless laughter. Then they reckoned up the hours left for them to learn Epicharmos of Kos in,--between Monday noon and Thursday morning at nine,--and their quailing chill increased.

Even though he should be present in the kitchen he would not be likely to take notice of any extra preparations. In the meantime Harry had made a bell out of a flat sheet of steel. It was really a gong. When the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour arrived and the table had been set ready for the symbolic cake pyramid of little cakes, George ordered the gong to sound, and Harry made such a frightful din with the unexpected noise, that Baby was terribly frightened, and scampered to the loft, his usual place of retreat when reproved or unduly excited. The Professor was out of the laboratory like a shot, and hurried over to the house. At the same time George returned. \"Who has taken my cakes?\" he cried. \"There are less...", "...home, where late at it, W.

But, about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on July 10, we observed at least 300 birds in compact flocks of about 50 individuals each between Washington Beach and a point about 9 miles south of that locality. Approximately one in ten birds seen was in breeding plumage, the rest being in winter or subadult plumages, which are indistinguishable in the field. Perhaps some of the birds seen were nonbreeding, summering individuals, but we presume that the large groups were southbound migrants, and we note that autumnal migrants...", "...Empress on her journey to Belgium to meet Napoleon at the Palace of Lacken, near Brussels. Notwithstanding those discussions respecting the form of hats, the colour and shape of dresses, etc., Josephine received me in her usual gracious manner.

I shortened my visit, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> next day repaired to that delightful abode, which always created in my mind deep emotion. Not an alley, not a grove but teemed with interesting recollections; all recalled to me the period when I was the confidant of Bonaparte. But the time was past when he minutely calculated how much a residence at Malmaison would cost, and concluded by saying that an income of 30,000 livres would be necessary. When I arrived Madame Bonaparte was in the garden with Madame de Remusat, who was...", "...girls there are who think they know a better path than the one Jesus calls them to follow. There are \"stranger\" voices calling on every side, and many a child leaves the path of the Good Shepherd, and turns aside to hear what they would say.

I was once travelling from Duma to Akura, high up on the range of Lebanon. It was a hot summer's day, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I stopped to rest by a fountain. The waste water of the fountain ran into a square stone birkeh or pool, and around the pool were several shepherds resting with their flocks of sheep and goats. The shepherds came and talked with me, and sat smoking for nearly an hour, when suddenly one of them arose and walked away calling to his flock to follow him.

His interview with Mart, which he endured mostly for the sake of the Happy Family, developed into a quarrel which severed beyond mending his connection with the Acme.

There were two 'phone calls in his mail, he discovered, and one bore an urgent request that he call Hollywood something-or-other the moment he returned.

The first time I saw him was in the high <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of a scorching day, at an inn in Laytonstone. He came in while a sudden storm descended, and a rainbow of exquisite majesty vaulted the earth. Sitting down at a table, he beckoned the hostess for his beer, and conversed freely with his acquaintance. By his arch replies I found that I was in company with an original--a man that might stretch forth his arms in the wilderness without fear, and like Paul, grasp an adder without harm. He playfully entwined his fingers with their...", "...patient, Peters. He proposed that I wait a day, as he knew that Peters would within that time, and might any hour, send for him; and as soon as he was summoned he would notify me, and together we would drive out to the old sailor's residence--which, the doctor said, was a small, two-roomed log structure, where the old man dwelt entirely alone.

The loud call of a cavalry trumpet aroused me. How long I had passed in this state of despondency I knew not; but it was long past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when I rallied myself. My charger was already awaiting me; and a second blast of the trumpet told that the inspection in the Plaza was about to commence. As I continued to dress, I gradually rallied from my depressing thoughts; and ere I belted my sabretasche, the current of my ideas had turned from their train of sadness to one of hardihood and daring.

His eyes, distorted horribly by the extra powerful lenses of his spectacles, fixed me with a steady look. He came close as though to assure himself that there was no mistake.

They had no sign from the band behind them, but they knew it was always there, and that it would probably unite at the lake with the force the rangers were facing. It was about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of a gleaming summer day when Robert, from the crest of a ridge, saw once more the vast sheet of water extending a hundred and twenty-five miles north and south, that the Indians called Oneadatote and the white men Champlain, and around which and upon which an adventurous part of his own life had passed. His heart beat high, he felt now that the stage was set again for great events, and that his comrades and he would, as before, have a part in the war that was shaking the Old World...", "...taking up quarters in the chateau: a request which had been scrupulously observed. Such were the amazing but undisputed facts over which Rechamp and I, in our different ways, were now pondering. He hardly spoke, and when he did it was only to make some casual reference to the road or to our wounded soldiers; but all the while I sat at his side I kept hearing the echo of the question he was inwardly asking himself, and hoping to God he wouldn't put it to me.... It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when we finally reached the lines, and the men had to have a rest before we could start again; but a couple of hours later we landed them safely at the base hospital. From there we had intended to go back to Paris; but as we were starting there came an unexpected summons to another point of the front, where there had been a successful night-attack, and a lot of Germans taken in a blown-up trench. The place was fifty miles away, and off my beat, but the number of wounded on both...", "...which their fires had been built, as well as with flakes of arrow-head stone, and we found one perfect arrow-head. In one place we noticed where an Indian had sat to manufacture arrow-heads out of quartz, and the sand was sprinkled with a quart of small glass-like chips about as big as a fourpence, which he had broken off in his work. Here, then, the Indians must have fished before the whites arrived. There was another similar sandy tract about half a mile above this. Still the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> prevailed, and we turned the prow aside to bathe, and recline ourselves under some buttonwoods, by a ledge of rocks, in a retired pasture sloping to the water's edge, and skirted with pines and hazels, in the town of Hudson.

I hugged it, I found it sweet in my belly. I conceived the ship's last plunge, the sea bursting upon all sides into the cabin, the brief mortal conflict there, all by myself, in that closed place; I numbered the horrors, I had almost said with satisfaction; I felt I could bear all and more, if the _Nonesuch_ carried down with her, overtook by the same ruin, the enemy of my poor master's house. Towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the second day the screaming of the wind abated; the ship lay not so perilously over, and it began to be clear to me that we were past the height of the tempest. As I hope for mercy, I was singly disappointed. In the selfishness of that vile, absorbing passion of hatred, I forgot the case of our innocent shipmates, and thought but of myself and my enemy. For myself, I was already old; I had never been young, I was not formed for the world's pleasures, I had few affections; it...", "...in a peaked bonnet and a laced stomacher went about proclaiming \"_Old Satin, old Taffety, or Velvet_.\" And a singular looking party of the Hebrew persuasion, with a cocked hat on his head, and a bundle of rapiers and sword-sticks under his arm, which he was ready to barter for:-- [Illustration: OLD CLOAKS, SUITS, OR COATS.] [Illustration: HATS OR CAPS--BUY, SELL, OR EXCHANGE.] While another of the tribe proclaimed aloud from east to west--and back again, \"From morn to noon, from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to dewy eve,\" his willingness to \"_Buy, sell, or exchange Hats or Caps_.\" Why should the Hebrew race appear to possess a monopoly in the purchase and sale of dilapidated costumes?

A rest of an hour and a half, and he was again in the saddle, keeping up the same steady gait until noon, when another halt was made for a couple of hours. On through the afternoon he urged his horse once more, halting only after nightfall. Two hours before daybreak he was in the saddle, and now his horse was pushed more rapidly forward, as though a long rest lay not very far ahead. It was two hours before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the worn-out horse pricked up his ears as he saw a flag fluttering in the skies a mile ahead.

Clinton and Lord Cornwallis, led the turning movement, which came upon the rear of the enemy at the moment when they were engaged with the two other columns. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Americans had been driven back into the Brooklyn lines in considerable confusion, and with the loss of about half their number. This constituted the battle. The completeness of the English victory was due to the neglect of the Americans in guarding the left of their outposts. Howe has been criticized for not immediately assaulting the American works which he might have carried on the evening of the battle. In view of the fact that he had only defeated a small portion of the...", "...[Photograph: The Mess Tent] [Photograph: Where the Equator Crosses the Molo] Among our porters there were many types of features, and in a curious way many of them resembled people we had known at home. One porter had the eyes and expression of a young north-side girl; another had the walk and features of a prominent young Chicago man; and so on. Saa Sitaa was one of our brightest porters. His name means \"Six O'clock\" in Swahili, six o'clock in the native reckoning being our <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and our midnight. Just why he was given this significant name I never discovered. Perhaps he was born at that hour. It always used to amuse me to hear Abdi calling out, \"_Enjani hapa, Saa Sitaa_\"--\"Come here, Six O'clock.\" Baa Baa was a porter who always used to sing a queer native chant in which those words were predominant.

The Beagle was consequently anchored under Bezout Island, one of the eastern isles of Dampier's Archipelago, and boats were sent to examine the coast on the southward of Cape Lambert. It may, perhaps, be worthy of remark, that should a vessel be brought by any chance to this dreary part of the world in May, June, or July, anchorages exposed to easterly winds should be left at or before daylight--that being the time they set in; by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> all is again quiet.

The higher up we went, the thicker was the fog; we seemed to be moving in a slimy mass, breathing the air from a boiler. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we reached the lonely hut, where a dozen men and women squatted, shivering with cold and wet, crowded together under wretched palm-leaf mats, near a smouldering fire. There were some children wedged into the gaps between the grown-ups.

At four in the afternoon, our latitude was judged to be 0 deg. 29' south; and the course then steered was west, by compass, for a current of ten miles to the north had fully counteracted the western variation on the two preceding days. On the 9th [WEDNESDAY], the latitude was 0 deg. 43' south, and longitude 18 deg. 35'.

Toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the sun strikes some garret windows opposite that send across to me a few pale reflections, without warmth or cheerfulness, like the rays of a lamp; and even this vague, languishing light vanishes in a quarter of an hour.

Shortly after the noon edition rolled from the press, the buzzer in Mr. Schirr's office sounded. Mr. Parker's private secretary did not answer. The buzzer kept on for nearly five minutes. Then the door was flung open. \"What the blazes is the matter with everyone?\" Schirr shouted. His gaze fastened upon Penny at the copy desk. \"Meet our new editor, Mr. Schirr,\" said Salt, who had that moment come out of the camera room. Schirr ignored Penny. Snatching up one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> editions, still fresh with wet ink, he glanced at the front page. His eyes flashed. \"Eckert,\" he said to the head copy man, \"come into my office. I want to talk to you.\" \"Oh, sure,\" said Eckert, but he did not follow Schirr into the adjoining room. Soon the ex-editor came storming out to learn what was wrong. This time his expression was baffled. \"Mr. Eckert,\" he said with exaggerated politeness. \"Will you please step into my office?\" \"Sorry,\" replied the copy reader....", "...to draw the sword on that account?

Mr. Van der Merwe, who said he spoke on behalf of the young people, said all their officers should resign like General Beyers and others. He hoped that any officers present would resign before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that day. General De Wet pointed out that the appointment of any Jack, Tom, and Harry might follow such wholesale resignations, for although he lived in the \"Free\" State he held a share in the affairs of that (Transvaal) Province.

Standing in the doorway, he could clearly distinguish the words of the speaker, who was apparently protesting in the name of some workmen against a large manufacturer who had at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> dismissed three thousand of them. The orator, who was standing on a table in the rear of the room, looked like a swaying shadow through the smoke, but his loud appeal completely filled the room, and the soul-stirring pictures he drew of the misery of the workmen, who had been turned out on the streets at the word of the millionaire manufacturer, caused his hearers' cheeks to burn with excitement. \"--and therefore,\" concluded the speaker, \"we will not submit to the absolutely...", "...XXI.

He saw the April <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on his books aglow, The wistaria trailing in at the window wide; He heard his father's voice from the terrace below Calling him down to ride. He saw the gray little church across the park, The mounds that hid the loved and honoured dead; The Norman arch, the chancel softly dark, The brasses black and red.

On the north side, in a sandy bay, I saw an old canoe, about 33 feet long, lying bottom upwards, and half buried in the beach. It was made of three pieces, the bottom entire, to which the sides were sewed in the common way. It had a sharp projecting prow rudely carved, in resemblance of the head of a fish; the extreme breadth was about three feet, and I imagine it was capable of carrying 20 men.

I named this Sunday Island: it lies N by W 3/4 W from Restoration Island; the latitude, by a good...", "...feet in height. To drive through such drifts was, of course, impossible; so they had to make long detours through the surrounding fields. At such places the horses, of course, had to be driven with extra care, for no one wanted the sleigh to land in some hole or be overturned. Occasionally, when the turnout was on a dangerous slant, the girls would shriek and the boys would hold their breath; but each time Washington Bones was equal to the occasion and brought them through safely. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they had covered five miles, and then they stopped to rest at a village where all procured a good hot dinner. Then they went forward once again, this time through a long patch of timber. \"If we gits through dat, we'll be all right,\" declared the colored driver. The snow lay deep in the woods, but the horses proved equal to the occasion, and at last the timber was left behind and they came out on a ridge road where the snow was only a few inches in depth.

Sitting on camp-stools, around the mess-tables, in the open, before the break of day, we swallowed some black coffee and ate some rather thick slices of bacon and dry bread. The Wilkins' tent was near ours, and I said to them, rather peevishly: \"Isn't this dust something awful?\" Miss Wilkins looked up with her sweet smile and gentle manner and replied: \"Why, yes, Mrs. Summerhayes, it is pretty bad, but you must not worry about such a little...", "...Flies, light for darkness, and dark for lightness, with the wind in the South, then that blows the Flie in the Trouts mouth.

It was about an hour past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and the sun was shining brightly, but the boat passed along in the shade. The canal is bordered by two rows of linden trees, elms, willows, and high hedges on either side, which hide the country. It seemed as though we were sailing across a forest.

At first Norm scoffed and declared that his ticket might be used to light the fire with, for all he cared; he didn't want to go to one of their \"swell\" concerts. But this talk Nettie laughed over good-naturedly, as though it were intended for a joke, and continued her planning as to when to have supper, and just when she and Norm must start. In the course of the day, that young man discovered it to be a fine thing to own tickets for this special concert. Before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> tickets were at a premium, and several of Norm's fellow-workmen gayly advised him to make an honest penny by selling his. During the early morning it had been delicately hinted by one young fellow that Norm Decker's tickets were made of tissue paper, which was his way of saying, that he did not believe that Norm had any; but, thanks to Nettie's thoughtful tact, the tickets were at that very moment reposing in her brother's pocket, and he drew them forth in triumph, wanting to know...", "...Wattie dear. Come, let us go!\" \"And to me the same!\" cried Wattie, \"'Silver sword of Ravenspur.'

He explains that an obvious way of finding the latitude is by finding the altitude of the sun at noon at the time of an equinox. If this altitude be 38d 10', then the latitude is the complement, or 51d 50'. But this observation can only be made on two days in the year. If then this seems to be too long a tarrying, observe his midday altitude, and allow for his declination. Thus, if the sun's altitude be 58d 10' at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when he is in the first degree of Leo, subtract his declination, viz. 20d, and the result is 38d 10', the complement of the latitude. If, however, the sun's declination be _south_, the amount of it must be added instead of subtracted. Or else we may find [Aries]A', the highest altitude of a star A' above the equinoctial, and also [Aries]A, its nether elongation extending from the same, and take the mean of the two. 26.

Every day at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Sultan and his son used to go to the mosque to pray. After they had gone the Sultan's wife used to sort out the seeds of every kind of grain in the Sultan's store. Those that needed drying she gave to a slave, called Kibaraka, to put out in the sun to dry. One day, after the Sultan and his son had gone to prayer, she called to the slave, \"Kibaraka, take these seeds and put them out in the sun.\" Kibaraka took the grain and spread it out to dry, each kind by itself.

Jed Prentiss was now aboard, for, with detectives arriving and departing at all hours, there was frequently need of serving a visitor with a meal while the \"Meteor\" dashed over the waves to or from Nantucket. Jed was enjoying himself despite his long hours and hard work. He even found time to hang about Joe and learn much about the running of the motor. By Saturday <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Horace Dunstan, who seemed to have aged much, gave up the notion that his detectives could aid him at Nantucket. The last three on the island were sent over to Wood's Hole on the \"Meteor,\" with instructions to help the men at work on the case on the mainland. \"Thank goodness, we're through with 'em,\" grunted Jed, leaving the galley and coming up through the engine room hatchway. \"I hope we'll get a breathing spell to-morrow.\" \"We've had a brisk four days of it,\" nodded Tom. \"I...", "...doubt of your sincerity, and you shall quickly be convinced of mine.

This said, we parted, and I passed the next day in great impatience. On Friday I got up betimes, and put on my best clothes, with fifty pieces of gold in my pocket: thus prepared, I mounted an ass, which I had bespoken the day before, and set out, accompanied by the man that lent me the ass.

Then by coach to my brother's, where I spent the afternoon in paying some of the charges of the buriall, and in looking over his papers, among which I find several letters of my brother John's to him speaking very foale words of me and my deportment to him here, and very crafty designs about Sturtlow land and God knows what, which I am very glad to know, and shall make him repent them. Anon my father...", "...chamber-work attended to, beds made, children's things put away, sweeping done, slops disposed of, fires looked after. Some time or in some way the clothes worn by the children on Sunday must be especially looked after, stitches taken, a little darn here and there, and then put away. During this time there may be the demands of one or more babies to be met. In this there is no compromise. With the completion of other work dinner time is approaching, for, with the majority, this is a <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal. The cooking must be done, and yet nothing else must be allowed to lag. The children in their confusion are home from school. Then dinner. Every one is in a hurry to get away. The children are sure they are going to be late. There is more work for them and the men, and then they are gone. Dinner dishes are washed, and the laundry work continues. The afternoon is little different from the morning; there is a little less rush and confusion, but a continuance of regular work....", "...the sake of old friendship. I only hope that he will make other acquaintances and leave me free. I must get into the best society.\" All this time her neighbor was thinking, \"I am so glad to see her again, so glad, so glad! When my wings are dry I will fly over to her and we will go through the forest together.\" He was a kind, warm-hearted fellow, who cared more for friendship than for beauty or family. Meanwhile their wings were growing fast, and drying, and flattening, so that by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they could begin to raise them above their heads. They were very large Moths and their wings were of a soft dust color with little clear, transparent places in them and touches of the most beautiful blue, quite the shade worn by the Peacock, who lived on the farm. There was a brown and white border to their wings, and on their bodies and legs the fur was white and dark orange. When the Cecropias rest, they spread their wings out flat, and do not slide the front pair over the...", "...by Charles II., Charles Beauclerc, was not born till May 8th, 1670. He was created Earl of Burford in 1676 and Duke of St. Albans in 1684.] Thence with Sir W. Pen home, and I to the office, where late about business, and then home to supper, and so to bed. 27th. Up, and am invited betimes to be godfather tomorrow to Captain Poole's child with my Lady Pen and Lady Batten, which I accepted out of complaisance to them, and so to the office, where we sat all the morning. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> dined at home, and then my wife and I, with Sir W. Pen, to the New Exchange, set her down, and he and I to St. James's, where Sir J. Minnes, [Sir] W. Batten, and we waited upon the Duke of York, but did little business, and he, I perceive, his head full of other business, and of late hath not been very ready to be troubled with any of our business. Having done with him, Sir J. Minnes, [Sir] W. Batten and I to White Hall, and there hear how it is like to go well enough with my Lord...", "...I wish she were here. And why should she not? There are but four red-coats at Tully-Veolan, and their muskets would be very useful to us.' To these broken remarks Edward made no answer; his ear indeed received them, but his soul was intent upon the expected entrance of Flora. The door opened--it was but Cathleen, with her lady's excuse, and wishes for Captain Waverley's health and happiness. CHAPTER XXIX WAVERLEY'S RECEPTION IN THE LOWLANDS AFTER HIS HIGHLAND TOUR It was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the two friends stood at the top of the pass of Bally-Brough. 'I must go no farther,' said Fergus Mac-Ivor, who during the journey had in vain endeavoured to raise his friend's spirits, 'If my cross-grained sister has any share in your dejection, trust me she thinks highly of you, though her present anxiety about the public cause prevents her listening to any other subject. Confide your interest to me; I will not betray it, providing you do not again assume that vile...", "...of their lives--experiences that they would never forget. CHAPTER V \"THE MINE IS ON FIRE\" THREE days had passed uneventfully, the Iron Boys having kept up their record for mining more ore than any other section in either of the company's mines. How they succeeded in doing so was a mystery to Mr. Penton, for he failed to discover that the boys were applying any new methods to the operation of their drifts. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the third day, when most of the miners were eating their dinners in the mines, the foremen and shift bosses having come to the surface, Steve also had come up for the purpose of going to his boarding place to get a pair of boots. The lad ate a quick dinner at the boarding house, then hurried back toward the shaft. Bob had remained in the mines, and Steve hoped to be down in time to have a chat with his friend before the whistles blew for the resumption of work at a quarter...", "...shrive me!\" \"Let me know at least what this secret concerns?\" suggested the Padre, insinuatingly. \"Shrive me first,\" said the dying man. But the priest still hesitated, parleying with the sufferer until the ship's bell struck, when, with a triumphant, mocking laugh from the stranger, the vessel suddenly fell to pieces, amid the rushing of waters which at once involved the dying man, the priest, and the mysterious stranger. The Padre did not recover his consciousness until high <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day, when he found himself lying in a little hollow between the Mission Hills, and his faithful mule a few paces from him, cropping the sparse herbage. The Padre made the best of his way home, but wisely abstained from narrating the facts mentioned above, until after the discovery of gold, when the whole of this veracious incident was related, with the assertion of the padre that the secret which was thus mysteriously snatched from his possession was nothing more than the...", "...triumph that he was still on the pad's back,--\"certainly it is true 'that the noblest conquest ever made by man was that of the horse:' a fine creature it is,--a very fine creature,-- and uncommonly difficult to sit on, especially without stirrups.\" Firmly in his stirrups the parson planted his feet; and the heart within him was very proud. CHAPTER XII. The borough town of Lansmere was situated in the county adjoining that which contained the village of Hazeldean. Late at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the parson crossed the little stream which divided the two shires, and came to an inn, which was placed at an angle, where the great main road branched off into two directions, the one leading towards Lansmere, the other going more direct to London. At this inn the pad stopped, and put down both ears with the air of a pad who has made up her mind to bait. And the parson himself, feeling very warm and somewhat sore, said to the pad, benignly, \"It is just,--thou shalt have corn...", "...wall of a burning tenement fell on me is no reason why I should remain in bed longer than one week and be waited upon.\" \"You surely had a wonderful escape, Dean,\" the girl said as she gave him the broth. \"Just by chance the firemen instantly turned the water where you had fallen and so you weren't burned.\" \"Nor drowned,\" the lad said merrily, \"just knocked senseless.\" Then, after a moment's pause, he continued: \"I want to be up and about before Nell returns. She will be in about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> tomorrow. Unless it got into the New England papers, which isn't likely, she won't know a thing about it. I don't want her to hear of it before I tell her. She would imagine all sorts of things that aren't true, and be needlessly worried.\" \"How glad your sister will be when she finds that the use of your arm has been restored to you.\" Lena May sat by the bedside holding Tony on her lap. \"Won't she?\" Dean's upward glance was radiant. \"No longer will I have to follow the...", "...I liked the weather after a shower. You look pale this morning, dear, and you don't talk quite like yourself. I do wish you would take an umbrella when you go to the office to-day. It is so very warm.\" Mrs. Anderson had a chronic fear of sunstroke. When Randolph went away without his umbrella, as he usually did, being, dearly as he loved his mother, impervious to some of her feminine demands, she watched him, standing in the doorway and shaking her head with a dubious air. That <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she was quite contented, for he did actually carry his umbrella. The sky in the northwest was threatening, although the sun still shone fiercely in the south. She herself sat on the doorstep in the shade, and fairly panted like a corpulent old dog. Her mouth was open and her tongue even lolled a little. She was, in reality, suffering frightfully. She had both flesh and nerves, and, given these two adverse conditions to endurance, and the mercury ninety in the shade, there is...", "...in an endeavour to clear away the wreck and get their ship once more before the wind,--laid himself athwart their bows and, with his topsail aback, poured broadside after broadside into the helpless craft; while the _Dolphin_, gliding hither and thither, beyond the reach of the frigate's guns, sent home an eighteen- pound shot every two or three minutes, every one of which appeared to tell somewhere or other on the Frenchman's hull. We now ran away from them, fast, however, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> had lost sight of them altogether. But, when last seen, they were still hammering away at each other, the brigantine and schooner appearing to be getting rather the best of it. Once fairly out of sight of the combatants, we took in our studding- sails, and hauled our wind to the northward, in obedience to Captain Winter's orders; and although I had a sharp look-out for the _Dolphin_ and her consort maintained throughout the whole of the next day, I was not greatly surprised at...", "...could give even Blue Gypsy some useful lessons in speed, and she had a racing pedigree four generations long. Peter had fallen in love with the mustang; he wanted it almost as much as Bobby. And he realized that these next few days were a critical period; if the boy were discovered in any black offence, the horse would be postponed until his fourteenth birthday. His father had an unerring sense of duty in the matter of punishments. It was Saturday and Mr. Carter would be out on the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> train. Peter drove to the station to meet him, still frowning over the question of Bobby and the revolver. He finally decided to warn the boy; there would be time enough to speak if the offence were repeated. Mr. Carter proved to be in an unusually genial frame of mind. He chatted all the way out on matters pertaining to the stables; and as they drew up at the _porte-cochere_ he paused to ask: \"Ah, Peter, about this new mustang for Master Bobby, what do you think?\" \"He's a...", "...from one section of the field to another. \"Red\" Earnest, from Waugh's ranch on the Frio, was the first entry in the relay race. He had a good mount of eight Spanish horses which he rode bareback, making many of his changes in less than fifteen seconds apiece, and finishing full three minutes under the time limit. The feat was cheered to the echo, I joining with the rest, and numerous friendly bets were made that the time would not be lowered that day. Two other riders rode before the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> recess, only one of whom came under the time limit, and his time was a minute over Earnest's record. Miss Jean had camped the ambulance in sight of the field, and kept open house to all comers. Suspecting that she would have Mrs. Hunter and Esther for lunch, if they were present, I avoided our party and took dinner with Mrs. Booth. Meanwhile Uncle Lance detailed Deweese and Happersett to handle my horses, allowing us five vaqueros, and distributing the other men as assistants to...", "...crossing the moon's orbit, Stewart would fire the forward cannon and the ship would coast around the moon, becoming the temporary satellite of a satellite. \"The rest would be easy,\" said Stewart, \"owing to the lesser gravity of the moon. The cannon would be fired to cushion the fall to the moon as the ship was gradually sucked toward the satellite. \"The moon is airless, waterless and lifeless, days and nights are two weeks long, temperatures range from that of boiling water at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> down perhaps to that of liquid air at midnight. The men of the ship would walk on the moon clad in diving suits. Gravity being only one-sixth that of the earth, a man would carry several hundred pounds of apparatus for providing air and for regulating the temperature. \"To leave the moon the ship would fire her rear cannon and coast back to earth. By firing its forward cannon it would cushion its landing on the earth, which would have to be made on a desert, because of the...", "...there are two stalls for us and Bertie and his wife are going to the Dress Circle. My Cook's ticket is taken for Brussels and I leave to-morrow by the Ostende route.\" \"To-morrow\" was the 12th of August, and Dora was not yet in being to interpose every possible obstacle in the way of the civilian traveller. Down to the Battle of the Marne in September, 1914, very little difficulty was made about crossing the Channel, especially off the main Dover-Calais route. So in the radiant <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of that August day Vivie looked her last on the brown-white promontories, cliffs and grey castle of Dover, scarcely troubling about any anticipations one way or the other, and certainly having no prevision she would not recross the Channel for four years and four months, and not see Dover again for five or six years. British war vessels were off the port and inside it. But there was not much excitement or crowding on the Ostende steamer or any of those sensational precautions...", "...return to the city that night. When Will walked into Mr. George's office that morning, that gentleman had not fully recovered from the effects of Mrs. Stout's visit of the night before. And when Will had concluded his remarks he felt about as mean and frightened as a narrow-minded man can feel. Will called next on the other members of the school committee, the editor of the local paper, in which much had been insinuated concerning Barbara, and the deacons of his father's church. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he returned to Mrs. Stout's, and when Barbara asked him where he had been, smilingly replied, \"Calling on our friends.\" In the afternoon Will gave his time and attention to the prominent ladies of the town,--Mrs. Tweedie, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Darling, and several others. He was extremely courteous to the ladies, but when he had finished, many of them knew what he would have said, and how he would have said it, if they had happened to be men. Toward night, when on his...", "...of volcanic fire; and being disposed in parallel layers, their inclination to the west is very evident: quantities of pumice stone were scattered along the shores. The country round the bay is mostly barren. On the eastern side it is rocky, with heath and brush-wood; the west is low, swampy, and sandy, with some partial exceptions; but on the south side there are grassy spaces amongst the brush-wood which might afford pasturage for cattle. Jervis Bay was quitted Dec. 13., and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Pigeon House bore W. by N. In the evening Mr. Bass stopped in a cove, which Point Upright shelters from northern winds; and he employed the next day in looking round the country. The vallies and slopes of the hills were found to be generally fertile; but there being nothing of particular interest in this place, it was quitted on the 15th. Some small islands lying close under the shore (in Bateman Bay), bore west at noon; and the night was passed at anchor under a point, in...", "...she would ever forget all the Rovers had done for her and her mother. Tom was anxious to learn about the Lanings, and was told that they were all at home and doing finely. \"Nellie and Grace are going on a visit to an aunt at Timber Run after the holidays,\" said Dora. \"They wanted me to go along, but I didn't care to leave mamma, and we didn't wish to lock up the house for fear some tramps might break in and rob us.\" After breakfast Sam said he felt like sitting up, but toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> his chest began to hurt him again, and Mrs. Stanhope said it would be best that somebody go for a doctor. Dick and Tom both volunteered, but it was finally decided that Dick should go alone, on horseback. A steed was soon saddled, and off Dick rode, wrapped in his overcoat and with an old fur cap pulled well down over his ears. It had now stopped snowing, so the weather was not quite as unpleasant as it had been. Dick was bound for the house of Dr. Fremley, a physician he knew...", "...amongst them; one man was rendered unfit for duty, and several others complained very much. The weather in general was squally, with thunder, lightning, and rain. In the morning of the 14th they saw an island bearing north-east, half north, 18 or 20 leagues distant, which made in two detached hummocks: At seven in the afternoon, the island seen in the morning was about nine leagues distant, on which they brought to for the night, and next morning made sail and stood for it. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they spoke to the Supply, Lieutenant Ball, who informed them that this island is named Lord Howe's Island. During the afternoon and night they stood off and on, and at nine o'clock the next morning a boat was hoisted out, and Lieutenant Watts with a party went on shore in search of turtle, but they could distinguish no traces of any, though the different bays were very closely explored: about noon, Mr. Watts returned on board. This disappointment did not deter them from making...", "...Jone, 'If I'm to have anything the matter with me, give me somethin' I'm used to.

CHAPTER XVII. IN WHICH WE TAKE A VACATION AND LOOK FOR DAVID DUTTON. It was about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of a very fair July day, in the next summer, when Euphemia and myself arrived at the little town where we were to take the stage up into the mountains. We were off for a two weeks' vacation and our minds were a good deal easier than when we went away before, and left Pomona at the helm. We had enlarged the boundaries of Rudder Grange, having purchased the house, with enough adjoining land to make quite a respectable farm. Of course I could not attend to the manifold duties on such...", "...on the wide wooden platform which extended out from the wall on one side, and made ourselves as comfortable as darkness, smoke, cold, and dirt would permit.

It began to storm furiously about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the 20th, and the violent wind swept up such tremendous clouds of snow from the great steppe north of the village, that the whole earth was darkened as if by an eclipse, and the atmosphere, to a height of a hundred feet from the ground, was literally packed with a driving mist of white snowflakes. I ventured to the top of the chimney hole once, but I was nearly blown over the edge of the _yurt_, and, blinded and choked by snow, I hastily retreated down the chimney,...", "...the afternoon before, in which he succeeded in driving away the Confederate cavalry that attacked him as he was passing through the town. While the General was waiting to ascertain the right road to Gettysburg, I fell asleep sitting on a zinc-covered fish stall, my bridle rein in my hand. On awaking I discovered the command had all moved on; learning the road they took, I hurried on and soon overtook them. CHAPTER IX General Gregg reached the battlefield of Gettysburg about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and reported to the commanding general, whose headquarters were not far from the cemetery, where I noticed that the sod and the graves were much torn up by artillery wheels. The General was ordered with his division to take position on the right of our army. During the day a portion of the command did some skirmishing, and our artillery occasionally fired when the enemy appeared, but we were not heavily engaged. This was the second of July, the day on which the fighting was so...", "...cause, but few were yet at the arrowhead of concentration as was this man. They were to attain it, but not yet. He looked at the north and he looked at his complaining legions, and he strode off to his bivouac beneath a solitary tree. Here, a little later he gave orders to his brigadiers. The Army of the Northwest would resume the march \"at early dawn.\" In the harsh coldness of the morning they retraced the road to Bath, a frightful road, a road over which an army had passed. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they came to Bath, but there was hardly a pause in the town. Beneath a sky of lead, in a harsh and freezing wind, the troops swung slowly into a narrow road running west through a meagre valley. Low hills were on either side--low and bleak. Scrub oak and pine grew sparsely, and along the edges of the road dead milkweed and mullein stood gaunt above the snow. The troops passed an old cider press and a cabin or two out of which negroes stared. Before long they crossed a creek and...", "...the boys call me Captain Sam.\" \"Do they? Then Captain Sam it shall be, and I wish you a successful campaign before Pensacola, Captain. Get your forces into marching order at once. Take all of your boys, unless some of them have already enlisted,--it won't do to take actual soldiers with you, as yours must be a citizen's camp,--and march as early as you can. I'll see that you are properly provided with the tools you need.\" CHAPTER VI. CAPTAIN SAM BEGINS HIS MARCH. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day Sam marched away from the camp at the head of his little company, reduced now to precisely six boys in all, counting the colored boy Joe, but not counting Captain Sam himself. Jake Elliott was one of the company, rather against Sam's wish, but he had begged for permission to go, and Sam thought his size and strength might be of use in some emergency. Tommy was of the party of course, and the other boys were Billy Bunker--called Billy Bowlegs by the boys, because he...", "...of the police is necessary to prevent a general melee and bloodshed. It seems that these fakirs, holy as they are, belong to different sects, between which there are deadly feuds, and if left to themselves unrestrained, when brought into close contact in a procession, they might tear each other in pieces. But this would be no great loss to the world. CHAPTER XII. AGRA--VISIT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES--PALACE OF THE GREAT MOGUL--THE TAJ. We left Allahabad at midnight, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the next day were at Agra, in the heart of the old Mogul Empire. As we approached from the other side of the Jumna, we saw before us what seemed a royal castle, of imposing dimensions, strongly fortified, with walls and moat, like one of the strongholds of the Middle Ages, a castle on the Rhine, built for a double purpose, half palace and half fortress. As we crossed the long bridge flags were flying in honor of the Prince of Wales, who had arrived the week before. His entry...", "...monkeyed with the pardners three, Lyman And Frederick And Jim!

He had gone at right angles to the course he imagined would take him back to the ranch, and now he found he must make a detour around a hill covered with cactus and other prickly plants. By this time Allen was thoroughly worn out and hungry to the last degree. Bitterly he regretted the loss of his favorite mare, Lilly. \"If I had her I imagine I could strike home inside of a couple of hours,\" he said to himself. \"But on foot it will take me until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> or longer.\" But there was no use to grumble, and after resting a spell the young man again started on his weary tramp through thicket and brush, over hills and through hollows. More than once he stumbled and fell, and it was all he could do at times to regain his feet. \"It's no fun to be afoot on the long range,\" he soliloquized. \"A mile seems three times as long as when on horseback.\" But there was no help for it; he must go on, and on he went, his feet now so sore in his...", "...deep that even an active and unarmed man could scarce make his way through them and that only by springing from bush to bush. But he feared that the Romans might form paths by throwing down faggots, and so gain the island at some undefended point. Until noon he saw nothing to justify his anxiety; everything seemed still in the swamp. But he knew that this silence was deceptive, and the canopy of marsh loving trees completely hid the bushes and undergrowth from his sight. It was just <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when a Roman trumpet sounded, and at once at six different points a line of Roman soldiers issued from the bushes. Beric raised his horn to his lips and blew the signal for retreat. At its sound the defenders of the three lower intrenchments instantly left their posts and dashed at full speed up the hill, gaining it long before the Romans, who, as they issued out, formed up in order to repel any attack that might be made upon them. \"So they have made paths across the swamp,\"...", "...not digested.

Nevertheless, when morning came the trail was so drenched that it was impossible to travel on it. \"We must wait till noon,\" said Kate. \"That trail won't be dry enough to travel on for a week,\" I said disconsolately. \"My dear; the chinook is blowing up,\" said Kate. \"You don't know how quickly a trail dries in a chinook. It's like magic.\" I did not believe a chinook or anything else could dry up that trail by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> sufficiently for us to travel on. But it did. As Kate said, it seemed like magic. By one o'clock we were on our way again, the chinook blowing merrily against our faces. It was a wind that blew straight from the heart of the wilderness and had in it all the potent lure of the wild. The yellow prairie laughed and glistened in the sun. We made twenty-five miles that afternoon and, as we were again fortunate enough to find a bluff of dead poplar near which to camp, we built a royal...", "...Bluff, and saw the boundary-post between South and Western Australia, placed by Lieutenant Douglas. _July 12th._ Erected the flagstaff with the Union Jack flying, and nailed a copperplate to the staff, with the following engraved on it: WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

The horses were in a very exhausted state; some having difficulty to keep up. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I could descry the land turning to the southward, and saw, with great pleasure, we were fast approaching the Head of the Great Australian Bight. Reached the sand-patches at the extreme head of the Bight just as the sun was setting, and found abundance of water by digging two feet deep in the sand. Gave the horses as much as I considered safe for them to have at one time. I have never seen horses in such a state before and hope never to do so again. The horses, which four days ago...", "...up his hat and shouting with delight, but his dignity as a car manager would not permit him to do so. No such limitations were imposed upon Teddy Tucker, however, and Teddy whooped it up for all that was in him. All hands were weary when they turned in that night. At about eleven o'clock the following morning, the country billposters came in, having completed their routes. Phil had made his arrangements to have his car hauled over the road by a special engine, and shortly after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Car Three was again on its way, every man on board rejoicing over the drubbing they had given their rival. Phil Forrest was a hero in their eyes. Not a man of that crew, now, but who would go through fire for him, if need be! That afternoon the same plan was followed, Phil driving his men out to their work. \"I am sorry, boys,\" he said. \"I don't like to drive you like this, but we've simply got to shake off Tripp and his crew. In a day or so we will be straightened around...", "...attacked? Lee, relying on McClellan's caution and Jackson's energy, answered the question in the affirmative. The September day wore on. The country between the South Mountain and Sharpsburg, resembling in every characteristic the Valley of the Shenandoah, is open and gently undulating. No leagues of woodland, as in Eastern Virginia, block the view. The roads run through wide cornfields and rolling pastures, and scattered copses are the only relics of the forest. It was not yet <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the Federal scouts appeared among the trees which crown the left bank of the Antietam Creek. \"The number increased, and larger and larger grew the field of blue until it seemed to stretch as far as the eye could see. It was an awe-inspiring spectacle,\" adds Longstreet, \"as this grand force settled down in sight of the Confederates, shattered by battles and scattered by long and tedious marches.\"* (* Battles and Leaders volume 2 page 667.) But when night fell upon the field...", "...this re-enforcement of picked men all danger of war ceased. Before noon the Pawnee chiefs and some of the elder warriors had paid their visit, received their presents, sold a few horses to wagoners who had jaded animals and then returned to their camp, pitched along the banks of the creek a short distance away. The afternoon was spent in visiting between the two encampments and the night in alert vigilance. At dawn the animals were turned out to graze under a strong guard and before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the caravan was on its way again, its rear guard and flankers doubled in strength. Shortly after leaving Ash Creek they came to great sections of the prairie where the buffalo grass was cropped as short as though a herd of sheep had crossed it. It marked the grazing ground of the more compact buffalo herds. The next creek was Pawnee Fork, but since it lay only six miles from the last stopping place, and because it was wise to put a greater distance between them and the Pawnees,...", "...after the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped mountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travel in order to reach it, they again started upon their journey. They followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more pretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak to them. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were many of the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty orchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums that grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them: \"There are bears near by. Be careful.\" The Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip. Dorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed from it and was grazing some distance away. The owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said: \"You cannot escape...", "...and the car ran up the wharf and up an incline at the shore-end. The moment the car disappeared, Del Mar hurried away in the direction he had come. At the top of the grade, he noticed, was a donkey engine which operated the cable that drew the car up from the dock, and at the top of the incline was a huge pile of material. The car had been drawn up to the top of the grade by this time. There the engineer who operated the engine stopped it. Just then the whistle blew for the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour. The men quit work and went to get their dinner pails, while the engineer started to draw the fire. Beside the engine, he began to chop some wood, while the car was held at the top of the grade by the cable. . . . . . . . In our pursuit we came at last in sight of a lonely hut. Evidently that must be a rendezvous of Del Mar. But was he there? Was Elaine there? We must see first. While we were looking about and debating what...", "...amusing, as well as novel, to see the quartermaster conning the ship by looking at the dogvane. The weather cleared a little at intervals, but not enough to enable us to proceed till nine A.M. on the 31st, when we cast off from the ice, with a very light air from the northward. We occasionally caught a glimpse of land through the heavy fog-banks with which the horizon was covered, which was sufficient to give us an idea of the true direction in which we ought to steer. Soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we were once more enveloped in a fog, which, however, was not so thick as to prevent our having recourse to a new expedient for steering the ships, which circumstances at the time naturally suggested to our minds. Before the fog recommenced, and while we were sailing on the course which, by the bearings of the land, we knew to be the right one, the Griper was exactly astern of the Hecla, at the distance of about a quarter of a mile. The weather being fortunately not so thick as to...", "...to devote all my care to her, until such time as she should find a husband worthy of her. By an ancient bequest to the Company, we distributed, on the day before Christmas-day, to twenty-four poor people, a loaf of bread, a small log of wood, or bavin, as we call it, and the sum of two shillings and ten-pence to each person. The recipients were all old, decrepit men and women. There was an ancient regulation, still unrepealed, that they should all attend on the following court-day, at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> precisely, to \"return thanks for the same;\" though that performance of mechanical gratitude had been allowed to fall into disuse by a more philosophical generation. The first Christmas after Lucy came there, she begged me to let her distribute these gifts, and I consented. I stood at my little desk at the end of the hall, with my face resting upon my hands, watching her, and listening to her talking to the old people. Next to the pleasure of hearing her speak to little children, I...", "...the second for that of astronomers, referred to the meridian of Washington. The division of the matter without serious duplication is more easy than might at first be imagined. In explaining it, I will take the ephemeris as it now is, with the small changes which have been made from time to time. One of the purposes of any ephemeris, and especially of that of the navigators, is to give the position of the heavenly bodies at equidistant intervals of time, usually one day. Since it is <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at some point of the earth all the time, it follows that such an ephemeris will always be referred to noon at some meridian. What meridian this shall be is purely a practical question, to be determined by convenience and custom. Greenwich noon, being that necessarily used by the navigator, is adopted as the standard, but we must not conclude that the ephemeris for Greenwich noon is referred to the meridian of Greenwich in the sense that we refer a longitude to that meridian....", "...tenanted by a lone hermit of a fisherman. From him, they learned that they were within fifteen miles of the city of Tampa. The captain purchased a package of tobacco from the hermit and was soon enjoying the first smoke he had had in many days. The boys looked longingly at the fisherman's little sloop bobbing at anchor in the cove. They would have liked to have bargained for a passage to Tampa but they had too little money in their pockets to afford such a luxury. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and the fisherman, with the ready hospitality of his calling, invited them to dinner, an invitation they were not slow to accept. The meal was simple, but the vegetables tasted delicious after their steady meat diet, and they reveled in the strong, hot, fragrant coffee. They did not linger long after eating, for they were anxious to reach their journey's end. When about five miles from the friendly fisherman's, Charley called a halt. \"Listen, and see if you hear...", "...This one had no doubt more than once played such a part in days past. Expertly the riders threw the cattle back to the mesa and moved them forward. Among the bunch one could find the T Anchor brand, the Circle Cross, the Diamond Tail, and the X-Z, scattered among the cows burned with the D Bar Lazy R, which was the original brand of the owner, Emerson Crawford. The sun rose and filled the sky. In a heavy cloud of dust the cattle trailed steadily toward the distant hills. Near <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Buck, passing Dave where he rode as drag driver in the wake of the herd, shouted a greeting at the young man. \"Tur'ble hot. I'm spittin' cotton.\" Dave nodded. His eyes were red and sore from the alkali dust, his throat dry as a lime kiln. \"You done, said it, Buck. Hotter 'n hell or Yuma.\" \"Dug says for us to throw off at Seven-Mile Hole.\" \"I won't make no holler at that.\" The herd leaders, reading the signs of a spring close at hand, quickened the pace. With necks...", "...asked Tom, later on, as he observed some in clouds to the westward. \"Can't say as to that, lad. Those clouds may come this way and they may blow north'ard. If they come down here, we'll catch it putty lively.\" \"I like a good, stiff breeze,\" came from Sam. \"Oh, don't run us into a storm,\" cried Grace in alarm. \"We might all get seasick.\" \"Don't be alarmed,\" said Dick. \"We are a very long way from a storm, to my way of thinking.\" The morning passed quickly enough, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they ran into a small harbor on one of the islands and had dinner in true picnic style. At one o'clock they packed up once more, went on board of the Old Glory, and stood off to the westward, for all wanted a run \"right on the ocean,\" as Tom expressed it. Captain Jerry was just a bit doubtful of the trip, for the clouds in the western sky had grown considerably larger than when first noticed. Not that he did not think the yacht could weather a blow, but he was afraid the young...", "...stopped anybody's engine and backed it in a hurry, as you did. If I'd known where Parkins was, I'd a dropped a gentle word in the ear of the crowd outside, but I wouldn't a pulled that greeny's coffee-nuts out of the fire, and I won't hold the hot things for you.

And, after all the presentiment he had had, <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came round. Presentiments generally come from the nerves, and signify nothing; but nobody keeps a tally of the presentiments and auguries that fail. When the first-engineer and a new man took the engines at noon, Gus was advised by the former to get some sleep, but there was no sleep for him until he had found Norman, who trembled at the sight of him. \"Where is your state-room?\" said August sternly, for he couldn't bring himself to speak kindly to the poor fellow, even in his...", "...losing her hold on life, without any reason in the world that she should not be up and about--except, indeed, that sickness of the soul which saps the very foundations of life. This fear that Jacqueline was slipping away from them impelled her to write Throckmorton a few lines--guarded, but without disguising anything. Meanwhile, the day that was to have been the wedding-day had come and gone. Jacqueline had not noticed it--she seemed to notice nothing in those days--but toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she said to Judith: \"I want to see my wedding-dress--to see if it is quite ruined.\" Judith, without protesting, went and got it. She spread it out on the bed. It was rich and white and soft, and was beautiful with Judith's handiwork; but it was bloodstained in many places. \"That blood, I think, came from my heart,\" said Jacqueline; her eyes were soft and luminous. \"I've been thinking about Throckmorton in the last two or three days--for the first time.

The soldier's account which appeared in _The Living Church_ is worth reading. It is not conclusive evidence, but the number of such experiences has value on the great subject of Spiritual Intervention. Religion pledges itself to such a belief. This is the soldier's story, one of many similar stories: \"It was the next day. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we got word to take the trenches in front of us. They were two hundred yards away, and we weren't well started till we knew that the big guns had failed in their work of preparation. We had advanced 150 yards when we found it was no good.

IV.--_The influence of peat on the temperature_ of light soils dressed with it may often be of considerable practical importance. A light dry soil is subject to great variations of temperature, and rapidly follows the changes of the atmosphere from cold to hot, and from hot to cold. In the summer <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> a sandy soil becomes so warm as to be hardly endurable to the feel, and again it is on such soils that the earliest frosts take effect. If a soil thus subject to extremes of temperature have a dressing of peat, it will on the one hand not become so warm in the hot day, and on the other hand it will not cool so rapidly, nor so much in the night; its temperature will be rendered more uniform, and on the whole, more conducive to the welfare of vegetation.

Captain Cowen's little fortune was gone--all but his pension of eighty pounds a year. He sat like a man turned to stone; then he clasped his hands with agony, and uttered two words--no more--\"My son!\" He rose and left the place like one in a dream.

That night we slept at Matavonium, eighty-four miles forward and but seventy-four miles from Marseilles. So far we had had no adventures, had been accepted without question everywhere, had seen no look of suspicion from anyone, had encountered no other couriers, except those whom we met and passed on the road, we and they lashing, spurring and hallooing, each party barely visible to the other through the cloud of dust both raised. On that day, our eighth out from Rome, at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at Tegulata, we had adventure enough. The common room of the inn was low-ceiled, I could have jumped and touched the carved beams with my hand. But it was very large indeed, something like thirty yards long and fully twenty yards wide, with two Tuscan columns about ten yards apart in the middle of it, supporting the seven great beams, smoke-blackened till their carving was blurred, on which the ceiling-joists were laid. The floor was of some dark, smooth-grained stone, polished...", "...it was sucking like a good one and wigling its tale like a snaik when you step on its head. the old sheep tried to butt and kick and get away but she mite jest as wel have tride to brake away from a steal trap. i bet my father cood hold a wild bull of bastem that the minister talked about if he had him by the neck with one hand and the tale with the other. i tel you that lamn had a good time. after he dident want enny more father put him in another pen and let the old sheep go. this <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he held her again. it took us so long that it was too lait to go to chirch. i bet i dident feel bad. after dinner father held her again. tonite he held her a few minits and then he let me hold her. she only yanked once but i held her as good as father.

Usually the trail was single, but where we came on mud patches, many little trails were distributed over the whole breadth of the road. Here and there, where there were particularly bad spots, into which our horses would have sunk knee-deep, we were forced to take trails back among the trees. While the earlier part of the journey was through rolling country, we came at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> into a true plain, though wooded. We found many cross roads, broad and straight, cut through the woods, and were impressed by the great number of dry _barrancas_ into which we had to descend, and out of which we had to climb. Most of these were actually dry, but many of them contained a dirty pool of stagnant water. At many places, the road was bordered with plants, the leaves of which somewhat resembled those of the pineapple. They were light green in color, narrow and...", "...be telling you.

There's many a pleasant spot awaiting you in this tannery.\" A general snicker went around. Again Peter did not understand. \"Now,\" declared Carmachel briskly, \"you have idled long enough. Take that knife and go to cutting the twine from those bales of skins.\" At this task the boy worked faithfully until the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> whistle blew. At its first blast all the men dropped what they were doing and Peter, who did the same, followed them into a washroom, where he scoured his hands with sand soap. Somehow he did not feel as scornful toward his box of lunch as he had when he had tucked it under his arm in the early morning. Instead he made his way out into the vacant field opposite where he saw the men congregating, and sitting down in the shade of one of the factories, lifted the tin cover with...", "...and wilder pronunciation of their names from the lips of the inhabitants; not _Way_-tatic, _Way_-chusett, but _Wor_-tatic, _Wor_-chusett.

It was such a place as one feels to be on the outside of the earth; for from it we could, in some measure, see the form and structure of the globe. There lay...", "...knave, as I always observed him to be, and so home to supper, and to bed.

I do not contend that Mrs. Eddy, or Christian Scientists or others, ever killed or can kill or afflict with disease any other person by absent mental treatment, and one of my strong reasons for this confident belief is that I am still permitted to walk the earth.

He started for Manoa at dawn, and proceeded as far as Mahinauli, in mid-valley, where he rested under a hala (_Pandanus odoratissimus_) tree that grew in the grove of wiliwili (_Erythrina monosperma_). He sat there some time, brooding over the fancied injury to himself, and nursing his wrath. Upon resuming his walk he broke off and carried along with him a bunch of hala nuts. It was quite <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when he reached Kahaiamano and presented himself before the house of Kahalaopuna. The latter had just awakened from a sleep, and was lying on a pile of mats facing the door, thinking of going to the spring, her usual bathing-place, when she perceived a stranger at the door. She looked at him some time and, recognizing him from oft repeated descriptions, asked him to enter; but Kauhi refused, and asked her to come outside.

We encamped on Blacks Fork, marching a distance of fourteen and a half miles. _July 26_ (Monday). We marched seventeen miles...", "...This object being accomplished, they then let in their shots thick and fast. Very soon the guns were all silenced, and the fort showed evident signs of being much injured. Terry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done before, and at two o'clock on the following morning was up within two miles of the fort with a respectable abatis in front of his line. His artillery was all landed on that day, the 14th. Again Curtis's brigade of Ame's division had the lead. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they had carried an unfinished work less than a half mile from the fort, and turned it so as to face the other way. Terry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the following day. The two commanders arranged their signals so that they could communicate with each other from time to time as they might have occasion. At day light the fleet commenced its firing. The time agreed upon for the assault was the middle of the afternoon, and Ames who commanded the assaulting...", "...that happiness, which here I could not find, and that virtue, which here I have not attained.\" He rose and went away, leaving his audience not much elated with the hope of long life. The prince consoled himself with remarking, that it was not reasonable to be disappointed by this account; for age had never been considered as the season of felicity, and, if it was possible to be easy in decline and weakness, it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity might be happy; that the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of life might be bright, if the evening could be calm. The princess suspected that age was querulous and malignant, and delighted to repress the expectations of those, who had newly entered the world.

All the remainder of that day he moaned on with a splitting headache and terrible nausea. It was worse, he said, than sea sickness, of which he had experienced a touch on his first ocean voyage. The next morning, although still weak, Bob was greatly improved. The ill effects had gone, and once more he had an ambition again to get to the trail. But Dr. Rander protested. \"You are not strong enough yet,\" he said. \"We'll wait till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and see if you're improved sufficiently by that time.\" By the time the sun was directly overhead, Bob was his old natural self again. He was overly anxious to make up for lost time. Lunch over, the explorers again took to the trail, driving the staunch little mules along at a rapid pace. \"Now lead me to those secrets of the Andes!\" said Bob, as Cuzco faded from view. At length the adventurers came to another town, which Dr. Rander called Cameras. They would much rather...", "...gravest consequences. He had, as we know, no intention of forcing on a decision until his reconnaissance produced the information on which to base it, and he had therefore kept back three divisions under Desaix at Pontecurone. But as the day wore on without incident, he began to fear that the reconnaissance would be profitless, and unwilling to give Melas any further start, he sent out these divisions right and left to find and to hold the enemy, whichever way the latter had gone. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Desaix with one division was despatched southward to Rivalta to head off Melas from Genoa and at 9 A.M. on the 14th,[21] Lapoype was sent back over the Po to hold the Austrians should they be advancing from Valenza towards the Ticino. Thus there remained in hand only 21,000 men when at last, in the forenoon of the 14th the whole of Melas's army, more than 40,000 strong, moved out of Alessandria, not southward nor northward, but due west into the plain of Marengo (q.v.).

It was a painful thing to have to do, but the men admitted it was not only justifiable but necessary, and declared they were very glad the measure was adopted. It was fondly hoped that this surveillance would save us from a recurrence of the delay to which the expedition had been subjected, and ulterior steps were postponed till the shore was reached, when it was intended to institute a rigid inquiry.

The horse was fat and fresh; she shied back very frightened and kicked out till her hoofs rattled against the walls. Grettir fell off, but picked himself up and tried to mount her again. There was a sharp struggle, which ended in his shaving all the skin on her back down to her flank. Then he drove the horses out to the meadow. Keingala would not take a bite except off her back, and soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she bolted off to the stables. Grettir locked the door and went home. Asmund asked him where the horses were; he said he had looked after them as usual. Asmund said there must be a storm close at hand if the horses would not stay out in such weather as there was then. Grettir said: \"Many seem wise who are lacking in wit.\" The night passed and there was no storm. Grettir drove out the horses, but Keingala could not endure the pasture.

What still more astonished and perplexed the youth was, that the light seemed of various colours, ever changing, never for a moment wearing the same appearance.

From here their course led up through an enormous gorge, or cleft, that grew narrower as they ascended, until it terminated in a long, steep slope of boulders and loose rocks. Here they encountered the first real danger of the ascent.

The weather, thus far, had been remarkably clear and fine, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we found the weather sometimes oppressively warm. Toward night the wind veered around to the northwest, and grew colder. At nightfall, when we kindled our fire, the air was so chilly and cutting that Nat and I were in a shiver. Had it not been for our blankets we should have suffered considerably, though Biddon did not call his into requisition. There were a number of cottonwood trees near at hand, which served partly to screen us from the blast.

I cannot say much for our first attempts at turning tamenes: the straps supporting our burdens cut into our flesh, we advanced slowly and with great difficulty, and although it was comparatively cool in the forest, I felt hot to suffocation; we stopped every five minutes to take breath and ease ourselves of our burdens, but after a while we got used to our new mode of life, which was not so bad after all, for we found plenty of water on the road, and towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we sat down by the side of a running stream to eat our ham and _posole_, when Julian felt so exhilarated by his present comfort, as to indulge in small jokes about our late sad experiences.

As day broke I heard a cock...", "...his plaster carefully and pushed the stool back into the corner. Near it was a pile of books which he had carefully done up to return to Mrs. Faversham. She had obtained orders for him from her friends, none of which he had accepted. Why should he be so churlish? Why should he refuse to take advantage of her kindness and generosity? Why should not her influence help him on his stony way? What part did his pride play in it? Was it on account of Cedersholm, or was it something else?

It was clear and sunny after the storm; bleak, though. He shivered a little as he came in sight of the club. A sick distaste for the very building overcame him. A flash of the river where the Dream had anchored glittered between the houses. He turned away his face.

Incident had been crowded on incident, and action upon action. But now that he found himself faced with the necessity of waiting for the slightest sign that could send him on the trail again, he had to meet and endure the greatest trial that he had ever known. It was such a helpless and almost hopeless position. Still it was not without some hope, and hope helped considerably to mitigate his sufferings between the hours of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and three o'clock. And then, just as he had predicted--just as he had calculated it must come to pass--the expected message came. It came in the shape of a telegram addressed to the Premier, which read as follows: \"If you accept my terms, wire, not later than four o'clock, to Smith-Brown-Smith, care of Poste Restante, St Martin's-le-Grand.

We made camp at about 8500 feet elevation on the head of one of the forks of Four Bear Creek, having to pack wood up from below for making coffee. We struck out after lunch up the gulch, and after going a few miles discovered a grizzly rooting among the rocks well up to its head, near the summit of the range, which is here between 10,000 and 11,000 feet elevation.

But when at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Division was joined by reinforcements from Tergnier, the Saxon rifles stormed the park by the high-road, and the Schleswig-Holstein Fusiliers carried La Neuville.

Peter detested the arrangement, unavoidable as it was, and always rejoiced when the noon hour was over. But here was an escape from such disagreeable conditions. Here was an unused room! Why should it not become a refuge from the noise, the dirt, and the turmoil of the factory? The plan seemed innocent enough, and when Peter confided it to Nat neither of them could see the slightest objection to it. In consequence, at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> time they crept up-stairs, and arranged a cozy little corner for themselves behind the packing-cases. It was almost as good as playing Robinson Crusoe, this building a fortress and hiding inside it. Then, too, the constant chance of being discovered provided just the necessary tremor of excitement to make it interesting. What fun it was! They called their stronghold Sterling Castle, and many a joke and jibe they made concerning it--jokes at which they laughed heartily when they...", "...to the faithful dog. The rising sun saw us again _en route_ over very difficult ground. The ravines which we always followed in order to skirt the precipices, were at times so full of large blocks that we could not jump from one to the other without danger, while the rock strata we were compelled to climb were often too high for us to lift ourselves upon them. Hence we were obliged to make numerous circuits and could not advance so rapidly as the distance would have allowed. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we were scaling a height when suddenly a mighty condor spread out its enormous wings with a loud yell, and rose from a rock with a great effort, and we saw a mountain sheep hanging in its claws. It swung itself on to the nearest peak and sat down there, looking over at us with extended wings and croaking hoarsely. We raised our rifles almost simultaneously and the eagle sank lifeless on its quarry. Tiger climbed up and threw both down to us. The sheep was a one year old ewe and...", "...or wooden images of their dead ancestors. These they keep in separate rooms of their houses and take with them as talismans to war. In these inner rooms are also kept miniature wooden houses in which their ancestors are believed to reside, and in which even Mohammedans (for some of the natives profess Islam) burn incense on Fridays in honour of the souls of the dead. These souls are treated like living beings, for in the morning some finely pounded sago is placed in the shrines; at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it is taken away, but may not be eaten by the inmates of the house. Curiously enough, women are forbidden to set food for the dead in the shrines: if they did so, it is believed that they would be childless. Further, in the chief's house there are shrines for the souls of all the persons who have died in the whole village. Such a house might almost be described as a temple of the dead.

Presently I saw the herd pouring like a foam-white noisy river across the narrow bridge over the Water of Cruden. The next morning was fine, very hot, and of an unusual stillness. Ordinarily I should have rejoiced at such a day; but the warning of the erudite and philosophical shepherd made me mistrust. To me the worst of the prophecy business was that it became a disturbing influence. To-day, perforce, because it was fine, I had to expect that it would end badly. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I walked over to Whinnyfold; it being Saturday I knew that the workmen would have gone away early, and I wanted to have the house to myself so that I could go over it quietly and finally arrange the scheme of colouring. I remained there some hours, and then, when I had made up my mind as to things, I set off for the hotel. In those few hours the weather had changed marvellously. Busy within doors and thinking of something else, I had not noticed the change, which must have been...", "...out of the depths of the valley, reach the warm, level rays of sunlight that turns the first leaves that have passed their prime into the fierce yellows and burnt siennas which, when faithfully represented at Burlington House, are often considered overdone.

Evening is by no means necessary to the attractions of Swaledale, for a blazing <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> gives lights and shades and contrasts of colour that are a large portion of Swaledale's charms. If instead of taking either the old road by way of Marske, or the new one by the riverside, one had crossed the old bridge below the castle, and left Richmond by a very steep road that goes to Leyburn, one would have reached a moorland that is at its best in the full light of a clear morning.

I remember those bathing excursions to the New river, which Lamb recalls with such relish, better, I think, than he can, for he was a home-seeking lad, and did not care for such water parties. How we would sally forth into the fields, and strip under the first warmth of the sun, and wanton like young dace in the streams, getting appetites for the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> which those of us that were penniless had not the means of allaying; while the cattle, and the birds, and the fishes were at feed about us, and we had nothing to satisfy our cravings: the very beauty of the day, the exercise of the pastime, and the sense of liberty, setting a keener edge upon them! How, faint and languid, finally, we would return, toward nightfall, to our desired morsel, half-rejoicing, half-reluctant, that the hours of uneasy liberty had expired! \"It was...", "...crafty boy, Addison,\" said he. Ad looked a little confused. \"I knew Tom would like to go first rate,\" said he; \"and as there may be considerable hard digging before us, I thought it would be all right to have somebody who could take his turn at it.\" \"Quite right,\" replied Gramp, still laughing. \"Craft is a good thing and often helps along famously. But don't grow too crafty. \"I am quite willing for you to send for Thomas,\" he added. \"I think it is a good idea.\" Accordingly, at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Halse went to the Edwards homestead, bearing an invitation to a fox-digging bee. They, too, were busy with their hoeing, but Mr. Edwards, who was a very good-humored man, gave Thomas permission to join us at two o'clock. When we went out from dinner to our own hoeing, we took along an axe, two spades, a hog-hook to pull out the fox, and a crowbar, also the gun; and after working two hours in the corn-field, we set off across the fields and pastures for the fox burrow, just as...", "...the spaces between the knife-rests, which defended it some 40 yards in front, with screw pickets and loose strands of wire.

Only 15 casualties were reported from the whole Brigade, none of which fell to the share of our Battalion. The trench was held by a few posts until dawn and then evacuated. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> next day an enemy aeroplane flew along it, and the observer could be plainly seen leaning out and taking photographs of this mushroom growth. Almost immediately every battery from La Brayelle to Serre began to register upon it, and for weeks it was rendered unwholesome by the constant attention of artillery and mine-throwers. A poem of Lieut. Downs' preserves the air of mystery in which the whole scheme was so fortunately conceived and executed. A whisper wandered...", "...a word to say to anyone. Only Dick feared that he would find Mr. Goodwyn a hard taskmaster, on account of this incident; and he regretted it very much, believing it would handicap him more or less in his work.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Dick bought himself a little luncheon, for he was too far away from home to spend half an hour walking to and fro each day; after this he meant to bring something with him; no matter if it were only bread and butter, it would be much better than this \"sawdust,\" as he contemptuously called the cake he had purchased at the town bakery. It was just at two o'clock that a most peculiar incident occurred, and one that gave Dick considerable amusement. He was waiting in the outer...", "...between the machines, bearing a basket of leather findings under his left arm, and pressed against his stomach. When near Carrie, he stretched out his right hand and gripped one girl under the arm. \"Aw, let me go,\" she exclaimed angrily. \"Duffer.\" He only grinned broadly in return. \"Rubber!\" he called back as she looked after him. There was nothing of the gallant in him. Carrie at last could scarcely sit still. Her legs began to tire and she wanted to get up and stretch. Would <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> never come? It seemed as if she had worked an entire day. She was not hungry at all, but weak, and her eyes were tired, straining at the one point where the eye-punch came down. The girl at the right noticed her squirmings and felt sorry for her. She was concentrating herself too thoroughly--what she did really required less mental and physical strain. There was nothing to be done, however. The halves of the uppers came piling steadily down.

We have lost some brave officers and men.

This watch should be a good one and receive as much care, in its way, as the chronometer. It should be wound at the same time every day, carefully handled and, in other respects, treated like the fine time-piece that it is. While authorities differ on this point, the best practice seems to be not to change the navigator's watch to correspond with the apparent time of each day's <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> position. The reason for this is two-fold. First, because constant moving of the hands will have an injurious effect on the works of the watch, and second, because, by not changing the watch, the C-W remains approximately the same, and thus a good check can be kept on both the watch and the chronometer as well as on the navigator's figures in reckoning the times of his various sights.

Opposite, in the next two columns, I found that the Snark had made 3.5 miles of southing or latitude, and that she had made 23.7 miles of westing. To find my eight o'clock' latitude was easy. I had but to subtract 3.5 miles from my <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> latitude. All the elements being present, I worked up my longitude. But this was my eight o'clock longitude.

For about a couple of hours the adventurous voyagers were able to maintain that speed; but toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they found themselves once more surrounded by ice; and they had no choice but either to materially reduce their speed and slowly thread their way through narrow and tortuous channels, or once more take flight into the air. They chose the latter alternative; and for the next two hours the flying ship sped northward through Smith's Sound, for the most part over an unbroken field of pack-ice which, to any ordinary vessel, would have opposed an utterly impassable barrier.

I had forgotten the circumstance next day, but at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I happened to look toward cot No. 39, and there was Mrs. Maben herself. She had brought the chicken broth in a pretty china bowl, with napkin and silver spoon, and was feeding my doubting Thomas, to his great satisfaction.

The noon meal there is a social function, and certain formalities are observed.

Bob dragged himself out of bed every morning at half-past six, hurried through a breakfast, caught a car--and hoped that the bridge would be closed.

As he looked, the winter murk parted noiselessly, as though the effect were prearranged; a blue sky shone through on a glint of bluer water; and, wonder of wonders, there through the grimy dirty roar of...", "...to-morrow.

After a few minutes of stubborn denial, the rascal gave in and told the whole story. He was to share half of the amount thus gained with the man Spooner. Up to that time the two men had made a substantial rake-off six days in every week. After the tally-man had made a clean breast of the steal the superintendent said: \"Go back to your post.

He told me he was recovering from an \"attack of Congo,\" which I take to be an intermittent fever. He had just been mustered out...", "...Mr. Grey, who was leaning over the foot of the bed, cast me a quick glance which was not without its suspicion.

But there were enough of them to carry all the boxes and bales that contained the outfit of our friends. \"It might be worse,\" commented Tom. \"Now if they'll help us pack up we'll travel on.\" More sign language was resorted to, and the chief, after another present had been made to him, sent some of his men to help put the packs on the animals. The steers, which Tom did not regard with much favor, proved to be better than the mules, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> our friends were all packed up again, and ready to take the trail. The chief gave them a good dinner,--as native dinners go,--and then, after telling them that, though he had never seen the giants it had long been known that they inhabited the country to the north, he waved a friendly good-bye. \"Well, we'll see what luck we'll have by ourselves,\" remarked Tom, as he mounted a bony mule, an example followed by Ned, Mr. Damon and Eradicate, They had left behind some of their...", "...time I saw a long range of breakers from the entrance stretching away south-east to east-south-east which made me to be in some doubts as to an entrance existing, however I sent Mr. Hacking in the boat to sound and almost immediately we struck on a sandbank.

Beyond any power of thought or even fancy, with only a dreamy succession of images flitting across her mind, the hours passed she knew not how; that they did pass she knew from her handmaid in the long curls who was every now and then coming in to look at her and give her fresh water; it needed no ice. Her handmaid told her that the cars were gone by--that it was near noon--then that it was past noon.

But, about nine o'clock at night, I received from General Tyler, in person, the order to continue the retreat to the Potomac. This retreat was by night, and disorderly in the extreme.

I reached this point at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day, and found a miscellaneous crowd crossing over the aqueduct and ferries.. Conceiving this to be demoralizing, I at once commanded the guard to be increased, and all persons attempting to pass over to be stopped.

Anticipation was not unmingled with anxiety. Two days later they entered a valley, and when they stopped at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for their usual rest Harry Kenton rode some distance up a creek, thinking that he might rouse a deer out of the underbrush. Although the country looked extremely wild and particularly suited to game, he found none, but unwilling to give up he continued the hunt, riding much farther than he was aware. He was just thinking of the return, when he heard a rustling in a thicket to his right, and paused, thinking that it might be the deer he wanted. Instead, a gigantic figure with...", "...is so funny.

The once peaceful hamlet, which, he remembered, had been on the right bank of the Cedar, was surrounded by the rampant waters. While Tim circled the village, Ralph managed to secure two graphic pictures of the marooned village. Tim could see a little group gathered in front of the general store and once he thought they were gesturing to him, but he dared not go closer. Motor trouble at any lower altitude would mean a plunge into the flood. A few minutes before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Tim dropped the crimson-winged Lark down out of the clouds and skidded over the muddy field. He uncurled his legs and got stiffly out of the cockpit. Ralph hopped down beside him, his camera under his arm. They left orders for mechanics at the field to take care of the plane and then headed toward the city in the car they had left at the field. \"That's some flood,\" said Ralph as they sped toward the office. \"I didn't think there was so much water in the whole world.\" Tim...", "...inquired of Ronald, \"by whose authority you have done this?\" The Ensign saluted. \"By the authority of a Second Lieutenant who sees the wife of his Captain in danger,\" he answered stiffly, then turned on his heel and walked away.

At least a thousand, including the squaws, came out of the woods and were assigned to different stations, according to their rank. The chiefs of the several branches of the...", "...when he was seeking a messenger; and by an even greater miracle, they had composed all their difficulties just in time for him to send her to town. It was like an act of Providence, an answer to prayer, if people any longer prayed; and, more, even, than the money and the joy of success, was the consciousness of Virginia's love. She had seemed so hostile, so distant and unattainable; but the moment that he forgot her and abandoned all hope she fluttered to his hand like a dove. The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour came and went and as Wiley watched the 'phone it seemed to him strangely silent. To be sure, few people called him, but--he snatched the receiver from the hook. He had guessed it--the 'phone was dead! He rattled the hook and listened impatiently, then he shouted and listened again, and black fancies rose up in his brain. What was the meaning of this? Had they cut the wire on him? And why? It really made no difference! Virginia was there; he had heard it from the stage-driver...", "...Anjou is on the coast of Normandy, [at this time Margaret was at Harfleur--Will.

The scene was striking: the moon was extremely bright and the sky serene, but around the tent stood a troop of torch- bearers, and the red glare shone luridly upon the steel of the serried horsemen and the banners of the earl, in which the grim white bear was wrought upon an ebon ground, quartered with the dun bull, and crested in gold with...", "...line would be next to the Admiral's flagship. \"I thought Admiral Beatty would be up toward the front,\" said Jack. \"He probably will,\" was Frank's reply. \"I have it figured out like this, from what you have told me of the fact that the submarines will be surrendered first: Admiral Tyrwhitt probably will receive the surrender of the U-Boats, while Admiral Beatty will receive the formal surrender of Admiral von Wimpfen himself.\" \"Maybe that's it,\" Jack agreed. It was well after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the Essex sighted the flagship of Admiral Tyrwhitt, the Invincible, and reported for duty. Jack received instructions to lay to just west of the flagship. He obeyed. From time to time now other vessels appeared and reported to Admiral Tyrwhitt and were assigned places in the long line. Suddenly there was a cheer from the crews of the many ships. Jack glanced across the water, as did Frank. And then the latter went wild with excitement. Steaming majestically toward them...", "...but our actual course was nearer 7000. When off the Galapagos Islands, we met the cold southerly wind and water, known as the Chilian current, and crossed the equator in a breeze which forced us all to wear great-coats, and to dream that, instead of entering the southern hemisphere, we had come by mistake within the arctic circle.

At half-past two o'clock, land was sighted right ahead; and by four o'clock, we were in the bay, such as it is, at Pitcairn. Although at sea there was a calm, the surf from the ground-swell beat heavily upon the shore, and we were faint to content ourselves with the view of the island from our decks. It consists of a single volcanic peak, hung with an arras of green...", "...January, 1878, I went on an expedition down the Potomac with a couple of friends to shoot ducks. We left on the morning boat that makes daily trips to and from Mount Vernon. The weather was chilly and the sky threatening. The clouds had a singular appearance; they were boat-shaped, with well-defined keels. I have seldom known such clouds to bring rain; they are simply the fleet of \u00c3\u0086olus, and so it proved on this occasion, for they gradually dispersed or faded out and before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the sun was shining. We saw numerous flocks of ducks on the passage down, and saw a gun (the man was concealed) shoot some from a \"blind\" near Fort Washington. Opposite Mount Vernon, on the flats, there was a large \"bed\" of ducks. I thought the word a good one to describe a long strip of water thickly planted with them.

Nine miles is quite a distance, but we ought to reach the Emerald City by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> if no accidents happen.\" So the Pumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the Saw-Horse and the journey was resumed.

I came over at once.\" He cleared his throat and looked first at Audrey and then at Miss Ingate. He felt that he ought to be addressing Audrey, but somehow he could not help addressing Miss Ingate instead.

This person met him very kindly, and with a hearty shake of the hand, \"hoped he would do his Aunt Mabel the honor of coming to stay with them.\" There was an air of irony in this speech which Reuben was quick to perceive; and the knowing look of Captain Saul at once informed him that all the romance of his runaway voyage was at an end. Both...", "...these walks. He liked to be alone. He liked the solitude of the tremendous, tumbling ocean; the fresh, windy downs; he liked to feel the gusty Trades flogging his face, and he would remain for hours watching the roll and plunge of the breakers with the silent, unreasoned enjoyment of a child. All at once he developed a passion for fishing. He would sit all day nearly motionless upon a point of rocks, his fish-line between his fingers, happy if he caught three perch in twelve hours. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he would retire to a bit of level turf around an angle of the shore and cook his fish, eating them without salt or knife or fork. He thrust a pointed stick down the mouth of the perch, and turned it slowly over the blaze. When the grease stopped dripping, he knew that it was done, and would devour it slowly and with tremendous relish, picking the bones clean, eating even the head. He remembered how often he used to do this sort of thing when he was a boy in the mountains of Placer...", "...pointing right at your image on the screen.\" Burris opened his mouth. Nothing came out.

Mr. Clive, the noted handwriting expert, had a flat in Lincoln's Inn; and thither Anstice hastened in a taxi, arriving just as the clocks of London were striking three; a feat in punctuality which...", "...that the King hath prorogued the Parliament to October next; and, among other reasons, it will give me time to go to France, I hope. 15th.

At first she felt inclined to seek its shelter when the rain poured loudly on the leaves above her and fell thence in big blobs, making a noise like the little ripe figs when the squirrels shook them down; but the remembrance that such women as Tara performed like vows cheerfully kept her steady. And after a day or two she often started to find it was already <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> or dusk, the day half gone or done. Time slipped by with incredible swiftness in watching the squirrels and the birds, in counting the raindrops fall from a peepul leaf. And what a strange peace and contentment the life brought! As she sat after dark in the thatch, eating the rice and milk and fruit which Tara brought her stealthily, she felt, at times, a terrified amaze at herself. If she ever came through the long struggle for life, this surely would be the strangest part of the...", "...doves and sparrows and a group of frisking squirrels on a wide sweep of sunlit grass.

Not until the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> bells sent Pollyanna hurrying homeward did she remember that she did not even yet know the boy's name. \"I only know it isn't 'Sir James,'\" she sighed to herself, frowning with vexation. \"But never mind.

French's division, three brigades, 4,800 men, accompanied by seven batteries of horse artillery, left Modder River Camp at 3 A.M. Sunday, February 11th. Diverging slightly from the railroad, they marched due south--away from the enemy--seventeen miles to Ramdam, which is about ten miles east of Graspan Station. At sunrise they were out of sight of the empty tents, standing deceitfully behind them. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Ramdam was reached, and the division halted till 3 A.M. of the 12th, when it again marched due east for a ford called Waterval Drift, on the Riet River, which it will be remembered is a tributary of the Modder, flowing from south-east to north-west. Reaching there soon after sunrise, the ford was found to be held by a party of the enemy. Covering his change of purpose by a feint upon this position, French swung the rest of his division to the right, and with slight loss forced a...", "...why everyone wanted to help. CHAPTER 21 The Dinner The girls, a little uneasy lest their alarmingly interested parents should insist on cooking and serving the entire dinner, were both relieved and perplexed to find that the grown-ups, while perfectly willing to help with the dinner provided they could work in their own kitchens, flatly declined the most urgent invitations to enter the cottage on the afternoon or evening of the party. It was incomprehensible. Until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the very day of the feast the parents and Aunty Jane had paid the girls an almost embarrassing number of visits. Now, when the girls really wanted them and actually gave each of them a very special invitation, each one unexpectedly held aloof. For, as the hour approached, the girls momentarily became more and more convinced that something would surely go wrong in the cottage kitchen with no experienced person to keep things moving. They decided, at four o'clock, to ask Mrs....", "...decks should be swamped, and the ship delayed. They ran out the boarding-nets, and brought up the powder, wads and shot.

We may sight an English frigate at any moment, and then we shall see some fun, Mr. Rogers.\" \"Aye! aye! captain. That we shall,\" replied the mate. Slowly the distant frigate gained upon the _Duncan_, and before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it could be easily seen from the deck, though still some five leagues distant. Nearer and nearer she came, and every man aboard the _Duncan_ had now made up his mind that a fight was the only possible ending, and the sooner it came, the better. The second mate, Mr. Hudson, and Jamie were in the fore-top now, and just before dinner the captain hailed them, and said-- \"Ho, there! Can you make out her armament yet?\" \"Pretty well, sir.\" \"How many guns does she carry?\"...", "...the helm laid hold of the water, and the ship was got gradually round to face the waves. The rolling diminished, a certain amount of pitching taking its place. Our speed had fallen from eleven knots to two. I went again to bed. After a space of calm, when we seemed crossing the vortex of a storm, heavy tossing recommenced. I was afraid to allow myself to fall asleep, as my berth was high, and to be pitched out of it might be attended with bruises, if not with fractures. From Friday at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to Saturday at noon we accomplished sixty-six miles, or an average of less than three miles an hour. I overheard the sailors talking about this storm. The 'Urgent,' according to those that knew her, had never previously experienced anything like it.[45] [45] There is, it will be seen, a fair agreement between these impressions and those so vigorously described by a scientific correspondent of the 'Times.'

Scarcely did he find himself clambering across its gnarly trunk and thick close branches than the pine-tree, to Knut's great fright, raised itself high in air, and roared with a gruff voice: \"Good-day, Knut Spelevink. Why do you look so poorly to-day?\" Knut, hanging over the road in the pine-tree's top, still found courage to answer: \"Why shouldn't I look poorly when I have had nothing to eat since yesterday <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> except Catechism, and bar iron, and frozen quicksilver and a gnat's leg?\" \"Well, why did you interrupt my midday nap?\" asked the pine-tree. \"Don't you know that I am the King of the Forest and rule over all the trees and swamps for seven times seven miles around!

Aside from these two men we travelled through an apparently deserted jungle. I suspect, however, that we were probably well watched; for when we stopped for <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we heard the gunbearers beyond the screen of leaves talking to some one. On learning from our boys that these were some of the shenzis, we told them to bring the savages in for a shauri; but in this our men failed, nor could they themselves get nearer than fifty yards or so to the wild people.

By making signs they were made to understand they were not to come nearer to our camp than about one hundred and fifty yards. They remained until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> staring at us and our horses. Some who could not see us very well got into the gum-trees, and had a long look at us. They were seventeen in number; four of them were boys, one of them much lighter than the others, nearly a light yellow. At noon they all went off, after remaining for four hours.

With this view, after exploring without success a little glen near us, we crossed several of the ridges of which I have before spoken; and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> found ourselves ascending a long and gradually rising slope, but still without having discovered any place adapted to our purpose. Low and heavy clouds betokened an approaching storm, and we hurried on to gain a covert in a clump of thick bushes, which appeared to terminate the long ascent. We threw ourselves under the lee of these bushes, and pulling up the long grass that grew around, covered ourselves completely with it, and awaited the shower.

He appropriated Scotch's bed in the tub, to the evident satisfaction of Scotch. During the morning the two played together in the happiest possible manner for more than an hour. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I fed them together. In the afternoon, while I was writing, I heard the varied voices of the coyote pack, and went out with my glass to watch proceedings, wondering how the visiting collie would play his part. There went Scotch, as I supposed, racing for the yelping pack, but the visiting collie was not to be seen. The pack beat the usual sullen, scattering retreat, and while the dog, which I supposed to be Scotch, was chasing the last slow tormenter into the woods, from behind...", "...like best to be when you grow up, Davy?\" he asked. \"Six feet,\" said I, so promptly that he laughed. \"Faith,\" said Polly Ann, looking at me comically, \"he may be many things, but I'll warrant he'll never be that.\" I have often thought since that young Mr. Clark showed much of the wisdom of the famous king of Israel on that day.

Soon after, the landscape grew savage and untenanted, and the carretera more and more constricted until it passed, like a thread through the eye of a needle, through a short tunnel, built, said the inscription, by Isabel II--an example of exaggerated Spanish courtesy evidently, for history shouts assurance that the activities of that lady...", "...Miss Carpenter's familiar by having kittens under the horse-hair sofa in the parlour. Incidentally this indelicate and ungentlemanly behaviour temporarily unloosed the hinges of Miss Carpenter's reason, so that my supper suffered that evening, and for several days she wandered round the house with blank and witless eyes. Perhaps I should have warned her, for I had latterly come to suspect Caesar of leading a double life; but for reasons which seemed sufficient I had refrained. By the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> train Roland Barnette received his new summer suit from Chicago. I did not see it till evening, but heard of it before one, since Roland donned it immediately and wore it to the bank that very afternoon. I understand it caused something very near a run on the bank; people came in to draw a dollar or so or get change and lingered to feast their outraged visions, so that Blinky Lockwood, the president, had to send Roland home to change before closing-time. He changed back, however,...", "...find the use of them. At this time I served a teaspoonful of rum to each person, from which we all found great benefit. As I have mentioned before I determined to keep to the west-north-west till I got more to the northward, for I not only expected to have better weather but to see the Feejee Islands, as I have often understood from the natives of Annamooka that they lie in that direction. Captain Cook likewise considered them to be north-west by west from Tongataboo. Just before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we discovered a small flat island of a moderate height bearing west-south-west 4 or 5 leagues. I observed our latitude to be 18 degrees 58 minutes south; our longitude was by account 3 degrees 4 minutes west from the island of Tofoa, having made a north 72 degrees west course, distance 95 miles, since yesterday noon. I divided five small coconuts for our dinner and everyone was satisfied. A little after noon other islands appeared, and at a quarter past three o'clock we could...", "...one is almost loth to seek the earth again, although the novelty of landing in who knows what part of Europe affords still another unique pleasure. For many the great charm of all ballooning lies here. The balloonist becomes an explorer.

I advise you to take to spherical ballooning. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> you lunch peaceably amid your family. At 2 P.M. you mount. Ten minutes later you are no longer a commonplace citizen--you are an explorer, an adventurer of the unknown as truly as they who freeze on Greenland's icy mountains or melt on India's coral strand. You know but vaguely where you are and cannot know where you are going. Yet much may depend upon your choice as well as your skill and experience. The choice of altitude is yours--whether to accept this current or mount...", "...very fresh, but very pleasant it was, and the first time I have sailed in any one of them.

Towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> there comes a man in as if upon ordinary business, and shows me a writ from the Exchequer, called a Commission of Rebellion, and tells me that I am his prisoner in Field's business; which methought did strike me to the heart, to think that we could not sit in the middle of the King's business. I told him how and where we were employed, and bid him have a care; and perceiving that we were busy, he said he would, and did withdraw for an hour: in which time Sir J. Minnes took coach...", "...the Solitaries we again closed with the coast at Cape Byron. The scenery is magnificent. The coast range attains to a great elevation. Mount Warning, the loftiest peak, rises to a height of 3,840 feet, and is visible fully sixty miles. It was our guiding mark in the navigation of the coast for a space of twenty-four hours.

Prime acceded cheerfully enough, though he was impatient to examine the canoe-load, in which he was hoping there might prove to be a supply of tobacco. For the better part of the forenoon they quartered the forest around and about between the river and the lake in widening circles, missing nothing but the glade of horrors, which Prime took good care to avoid.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the barograph curve turned up and the wind moderated, the sky gradually clearing. To-night it is fairly bright and clear; there is a light south-westerly wind. It seems rather as though the great gales of the Westerlies must begin in these latitudes with such mild disturbances as we have just experienced.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I reached one of those most troublesome cactus woods, which frequently run across the prairies. The present one ran like a wall for miles across my path. There is no chance of riding through these thickets, as the prickly plants grow closely together.

Better already. Letter by post. \"Henry.\" She detained the man, and made up a packet of things for Cairnhope, and gave him five shillings to be sure and take them. This was followed by a correspondence, a portion of which will suffice to eke out the narrative. \"DEAREST MOTHER,--I slept ill last night, and got...", "...having been entirely expended last night we shared our small stock with them.

A few days afterwards, he begged me again to forgive him, if he had done me any wrong since the last time, for he wished to make reconciliation with God before he became weaker, and he wept and protested, saying, 'It indeed grieves me still that I should have often annoyed you, and you comfort me.' On Sunday at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I congratulated him on his spiritual feast. Thus he dragged on with great difficulty for about fourteen days, and as I heard that two men were obliged almost to carry him up the stairs, I sent him word that he might remain below on the ground floor of the tower, and that he might rest assured I would go nowhere. He thanked me, crawled up for the last time to my door, and said, 'If I did that and the Queen heard of it, my head would answer for it.' I said: 'Then confess your...", "...The Portuguese are the most adventurous traders. The value of imports to Peru by the Amazonian steamers during 1867 was $324,533; of exports, $267,748. In two hours and a half we arrive at Maucallacta, or \"Old Town,\" an Indian village on the right bank of the river. Here our passports were vised by the Peruvian governor, and the steamer wooded up. One of the hands on the \"Morona\" was Manuel Medina, a mameluco, who was employed by Bates and Agassiz in their explorations. We left at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the following day, and anchored for the night off Caballococha, for the Peruvian steamers run only in the daytime. Caballococha, or \"Horse-lake,\" is a Ticuna town, situated on a level tract of light loam, closely surrounded by the dense forest, and beside a cano of clear water leading to a pretty lake.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Major Ferguson sent a final express to Lord Cornwallis, urging the hurrying on of the reinforcements, not knowing that his former despatch had been intercepted, nor that Tarleton had not as yet started to the rescue. A little later the scouts began to come in one by one with news of the approaching riflemen. There was but a small body of them, not above a thousand men in all, so the spies said, and my heart misgave me. They were without cannon and they lacked bayonets; and...", "...for the Val or Yellow River, near to which they expected to fall in with plenty of game, and particularly the giraffe and rhinoceros. Although at that season of the year the river was nearly dry, still there was a scanty herbage on and near its bank, intermixed with beds of rushes and high reeds; this was sufficient for the pasture of the cattle, but it was infested with lions and other animals, which at the dry season of the year kept near the river-bank for a supply of water. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they had proceeded about fifteen miles to the westward, and as they advanced they found that the supply of water in the river was more abundant; they then unyoked the cattle to allow them to feed till the evening, for it was too dangerous to turn them loose at night.

She went home at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and slept till four. She arrived at the Boutells' flat looking like a dead leaf. She tried to skip into the presence of Mrs. Boutell--a dragon with a frizz--and was heavily informed that Mr. Boutell wouldn't be back till six, and that, anyway, they had \"talked over the Villa Estates proposition, and decided it wasn't quite time to come to a decision--be better to wait till the weather cleared up, so a body can move about.\" \"Oh, Mrs. Boutell, I just can't argue it out with you,\"...", "...of old, The Dusk goes gleaning color and perfume From Bible slopes of heaven, that illume Her pensive beauty deep in shadows stoled.

Prince Chrzanovsky, who had fought under Napoleon at Leipzig and Waterloo, and had subsequently commanded a Russian division at Varna, was put in supreme command, seconded by Alexander La Marmora.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on March 20, hostilities were to be resumed. The campaign that followed lasted but five days. Radetzky, by his preliminary feint, made the Italians believe that he would evacuate Lombardy as heretofore; but at the last moment he quickly concentrated his five army corps at Pavia.

In the harness shop belonging to Joseph Wainsworth it one day struck a new note. The harness maker was a tradesman of the old school and was vastly independent.

Now, just one word of review. You remember that we have learned that astronomical time is reckoned from noon of one day to <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the next and hence the astronomical day corresponds to the 24 hours of a ship's run. The hours are counted from 0 to 24, so that 10 o'clock in the morning of October 25th is astronomically October 24th, 22 hours or 22 o'clock of October 24th. Now Right Ascension is different from both astronomical and civil time. Right Ascension is practically celestial longitude. For instance, the position of a place on the earth is fixed by its latitude and longitude; the position of a...", "...it a valuable asset. Mr. Jones's expression startled Obadiah.

To Obadiah it spoke of arson, of the assassination of capitalists, of the proletariat running mad. He quailed before it. \"Where do you get that <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> stuff?\" snarled Mr. Jones. Obadiah turned towards the clock as if to place the blame for any misstatements of time upon that instrument. The hands pointed to five minutes past nine thereby also indicating their owner to be a liar. Again Mr. Jones spoke.

After two nights of troubled thought, Barry Lapelle had hit upon an extraordinary means to circumvent Rachel Gwyn. With Machiavellian cunning he had devised a way to make Viola his wife without jeopardizing her or his own prospects for the future.

No houses or shelters are provided for these geese but some yards are somewhat wooded which affords a measure of protection from the wind. _Feeding._ When the geese are placed in the fattening lots, some fatteners prefer to fast the geese for from 3 to 5 days, giving them no feed but plenty of water to drink. This gives them a good appetite and puts them in good shape for fattening. The geese are fed three times a day, in the morning, at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and at night. The morning and night feed usually consists of a moist mixed feed fed in troughs; while the noon feed is whole corn thrown on the ground. The use of one feed of corn a day is supposed to check any tendency toward diarrhoea. In very cold weather some fatteners feed the mixed feed at noon and the corn at night.

And in Stephen there burned the zeal of the real leader. In order to keep up the spirit of the host, which fatigue would tend to lessen, he spoke to them often in stirring words. At morning or <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> or evening when they halted or encamped and also while they marched, he leaned often from his chariot and spoke encouraging words. Sometimes they thronged around him so closely when he spoke that it was hard work for his guards to protect him from the consequences of their weak homage and as they pushed forward to be near him, many of the weak and small were crushed to death. The veneration for the Boy Prophet was carried to such an extent that all vied with each other to procure...", "...message to my dear-- A thousand leagues and more to her-- The dumb sea-levels thrilled to hear, And Lost Atlantis bore to her.

Ross pushed his cap back and looked up. In the sunshine, his back against a warm rock, his feet buried in the dry loam and pine needles, sat Leslie Jones. He had eaten his dinner and wandered along the trail until he had found a warm spot in which to spend the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour. Ross promptly climbed the steep mountainside and dropped down beside him. \"The McKenzies say,\" began Leslie curiously, \"that you don't stop work long enough to eat and sleep. Yet here you are two miles from home in the middle of the day.\" \"It's because of what the McKenzies have said that I'm here now,\" Ross returned swiftly. \"It may not be worth a picayune to you, and then again, maybe, it will be,\" and he related the events of the previous evening.

But it would take more than all this to delay us now when we are so near the English shores. If we leave Amiens early enough we may catch the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Channel boat--we ought to cover the ninety miles to Boulogne in three or four hours. But we find the main road to Abbeville closed and lose our way twice, which, with two deflated tires, puts our plan out of question. Much of the road is distressingly rough and there are many \"canivaux\" to slacken our speed. We soon decide to take matters easily and cross the Channel on the late afternoon boat. The picturesque old town of Abbeville was one of John Ruskin's favorite sketching...", "...Summersby was a very small man. It was an unwonted sensation, the most satisfying he had ever experienced. He looked at them out there, as they lay watching Mrs. Full and Adam mowing down Cal and Villa with imaginary Brownings. He grinned, felt his lips curve in the unaccustomed grimace, and thought with no particular bitterness that he was getting mellow in his last days. \"Hello, High-pockets,\" he said softly to the kid that owned him. \"How's the weather up there?\" At five to <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the door opened. Summersby, seeing its silent motion, left off the mimic gunplay and started for the wall, where he could intercept Watkins and find out whether he'd been successful. But the safe-cracker came running down the middle of the room, yelling. \"Come on, everybody!\" \"Come on?\" The two giant children were on their feet, uncertain of what was happening. Obviously they didn't realize Watkins had been out of the room at all. \"The adults spotted me!\" roared the...", "...lawful wife, Gurth Egerton, and you can say good-bye to my money, old fellow. Better luck next time.' With which compliment Ralph tossed off the brandy, and rolled his eyes about more wildly than ever. Gurth Egerton bit his lip and turned his face away lest Ralph should see how white it was. He was convinced that the drunkard spoke the truth, and he saw that his hopes were shattered. Ralph was married, and he would have children. Much in Gertie's conduct lately was clear as the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to him now, and he understood why lately she had kept out of the way when the men were about. His worst fears were realized. Ralph Egerton had swept fortune from him just as it seemed within his grasp. The pair sat in silence for full five minutes. In those five minutes a daring scheme had matured itself in the brain of the one. 'Ralph, old boy,' said Gurth, 'shake hands. I'm sorry we've quarrelled.

When they had reached a part of the country where such a precaution became necessary, the carts being regularly arranged for defending the camp, guard was mounted at eight o'clock, consisting of three men, who were relieved every two hours; the morning watch being horse guard for the day. At daybreak, the camp was roused, the animals turned loose to graze, and breakfast generally over between six and seven o'clock, when they resumed their march, making regularly a halt at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for one or two hours. Such was usually the order of the day, except when accident of country forced a variation, which, however, happened but rarely. They reached the ford of the Kansas late in the afternoon of the 14th, where the river was two hundred and thirty yards wide, and commenced immediately preparations for crossing. The river had been swollen by the late rains, and was sweeping by with an angry current, yellow and turbid as the Missouri. Up to this point, the road...", "...of the more famous epics of the world--since Mathilde had to create the mould of art into which she poured her story. For who had thought before her of making women's stitches write or paint a great historical event, crowded with homely details which now are dubbed archaeological veracities?

The history of Bayeux is commonly given in a paragraph. Our morning's walk had proved to us it was the kind of town that does more to re-create the historic past than all the pages of a Guizot or a Challamel. The bells that were ringing out the hour of high-noon from the cathedral towers at Bayeux were making the heights of St. Lo, two hours later, as noisy as a village fair. The bells, for rivals, had the clatter of women's tongues. I think I never, before or since, have...", "...what he did, he questioned him. The creature's family was scattered on the mountain-sides; he could give Rowland no help to find them. Rowland climbed into many awkward places, and skirted, intently and peeringly, many an ugly chasm and steep-dropping ledge. But the sun, as I have said, was everywhere; it illumined the deep places over which, not knowing where to turn next, he halted and lingered, and showed him nothing but the stony Alpine void--nothing so human even as death. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he paused in his quest and sat down on a stone; the conviction was pressing upon him that the worst that was now possible was true. He suspended his search; he was afraid to go on. He sat there for an hour, sick to the depths of his soul. Without his knowing why, several things, chiefly trivial, that had happened during the last two years and that he had quite forgotten, became vividly present to his mind. He was aroused at last by the sound of a stone dislodged near by, which...", "...a little over half a mile, and now it settled, rather than fell, into the river, with a gentle descent.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Thursday (December 12, 1901), Marconi sat waiting, a telephone receiver at his ear, in a room of the old barracks on Signal Hill. To him it must have been a moment of painful stress and expectation. Arranged on the table before him, all its parts within easy reach of his hand, was the delicate receiving instrument, the supreme product of years of the inventor's life, now to be submitted to a decisive test. A wire ran out through the window, thence to a pole, thence upward to...", "...Confederates in arms between us and New Orleans but the country was full of men who had broken all laws and who held any human life very cheap, when money was at stake. How to send home the money the soldiers could spare was a very important question. In a chapter printed elsewhere in this book, entitled \"How the Pay of the Regiment was Carried to New Orleans by Lieutenant Henry Hill Goodell,\" it will be told how it was accomplished. On May 21st we received marching orders and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we embarked on board the little steamer Empire Parish along with the One Hundred and Fifty-ninth New York and the Thirteenth Connecticut. I wonder if anyone can imagine how crowded we were, also taking into consideration that a good many of the soldiers were inclined to be troublesome. Colonel Bissell was taken quite sick at about this time and had to find a place to lie down. Soon after 3 P.M., while the rest of the boats were being loaded we shipped from the dock and away up the...", "...Then it would have suspended him the next morning and expelled him a few days later.

He thought about this, deep down in his soul, all the rest of the morning. When <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came he was as much as ever at a loss how to proceed. One of the worst features of the case, as he thought about it, was this: \"Dodd\" had been going to school to him now a year and a half, and he had begun to think that he had a permanent hold upon the boy. But here it was again, back in the same old notch, and as bad as ever. It does take so long to make anything permanent in the way of character! You have found it so yourself, haven't you, beloved? In your own case, I...", "...patience and self-denial. The wonderful transformation of her face showed him what this day was to her life, and he resolved that no disappointment of his own should come between her and her triumph. To Gilbert the way was not too long, nor the progress too slow. It gave him time to grow familiar, not only with the fact, but with his duty. He forcibly postponed his wandering conjectures, and compelled his mind to dwell upon that which lay immediately before him.

He recalled, with the approval of an aristocrat in taste, the daintiness of her movements, the delicacy of her hands as they lay open on the fence, even her indifference to him, to him, who was in no wise accustomed to indifference in women. At twilight he went to the Chestnut Ridge, but Katrine was not there, nor did she come. The following day he went again with a similar resulting. The third day he saw her about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the river-bank, and she waved her hand to him in a cavalier fashion, disappearing into a small copse of dogwood, not to reappear. The thing had become amusing. During this time he saw neither Dermott McDermott nor the new overseer, whom he learned was at Marlton on affairs concerning a sawmill. The fourth day after his meeting with Katrine a message from the great doctor gave him the dignity of a mission, and he rode to the old lodge to show her the letter, which said that...", "...spread Watches with eyes unshut?

When he came to the Elgeria trail he was not disappointed to find it smooth, untrodden by any recent travel. Half a mile farther on through the forest, however, he encountered tracks of three horses, made early the day before. Still farther on he found cattle and horse tracks, now growing old and dim. These tracks, pointed toward Elgeria, were like words of a printed page to Wade. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he climbed a rocky eminence that jutted out from a slow-descending ridge, and from this vantage-point he saw down the wavering black and green bosom of the mountain slope.

Before my comrade and I fell asleep, we had some conversation about the good humour of our landlord, which gave Strap such an idea of his benevolence, that he positively believed we should pay nothing for our lodging and entertainment. \"Don't you observe,\" said he, \"that he has conceived a particular affection for us--nay, even treated us at supper...", "...of the wilderness.[1] [Footnote 1: To get the local descriptions, the color, atmosphere, \"feel\" of a day and a country so long gone by, any writer of to-day must go to writers of another day.

Wingate's outriders moved out before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of one day, intending to locate camp at the ford of the Big Vermilion. Four miles in advance they unexpectedly met the scout of the Missouri column, Bill Jackson, who had passed the Wingate train by a cut-off of his own on a solitary ride ahead for sake of information. He was at a gallop now, and what he said sent them all back at full speed to the head of the Wingate column. Jackson riding ahead, came up with his hand raised for a halt. \"My God, Cap'n, stop the train!\" he...", "...had told his wife about the matter. \"It was like the shop in the evening when I've got a job of work done and the boy has gone home,\" he had said. The harness maker looked out through the open door of his shop and saw Tom Butterworth and Steve Hunter going along Main Street, engaged in earnest conversation. Steve had a cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth and Tom had on a fancy vest. He thought again of the money he had lost in the plant-setting machine venture and was furious. The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour was spoiled and he was almost glad when Jim came back from his mid-day meal. The position in which he found himself in the shop amused Jim Gibson. He chuckled to himself as he waited on the customers who came in, and as he worked at the bench. One day when he came back along Main Street from the noon meal, he decided to try an experiment. \"If I lose my job what difference does it make?\" he asked himself. He stopped at a saloon and had a drink of whisky. When he got to the...", "...arrow had struck the shoulder blade, which saved the vitals.

Staits and Jephson were both very ill of fever, and I was a prematurely old man of ninety in strength and appearance and just able to walk at this time about one hundred yards. Captain Nelson and Surgeon Parke therefore superintended the work of transporting the Expedition across the Semliki. At two o'clock in the afternoon, while the ferrying was briskly proceeding, a body of fifty of the Wara Sura stole up to within 250 yards of the...", "...yes. It could do no harm. He knew it could do no good. They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but the damage had been done. Could a broken bowl be mended and called whole? It might be called whole, but what of it? Was it not broken and mended? He wrote and intimated that he would come. On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to remind him of the engagement. Lester listened curiously to the sound of his voice. \"All right,\" he said, \"I'll be with you.\" At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again. Robert was thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer. His eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either side. His manner was quick, keen, dynamic. Lester was noticeably of another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent. Men spoke of Lester these days as a little hard. Robert's keen blue eyes did not disturb...", "...party started away from Yucca with Min Peters ahead and Pedro bringing up the rear with his burros. Although the ponies could travel at a much faster pace than the pack animals, the latter at their steady pace would overtake the cavalcade of riders before the day was done. The road they struck into after leaving town was a pretty good wagon trail and the riding was easy. There was an occasional ranch-house at which the occupants showed considerable interest in the tourists. But before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they had ridden into the foothills and Min told them that thereafter dwellings would be few and far between. \"'Ceptin' where there's a town.

It was a beautiful day, and the boys enjoyed the scenery as much as if they had never seen it before. \"I hope we can make a good connection for Cedarville,\" said Sam as they left the train and started for the dock from which the _Golden Star_ made her trips on the lake. But they were doomed to disappointment, the steamboat had had a break-down and would be delayed two hours or more.

I just lay down on the bed and fell into a kind of stupor. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and I had had no food offered me since the sandwiches our friends brought us in the courtroom at noon the day before. The doctor came and examined my heart. Then he examined my lame foot. It had a long blue bruise above the ankle, where they had knocked me as they took me across the night {199} before. He asked me what caused' the bruise. I said, \"Those fiends when they dragged me to the cell last night.\" It was paining me.

And then came the marvelous news that they were to board a special car and speed away to the real mountains. So weary was Jeanne, by the time she reached that car, that she crept beneath the blankets in her berth and did not awaken until the morning sun and the green hills of Kentucky greeted her eyes. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of that same day Jeanne found herself seated on a great rock at the foot of Big Black Mountain. She was dressed in boys' unionalls. Her feet were bare. On her head, slouched down about her ears, she wore an old straw hat. Gripped in both hands was a fishing rod made from the branch of a chestnut tree. She was fishing, fishing joyously for \"green perch.\" What mattered it that a movie camera was clicking across the stream, or that the villain of the movie tried in vain to talk to her...", "...of any spot. In general, where the luminous and heating rays are most abundant, the proportion of chemical rays is least; and, in fact, the two seem antagonistic to each other. Thus, near the equator, the luminous and calorific rays being most powerful, the chemical are feeble, as is shown by the length of time required for the production of photographic pictures. Hence, also, June and July are the worst months for the practice of photography, and better results are obtained before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> than after. It is precisely for a similar reason that the combustion of an ordinary fire, being strictly a chemical change, is retarded whenever the sun's heating and luminous rays are most powerful, as during bright {440} sunshine, and that observe our fires to burn more briskly in summer than winter; in fact, that apparently \"the sun's rays put out the fire.\" A.

The mornings broke cool and breezy, but, as a rule, at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the clouds which had sailed eastward singly began to gather in compact banks. Then would come a roll of thunder and a deluge that might last an hour, after which the prairie lay bright in the sunshine until evening fell. The grass rippled across the waste in waves of vivid green, with flowers tossing beneath the gusts like wreaths of colored foam. Wild barley raised its spiky heads along the trails, and in the hollows the natural hay grew rank and tall. No sand blew from the bare...", "...resumed their sway, and General Sir Archibald Hunter straightened out the limp backbone of the army, and made soldierly preparations to welcome the relief column. There were cleansings and polishings, washings and brushings up, of a ramshackle kind, it is true, but they savoured of the old parade days returned. Poor skeletons of horses were groomed down, Sunday best was smoothed out, everything was done that the slender resources of the melancholy perimeter would allow. Shortly after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the 3rd of March Sir Redvers Buller made his formal entry. His arrival was somewhat unexpected, and there was little effervescent demonstration. Sir George White and Sir Redvers Buller meeting with a handclasp, said at first little more than the familiar \"D'ye do?\" of saunterers in Piccadilly. What else could be done?

And there amongst the showers of reddening vine leaves, she had helped to gather the last grapes of the year, with song and jest and laughter. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they climbed the hill again in the October sun, and dined upon the remains of the previous day's feast; then, singing still, they had started on their homeward downward way, happy and not half tired yet when they reached Subiaco in the evening glow.

Her nights of anxiety and watching had left their traces upon her face; her usually light and elastic step was feeble and slow, and she rested heavily upon the arm of her husband.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it was very warm and bright, but before we returned from the funeral it was cloudy and cold. The next day Mrs. B. was quite sick with severe cold, and the effects of the past excitement and grief. We flattered ourselves that rest and quiet, with good nursing, would soon restore her; and you may judge of our dismay upon learning, the day after, that she was dangerously ill. \"Oh no,\" we thought and said a hundred times, \"it cannot be so; she will surely be better...", "...'t to thee, O unforgotten Friend!

The house-wife, whose heart was touched by a sight of An-dre's youth and look of grief, asked him to draw near and take some of the food. Then as she caught sight of his gold-laced coat, the good dame said that she knew it was poor fare for such as he, but it was the best she had.

Happily they did not come on, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we were able to bring back that part of the army which had crossed the river. Our generals held a council of war, and it became known that the sad hour had arrived when we must sue for terms with the enemy, or undergo all the dangers of an assault with the certainty of being defeated at last. With feelings of sorrow and regret we saw the flag of truce depart. We waited the result with anxiety.

We kept as close as we could to the main shore, but having to cross some bays, it became a matter of doubt whether we had not left the main, and were running along an island.

The snow, which had begun falling the day before, had continued all night with such rigorous, relentless persistence that by the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour the whole city was sheeted with a soft white blanket that spread abroad a solemn stillness. The rolling wheels of the few vehicles in the streets were noiseless, and the sharp ring and clatter of horses' hoofs became a dull muffled tramp.

To be sure, he could not remember that an exaggerated estimate of the Great West had ever been a vagary of his own youth. But then, he supposed that the West had made advances since his day! A glance at his watch changed the direction of his thoughts, and a few minutes later Vittorio was rowing him swiftly, with the tide, up the Grand Canal. Just as the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> gun roared out from the base of San Giorgio, the Colonel rang the bell of the Palazzo Darino. She was sitting, the lady of his evening reverie, the lady of a life-long reverie, one might as truly say, just as he had hoped to find her, alone and disengaged. Two or three open letters lay upon the table beside her, but they lay there meekly, as if they knew that they must bide their time. \"Ah! Colonel Steele!\" She spoke his name as no one else had ever done, somehow as if it...", "...are not _exact_. To set a post of any kind, with great precision, perpendicular to the horizon, would require very expensive mathematical instruments, and very laborious and nice observations. Then, again, if the clock had been exact, and the post perfectly upright, Jonas could not have marked the place of the shadow exactly. The shadow has not an exact and well-defined edge; and then, even while he was marking at one end, the shadow would be moving along at the other end, and so his <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> mark would not be exactly straight.\" \"Why, father, he could make the mark right along quick.\" \"No matter how quick he might make it.

They don't know anything about our barrel of water.\" \"Blessed barrel!\" ejaculated Paul. It seemed that Henry was right in his prediction. As long hours passed, the sun rose higher and higher, and it grew very close in the little cabin. Paul thought the warriors must have gone away, disgusted with their losses, but Henry cautioned him against savage patience. Toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they ate a little more of their pigeon and dried venison, and Paul looked with some dismay at the small portions that were left. \"Henry,\" he exclaimed, \"there is enough for supper, and no more.\" \"Just so,\" said Henry, \"and our enemies remain on guard. They'll wait for us.\" He thought it best to put the case plainly and in all its hideous phases to Paul. While savages sometimes abandoned a siege very soon, they did not show signs of ceasing now. Perhaps they relied on...", "...Boy_ slipped past Mother Burke in fair weather an' run into a dirty gale from the north off the upper French shore.

This puts him in a good-humour, and you may learn something about this critical affair from his own mouth.\" I must confess that the thought of passing midnight in the church alone with Berthold made me shudder a little, now I had read his history. I thought that there might be a little of the devil in him in spite of his good-humour and frank deportment; and I chose rather to be in his company that very <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> in the clear sunlight. I found him upon the scaffold, reserved and in an ill-humour, painting the veins of marble. Climbing up to him, I reached him the pots, while he stared at me with amazement. \"I am your helpmate,\" said I softly, and this drew a smile from him.

Giv's the mate, ye haythen! giv's the mate, domyersool!\" The cook shrank back before their gleaming eyes and threatening fists, and they crowded into the galley, where, as fate determined, the mild little steward was gathering up the cabin dinner. He seized his brick. \"Now, here, you men,\" he said, bravely, \"you get right out of this galley.

They were in time for the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> guard-mounting, however, and Mrs. March said that the way the retiring squad kicked their legs out in the high martial step of the German soldiers was a perfect expression of the insolent militarism of their empire, and was of itself enough to make one thank Heaven that one was an American and a republican. She softened a little toward their system when it proved that the garden of the palace was still open, and yet more when she sank down upon a bench between two marble groups...", "...of that ultimate prospect, that the wealth already thus obtained was religiously expended in engines and machinery for the boring of wells and the conveyance of that precious water which the exhausted river had long since ceased to yield.

Such was the position of affairs at Devil's Ford on the 13th of August, 1860. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of a hot day. Whatever movement there was in the stifling air was seen rather than felt in a tremulous, quivering, upward-moving dust along the flank of the mountain, through which the spires of the pines were faintly visible.

A tall man of distinguished appearance, still in the prime of life, and bearing a close resemblance to Bob, entered the room. He glanced inquiringly at the boys. \"Something gone wrong?\" he asked. \"What's the trouble?\" \"Hello, Dad.\" \"Hello, Uncle George.\" It was Mr. Temple, Bob's father and Frank's guardian, and there was relief in the boys' voices as they greeted him.

Thereupon he proceeded to relate what had occurred. Mr. Temple listened in silence. His face showed he was disturbed. At the conclusion of Bob's recital, he walked over to a...", "...visiting Tahaiti at this season, to run into the harbour, which lies eight miles west of Venus Point. It is spacious, formed by coral reefs, protected against all winds, and has two entrances so convenient, that ships may sail either in or out with almost any wind.

The rise and fall is very inconsiderable.

Luis kept close to Isabel; and her lovely face and merry chatter beguiled him from all other observations. A little before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they halted in a beautiful wood; a tent was spread for the ladies, the animals were loosened from their harness, and a luxurious meal laid upon the grass. Then the siesta was taken, and at three o'clock travel was resumed until near sunset, when the camp was made for the night. The same order was followed every day, and the journey was in every sense an easy and delightful one. The rides, cheered by pleasant companionship, were not fatiguing; the impromptu meals were keenly...", "...kingdoms accounted it as a special honor to themselves if they had possessions in the Holy Land. This mountain was divided among four kingdoms, and each kingdom had a special name for its parts.

To this mountain, upon God's command, Moses betook himself at noon of the day on which he died. On this occasion, as upon two others, God had His commands executed at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to show mankind that they could not hinder the execution of God's orders, even if they chose to do so.

In the gorge we stopped to take a light meal of gingerbread horses--a cake that is the peculiar glory of the _habitant_--dried herrings and sea biscuits. By the sun, I knew it was long past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and that we had been traveling northwest. I also vaguely guessed that Paul's object was to intercept the North-West trappers, if they had planned to slip away from the St. Lawrence through the bush to the Upper Ottawa, where they could meet north-bound boats.

On the 23d, at ten o'clock in the morning, land was seen from the top-mast head, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> from the deck, extending from S. by W. to S.W. by S. We hauled up for it with the wind at S.E., and found it to consist of two or three small islets, connected together by breakers like most of the low isles in the sea, lying in a triangular form, and about six leagues in circuit. They were clothed with wood, among which were many cocoa-nut trees. We saw no people, or signs of inhabitants; and had reason to think there were none. The situation of this isle, which is in the latitude...", "...precipices on either side, through which the turbid and rapid Visp tears along at a furious rate, boiling and leaping in foam over its rocky bed, and nearly as large as the Rhone at the junction.

This gave rise to no suspicion, and in the excitement of digging was quite forgotten. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I contrived to have a damper and a large joint of baked mutton ready for the \"day labourers,\" as they styled themselves. The mutton was baked in a large camp oven suspended from three iron bars, which were fixed in the ground in the form of a triangle, about a yard apart, and were joined together at the top, at which part the oven was hung over a wood fire. This grand cooking machine was, of course, outside the tent.

The gentleman who was feeding and caring for them seemed pleased at my interest, leaned over the fence and conversed with new about them, telling where he had discovered some, how costly...", "...'I pitied him also,' said Sir Richard. '\"After the spur, corn,\" said De Aquila, and he threw Fulke three wedges of gold that he had taken from our little chest by the bed-place. '\"If I had known this,\" said Fulke, catching his breath, \"I would never have lifted hand against Pevensey. Only lack of this yellow stuff has made me so unlucky in my dealings.\" 'It was dawn then, and they stirred in the Great Hall below. We sent down Fulke's mail to be scoured, and when he rode away at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> under his own and the King's banner very splendid and stately did he show. He smoothed his long beard, and called his son to his stirrup and kissed him. De Aquila rode with him as far as the New Mill landward. We thought the night had been all a dream.' 'But did he make it right with the King?' Dan asked. 'About your not being traitors, I mean?' Sir Richard smiled. 'The King sent no second summons to Pevensey, nor did he ask why De Aquila had not obeyed the first. Yes, that...", "...them into an uproar of hideous, maimed noises, and a tangle of harness chains, while Salty would sit on the high seat with the sun glare heavy in his eyes, dealing out curses of pacification in a level, uninterested voice until the clamor fell off from sheer exhaustion. There was a line of shallow graves' along that road; they used to count on dropping a man or two of every new gang of coolies brought out in the hot season. But when he lost his swamper, smitten without warning at the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> halt, Salty quit his job; he said it was \"too durn hot.\" The swamper he buried by the way with stones upon him to keep the coyotes from digging him up, and seven years later I read the penciled lines on the pine headboard, still bright and unweathered. But before that, driving up on the Mojave stage, I met Salty again crossing Indian Wells, his face from the high seat, tanned and ruddy as a harvest moon, looming through the golden dust above his eighteen mules. The land had...", "...ran down the walk again. \"You'll see him come by here to-morrow, if it quits raining,\" returned Helen, over her shoulder. But it did not stop raining that night, nor for a full week. The scuds of rain, blowing across the river, slapped sharply against the side of the house, and against Ruth's window all night. She did not sleep that first night as well as she had in the charitable home of the station master and his good wife. The evening meal had been as stiff and unpleasant as the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal. The evening was spent in the same room-- the kitchen. Aunt Alviry knitted and sewed; Uncle Jabez pored over certain accounts and counted money very softly behind the uplifted cover of the japanned cash-box that he had brought in from the mill. She got in time to know that cash-box very well indeed. It often came into the house under Uncle Jabez's arm at dinner, too. He scarcely seemed willing to trust it out of his sight. And Ruth was sure that he locked himself into his...", "...of the various requirements of the trip. Everything comes handy to them. They put the boat in shape, run the engine, do carpentry and any other trade that is needed. It was hard to guide the unwieldy boat so they designed a rudder, went to town for material, hunted up a blacksmith and showed him what they wanted, and put the rudder together and hung it in good shape. It has a tiller up on the roof, whence the steersman can see ahead. We secured some food at Morris, with difficulty. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the rudder was hung and we were off for Seneca, the boy happy in charge of the tiller. We wish we were a word painter, to describe the beauty of the scenery along the canal. The water has lost all reminiscence of Chicago's drainage. At 3 p. m. we stopped at a farm and obtained milk, eggs and chickens, with half a bushel of apples for good measure. The boat excites much interest among the farmers. At Morris we had our first call upon the drugs, the boys finding a friend whose horse...", "...of grass, nodded its little head as well as it could, and slept peacefully and sweetly. The fly was dead. \"Poor little Ephemera!\" said the oak; \"what a short life!\" And so on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions were asked and the same answers given, and there was the same peaceful falling asleep at sunset. This continued through many generations of Ephemeras, and all of them felt merry and happy. The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of summer, and the evening of autumn; its time of rest, its night, drew near--its winter was coming. Here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf. Already the storms were singing: \"Good night, good night. We will rock you and lull you. Go to sleep, go to sleep. We will sing you to sleep, and shake you to sleep, and it will do your old twigs good; they will even crackle with pleasure. Sleep sweetly, sleep sweetly, it is your three hundred and sixty-fifth night. You are still very young...", "...of mind in which I determined to go, at any risk, to Vaucluse. Now that I think it over, I seem to remember that I had hoped, after all, that the submersion of the roads would forbid it. Since morning the clouds had gathered again, and by noon they were so heavy that there was every prospect of a torrent. It appeared absurd to choose such a time as this to visit a fountain - a fountain which, would be indistinguishable in the general cataract. Nevertheless I took a vow that if at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the rain should not have begun to descend upon Avignon I would repair to the head-spring of the Sorgues. When the critical moment arrived, the clouds were hanging over Avignon like distended water-bags, which only needed a prick to empty themselves. The prick was not given, however; all nature was too much occupied in following the aberration of the Rhone to think of playing tricks elsewhere. Accordingly, I started for the station in a spirit which, for a tourist who...", "...more substantial things than ghosts at Chicago, and they might look on you as an escaped lunatic. Nathless, it was a pretty idea to promulgate among the Indians two centuries ago. Observe how civilization has changed. Two hundred years ago we sent missionaries among them: now we send soldiers to shoot them down, after we have plundered them of their lands.\" Neither of us were disposed to discuss the Indian question with Hugh Warren, and the conversation dropped after a while. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the next day the steamer made Milwaukee, and the evening of the day after Chicago. These two cities are excellent types of the Western city, and both show, in a wonderful degree, the rapid growth of towns in the great West. Neither had an inhabitant before 1825, and now one has a population of one hundred thousand, and the other of five hundred thousand. Chicago is, in fact, a wonder of the world. Its unparalleled growth, its phoenix-like rise from the devastation of the great...", "...to perform, first in locating the runaways and then in persuading them to return to Oak Hall to face the music. He had an early breakfast, Roger eating with him, and then the buggy, driven by Horsehair, was brought around and he got in, and a minute later he was off, the senator's son waving him an adieu from the porch of the school. Dave found the first train he rode on but half filled with passengers, and he had a double seat to himself. He changed at the Junction, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> reached Lumberport, where he was to take the train on the little side-line for Camptown Falls. At Lumberport he got dinner, at a hotel frequented by lumbermen. He sat at a long table with half a dozen men and listened to their talk with interest when he heard Camptown Falls mentioned. \"Yes, they tell me there is great danger of the dam giving way just above Camptown Falls,\" one of the men said. \"Doxey reported it hasn't been safe for a week.\" \"Say, if that dam gave way it...", "...with me and asked where I was staying. \"Nowhere,\" said I; \"I came from Zurich on foot, and my first visit was to your church.\" I do not know whether I pronounced these words with an air of compunction, but the abbot joined his hands and lifted them to heaven, as if to thank God for touching my heart and bringing me there to lay down the burden of my sins. I have no doubt that these were his thoughts, as I have always had the look of a great sinner. The abbot said it was near <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and that he hoped I would do him the honour of dining with him, and I accepted with pleasure, for I had had nothing to eat and I knew that there is usually good cheer in such places. I did not know where I was and I did not care to ask, being willing to leave him under the impression that I was a pilgrim come to expiate my sins. On our way from the church the abbot told me that his monks were fasting, but that we should eat meat in virtue of a dispensation he had received from...", "...cordial reply to the man who had thus 'with friendly hand struck the balance of his existence'; averring that he too dated a new epoch from their meeting in Jena; expressing the hope that they might soon find opportunity for a further interchange of views and that, having mutually cleared up their past course of thinking, they might proceed on their way together. A few weeks later Schiller spent two weeks as Goethe's guest in Weimar, where long discussions, spun out on one occasion from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to midnight, begot a perfect understanding and laid the foundation of a lifelong friendship. It was a friendship based upon mutual respect and mutual need, full of high advantage on both sides and cherished loyally to the end. Between then and now many and many a writer has compared Goethe with Schiller and undertaken to reckon up the balance of their respective merit. The task is not easy, even though the world is now well agreed that Goethe's was the rarer genius. No doubt he,...", "...As very few among them know what a watch is, and as they conceive, but imperfectly the duration of an hour, they usually determine time almost as when we say, it happened about noon, about evening, &c. The moment when the Sun disappears is called _Maggrib_, about two hours afterwards they call it _El ascha_; two hours later, _El maerfa_; midnight _Nus el lejl_: the dawn of morning _El fadsjer_: sun rise _Es subhh_. They eat about nine in the morning, and that meal is called _El ghadda_; <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> _El duhhr_; three hours after noon _El asr_. Of all these divisions of time only noon and midnight are well ascertained; they both fall upon the twelfth hour. The others are earlier or later as the days are short or long. The five hours appointed for prayer are _Maggrib, Nus el lejl, El fedsjer, Duhhr_, and _El asr_. _Niebuhr.

But it is afternoon and I must reckon half way backward. Notice,--I point the hour hand at a fraction before seven. Now divide the distance between that point and the figure 12 into halves and take the midway point: there you are--that indicates south.\" \"Suppose the sun wasn't shining, Jack?\" \"If the clouds were too dense to allow you to locate the sun, your watch would be useless as a compass, but that isn't often the case.

The nymph led her son to the prophet's cave, and concealed him among the recesses of the rocks, while she herself took her place behind the clouds. Then <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came and the hour when men and herds retreat from the glaring sun to indulge in quiet slumber, Proteus issued from the water, followed hy his herd of sea- calves, which spread themselves along the shore. He sat on the rock and counted his herd; then stretched himself on the floor of the cave and went to sleep. Aristaeus hardly allowed him to get fairly asleep before he fixed the fetters on him and shouted aloud. Proteus, waking and finding himself captured, immediately...", "...Spring was already forcing into bloom the flowers, and urging the trees to greater activity, as regards the tender green leaves, there came an almost overpowering desire to toss aside books and papers, and get out where the smell of the brown earth mingled with the perfume of growing vegetation. The teachers, doubtless, found it difficult also, for the call of nature manifested itself to them, and the girls and boys, rather selfishly, did not make it as easy as they might. The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> recess again brought the four friends together, and Betty showed a tentative program she had surreptitiously scribbled during a study period. It contained the names of towns, with the available relatives of the girls set down opposite each one, and a rough calculation of the time required to walk from one place to the other. \"It seems as if we ought to start at once,\" exclaimed Mollie. \"Aren't you just dying to go, Amy?\" \"I am--yes.\" There was hesitation in the tones....", "...the Saxon coats of arms, rose amid the leafy tops of the lindens, and floated from tall poles in the sunny May air. The blue and yellow Saxon flag, with the black and yellow chevron in the field and a lozenged chaplet from the left corner to the top, was more frequently seen than any other banner. Even though this festival was held for Duke Maurice, no one could fail to notice how much more space was given to his escutcheon than to the Emperor's. The entertainment had opened at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> with a tournament and riding at the ring. The duke had participated in the sport a short time, and carried off several rings on his sword while in full career. The Emperor had held aloof from this game, in which he had formerly joined gladly and with much skill, but, on the other hand, he had promised to appear at the festival under the lindens, which was to last until night. The Council had had a magnificent tent erected for him, Duke Maurice, and the court, and in order to...", "...that they would have to leave the section. There came a time, all too soon, when a \"Blighty\" was the finest present a man could get; the loss of a few fingers or even a hand or foot being considered not too high a price to pay to get out of hell for a few months. When the weather was very bad there was but little sniping-going on, so we often went in and out of the lines \"overland\" in broad daylight. Sunday, November fourteenth, was one such occasion. We had not been relieved until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> by the Twentieth Battalion who had taken a very roundabout way to get in, so I put it up to all my crowd to choose whether we should spend several hours going around or take a chance down the open road. They unanimously decided on the road, so I started out ahead, with instructions for them to follow at about fifty-yard intervals, and in this fashion we walked down at least four hundred yards of open road, every foot of which was in plain sight of the German lines, and got under...", "...him by water to the Wardrobe with me, and there we found my Lord newly gone away with the Duke of Ormond and some others, whom he had had to the collation; and so we, with the rest of the servants in the hall, sat down and eat of the best cold meats that ever I eat on in all my life.

In an instant I was at Marsac's side. But before I could utter a word, \"What the devil does this mean?\" he asked, eyeing me with fierce suspicion. \"It means, monsieur, that there are more Lesperons than one in France. I am the Lesperon who was at Lavedan. If you doubt me, ask this gentleman, who arrested me there last night. Ask him, too, why we have halted here. Ask him, if you will, to show you the letter that you left at Lavedan making an assignation here before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to-day, which letter I received.\" The suspicion faded from Marsac's eyes, and they grew round with wonder as he listened to this prodigious array of evidence. Lesperon looked on in no less amazement, yet I am sure from the manner of his glance that he did not recognize in me the man that had succoured him at Mirepoix. That, after all, was natural enough; for the minds of men in such reduced conditions as had been his upon that night are not prone to receive very clear...", "...act. New excuses for a fresh absence were impossible; and it was with a heart full of anguish that he was compelled to seize an opportunity in the afternoon of the last day of the month, to steal away from Nisida and hasten across the mountains. Oh! what would she think of his absence now?--an absence for which he had not prepared her, and which was not on this occasion justified by any petulance or willfulness on her part? The idea was maddening, but there was no alternative. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the ensuing day when Fernand Wagner, pale and care-worn, again sought that spot on the strand where the rudely constructed cottage stood; but Nisida was not within the hut. He roved along the shore to a considerable distance, and still beheld her not. Terrible alarms now oppressed him. Could she have done some desperate deed to rid herself of an existence whereof she was weary? or had some fatal accident befallen her. From the shore he hastened to the valley; and there, seated...", "...if it now exists, it would be madness to attempt to search for it.

It was toilsome work, as they often had to clear a way with axes through the undergrowth and tangle of creepers. But at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they reached level ground.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of that day, when the members constituting the two branches of the first Congress under the Constitution assembled in the rooms arranged for their sessions in the reconstructed City Hall of New York, there was no quorum in either House.

These sent out one circular letter after another to the...", "...for additional arms and ammunition. At noon the following day, October 31, leaving orders for Doty to follow with the train on his return from the fort, the governor, with Delaware Jim and Hugh Robie, his only companions, started for the Bitter Root valley, and reached Fort Owen in four and a half days, a distance of two hundred and thirty miles. Says the governor of this trip:-- \"The first night we camped on Sun River, having made a distance of some twenty-nine miles from about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to sundown. On the 1st of November we were in the saddle at early dawn, pushed towards Cadotte's Pass, between the Crown Butte and Rattlers, passed by the Bird Tail Rock, crossed the Dearborn, and went into camp four miles before reaching the divide, at a point which was the camp of Lieutenant Grover and Mr. Robie in their winter trip of 1854. This evening a snow came on about an hour before sundown, or we should have crossed the divide that night. The weather in the...", "...upon; the boats were shoved off and the oars resumed. So tired and exhausted were the men, that their oars dipped mechanically into the water, for there was no strength left to be applied; it was not until the next morning at daylight, that they had arrived opposite False Bay, and they had still many miles to pull. The wind in their favour had done almost all--the men could do little or nothing. Encouraged, however, by the sight of land which they knew, they rallied; and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they pulled, exhausted, to the beach at the bottom of Table Bay, near to which were the houses, and the fort protecting the settlers, who had for some few years resided there. They landed close to where a broad rivulet at that season (but a torrent in the winter) poured its stream into the bay.

Then the junior donkey was led forth garlanded with flowers. He had officiated on this occasion now for ten years. This was the great moment when the identity of the most popular girl in the junior class was established for all time, and it was an important moment, because the one selected was generally chosen as Class President the next year.

For this Roland and Sir John were also to change their guns for rifles and hunting knives, pointed as daggers and sharp as razors, which formed part of Sir John's arsenal, and could be suspended from the belt or screwed on the point of the gun like bayonets. From the beginning of the battue it was easy to see that the hunt would be a good one. A roebuck and two hares were killed at once. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> two does, seven roebucks and two foxes had been bagged. They had also seen two boars, but these latter had only shaken their bristles in answer to the heavy balls and made off. Edouard was in the seventh heaven; he had killed a roebuck.

Without any warning the rain showered upon us and we were obliged to remain in our places and let it come down upon us, regardless of results to our clothing. The rain was of short duration, however, and we rather enjoyed the cooling effect. Presently the sun shone in all its glory and in an hour we were once more with dry clothing. This mixed weather continued the whole ten days of our journey. At noon of each day...", "...were summer we would smoke them.\" The sinews were collected for thread. The other reindeer were then butchered, and the meat placed on the racks outside of the tent. CHAPTER XV WATCHING FOR THE REAPPEARANCE OF THE SUN.--THE UPPER RIM FIRST VISIBLE.--THE WHOLE ORB SEEN FROM A HILL.--DAYS OF SUNSHINE AHEAD. I watched the horizon every day towards noon, hoping to see the sun, for the light was getting brighter and brighter. The glow of the hidden sun was so great at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that it looked as if sunrise were going to take place. How disappointed I felt when the glow became less and less, as the unseen sun sank lower without showing itself. Then came to my mind the coast of New Jersey, where in the early morning I had often watched for the appearance of the sun above the horizon, in the long glow that preceded sunrise. One day I saw a golden thread above the snowy horizon. It was the upper rim of the sun. I watched, hoping to see the whole sun. But...", "...was that? a cuckoo?\" At first I can scarcely believe my own senses, the idea of cuckoos calling in the jungles of Afghanistan being about the last thing I should have expected to hear, never having read of travellers hearing them anywhere in Central Asia, nor yet having heard them myself before. But there is no mistake; for ere we pass Kafir Kaleh, I hear the familiar notes again and again. The road is a decided improvement over anything we have struck since leaving Herat, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we arrive at Karize. For some inexplicable reason the Sooltan of Karize receives our party with very ill grace. He looks sick, and is probably suffering from fever, which may account for the evident sourness of his disposition. Mohammed Ahzim Khan is anything but pleased at our reception, and as soon as he receives the receipt for my delivery makes his preparations to return. I don't think the Sooltan even tendered my escort a feed of grain for their horses, a piece of...", "...But that was greatly the management of the man. He was so afraid that something might happen to undo all the wonders accomplished in the Girl, and again whiten her face with pain, that he scarcely allowed her out of his sight. He remained in the cabin, helping when she worked, and then drove with her and a big blanket to the woods, arranged her chair and table, found some attractive subject, and while the wind ravelled her hair and flushed her cheeks, her fingers drew designs. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they went to the cabin to lunch, and the Girl took a nap, while the Harvester spread his morning's reaping on the shelves to dry. They returned to the woods until five o'clock; then home again and the Girl dressed and prepared supper, while the Harvester spread his stores and fed the stock. Then he put on white clothing for the evening. The Girl rested while he washed the dishes, and they explored the lake in the little motor boat, or drove to the city for supplies, or to see...", "...laughed. \"Oh, I know! You are always busy! Will you ever get tired, I wonder?\" I smiled. \"I hope not!\" With that we shook hands and parted, and within the next twenty minutes the steamer had started, bearing me far away from the Isle of Skye, that beautiful, weird and mystic region full of strange legends and memories, which to me had proved a veritable wonderland. I watched the 'Diana' at anchor in the bay of Portree till I could see her no more,--and it was getting on towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when I suddenly noticed the people on board the steamer making a rush to one side of the deck to look at something that was evidently both startling and attractive. I followed the crowd,--and my heart gave a quick throb of delight when I saw poised on the sparkling waters the fairylike 'Dream'!--her sails white as the wings of a swan, and her cordage gleaming like woven gold in the brilliant sunshine. She was a thing of perfect beauty as she seemed to glide on the very edge of the...", "...promised to continue interestin', but somehow this struck me as a swell time for me to quit. So I strolls back to the hotel and goes to bed. Yes, I was some curious to know how the muss ended, but I didn't hurry around next mornin'. As a matter of fact, I'd enjoyed the society of the Sobowskis quite a lot durin' the past two days, and I thought I'd better stay away for a while. They're a strenuous bunch when they're stirred up--even a kittenish young thing like Anna. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I 'phoned the works, and found that all was serene there, with no signs of a strike yet. \"No, and I got a hunch there won't be any, either,\" says I. I was plannin' to linger in Bridgeport another day or so; but when the afternoon paper came out I changed my mind. Accordin' to the police-court reporter's account, there'd been some little disturbance in Warsaw Hall the night before. Seems a stranger by the name of Stukey had butted into a meetin' of the Pulaski Social Club, and...", "...in the next room--all stand out, separate and distinct, indelibly imprinted upon the memory. There is another variety of the same phenomena, seldom commented on, where an entirely unreal impression of the scene as a whole is left on the mind by one or two details. To Dosia, sitting there by the little plot of tulips, the sun was the brilliant sun of July, and those scarlet tulips a garden wide and far-reaching, an endless vista of flowers, the blue sky an endless vault above her--high <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and midsummer, with that sweet-scented warmth at the busy heart of things, a circle of infinite life humming in the low grasses, in the almost windless, hardly stirring air. Warmth and color and life, at high noon, listening close to the heart of things. And Dosia! She had never supposed that any girl could care for a man until he had shown that he cared for her--it was the unmaidenly, impossible thing. And now--how beautiful he was, how dear! A wistful smile trembled around...", "...reserve in the rear, the Mameluke chief extended his lines till his forces seemed to cover the plain. Nor was he sorry to observe that there was a prospect of a stern resistance; for the difficulties of his situation increased his importance in the eyes of his soldiers, and every step he took in overcoming perils, from which others shrank, brought him nearer to the object on which his heart was set--that object being neither more nor less than the throne of the sultans. And now, <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> having come, with horns and kettle-drums sounding an onset, Bibars Bendocdar advanced on the Crusaders, and attacked the Count of Anjou, who was at the head of the camp on the side towards the Nile. At first, the French cavalry calmly abided the assault; but they soon found themselves exposed to a kind of attack which they had not anticipated. In fact, the Saracen infantry, moving forward, overwhelmed the knights with Greek fire, and threw them into confusion. Surcoats and...", "...wholy covered with Snow, whereas it only lies upon these in patches.* (* The highest peak of the Kaikoura Mountains, Mount Tapuaepuka, is 9500 feet high. It is therefore higher than Mount Egmont, but not so high as the Peak of Teneriffe. The snow lies thicker on the western side of New Zealand mountains, so Cook's parallel was fallacious. The Endeavour was now near the Kaikoura Peninsula, where a small town stands at the present day, the shipping port of an agricultural district.) At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> was in the Latitude of 42 degrees 34 minutes South; the Southermost land we had in sight bore South-West 1/2 West, and some low land that made like an Island lying close under the foot of the Ridge North-West by North, distant about 5 or 6 Leagues. Thursday, 15th. In the P.M. 4 Double Canoes, in which were 57 Men, came off to the Ship; they kept at the distance of about a Stone's throw from us, and would not be prevailed upon to put alongside by all that Tupia could say to...", "...smell of the air, produced altogether a most awful and terrifying effect. We were at this time about eight leagues from the foot of the mountain. On the 16th, at day-light, we again weighed anchor, and stood out of the bay; but the ebb tide setting across the passage upon the eastern shore, and the wind falling, we were driven very near the Three Needle Rocks, which lie on that side of the entrance, and obliged to hoist out the boats, in order to tow the ships clear of them. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we were two leagues from the land, and had soundings with forty-three fathoms of line, over a bottom of small stones, of the same kind with those which fell on our decks after the eruption of the _volcano_; but whether they had been, left there by the last, or by some former eruptions, we were not able to determine. The aspect of the country was now very different from what it had been on our first arrival. The snow, excepting what remained on the tops of some very high...", "...the Christian faith. The apologetics are, however, in the first instance poems, and they remain poems at the last. The imaginary scene of the death of the Evangelist John is rendered with the finest art; its dignity is that of a certain noble bareness; in the dim-lighted grotto are the aged disciple and the little group of witnesses to whom he utters his legacy of words; at the cave's edge is the Bactrian crying from time to time his bird-like cry of assurance: Outside was all <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and the burning blue. The slow return of the dying man to consciousness of his surroundings is as true as if it were studied from a death-bed; his sudden awakening at the words \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" arrives not as a dramatic surprise but as the simplest surprise of nature--light breaking forth before sunset. The chief speaker of the poem is chosen because the argument is one concerning faith that comes through love, and St John was the disciple who had learnt...", "...afternoons, racing light sleighs on National Avenue and Tennessee Street; everybody recognized both the trotters and the drivers; and again knew them as well on summer evenings, when slim buggies whizzed by in renewals of the snow-time rivalry. For that matter, everybody knew everybody else's family horse-and-carriage, could identify such a silhouette half a mile down the street, and thereby was sure who was going to market, or to a reception, or coming home from office or store to <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> dinner or evening supper. During the earlier years of this period, elegance of personal appearance was believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping. A silk dress needed no remodelling when it was a year or so old; it remained distinguished by merely remaining silk. Old men and governors wore broadcloth; \"full dress\" was broadcloth with \"doeskin\" trousers; and there were seen men of all ages to whom a hat meant only that rigid, tall silk thing known...", "...well--well enough to hold ordinary conversations--was also a strong asset in my favor. When we started, a few stars were seen between thin clouds, but the light was good. A soft wind came from the south; the temperature was -36 deg. F. The Greenland ice-cap was outlined; a belt of orange in the south heralded the rising sun. The snow still retained the purple of twilight. The ice was covered with about three inches of soft snow over a hard crust, which made speed difficult. Before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the sky was gray, but the light remained good enough for traveling until 4 P. M. A course was made about northwest, because a more direct line was still impractical. A water sky to the west and south denoted open water. At 3 P. M. we ran into bear tracks, and the sledges bounced along as if empty. The tracks were making a good course for us, so the dogs were encouraged. By four o'clock the feeble light made it dangerous to proceed. Two hunters still followed the bear tracks,...", "...of Indians was well illustrated on this eventful trip. It was fresh every morning. They all behaved well, however, exerted themselves under tedious hardships without flinching for days or weeks at a time; never seemed in the least nonplussed; were prompt to act in every exigency; good as servants, fellow travelers, and even friends. We landed on an island in sight of Wrangell and built a big smoky signal fire for friends in town, then set sail, unfurled our flag, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> completed our long journey of seven or eight hundred miles. As we approached the town, a large canoeful of friendly Indians came flying out to meet us, cheering and handshaking in lusty Boston fashion. The friends of Mr. Young had intended to come out in a body to welcome him back, but had not had time to complete their arrangements before we landed. Mr. Young was eager for news. I told him there could be no news of importance about a town. We only had real news, drawn from the...", "...were moving about him, carrying the wounded or helping with the camp, but they were only misty forms in the white gloom. Looking again toward the east he saw a silver bar appear just below the horizon. He knew it was the bright vanguard that heralded the coming sun, and his imaginative, susceptible mind beheld in it once more an omen. It beckoned him toward the east, and hope rose strong in his heart. \"Wharton,\" he said, \"I suppose we'll stay awhile in Chastel.\" \"So I hear. Until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at least.\" \"Then you wake me three hours from now. It will be enough sleep at such a time, and I want to be up when Lannes comes. You promise?\" \"Certainly, Scott, I'll do it, though you'll probably swear at me for bothering you. Still, I'm ready to do any unpleasant duty for a friend when he asks it.\" John laughed, went into the tent, rolled himself in the blankets and in a minute was fast asleep. In another minute, as it seemed, Wharton was pulling vigorously at his...", "...At some ports, no doubt, the tide is high when the moon is on the meridian. In that case, of course, the high water is under the moon, as apparently ought to be the case invariably, on a superficial view. But, on the other hand, there are ports where there is often low water when the moon is crossing the meridian. Yet other ports might be cited in which every intermediate phase could be observed. If the theory of the tides was to be the simple one so often described, then at every port <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> should be the hour of high water on the day of the new moon or of the full moon, because then both tide-exciting bodies are on the meridian at the same time. Even if the friction retarded the great tidal wave uniformly, the high tide on the days of full or change should always occur at fixed hours; but, unfortunately, there is no such delightful theory of the tides as this would imply. At Greenock no doubt there is high water at or about noon on the day of full or change; and if...", "...that leads to the village of Mbabane. We found several other transport wagons there, with three white traders whose occupation was to carry goods from Ermelo and Carolina, the two rail stations, to Mbabane and vice versa. These traders were much interested in our outfit, and by treating them to drinks, fresh food, and the payment of one pound sterling I was able to hire twelve donkeys from their caravans to assist us to the top of the mountain. We started at dawn next day, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> had reached the summit. There we rested for the balance of the day. My object in delaying there all the afternoon was mainly on account of the great load of liquor in the big wagon. I did not want to bring this through Mbabane in daylight because I had no permit to bring it into Swaziland and I did not want to get caught doing so. I thought that I could get by practically unobserved if I waited until after dark and then went through the village with other wagons. Our camp at...", "...Emma von der Tann smiled. It was evident that Lieutenant Butzow had not discovered the deception that had been practiced upon him in common with all Lutha--she being the only exception. It seemed incredible that this good friend of the American had not seen in the heroism of the man who wore the king's clothes the attributes and ear-marks of Barney Custer. She glowed with pride at the narration of his heroism, though she suffered with him because of his wound. It was not yet <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the detachment of the Royal Horse arrived in Lustadt from Blentz. At their head rode one whom all upon the streets of the capital greeted enthusiastically as king. The party rode directly to the royal palace, and the king retired immediately to his apartments. A half hour later an officer of the king's household knocked upon the door of the Princess Emma von der Tann's boudoir. In accord with her summons he entered, saluted respectfully, and handed her a note. It was...", "...to them: our observation at noon, gave 29 deg. 14' north latitude, the longitude was 39 deg. 05' west, and the variation of the compass 07 deg. 45' west. On the 5th, we had 11 deg. 04' westerly variation; our latitude, at that time, was 35 deg. 39' north, and the longitude, by lunar observation, 36 deg. 16' west. The trade wind had now left us, and we had strong breezes generally from the north-west quarter. The variation, by azimuth, on the 13th, was 22 deg. 00' west; the latitude at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> being 47 deg. 09' north, and the longitude 17 deg. 46' west. In the morning of the 15th, we saw several vessels standing to the westward, and at ten o'clock, spoke a sloop from Bristol, bound to Saint Michael's. At six o'clock in the afternoon of the 17th, we sounded and struck the ground in sixty-five fathoms, over a bottom of fine sand, mixed with black specks. Our latitude at noon, on the 19th, was 49 deg. 23', and the longitude, by lunar observation, 6 deg. 56' west.

His musings merged into vacuity, into a dull gray mist of hopelessness comparable only to the dismal skies then lowering over London-town. Brentwick was good, but Brentwick was mistaken. There was really nothing for Kirkwood to do but to go ahead. But one steamer-trunk remained to be packed; the boat-train would leave before midnight, the steamer with the morning tide; by the morrow's <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he would be upon the high seas, within ten days in New York and among friends; and then ... The problem of that afterwards perplexed Kirkwood more than he cared to own. Brentwick had opened his eyes to the fact that he would be practically useless in San Francisco; he could not harbor the thought of going back, only to become a charge upon Vanderlip. No; he was resolved that thenceforward he must rely upon himself, carve out his own destiny. But--would the art that he had...", "...sixteen hoofs on a paved way set his heart to beating. However, it was not yet the streets of Lodi, but those of Melegnano. He reached Lodi at about nine o'clock, and got out at the Albergo del Sole, where they gave him a room without fire or sun. Not daring to brave either the fog in the street or the fumes in the kitchen, he decided to go to bed, and putting on his night-cap, which was acquainted with all his woes, he waited, a camphor cigarette between his lips, for the coming of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and a happy thought. * * * * * At one o'clock he ascended the steps of the Palazzo X. with the wise determination to carefully forget all the speeches he had prepared, and to trust to the inspiration of the moment.

I imagine a fellow with the stuff in him that you are made of would be worth having for a friend.\" He drew out his watch and looked at it, rising quickly as he noted the time. \"It's getting late. By the time I get breakfast and reach the bank it'll be close onto nine. I'm glad you're lookin' so well. Don't try to get up today. I'll call in at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for a minute. Good-bye.\" He leaned over the bed and pressed Glenning's hand again, then took his hat and withdrew, closing the door gently behind him. When his fat friend had departed, Glenning mechanically sent his eyes around the room. It contained, besides the bed upon which he lay, the customary washstand, dresser, table and two chairs. His clothes lay upon one of these chairs, and he looked in a rather disinterested way at the scorched and burned garments, now rendered...", "...good and solid, after a very foolish introduction as ever I read, and do give a very good account of the advantage of our league with Holland at this time.

But whether you will like it after it is hit, is another matter.\" Then I went indoors, for my arm was paining me. In my own room I eagerly examined the wound. It was but slight. A pellet or two had grazed my arm and ploughed their way along the thickness of the skin, but none had entered deeply. So I wrapped my arm in a little lint and some old linen, and went to bed. I did not again see the Countess till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the morrow, when her carriage was at the door and she tripped down the steps to enter. The Count stood by it, holding the door for her to enter--I midway down the broad flight of steps. \"Good-bye,\" she said, holding out her hand, from which she deftly drew the glove. \"We shall meet again.\" \"God grant it! I live for that!\" said I, so low that the Count did not hear, as I bent to kiss her hand. For in these months I had learned many things. At this moment Henry came up...", "...Eugene. \"I'll take tomorrow morning off and look.\" \"Poor Eugene,\" she said sympathetically. \"It's too bad. Never mind though. Everything will come out right.\" She was still not counting on Angela. She thought that even if Angela came back, as Eugene told her she would soon, a joint arrangement might possibly be made. Angela could be here, but she, Carlotta, could share Eugene in some way. She thought she would rather live with him than any other man on earth. It was only about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next morning when Eugene had found another room, for, in living here so long, he had thought of several methods by which he might have obtained a room in the first place. There was another church, a library, the postmaster and the ticket agent at Speonk who lived in the village. He went first to the postmaster and learned of two families, one the home of a civil engineer, where he might be welcome, and it was here that he eventually settled. The view was not quite so...", "...Helen Hunt Jackson The goldenrod is yellow; The corn is turning brown; The trees in apple orchards With fruit are bending down.

She was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father was a professor in Amherst College, but she spent much of her life in California. She married a banker in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where...", "...her own hospital home went physicians and graduate nurses to dedicate themselves afresh to service. The call reached and wrung the heart of Rose. She could not go as a nurse, she knew; yet the need was so great that it seemed to her that somehow she must answer; but she resolutely closed her ears to it and fixed her eyes the more steadfastly upon the rocky, shut-in path which she had set forth to climb. It was a raw, bleak evening in late November when she made her final resolve. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Donald had met her in one of the corridors and stopped to speak with her. His face, she thought afterwards, had appeared unusually serious and determined, even for him, as he said, \"This is your afternoon and evening off duty, isn't it, Rose? I want to talk with you, if you haven't made any other plans.\" As it chanced, she had been eagerly anticipating a visit to the theatre with Miss Merriman, who was home for a few days between cases; but something about his manner caused her...", "...out a short distance, smelled of a number of things, licked the snow a few times, and then returned to his nest. The next morning he went early for a drink of water and ate more willow-twigs. In the afternoon of this day he came on a dead bird,--apparently a junco,--which he ate. Another drink, and he lay down at the foot of a tree for the night. The next morning he drank freely of water, surprised a rabbit, which he entirely devoured, and then lay down and probably slept until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the following day. On this day he found a dead grouse, and toward evening he caught another rabbit. The following day he started off with more spirit than on any of the preceding ones. Evidently he was hungry, and he covered more distance that day than in all those preceding. He caught another rabbit, apparently picked up three or four dead birds, and captured a mouse or two. Grizzlies are born about midwinter, while the mother is in the hibernating-cave. The number at birth...", "...on your death-bed, and send you, unshriven, to perdition!\" A sort of shudder ran through the bowed form of Inez, and in a low tone, she replied, \"I also accuse myself of all the sins that may have escaped my memory, and by which, as well as those I have confessed, I have offended Almighty God, through my most grievous fault.\" \"I enjoin upon you, as penance for the omission of the holy ordinances of our most holy church, five Credos when you hear the matin bell, twelve Paters when <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> comes round, and five Aves at vespers.

Moreover, you shall see and speak to none, save the holy sisters.

So far were Blucher and his army from being in the state of annihilation described in the boastful bulletin by which Napoleon informed the Parisians of his victory at Ligny. Indeed, the French Emperor seems himself to have been misinformed as to the extent of loss which he had inflicted on the Prussians. Had he known in what good order and with what undiminished spirit they were retiring, he would scarcely have delayed sending a large force to press them in their retreat until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the 17th. Such, however, was the case. It was about that time that he confided to Marshal Grouchy the duty of pursuing the defeated Prussians, and preventing them from joining Wellington. He placed for this purpose 32,000 men and 96 guns under his orders. Violent complaints and recriminations passed afterwards between the Emperor and the marshal respecting the manner in which Grouchy attempted to perform this duty, and the reasons why he failed on the 18th to arrest the lateral...", "...an equal revenue of something else might be found for the King, and people be enjoyned to buy off this tax of Chimney-money for ever at eight years' purchase, which will raise present money, as they think, L1,600,000, and the State be eased of an ill burthen and the King be supplied of something as food or better for his use.

We have come a long way from the farmhouse.\" \"Father Bear is always right,\" said Mother Bear, as she emptied the broken eggs into the frying pan and began picking out pieces of the shells and tossing them into the water. That is how it came about that the Three Bears built a camp fire at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and dined on scrambled eggs. They had a jolly time eating dinner in the woods and talking about what a huge fish it was that Father Bear had almost pulled out of the stream in the morning. But after dinner Little Bear laughed and sang: \"I had my wish! Because Daddy lost his fish!

A kindly faced, white-haired old lady walked into the county jail this morning and asked permission to address the prisoners. She was \"Mother\" Elizabeth Rider Wheaton, the prison evangelist, who is known from coast to coast. As soon as her identity was made known Turnkey Reynolds and his corps of assistants did their utmost to assist the generous old lady. She was shown through the building, and then allowed to enter each ward. From 11 o'clock until long after the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour she remained with the unfortunates, visiting them separately and then preaching to all. Tears were in the eyes of many of these hardened criminals before she had finished. \"Mother\" Wheaton was met at the jail entrance and asked to explain her system of working. \"It is all done by faith,\" she said. \"I have faith in God, and that is sufficient. He will provide me with all that is necessary to carry on this work.\" \"Under whose guidance do you work?\" was asked. \"The...", "...most any time from Indians. In July of that year the Cheyennes, Kiowas, Arapahoes and some Comanche and Hickory Apaches were camped a mile north of Fort Larned. The commanding officer of the fort told me he could only let me have about thirty soldiers for an escort. I told him that if we should have trouble with the Indians thirty soldiers would be just as good as a thousand, and that I had rather take my chances with thirty soldiers than more. We left Fort Larned a little before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and arrived at Big Coon Creek, twenty-two miles from Fort Larned, where we stopped for supper at about four o'clock in the afternoon. A lieutenant of my escort in charge of the soldiers put out a guard. While we were eating supper the guards shot off their guns and came rushing into camp with news that a thousand or more Indians were hidden along the banks of Coon Creek. The lieutenant placed double guard and came out to me and gravely suggested that we go back to Fort Larned and...", "...The presents sent for the Indians were distributed to each band, after payment. On Wednesday also the Commissioners drove to see the coal seam about five miles east of the Blackfoot crossing. Under the guidance of Mr. French, they found an outcrop of the seam at a coulee some three miles south of the river. The seam there is from three to ten feet in thickness, and the coal, some of which was burned every day in the officers' mess tent at the treaty, is of a very fair quality. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Friday the payments were completed, and the Commissioners proceeded to close the accounts. They found that the number of Indians paid, who had accepted the terms of the new treaty was as follows:-- Head Chiefs 10 at $25 $250 Minor Chiefs and Councillors 40 at 15 600 Men, women and children 4,342 at 12 52,104 ----- ------ Total 4,392...", "...of the little maid the doctor looked for and found reminiscences of her mother.

Every day they met at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to exchange on equal terms the experiences of the morning. Every night they closed the day with dinner and family prayers, the little girl gravely taking her part in the reading during the last year from her mother's Bible.

The doctor was widely read beyond the literature of his profession, and every day for a half hour it was his custom to share with the little girl the treasures of...", "...After all, Tom was himself scarcely more than a boy in years. He cherished, deep hidden in him, the dreams and illusions that long contact with the world is likely to dispel. At New Haven and Cambridge lads of his age were larking beneath the elms and playing childish pranks on each other. West drove the team. Tom either broke trail or followed. He came across plenty of tracks, but most of them were old ones. He recognized the spoor of deer, bear, and innumerable rabbits. Toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> fresh caribou tracks crossed their path. The slot pointed south. Over a soft and rotting trail Morse swung round in pursuit. They made heavy going of it. He had to break trail through slushy snow. His shoes broke through the crust and clogged with the sludgy stuff so that his feet were greatly weighted. Fatigue pressed like a load on his shoulders. The dogs and West wallowed behind. By night probably the trail would be much better, but they dared not wait till then.

For some reason, Adamski didn't know exactly why, on November 19th he'd decided to go out into the Mojave Desert. He'd called some friends and told them to meet him there. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day the party, which consisted of Adamski and six others, had met and were eating lunch near the town of Desert Center on the California-Arizona border. They looked for saucers, but except for an occasional airplane, the cloudless blue sky was empty. They were about ready to give it up as a bad day when another airplane came over. Again they looked up, but this time, in addition to seeing the airplane, they saw a silvery, cigar-shaped \"flying saucer.\" For some...", "...was torn to pieces with their \"hi-ex\" shells. \"Why are they throwing away so much good ammunition?\" my men would ask me. I knew but did not say anything. On account of the brave way in which our forward lines were fighting, the Germans fancied we had thousands of men in support. If they only knew they could have steam-rollered us. It is part of the game of war to impose on the enemy and we were carrying out that tradition. It was the biggest bluff Canada ever played. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Germans began blowing the troops out of the trenches on the right of our supports. I went down again with Lieut. Colonel Burland to the enfiladed crossroads to see what troops were there, and to learn if any word had come through from headquarters. I stopped at the field dressing station and ordered them to get the wounded away as quickly as possible as the enemy were shelling their quarters, evidently with the intention of destroying them.

At that moment I happened to leave my work and, coming home to our <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal, saw the two women talking on the threshold; and my wife stopped me, saying, \"This neighbour biddeth twenty Ashrafis to price for the piece of glass, but I have as yet given her no reply.

They never came. One afternoon, seven or eight days out, we had notice at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that we would try on our life preservers that afternoon. The life preservers were thrown on our beds by the stewards and at three o'clock each passenger appeared beside the life-boat assigned to him, donned his life-belt which gave him a ridiculously stuffed appearance, answered to a roll-call, guyed those about him after the manner of old friends, and waited for something else.

No corral was formed, as there was little danger from Indians or risk of animals straying in the daytime.

One night, early in July, Alec Pierre, a wood-chopper, came to the village with a startling story. He had been chopping two or three miles back in the heavy timber. His own home was closer to the primeval forest than any other of the many straggling farmhouses. He had taken his dinner, going and coming at morning and evening. Each noon he went to a cool spring which he knew of, to eat his lunch. This <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he had gone as usual, only to discover that some one had gotten ahead of him. There by the spring, sitting upon his haunches, was an enormous black bear. In his paws he was holding the coffee-bottle, looking at it intently, while his countenance plainly bespoke satisfaction with the discovery. While the woodsman was wondering what was the best thing to do, the bear raised the bottle to his mouth, and biting upon the cork with his teeth, pulled it out. Then he put the nose of...", "...him to inform Hamed that, as the Musungu did not wish to detain him, or any other caravan, it was his express wish that Hamed would march and leave him, as he was quite strong enough in guns to march through Ugogo alone.

I took a second dose; before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I had taken four more--altogether, fifty measured grains-the effect of which was manifest in the copious perspiration which drenched flannels, linen, and blankets. After noon I arose, devoutly thankful that the disease which had clung to me for the last fourteen days had at last succumbed to quinine.

Of course Sam was ordered to take charge of the little boy, as before. The British had not long to wait for the expected meeting with the enemy. At daylight on the 8th of April 1782, the _Andromache_ frigate, commanded by Captain Byron, appeared off Gros Islet Bay, with the signal flying that the enemy's fleet, with a large convoy, was coming out of Fort Royal Bay and standing to the north-west. Instantly Sir George Rodney made the signal to weigh, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the whole fleet was clear of the bay. The Admiral stretched over to Fort Royal, but finding none of the French ships there, or at Saint Pierre's, he made the signal for a general chase. Night came on, but still a sharp lookout was kept ahead. Paul Pringle and Abel Bush walked the forecastle, where the second lieutenant of the ship was stationed with his night-glass. The _Fame_ was one of the leading ships. It was the middle watch. Paul put his hand on Abel's shoulder....", "...love of mine Shall find thy sacred hidden sweet!

At daylight they started out again. Boone took short cuts through the woods, but he always found the trail. His sharp eyes saw what the girls had left for him to see. One had dug her heels into the soft mud. Another had left bits of her dress here and there. Boone led the young men straight through the heart of the forest to Jemima and her friends. About noon the men caught sight of the girls. The Indians had stopped with them for their <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal. The white men crept up. Bang! Bang! Bang! went their guns. \"It's Father!\" Jemima cried. \"Fall flat on your faces, girls!\" Daniel Boone shouted. The white men ran toward the Indians. They shot their guns as they ran. The Indians were taken by surprise. One Indian threw his tomahawk. It almost hit the girls. Two Indians were shot. The others ran away. The men took the three girls back to Boonesborough. Later the three girls married the three young men. The...", "...made. We found the mountain to be 4860 feet above the sea, barometrical admeasurement, and the flagstaff itself in latitude 13 deg. 18' N. and longitude 87 deg. 45' W. We obtained bearings on nearly all the volcanic cones on the plain of Leon, as also on many of the detached mountain-peaks of Honduras and San Salvador, as the commencement of a system of triangulations which subsequently enabled us to construct the first map of the country at all approximating to accuracy. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the day of our visit, the thermometer marked a temperature of 16 deg. of Fahrenheit below that of the port. It is a singular circumstance, that Captain Sir Edward Belcher, who surveyed the Bay of Fonseca in 1838, speaks of Conchagua as a mountain exhibiting no evidences of volcanic origin. Apart from its form, which is itself conclusive on that point, its lower slopes are ridged all over with dikes of lava, some of which come down to the water's edge, in rugged, black...", "...She remembers you.

After a little Bishop got weary of the dangers and fatigues of exhumation, and proposed to Williams that instead of disinterring they should murder their subjects. Bishop confessed that he was moved to this by the example of Burke and Hare. They pursued their terrible trade for five years without scruple and without detection. Eventually the law overtook them, but almost by accident. They presented themselves about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> one day at the dissecting room of King's College Hospital, accompanied by a third man, an avowed \"snatcher\" and _habitue_ of the Fortune of War, a public-house in Smithfield frequented openly by men of this awful profession. This man, May, asked the porter at King's College if \"he wanted anything?\" the euphemism for offering a body. The porter asked what he had got, and the answer was, a male subject.

A quivering peace is on the grass. Through the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> gloam butterflies pass, White and hot blue, only to where They can float flat and dream on the soft air....

Scorpions were unnested, and bats and owls made unhappy by daylight where daylight had never been before. Convents and monasteries were not exempt. The sea was dragged, and the great moat from the Golden Gate to the Cynegion raked for traces of a new-made grave. Nor less were the cemeteries overhauled, and tombs and sarcophagi opened, and Saints' Rests dug into and profaned. In short, but one property in Byzantium was respected--that of the Emperor. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the excitement had crossed to Galata, and was at high tide in the Isles of the Princes. Such power was there in the offer of bezants in gold--six thousand for the girl, five thousand for one of her captors--singly, a fortune to stir the cupidity of a Duke--together, enough to enlist a King in the work. And everywhere the two questions--Has she been found? and who is the Prince of India? Poor Uel had not space to think of his loss or yield to sorrow; the questions kept him so...", "...went on as fast as possible. He was becoming conscious of a pain in his left side; one foot felt sore; and as the sun got hotter a longing to lie down a while grew steadily stronger. Still, he could see nothing but short, gray grass ahead; he must hold on; there might be bluffs or broken country beyond the skyline. At length a small square block cut against the dazzling brightness and slowly grew into a lonely homestead. After some consideration, George headed for it, and toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> reached a little, birch-log dwelling, with a sod stable beside it. Both had an uncared-for appearance, which suggested their owner's poverty. As George approached the door, a gaunt, hard-faced man in dilapidated overalls came out and gazed at him in surprise. George's clothing, which had been torn when he was seized in the bluff, had further suffered during the deluge. He looked a weary, ragged outcast. \"Can you give me something to eat and hire me a horse?\" he asked. The...", "...He was urging on his horse with voice and hand and spur, riding as if for dear life, yet even while he rode he was making up his mind to keep back from Mr. Morton all knowledge of Dearing's map. Of Dearing's death he was bound to tell him, but he would say nothing of the map. If Harding was found it would be so easy to say he had forgotten it in his anxiety; if Harding-- Gray did not finish the sentence to himself, but he determined to keep back the map. It was not much past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the plains began to give place to undulating ground, richer in vegetation, and with great clumps of dark-foliaged trees here and there; and it was soon after that that Gray caught his first glimpse of the river, and saw the roofs of the station gleaming in the sunlight.

They were comfortable, roomy cottages, looking down...", "...pause and lift their heads. It was the voice of a child crying,--crying long and loud, hopelessly, as if there were no one by to comfort it. The panthers turned aside from their former course and glided toward the sound. They were not yet come to the outskirts of the settlement, but they knew of a solitary cabin lying in the thick of the woods a mile and more from the nearest neighbor. Thither they bent their way, fired with fierce hope. Soon would they break their bitter fast. Up to <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the previous day the lonely cabin had been occupied. Then its owner, a shiftless fellow, who spent his days for the most part at the corner tavern three miles distant, had suddenly grown disgusted with a land wherein one must work to live, and had betaken himself with his seven-year-old boy to seek some more indolent clime. During the long lonely days when his father was away at the tavern the little boy had been wont to visit the house of the next neighbor, to play with a...", "...Isaac S.

You should learn to sit down less suddenly.\" \"And,\" said Marjory, \"to be more careful in your choice of seats--we'll have to take up a collection and buy Mrs. Tucker a new basin, or she'll be afraid to lend us anything more.\" The girls ran home at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for a hasty luncheon. Rested and refreshed, they all returned promptly to their housecleaning. Nobody wanted to brush out the kitchen cupboard. It was not only dusty, but full of spider webs, and worst of all, the spiders themselves seemed very much at home. The girls left the back door open, hoping that the spiders would run out of their own accord. Apparently, however, the spiders felt no need of fresh air. Bettie, without a word to anyone, ran home, returning a moment later...", "...destruction of Jerusalem, when the Jewish method would not likely be preserved. Roman ideas were prevalent in Asia Minor. John evidently is not writing for the Jews primarily, since he constantly speaks of \"the Jews\" as outsiders. John is writing to be understood by the people, and this is the way it would be understood in Asia Minor. _(b)_ All the passages in John, where the hour is mentioned, allow this computation. John 1:39 would be 10 A.M.; 4:6 f. would be 6 P.M., counting from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> also (as we do). This hour suits best the circumstances. In the evening the women would come to get water, Jesus would have time for his journey thither, and would be tired and hungry. In John 4:52 the hour would be 7 P.M. This hour likewise suits the circumstances better. John 11:9, Are there not twelve hours in the day? is not against this idea, since here obviously the natural day, as opposed to night, is meant. The Romans used both methods and so do we. _(c)_ Moreover, one...", "...paper and sat still. Now he volunteered to do a few other little things. One was to go to the butcher, another to the grocery. He really thought nothing of these little services in connection with their true significance. He felt as if he were not wholly useless--indeed, in such a stress of weather, quite worth while about the house. On the fourth day, however, it cleared, and he read that the storm was over. Now, however, he idled, thinking how sloppy the streets would be. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> before he finally abandoned his papers and got under way. Owing to the slightly warmer temperature the streets were bad. He went across Fourteenth Street on the car and got a transfer south on Broadway. One little advertisement he had, relating to a saloon down in Pearl Street. When he reached the Broadway Central, however, he changed his mind. \"What's the use?\" he thought, looking out upon the slop and snow. \"I couldn't buy into it. It's a thousand to one nothing comes of it....", "...St. James's Parks were now shouting \"Stop the war! Stop the war!\" The cry was taken up but faintly, however, for the blood of Londoners, slow to rise, had now been stirred by seeing their country slowly yet completely crushed by Germany. All the patriotism latent within them was now displayed. The national flag was shown everywhere, and at every point one heard \"God save the King\" sung lustily. Two gunmakers' shops in the Strand, which had hitherto escaped notice, were shortly after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> broken open, and every available arm and all the ammunition seized. One man, unable to obtain a revolver, snatched half a dozen pairs of steel handcuffs, and cried with grim humour as he held them up: \"If I can't shoot any of the sausage-eaters, I can at least bag a prisoner or two!\" The banks, the great jewellers, the diamond merchants, the safe-deposit offices, and all who had valuables in their keeping, were extremely anxious as to what might happen.

As soon as they were up Capt. Pipe's wife placed a dish of boiled corn, like hominy, before them, and this was their breakfast. A little later, telling Capt.

It was two hours past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when Tom Fish suddenly started up from the broiled turkey with which he was regaling himself, as he heard some one approach, and discovered Ree and John returning. He greeted them gladly, but not in his usual hilarious fashion, and they could not but notice how unlike himself he was as he carved for them some juicy slices from the fine young gobbler he had cooked. Yet he listened with interest to Ree's account of their trip, John often breaking in with such jolly comment as: \"You...", "...shot, directed principally against the lofty eminence of the Upper Town, fell almost harmless, while a vigorous cannonade from the numerous guns of the fortress replied with overwhelming power.

By the first light of morning, however, Phipps renewed the action with pertinacious courage, but with no better success. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the contest became evidently hopeless to the stubborn assailants; they weighed anchor, and, with the receding tide, floated their crippled vessels down the stream, beyond the reach of the enemy's fire.[411] The British troops, under Major Walley, although placed in battle array at daylight, remained inactive, through some unaccountable delay, while the enemy's attention was diverted by the combat with Phipps's squadron.

Also, he had given me another letter, of which more anon, and had pressed upon me a small purse of gold pieces--a treasure rare enough in patriot hands in that impoverished time. When all was done, two of my late captors were ordered to set me straight in the road; and some half-hour past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I had shaken hands with the big fellow in homespun who had been so bent upon hanging me without benefit of clergy, had crossed the river, and was making the first looping in a detour which should bring me into Charlotte from the westward.

Then I saw a lonely bird making way for the heronry. I remember it plainly; in the sun it looked shining white. I flew...", "...they were all hung with icicles.

Within a few minutes after this intelligence had been received, I was further informed by Captain Denmons, of the...", "...[BATTLE OF PALO ALTO] During these days Arista had waited for Taylor's return; but, in order to hasten that and perhaps accomplish direct results, he had ordered the guns of Matamoros to begin cannonading Fort Brown on the morning of May 3, and two days later, believing the garrison were near starvation, sent Ampudia to invest it. For the sake of water and to cover all of the roads that might be taken by the American army, he placed himself at Los Tanques del Ramireno; and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the eighth, learning of Taylor's approach, he set out for Palo Alto, some five miles away. Shortly before gaining that point he saw through his glass blue American dragoons in the far distance, and, as quickly as he could, put his troops in position. At the extreme right were placed about 150 horse under Noriega, and then came a 4-pounder, a corps of Sappers, the Second Light Infantry, the Tampico Veteran Company and Coast Guards, five 4-pounders, the First, the Sixth and the...", "...and as his gaze passed from Bigot at the window to the old Free Companion, who sat on a stool beside him, engaged in shaping a piece of wood into a splint, an expression almost soft crept into his harsh face. \"Old fool!\" he said. And his voice, though changed, had not lost all its strength and harshness. \"Did the Constable need a splint when you laid him under the tower at Gaeta?\" The old man lifted his eyes from his task, and glanced through the nearest window. \"It is long from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to night,\" he said quietly, \"and far from cup to lip, my lord!\" \"It would be if I had two legs,\" Tavannes answered, with a grimace, half-snarl, half-smile. \"As it is--where is that dagger? It leaves me every minute.\" It had slipped from the coverlid to the ground. Badelon took it up, and set it on the bed within reach of his master's hand. Bigot swore fiercely. \"It would be farther still,\" he growled, \"if you would be guided by me, my lord. Give me leave to bar the door,...", "...plan was to engage one of these. \"No,\" said his father; \"we will not take a sail boat; we will take a steamboat.\" Besides the sail boats and row boats, there were a number of large and handsome steamboats plying on the lake. There were two or three that left in the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, and then there were one or two at noon also. Those that left in the morning had time to go to the farther end of the lake and return the same day; while those that left at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came back the next morning. Thus, to see the lake, you could go in the forenoon of one day, and come back in the afternoon of the same, or you could go in the afternoon of one day, and come back in the morning of the next. \"Which would you do?\" said Mr. Holiday to Rollo. \"But, father,\" said Rollo, \"I think it would be pleasanter to go in a sail boat. Besides, you said that you would take me to a sail; and going in a steamboat is not sailing.\" \"What is it doing?\" said Mr....", "...of the quartette had troubled themselves much concerning \"passes,\" those magic bits of scribbled paper that meant permission to quit camp limits for a few brief hours of civil life. Once or twice they had obtained leave to spend an evening in Glenwood, a village about three miles from Camp Sterling. \"What we ought to do is to all get a pass, go to Tremont and take in a good show,\" was Bob's opinion one evening as the four boys sat talking together in barracks. \"We could get off at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> some Saturday and be back by midnight. That would give us the afternoon to see the town, a bang-up supper at a first-class restaurant and a show afterward. Oh, boy! Oh, joy! I can just see us doing it.\" \"That sounds good to me,\" glowed Jimmy. \"I've been going slow on the pass business 'cause I want to ask for one from Saturday until Monday morning, so that I can go home.

The cold was beyond belief. I have often suffered less at a dentist's. It was a clear, sunny day, but the sun even at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> falls, at this season, only here and there into the Praettigau. I kept up as long as I could in an imitation of a street singer:-- \"Away, ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses,\" etc. At last Lloyd remarked, a blue mouth speaking from a corpse-coloured face, \"You seem to be the only one with any courage left?\" And, do you know, with that word my courage disappeared, and I made the rest of the stage in the same dumb wretchedness as the others. My only terror was lest Fanny...", "...than might be seen in the snow hut of an Esquimaux. But we made a summer of it, in spite of the wild drifts. It was an April day, as already hinted, and well towards the middle of the month. When morning dawned upon me, in town, its temperature was mild enough to be pronounced even balmy, by a lodger, like myself, in one of the midmost houses of a brick block,--each house partaking of the warmth of all the rest, besides the sultriness of its individual furnace--heat. But towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> there had come snow, driven along the street by a northeasterly blast, and whitening the roofs and sidewalks with a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our severest January tempest. It set about its task apparently as much in earnest as if it had been guaranteed from a thaw for months to come. The greater, surely, was my heroism, when, puffing out a final whiff of cigar-smoke, I quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms,--with a good fire burning in the grate,...", "...up sauntered her worthy father, wiping his silky moustache and beard from the smoke. 'Well, dear, how have you managed? Beautifully, I have no doubt. She's a model of a daughter, Wynn!' 'Papa, I hope we may soon land; I positively long to tread the firm earth again.' 'What would you do if you were rocking and rolling in a transport five months round the Cape? All in good time, dear: I have one or two trifling matters to settle;' and he went down to the cabins.

And he who was of his own people asked his help against him who was of his enemies. And Moses smote him with his fist and slew him. Said he, \"This is a work of Satan; for he is an enemy, a manifest misleader.\" He said, \"O my Lord, I have sinned to mine own hurt:7 forgive me.\" So God forgave him; for He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He said, \"Lord, because thou hast showed me this grace, I will never again be the helper of the wicked.\" And in the city at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he was full of fear, casting furtive glances round him: and lo! the man whom he had helped the day before, cried out to him again for help. Said Moses to him, \"Thou art plainly a most depraved person.\" And when he would have laid violent hands on him who was their common foe, he said to him, \"O Moses, dost thou desire to slay me, as thou slayedst a man yesterday? Thou desirest only to become a tyrant in this land, and desirest not to become a peacemaker.\" But a man came...", "...Thou, drugging pain by patience; half averse From thine own mother's breast, that knows not thee; With eyes which sought thine eyes thou didst converse, And that soul-searching vision fell on me.

There are a lot of fairly good swimmers in our school, too.\" \"We'll talk it over with the fellows, and with Old Dut also,\" Dick went on. \"Of course we have no right to act for the school unless the other fellows are willing.\" When Dick left his chums at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it was with an agreement to meet on Main Street again at half past one. At fifteen minutes past one the telephone bell rang in the little bookstore. \"Have you a copy of Moore's Ballads?\" asked a masculine voice. \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Prescott; \"in different styles of bindings and at different prices.\" The bookseller then went on to describe the bindings and named the prices. The customer at the other end of the wire seemed to prefer an expensive volume, which came at four...", "...when she awoke in the morning. Therefore, it seemed that the jewels had been abstracted immediately before she had entered the room on the previous night--stolen by some one well acquainted with their hiding-place--for the jewel-case was kept for safety at the bottom of a trunk full of soiled linen.

All the visitors who had been in the hotel the previous day at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> were still there. The night-porter had not noticed anything suspicious, and nobody had heard any unusual sound during the night. All of us in the hotel were closely interrogated, including Lola, who preserved an air of deepest regret that her dear friend, the Baroness, should have been so ingeniously robbed. Indeed, it was during that interrogation that I had first exchanged words with her. \"I can't understand it,\" she had declared to me in French. \"I was in the Baroness's...", "...our meridian. \"You know,\" speaking to me, \"we must not allow sharks nor anything else to interfere with the progress of the ship.

So that I can always tell now when it is noon, by the shadow of the post upon my noon mark, if the sun shines.\" All this was very new and very curious to Rollo. He had never seen or heard of a noon mark before; and it seemed to him a very simple and beautiful way of knowing when it was noon.

But the time required to be kept holy varied. An edict from the king of Scotland declared that \"Saturday from twelve at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> ought to be accounted holy,\" and that no man, from that time till Monday morning, should engage in worldly business.(1013) But notwithstanding all the efforts to establish Sunday sacredness, papists themselves publicly confessed the divine authority of the Sabbath, and the human origin of the institution by which it had been supplanted.

By the time we had beaten around the long bend up which we had fought our way the day before, the snow had ceased, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the wind had dropped and the sun was shining, and in a few moments of his unobscured strength all the loose snow on the sled was melted--a warning of the rapidity with which the general thaw would proceed once the skies were clear.

It was noticeable that after all had been capsized, nothing of the kind took place again. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> an hour's halt was made. The Esquimaux produced their cooked venison and all ate. The snow, although it seems to add to one's thirst, when first used, served excellently in the place of water. As well as they could by signs, the passengers offered to walk and allow the Esquimaux to ride. Where the surface was so favorable this would have imposed no hard work, but the natives refused, even declining to ride alternately in the rear sleigh. The dogs were tired enough to give no...", "...vol. 12, page 413, verified Cook's longitude of Cape St John, having found it to agree exactly with that pointed out by the watches on board his consort the Neva, which differed but a few minutes from those in his own vessel.--E.] After getting round the cape, I hauled up along the south coast, and as soon as we had brought the wind to blow off the land, it came upon us in such heavy squalls as obliged us to double-reef our top-sails. It afterwards fell, by little and little, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> ended in a calm. At this time Cape St John bore N. 20 deg. E., distant three and a half leagues; Cape St Bartholomew, or the S.W. point of Staten Land, S. 83 deg. W.; two high detached rocks N. 80 deg. W.; and the place where the land seemed to be divided, which had the same appearance on this side, bore N. 15 deg. W. three leagues distant. Latitude observed 54 deg. 56'. In this situation we sounded, but had no bottom with a line of 120 fathoms. The calm was of very short...", "...were a dozen who would conceal the deserter in their houses and send his pursuers off on the wrong trail. After Bob and his troopers had ridden about fifteen miles, and had shouted and sung off a little of their surplus enthusiasm, they relapsed into silence and settled down to business. They halted on the top of every ridge to survey the country before them, and called at every ranche that lay along their route; but nothing was to be seen or heard of Bristow and his party. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they came within sight of a squatter's cabin, and Bob decided to stop there and eat dinner. The owner of the cabin was at home, and he welcomed the horsemen with every appearance of cordiality. \"Alight an' hitch, strangers,\" said he, when he had succeeded in quieting the small army of dogs which came out from under the cabin to dispute the further advance of the troopers. \"You're as welcome as the flowers in May.\" \"Thank you,\" said Bob as he swung himself from his saddle. \"We...", "...said Emmy Lou, \"and I'll bring Hattie. I'll get her now so she'll know you.\" But Hattie declined to come. She shook her head decidedly. \"They've light dispositions and I've not. My mamma said so about some other little girls I couldn't get along with. I don't want to come, and besides I'm not sure I want to know them.\" Which would imply that light dispositions were undesirable apart from Hattie's inability to get along with them! Hattie could be most disturbing. Towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> a sudden shower fell, and the class was told to remain in its room for recess and eat its luncheons at its desks. Across the aisle on the other side of Emmy Lou sat Charlotte Wright. She, too, had shown every disposition to be friendly but Hattie discouraged this also. She leaned from her desk now. \"Will you have a piece of my homemade hickory-nut candy?\" She spoke with pride. \"My mamma let me make it myself on the grate.\" On the grate? Why not in the kitchen on the stove?...", "...at a small village within half a mile of Sego, where he endeavoured in vain to procure some provisions. He was again informed that Mansong had sent people to apprehend him, and the dooty's son told him he had no time to lose, if he wished to escape. Mr. Park now fully saw the danger of his situation, and determined to avoid Sego altogether, and taking the road to Diggani, until he was out of sight of the village, struck to the westward through high grass and swampy ground. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he stopped under a tree, to consider what course to take, and at length determined to proceed along the Niger, and endeavour to ascertain how far the river was navigable. About sunset he arrived at a village called Sooboo, where, for two hundred kowries, he procured a lodging for the night.

For a moment Jack caught a glimpse of a carriage in the distance, a carriage preceded by outriders in crimson and gold, and followed by a mass of glittering cuirassiers. \"It's the Emperor.

He rose in his saddle and drew his sabre, and at the same instant a deep roar shook the regiment to its centre-- \"Vive l'Empereur!\" X AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER It was a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when the regiment halted on the Saint-Avold highway, blocked in front by a train of Guard artillery, and on either flank by columns of infantry--voltigeurs, red-legged fantassins loaded with camp equipment, engineers in crimson and bluish-black, and a whole battalion of Turcos, scarlet fez rakishly hauled down over one ear, canvas zouave trousers tucked into canvas leggings that fitted their finely moulded ankles like gloves. Jack rested patiently on his horse, waiting for the...", "...what Gumda had said, and he refused to go down into the water, and would not even drink. On being brought home he would not eat his grain, nor would he so much as look at water. He continued thus so long that he began to grow lean and weak.

The raja one day noticing the altered condition of his elephant, said to the mahout, \"Why has the elephant become so emaciated?\" The mahout replied, \"Oh! raja, one day at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Gumda abused him. He said, 'If you were not the raja's elephant, I would take you by the trunk and throw you across seven seas.' 'Every day,' he said, 'he rubs himself against my house.'

We went east all night, and in the morning were only three or four leagues from shore. The 20th we were off Rio de las Barbas. The 21st we continued along shore; and three or four leagues west of Cape Three Points, I found the bay to be set deeper than it is laid down by four leagues. At 4 P.M. the land began to shew high, the first part of it being covered by palm trees. The 24th, still going along shore, the land was very low and full of trees to the water side. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we anchored off the Rio de Boilas, where we sent the boat towards the shore with our merchants, but they durst not put into the river, because of a heavy surf that broke continually on the bar. The 28th we sailed along shore, and anchored at night in seven fathoms, to avoid being put back by a current setting from E.S.E. from _Papuas_. At noon on the 29th we were abreast of Ardrah, and there we took a caravel, the people belonging to which had fled to the land. She had nothing...", "...the last few days. I found all quiet in the lane or glade, and, unharnessing my little horse, I once more pitched my tent in the old spot beneath the ash, lighted my fire, ate my frugal meal, and then, after looking for some time at the heavenly bodies, and more particularly at the star Jupiter, I entered my tent, lay down upon my pallet, and went to sleep. Nothing occurred on the following day which requires any particular notice, nor indeed on the one succeeding that. It was about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the third day that I sat beneath the shade of the ash tree; I was not at work, for the weather was particularly hot, and I felt but little inclination to make any exertion. Leaning my back against the tree, I was not long in falling into a slumber; I particularly remember that slumber of mine beneath the ash tree, for it was about the sweetest slumber that I ever enjoyed; how long I continued in it I do not know; I could almost have wished that it had lasted to the present...", "...noon, the indicator is moved so that the sun circle will fall on the same middle line, and the pointer will show the time. This sun time differs somewhat from clock time. The difference for every day in the year is given by the almanacs, and very exactly by the Nautical Almanac. This difference being added or subtracted, makes known the true clock time. Thus, for the 1st of March, clock time is twelve minutes faster than sun time. Hence noon by the sun-dial is just that much later than <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> by the clock. Any of our readers who have a little mechanical skill can make a sun-dial, on the plan described, that, when put in proper position, will be more reliable than the best of clocks, and that will be found a convenient means of setting them right. But don't despise the clocks; for very likely you will have to resort to one in order to get the sun-dial in position; and then, too, remember that the sun does not shine all the while, but is very fond of hiding behind...", "...under the wire the can caught on a barb of the lower strand. Jerking furiously, the animal freed itself from the can, leaving splotches of hair and hide on the ragged edges of tin.

Then he blurted out: \"If I'd had any idea you were on this train, I'd have walked.\" Ardea laughed, and for all his misery he could not help remarking how much sweeter the low voice was growing, and how much clearer the blue of her eyes was under the forced light of the gas-globes. He had seen her only two or three times since that blush-kindling <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at Crestcliffe Inn.

In spite of frequent light showers the stream failed to rise appreciably, and our goods had to be carried on the back of the men to our next camping place. The following morning we started in a heavy rain at which we rejoiced, because it enabled us to use our prahus until we reached the foot of the dividing ridge. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we arrived in camp, with our clothing thoroughly wet. What the downpour might have left intact the Penyahbongs, forgetting everything but the safety of the prahus, had done their best to drench by splashing water all the time. Just as we had made camp the rain ceased and with it, being near the source of the stream, the overflow too passed away. In dry weather it would be a tedious trip to get up the Bakkaang.

After breakfast Archie suggested that they should leave the car at the inn and proceed to Paris conventionally by train. But Adelle would not give up one kilometre of her great dash for liberty and Archie. Nor would she consider his going on by train to make arrangements for the marriage. So they resumed their rapid flight, but mishaps with tires began, and it was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> before they entered the Porte Maillot. As they drove past the Villa Ponitowski, Adelle looked furtively up at the shutters as if she expected to see Pussy's severe face lurking there. She guided the machine to the Rue de l'Universite and stopped beneath Miss Baxter's studio windows. If Archie had proposed it, she would have gone at once to a hotel with him and registered, but he prudently suggested the studio, where he hoped to find Cornelia Baxter.

Leaving Paw Paw after breakfast I went down to Lawton by rail, where I changed cars, taking the Michigan Central to Niles, this for the purpose of making use of the extra time that now hung heavily upon my hands.

I got behind a tree and, like many others, fired off half a dozen cartridges in the enemy's direction, retaining but two out of the sixty I had during the day. Darkness was coming on. For us the Battle of Gaines's Mill was over, but it still raged on other parts of the field as long as it was light, and I think it was nine o'clock before all firing ceased. I learned later that our last attack had been made on Turkey Hill, not very far from the position we had held at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> before the battle began. Therefore we had lost little ground. Efforts were now made by our officers to reform our command which had become scattered throughout the woods; and with difficulty the remnants were gathered together and we made our way out of the woods to the road by which we had approached in the forenoon. Here we reformed ranks and took up our march in retreat. We soon came to a place where the road was skirted by thick woods on the left and a high bank on the...", "...murmur of waves over the rounded boulders.

In this same year, too, we find him hurrying with his lessons (not slighting them), that he might get leisure to read and think. \"Leisure,\" he wrote his father, \"which is to me...", "...I had made our parting.

This picture, however, passed away very rapidly, and in an hour the rime was hardly to be seen even at the shadiest spots. Our path continually ran upwards, and went up and down from one mountain saddle to another. We saw several bears climbing up the rocks, for in these remote regions they are not very particular as to the mode of going home, and came across a herd of antelopes, some of which we shot.

In the middle of a wide, snow-covered pasture one will occasionally spring from under your feet, scattering the snow that covered him, and go whirring away through the dusk, lost instantly in the darkness--a single little life in the wild, bleak wilderness of winter fields!

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I noted no signs of storm, but by four o'clock--an hour earlier than usual--the larks had disappeared. They rose here and there from the grass as I crossed the fields, not as they do when feeding, far ahead of me, but close to my feet. They had gone to bed.

Furthermore, the eyes of those on board the brig, weary of continually gazing upon a bare horizon since the day upon which the friendly whaler had vanished from their view, were now gladdened by the sight of another craft, a small barque, that had drifted above the southern horizon during the night, and now lay some five miles away from them. As the morning wore on towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the aspect of the sky steadily, though by insensible degrees, assumed a more threatening character, the huge masses of cloud that overspread the entire dome of the visible sky darkening in tint to such an extent that the scene became enwrapped in a murky kind of twilight. That wind, and plenty of it, was brewing, seemed evident from the fact that the clouds, although not drifting across the sky, were working visibly, writhing and twisting into the most extraordinary and fantastic...", "...day; and without which they cannot work: with the age of many trees there left at a great fall in Edward the Third's time, by the name of forbid-trees, which at this day are called vorbid trees.

Every member of the party was especially cautioned to keep a sharp lookout on both sides of the road. Just as the day before, the morning came hot and still, and for hour after hour the straggling safari crawled slowly over the long waves of the undulating veldt. The road was a wagon track always vanishing in front toward the head of the valley. The land lay silent beneath the glaring sunlight. We outspanned at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for an hour. Over the country here grew small, scattered thorn trees, thick with thorns but with scarcely any leaves, so that the shade beneath them was thin and could shelter no more than one horse. The water in the canteens, cold at the start, had become warm now. When we mounted again, the sweat had dried on the horses, and the boots felt stiff on our feet. The line of the road still stretched away its interminable length until it disappeared in the distance. And then, as...", "...the garret of his house, my two favorite hiding-places. This garret, under the high Louis XIII roof, extended the full length of the house. The shutters of the place were seldom opened, and there was here, in consequence, almost perpetual twilight. The old things, belonging to a bygone century, lying there under the dust and cobwebs attracted me from the first day; and, little by little, the habit of slipping up there with my Telemaque had grown upon me. I usually stole up after the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> dinner, secure in the thought that no one would dream of looking for me there. At this noon hour of hot and radiant sunshine, the garret, by contrast, was almost as dark as night. Noiselessly I would throw open a shutter of one of the dormer windows and a flood of sunshine poured in; then I climbed out on the roof, and with elbows resting upon the sun-warmed old slate tiles overgrown with golden mosses, I would read my book. Around me, on this same roof, thousands of Agen plums...", "...the earth like singing stars: \"O wondrous hope, O sweetest hope, O passion realized at last; O end of hunger, fear, and wars, O victory over the bottomless, vast Valley of Death!\" A silence fell, Broke by the voice of Gabriel: \"Music may follow this, O Lord!

Part of the time the kafila would be in a narrow valley by the seashore, and in the next hour following a zigzag path on the side of some precipitous mountain. In such places the kafila would have to proceed in single file, while the Moors would be constantly cautioning the slaves against falling from the backs of their animals. While stopping for an hour at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for the horses to rest, the Krooman turned over a flat stone, and underneath it found a large scorpion. After making a hole in the sand about six inches deep, and five or six in diameter, he put the reptile into it. He then went in search of a few more scorpions to keep the prisoner company. Under nearly every stone he turned over, one or two of these reptiles were found, all of which were cast into the hole where he had placed the first.

He wanted some breakfast, but there was no way to get it.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he was still tramping--among the rabble which followed after the royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would attract his little lunatic powerfully. He followed the pageant through all its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster and the Abbey.

Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said: 'Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.' Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When at last they awoke, it was already dark night.

The morning of the 25th of July was ushered in by a bright sun, and other favourable appearances, denoting the continuance of fine weather. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> intelligence came that the enemy was advancing in strong force upon the pickets; in a few minutes the whole of our line was formed, and the 50th, 71st and 92nd drew up on the highest part of the ridge.--From thence were perceived large bodies, covered by a host of light troops, rapidly driving in our outposts.

Beneath the beeches leaves lay in yellow heaps like sliced turnip, and over all the strath was a pink haze; the fields were singed brown, except where a recent ploughing gave them a mourning border. From early morn men, women and children (Tommy among them) were in the fields taking up their potatoes, half-a-dozen gatherers at first to every drill, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it seemed a dozen, though the new-comers were but stout sacks, now able to stand alone. By and by heavy-laden carts were trailing into Thrums, dog-tired toilers hanging on behind, not to be dragged, but for an incentive to keep them trudging, boys and girls falling asleep on top of the load, and so neglecting to enjoy the ride which was their recompense for lifting. A growing mist mixed with the daylight, and still there were a few people out, falling over their feet with...", "...people at Track's End, being new to the country, judged that the winter had come to stay, and were discouraged; and so most of the rest of them went away. It began to snow on the morning of the twenty-fifth, with an east and northeast wind. The snow came down all day in big flakes, and by evening it was a foot deep. It turned colder in the night, and the wind shifted to the northwest. In the morning it was blizzarding. The air was full of fine snow blown before the wind, and before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> you could not see across the street. Some of the smaller houses were almost drifted under. This kept up for three days. Of course the train could not get through, and the one telegraph wire went down and left the town like an island alone in the middle of the ocean.

The most experienced hunters went forth, but returned with nothing, thankful for so little a mercy as the ability to get back to their half-shelter. Henry at last took his rifle and ventured out alone--the others were too listless to stop him--and before the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour he found a buffalo bull, some outcast from the herd which had gone southward, struggling in the snow. The bull was old and lean, and it took two bullets to bring him down, but his death meant their life and Henry hurried to the camp with the joyful news. It was clearly recognized that he had saved them, but no one said anything and Henry was glad of their silence.

We unhesitatingly preferred to follow the latter example, and therefore took the course that the luckier ones had indicated. Of course, the width of the ice-belt may be subject to somewhat fortuitous changes, but it seems, nevertheless, that as a rule the region between the 175th and the 180th degrees of longitude offers the best chance of getting through rapidly; in any case, one ought not to enter the ice farther to the west.

Sailing onward, we had 13, 14, 15, 16 fathoms of water, but very uneven bottom as we approached the shore. We laid our course N.N.E. and N.E. by N. and from the shore, S.S.W. and S.

Such a faith may sometimes, perhaps often does, lie in the heart like a seed buried beyond the reach of the sun, thoroughly alive though giving no sign: to grow too soon might be to die. Things had indeed gone farther with Dorothy and Richard, but the lobes of their loves had never been fairly exposed to the sun and wind ere the swollen clods of winter again covered them. Once, in the cold <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of a lovely day of frost, when the lightest step crackled with the breaking of multitudinous crystals, when the trees were fringed with furry white, and the old spider-webs glimmered like filigrane of fairy silver, they met on a lonely country-road.

And yet that outlaw done it--or something.\" They started down the gulch, looking for a good place to camp for the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal. Hesitation still led the pack horse, her line being hitched to his saddle-ring. They all kept a bright lookout on either hand for some possible path to the top of the bank by which the outlaw horse might have tried to get out of the gulch.

Alarmed at this, they galloped full speed to the cave.

We then drew on the meagre supply of cigarettes and lay on our bags, feeling as comfortable as the daintiest epicure after a twelve-course dinner, drinking his coffee and smoking his cigar. We talked till twelve o'clock, and then went outside to look at the midnight sun, shining brightly just above the southern horizon. Turning in, we were once more at home in our dreams. By a latitude shot at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Boxing Day, I found that our position was not as far north as expected. The following wind had been probably slightly east of south-east and too much westing had been made. From a tangle of broken ridges whose surface was often granular, half-consolidated ice, the end of the day opened up a lilac plain of sea-ice ahead.

We started to stow the lumber on the ship, running the boards fore and aft, then athwart ships. After having stowed a few tiers, the raft took shape, but great care had to be taken in starting it, as it was hard to keep the first boards from floating away. The raft could not draw over six feet, otherwise we could not float it ashore, but with this draft we could raft twenty thousand feet ashore and escape the shallow places in the harbor. I went ashore towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to hire ten natives to help unload cargo. Much to my surprise, the native Fijian is a man of leisure and not of toil. Shell-fishing is good, and the yams and bananas are within easy reach, so this gentleman prefers to bask in the sunshine rather than to work for a paltry shilling.

Roger refrained from enlightening him, not yet able to discuss the affair with a stranger, although knowing that in all probability the coroner would drag out a certain amount of the truth at the inquest. Ultimately, of course, it would be impossible to hush the matter up, since he had every intention of prosecuting Sartorius to the full extent of the law, and the man's guilt could not be established without implicating the dead woman. By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> there was nothing more that could be done for the immediate moment. The police had been notified, the inquest set for the day after to-morrow. A warrant had been sworn out for the arrest of Sartorius, who was not to be found. There was reason to believe he had visited his residence in the Route de Grasse after leaving the Villa Firenze, but so far no one appeared to have any knowledge of his subsequent movements. His car was missing, which provided a likely clue. It seemed...", "...swimming. Hopeful once more, they started eagerly toward the green wall of pines, soon finding, however, that it was no easy matter to cross this portion of the marsh, scantily covered with water though it was. Much of it was treacherous quagmire, and the boys sometimes sank down suddenly in the mud to their armpits. Once Hubert sank up to his neck, and nothing but his long stick saved him. They had left their log behind, but fortunately carried their long poles. It was near <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when they at length reached the high land where the pine trees grew. After plunging into a neighboring pool of comparatively clear water in order to wash the mud and slime from their bodies and clothing, the boys climbed wearily up the slope and lay down in the warm sunshine, shading their faces with palmetto leaves. Here they rested several hours, for the most part in troubled, feverish slumber.

In a few days he mobilized and equipped an army of one hundred and twenty thousand veterans, and in June he was ready to attack the British and Prussian forces in Belgium. At Quatre-Bras, on June 16, Ney fought an indecisive engagement with the former, while at Ligny, on the same day, Napoleon defeated the Prussians under Bluecher. On the 18th, Napoleon's army confronted that of Wellington before Waterloo. Before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the fight began. Ney made repeated and gallant charges against the solid British squares, but his cavalry was slaughtered. Late in the day Bluecher, after a forced march, arrived with part of his army, and, joining the British, sent the French forces flying. Napoleon barely escaped, and the allies pursued the shattered remnants of his army. The Napoleonic wars, which had cost nine million lives and untold treasure, and had remade the map of the world, were ended.

Lying the night at a roadside inn, and setting out again early in the morning, he reached Nantes soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the following day. Through that long and lonely ride through the dull plains of Brittany, now at their dreariest in their winter garb, he had ample leisure in which to review his actions and his position. From one who had taken hitherto a purely academic and by no means friendly interest in the new philosophies of social life, exercising his wits upon these new ideas merely as a fencer exercises his eye and wrist with the foils, without ever suffering himself to be deluded...", "...thrill, When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately; It was PRESCOTT, one since told me; he commanded on the hill.

At eleven the streets were swarming, for the red-coats' ranks were forming; At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> in marching order they were moving to the piers; How the bayonets gleamed and glistened, as we looked far down, and listened To the trampling and the drum-beat of the belted grenadiers! At length the men have started, with a cheer (it seemed faint-hearted), In their scarlet regimentals, with their knapsacks on their backs, And the reddening, rippling water, as after a sea-fight's slaughter, Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks.

Then she went and hid herself from all eyes till the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> had passed. \"Dear Godfrey,\" the letter ran, \"Papa says that you will return on Wednesday if I write to ask you.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I slept on the grass in the shade of a maple, where the river had found a broader channel than usual, and was spread out shallow, with frequent sand-bars exposed. In the names of the towns I recognized some which I had long ago read on teamsters' wagons, that had come from far up country; quiet, uplandish towns, of mountainous fame. I walked along, musing and enchanted, by rows of sugar-maples, through the small and uninquisitive villages, and sometimes was pleased with the...", "...were any ships in the road. I immediately gave orders to man and arm our boats and sent them up that same night, in order to surprise any ships that might be there; and with strict orders, if they found them too strong, to endeavour to prevent them from sending any thing on shore till I were able to work the ship up to them. This I endeavoured to do all night, but to very little purpose; for at day-light next morning I could not discern any thing above us.

It was a dreary morning, but about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the sun shone out, and Hubert, leaning upon his staff, bent his steps to the snug little summer-house in the garden. It was a quiet spot, and Hubert was glad to be there alone. The storm was over, the few remaining autumn flowers were fading, and the leaves were falling thickly from the trees, and Hubert, as he looked upon the scene around him, drew a deep sigh, and taking from his pocket his \"torn Bible,\" began to read. Absorbed in what he was doing, he did not see a little boy...", "...I pelted him with pieces of rock, one of which hit him very hard, and he dived down. After a time I pulled up my line, and whistling to him to return, although I did not see him, I went away to the cabin, fully expecting that he would soon follow me, for now he could walk (after his fashion) from the cabin to the pool as he pleased. This was early in the morning, and I busied myself with my garden, which was now in great luxuriance, for I had dressed it with guano; but observing about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that he had not returned, I became uneasy, and went down to the pool to look for him. He was not there, and I looked on the sea, but could not perceive him anywhere.

Peter Cheever had been extravagantly gallant the morning after her return from the mountains. He had added the last perfect tribute of suspicion and jealousy. They had even breakfasted together. She had dragged herself down to the dining-room, and he had neglected his morning paper, and lingered for mere chatter. He had telephoned from his office to ask her for the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour, too. He had taken her to the Bankers' Club for luncheon in the big Blue Room.

There was a twinge of shame as well as grief in the Master's heart that day, though he knew well that what he had done was unavoidable. Still, there was the sense of shame, of treachery.

The air was mild and sunshine filled the hollow, while Foster had just dined upon some very appetizing broth. The broth was thick with vegetables, but he did not think the meat in it came from a barn-door fowl.

Over and over again the one frail elevator was jammed with the laughing crowd and shot up to the hat factory on the ninth floor and back. The men smoked...", "...The quartette held solemn councils in the Prince's chambers, and there was much discussion, and considerable laughter. The latter, it appeared, was in consequence of Max's recollection of the wonderful record of his Highness at Brooklands.

The fine old place was, the Prince found, quite a comfortable residence. The widow did the honours gracefully, welcoming her guests warmly. When the two friends found themselves alone in the Prince's room, his Highness whispered to the exemplary vicar: \"I don't like the look of that Italian butler, Tommy.

Therefore he did not care if the summer stayed away forever, if only it would grow light enough to go about easily on snow-shoes. One day about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Lapp said: \"Come here, and you shall see something!\" Sampo crept out of the hut in the dark, and looked toward the south, for it was in that direction that his father pointed. There he saw a little red streak way down on the horizon. \"Do you know what that is?\" asked the Lapp. \"That is Southern Lights,\" said the boy. He had a good idea of the points of the compass, and knew very well that you could not see Northern Lights in the south. \"No,\" said his father, \"that is...", "...the river, varying from eight hundred to one thousand feet in height.

The pines were not here in thick impenetrable masses, but perched aloft in single groups on the heights, or shrouded by the livelier hues of the poplar and willow. We passed the mouth of the Red Willow River on the south bank, flowing through a deep ravine. It is the continuation of the route by the Pembina, before mentioned. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we entered the majestic Athabasca or Elk River. Its junction with the Clear Water River is called the Forks. Its banks were in accessible cliffs, apparently of clay and stones, about two hundred feet high, and its windings in the south were encircled by high mountains. Its breadth exceeded half a mile and was swelled to a mile in many places by long muddy islands in the middle covered with trees. No more portages interrupted our course, but a swift current hurried us towards the...", "...will scratch and bite you. Have you never seen his tail twitch, his eyes blaze, his claws work as he has crouched watching at a rat's hole, or crawled stealthily upon a bird in the meadow grass? So, if you will watch, you shall see a real wild turkey in the tamest old gobbler on the farm. Watch him go to roost. Watch him get _ready_ to go to roost, I should say, for a turkey seems to begin to think of roosting about noon-time, especially in the winter; and it takes him from about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> till night to make up his mind that he really must go to roost. He comes along under the apple-tree of a December afternoon and looks up at the leafless limbs where he has been roosting since summer. He stretches his long neck, lays his little brainless head over on one side, then over on the other. He takes a good _long_ look at the limb. Then bobs his head--one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-_ten_ times, or perhaps twenty-two or -three times, and takes a still...", "...of country, many wild glens and deep fastnesses hitherto untraversed, and these had to be discovered and explored. Straight through the territory assigned to them marched our little band; keen-nosed dogs went first, secured by leashes, that the game they continually aroused might not lead them astray; men followed who, like American Indians, looked for \"trails\" in every soft surface of ground, and along the banks of each stream of sweet water, where men might come to drink, but by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they had traversed the whole extent of their territory in a straight line, and discovered nothing. Once, indeed, they thought they were on the scent of man; but they had crossed the trail of a wild boar and could not restrain themselves from following it up, the scent was so fresh, and herein they wasted much time, but succeeded in killing their boar; and Etienne at once proposed that, since it was midday, they should light a fire and dine upon its flesh. The forester, old...", "...and they hauled round to the westward, the wind having shifted to the north. A succession of gales, however, and now and then a storm, that reduced them to their courses, drove them too much to the southward, prevented them from falling in even with the southernmost of the Kurile islands, and obliged them at last to give up all further thoughts of discovery to the north of Japan. On the 22nd, the gale having abated, they let out the reefs of the topsails and made more sail. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they were in latitude 40 deg. 58', and longitude 148 deg. 17', and two small land birds being taken on board, plainly indicated they could not be any great distance from the land; they therefore hauled up to the west-north-west, in which direction the southernmost islands seen by Spanberg, and said to be inhabited by hairy men, lay at the distance of about fifty leagues. They saw several other signs of land; but, on the 24th, the wind shifted to the north, and blew a fresh gale,...", "...Phrygian king.

Waggon after waggon, laden with comestibles, filed slowly into the park. The rushing to and fro of waiters and other attendants showed that they expected a busy day of it. As <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> approached, train after train deposited at the Aston station hundreds and thousands of gaily-attired Black Country people. Special trains ran from New Street as fast as they could be got in order; all the approaches to the park were crammed with serried lines--three or four abreast--of omnibuses, waggons, cabs, carts, and every other imaginable vehicle; whilst thousands upon thousands of dusty pedestrians jostled each other in the crowded roads.

The next morning (Sunday) as I left the railway station I thought detectives were watching me, but, in all probability, it was only the imagination of a guilty conscience. I was then wearing a full beard, and as a precautionary measure I, that morning, had all shaved off save the mustache. Not daring to leave Paris on the through express, which started at 3 o'clock p.m., nor to purchase a ticket to either Calais or London direct, I went to the station and took the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> accommodation train, which went no further toward Calais than Arras, a town some thirty miles from Paris. I arrived there about 1 p.m. As it would be a couple of hours before the express train was due, I went to a small hotel and ordered dinner.

He was not very conforming in his physical dress or in his appearance or anything else. But the main thing that impressed me most about him was his immaturity.

The very high summer temperatures of the area north of the tropic of Cancer are sufficiently accounted for, when compared with those observed south of the tropic, by the increased length of the day in the higher latitude, which more than compensates for the loss of heat due to the smaller mid-day altitude of the sun. The difference between the heating power of the sun's rays at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the 21st of June, in latitude 20 deg. and in latitude 45 deg., is only about 2%; while the accumulated heat received during the day, which is lengthened to 15-1/2 hours in the higher latitude, is greater by about 11% than in the lower latitude, where the day consists only of 13-1/4 hours.

Each of the other girls, previous to seeing Belton,...", "...had a clear channel. Our tents stood on ground high above the reach of flood. The soil was excellent, and the brushes behind us abounded with a new species of melaleuca. The heat of the weather, at this time, was extremely oppressive, and the thermometer was seldom under 100 degrees of Fahr. at noon. The wind, too, we observed, seldom remained stationary for any length of time, but made its regular changes every twenty-four hours. In the morning, it invariably blew from the N.E., at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it shifted to N.W., and as the sun set it flew round to the eastward of south. A few dense clouds passed over us occasionally, but no rain fell from them. DISEASES OF THE NATIVES. Our intercourse with the natives had now been constant. We had found the interior more populous than we had any reason to expect; yet as we advanced into it, the population appeared to increase. It was impossible for us to judge of the disposition of the natives during the short interviews we...", "...and then parted, I by water to the Wardrobe to meet my wife, but my Lady and they had dined, and so I dined with the servants, and then up to my Lady, and there staid and talked a good while, and then parted and walked into Cheapside, and there saw my little picture, for which I am to sit again the next week. So home, and staid late writing at my office, and so home and to bed, troubled that now my boy is also fallen sick of an ague we fear. 22nd. At the office all the morning. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Sir Williams both and I by water down to the Lewes, Captain Dekins, his ship, a merchantman, where we met the owners, Sir John Lewes and Alderman Lewes, and several other great merchants; among others one Jefferys, a merry man that is a fumbler, and he and I called brothers, and he made all the mirth in the company. We had a very fine dinner, and all our wives' healths, with seven or nine guns apiece; and exceeding merry we were, and so home by barge again, and I vexed to find...", "...February 1st. Up, and to the office pretty betimes, and the Board not meeting as soon as I wished, I was forced to go to White Hall in expectation of a Committee for Tangier, but when I come it was put off, and so home again to the office, and sat till past two o'clock; where at the Board some high words passed between Sir W. Pen and I, begun by me, and yielded to by him, I being in the right in finding fault with him for his neglect of duty. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> home to dinner, and after dinner out with my wife, thinking to have gone to the Duke of York's playhouse, but was, to my great content in the saving my vow, hindered by coming a little too late; and so, it being a fine day, we out to Islington, and there to the old house and eat cheese-cakes and drank and talked, and so home in the evening, the ways being mighty bad, so as we had no pleasure in being abroad at all almost, but only the variety of it, and so to the office, where...", "...laughingly said, \"You ought to send this trunk free a thousand miles to pay for my big scold at you.\" The man good-naturedly replied, \"Where will you have it sent?\" I answered \"Oban,\" and he booked it. At 6 o'clock we took the front seat with the driver on a great high stage which we mounted by a ladder--they call the stage the \"machine\"--and drove a few miles to the Trossachs Hotel, past Loch Achray and Loch Vennachar.... While the rain rested this <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I took a walk up the ravine and it seemed very like going up the mountain at Grandfather Anthony's.

The next mornin' you'll find lots o' little spots where they've tiptoed in to see if the paint's dry an' how it's goin' to look. Where I work, they most allers say it's the cat,--well! that answer may deceive some folks, but 't wouldn't me.--Don't slop your paint, Gilbert; work quick an' neat an' even; then paintin' ain't no trick 't all.

By-and-by it cleared, and I headed westward towards Bozen, among the tangle of rocks where the Dwarf King had once his rose-garden. The first night I had no inn but slept in the vile cabin of a forester, who spoke a tongue half Latin, half Dutch, which I failed to master. The next day was a blaze of heat, the mountain-paths lay thick with dust, and I had no wine from sunrise to sunset. Can you wonder that, when the following <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I saw Santa Chiara sleeping in its green circlet of meadows, my thought was only of a deep draught and a cool chamber? I protest that I am a great lover of natural beauty, of rock and cascade, and all the properties of the poet: but the enthusiasm of Rousseau himself would sink from the stars to earth if he had marched since breakfast in a cloud of dust with a throat like the nether millstone. Yet I had not entered the place before Romance revived. The little town--a mere...", "...when we passed the backbone and approached the station, the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter. He could not have six horses all the time, so he made the most of his chance while he had it. Up to this point we had been in the heart of the William Tell region. The hero is not forgotten, by any means, or held in doubtful veneration. His wooden image, with his bow drawn, above the doors of taverns, was a frequent feature of the scenery. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we arrived at the foot of the Bruenig Pass, and made a two-hour stop at the village hotel, another of those clean, pretty, and thoroughly well-kept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote country-towns. There was a lake here, in the lap of the great mountains, the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered Swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens, and from...", "...his duty more promptly and more thoroughly than I had ever seen it done. When those who had been summoned to headquarters appeared on the parade-ground once more, they were surrounded by eager comrades, all anxious to know what had been said to them; but they could give very little definite information, and were unwilling to talk openly regarding the matter, for the reason, as I fancied, that some of them, being privy to the desertion, had denied such fact to the officers. Well, by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it seemed as if the matter had entirely blown over. Everything went along much as on the day previous, save that, according to my idea, there was a more healthy tone among the men, because we no longer heard talk of surrender, and I suggested that perhaps Colonel Gansevoort was as glad to be rid of his mutinous soldiers as Sergeant Corney had been to see them depart. It goes without saying that all of us, whether on duty or not, kept a sharper lookout over the enemy's encampment...", "...told this day, by one of the greater Ministers of State in England, and one of the King's Cabinet, that we had little left to agree on between the Dutch and us towards a peace, but only the place of treaty; which do astonish me to hear, but I am glad of it, for I fear the consequence of the war. But he says that the King, having all the money he is like to have, we shall be sure of a peace in a little time. 9th. Up and to the office, where did a good deale of business, and then at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to the Exchange and to my little goldsmith's, whose wife is very pretty and modest, that ever I saw any. Upon the 'Change, where I seldom have of late been, I find all people mightily at a losse what to expect, but confusion and fears in every man's head and heart.

Morning came, and the sun, and still there were no signs of the camp. Jones was very hungry, but the tinned delicacies were still the fair offspring of imagination, which filleth not the stomach. He travelled on, in despite of the sun, for the camp _could_ not now be far off; and he would have continued to plod forward until he dropped, but that he received before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> a terrible fright, which sent him into cover for many hours of dangerous daylight. There were sounds of hoofs, and the soul of the bimbashi rejoiced. \"It is some of our fellows doing a cavalry reconnoitre,\" he reflected; and when they came, as he judged by the sound, within earshot, he treated them to a \"coo-ee,\" and stood up to look out for a view and to hear their reply. Presently the troop passed across an open patch between mimosa bushes, and Jones saw, not hussars or...", "...in the reflection that for every dead shark there were hundreds of living ones. The day being very hot, I was in the act of lowering a couple of buckets over the side to get a supply of salt water to cool the decks with, when somehow or other the rope attached to them slipped out of my hand, and down went the buckets to the bottom of the ocean. This was most annoying, as we were now reduced to one bucket. Sailing in mid-ocean, and having no coast to steer by, we \"took the sun\" at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> each day, in order to determine our position and keep our course or alter it accordingly. By our calculations we should soon sight North Island, as we had now been five days out at sea. We had no chronometer on board, so we could not be certain of our exact position. On the evening of the eighth day out from Ralume, New Britain, we found ourselves ten miles to leeward of North Island. We rectified our course and, travelling night and day, beat our way between a perfect nest...", "...morning. With the loss of his new foresail, and rats in the flour, and worst of all forgetting to wind the chronometer, a fatal result of his preoccupation with the storm, he was the picture of a man doomed to despair, and I, for one, approached him very gingerly. With a look of disdain at Old Charlie, he said, \"To Hell with breakfast! All you beachcombers think of is eating. Haul the gaff to windward. Bend on the old foresail, or we shall be blown clear across to Japan.\" Towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the wind let up a little, enough to carry lower sails. Even with a heavy sea we were able to make five and one-half knots, but were off our course four points, as the wind was still south southeast. \"Mr. Mate, the Captain wants to see you.\" \"All right, Olsen.\" In the cabin the Captain was walking in a circle. \"Damn it all,\" he cried, \"why couldn't _you_remind me to wind the chronometer?\" \"I did not know that you had one on board, sir.\" \"Hell and damnation!

To assist in keeping the lower decks warm, as well as to retard, in some slight degree, the formation of ice immediately in contact with the ships' bends, we banked the snow up against their sides as high as the main chains; and canvass screens were nailed round all the hatchways on the lower deck. The stars of the second magnitude in Ursa Major were just perceptible to the naked eye a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> this day, and the Aurora Borealis appeared faintly in the southwest at night. About this time our medical gentlemen began to remark the extreme difficulty with which sores of every kind healed; a circumstance that rendered it the more necessary to be cautious in exposing the men to frostbites, lest the long inactivity and want of exercise during the cure of sores, in other respects trifling, should produce serious effects upon the general health of the patients. During the...", "...bore guns did not reach the enemy's position, we ceased firing, and I sent a request that you should send to me the thirty-pounder rifled gun attached to Captain Carlisle's Battery, at the same time I shifted the New York Sixty-ninth to the extreme right of the brigade. There we remained till we heard the musketry fire across Bull Run, showing that the head of Colonel Hunter's column was engaged. This firing was brisk, and showed that Hunter was driving before him the enemy, till about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when it became certain that the enemy had come to a stand, and that our force on the other side of Bull Run was all engaged, artillery and infantry. \"Here you sent me the order to cross over with the whole brigade to the assistance of Colonel Hunter.

He put on his hat and coat. \"Where are you going, Abe?\" Morris asked. Abe waggled his head solemnly. \"You shouldn't ask me, Mawruss,\" he said. \"I got an idee.\" It was a quarter to twelve when Abe left the loft building on Nineteenth Street, and he repaired immediately to the real-estate salesroom on Vesey Street, where auction sales of real estate are held at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> daily. To this center of real-estate activity comes every real-estate broker of the East Side, together with his brothers from Harlem and the Bronx, and Abe felt reasonably sure that B. Rashkin would be on hand. Indeed, he had hardly entered the salesroom when he descried B. Rashkin standing on the outskirts of a little throng that surrounded the rostrum of a popular auctioneer. \"Now, gentlemen,\" said the auctioneer, \"what am I offered for this six-story, four-family house....", "...patient. The Jew recited several verses connected with the name of Solomon, and the devils came forth through the noses of the patients.

The canoes, already loaded, lay moored near by, awaiting the word to be given that would send the little expedition on its way up-stream. Of course the news had got abroad, though Max would much rather have kept it a secret, if they could. But Herb and his friends, as well as some other boys of the river town, were on hand to see the start. And as was natural, a heap of...", "...remarkable, that on sounding, when not more than a mile from the land, there was no bottom found with eighty fathoms of line. Within the islands there appeared to be some fine harbours, and they probably afford a variety of refreshments.

By four o'clock, they were close in with the southernmost land, and saw a great number of canoes sailing close to the shore, some of which came towards the ship, and two of them very near, but nothing would entice them to come along-side. The people appeared much the same as those at Henderville's Island, and their canoes were of a similar construction;...", "...Graymouse, lived near Pond Lily Lake. Mother Graymouse usually visited her each year in August. The children had been looking forward to this trip for many days. The bag which had once held the Christmas candy, was packed with dainties for the little Field-Mouse Cousins.

Tiny and Teenty raced merrily on ahead, picking bouquets of wild blossoms and calling gaily to the butterflies and honey bees who were flitting among the flowers. By-and-by, the tired little party stopped to rest under a clump of red clover. Granny Whiskers had slipped a ginger cookie into each tiny pocket when they called at her door to say good-by. These cookies made a nice luncheon for them. \"How much farther is it, Mammy?\" asked Tiny. \"We...", "...[Illustration: Cross section of monitor.] Sectional View of Monitor through Turret and Pilot House.

Meanwhile the big guns in the Monitor's turret, firing every seven minutes, were pounding the ram's sides with terrible blows. The Merrimac's armor was at points crushed in several inches, but nowhere pierced, About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the fight stopped, as if by mutual consent. It was a drawn battle, but the career of the Merrimac had ended. Upon McClellan's advance, in May, she was blown up. The Monitor received no serious injury in this action, but the next December she foundered in a storm off Cape Hatteras. The invention of the Monitor revolutionized naval warfare, and set European nations to building the ponderous iron-clad navies of the present day. The United States Government soon contracted for...", "...she lowered the sash. \"Get what?\" Her visitor walked to the other front window and stooped to peer out.

From their feet two long streaks of black shadow darted back into the room, and vanished. Overhead an octopus of lightning snatched the whole heavens in its grasp, shook them, and disappeared.

Yet in a minute it was clear that the world still rolled on, and each looked at the other and laughed at her fright--till the prospect of an evening of storm sobered them both. \"Mercy!\" Mrs. Pollard...", "...the last time. The weather continued perfectly calm till the evening of the 4th of November, when some ominous looking clouds indicated an approaching storm. In addition to the Sceptre there remained in the Bay the Jupiter of 50 guns, the Oldenburg, a Danish 64 gun ship, and several other vessels. On the morning of the 5th, a strong gale blew from the north-west, but no danger was apprehended, and the ship, dressed in flags, and with the royal standard hoisted, fired her salute at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> in commemoration of the Gunpowder Treason. The gale had increased considerably by two o'clock, and as Table Bay affords no shelter from a north-west wind, the captain took every precaution to make all secure: the topmasts were struck, and the fore and main-yards were lowered to ease the ship. But half-an-hour had not elapsed before the violence of the storm was such, that the ship parted from her best bower cable; the sheet anchor was immediately let go, and the cable veered...", "...is?\" He drew himself away from her with a gesture, and in a minute answered with cold deliberation: \"I cannot cease to love my own wife because--because she's not always exactly the same.\" They sat silent beside each other. At length Milly rose from the sofa. The tinselled scarf, that other woman's delicate finery, had slipped from the white beauty of her shoulders. She drew it around her again slowly, and slowly with bowed head left the room.

My wife went up to the dining room to my Lady Paulina, and I staid below talking with Mr. Moore in the parley, reading of the King's and Chancellor's late speeches at the proroguing of the Houses of Parliament. And while I was reading, news was brought me that my Lord Sandwich is come and gone up to my Lady, which put me into great suspense of joy, so I went up waiting my Lord's coming out of my Lady's chamber, which by and by he did, and...", "...frisky fellows and enlivened this little journey by running away. Wilbur got them under control with little trouble, but it was noticed afterward that one of the wheels of the wagon had been injured by striking against a tree. Because his load would not be so heavy as the others, Austin was given this wagon. The morning they were to start every one was up early and eager to be off; but as is always the case at such times, they found more to do than they had supposed, and it was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when they left the house. They stopped in town to get groceries and a few things needed for the work, and were off again. Only Mr. Hill knew where the hay-fields were located, and as the road led through a rough country, he took the lead, the others following, making a jolly little caravan. They had not gone far on the way when all the joy of the trip was taken away for Austin. He saw a suspicious-looking brown bottle pass between Ned and Mr. Hill. Too well he knew what that...", "...However, the scheme had failed, and I was more strongly guarded than before. Von Theyer gave the strictest orders to the two troopers, one of whom was Franz, the comrade of the dead Ober. This man eyed me most maliciously, and I felt sure he would be a splendid tool in furthering the colonel's scheme. From boyhood, riding had been one of my chief pleasures; but this new style, tied hand and foot and bound to a horse's back, was a novelty I did not appreciate. Towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we halted beside a pleasant stream, a tributary of the Maros; and having attended to the animals, the men sat down to their frugal dinner. Now, since there is no satisfaction to be obtained in hanging a dead man, Von Theyer was compelled to give me some food; and this, with the temporary freedom of my arms, was a great relief. Having finished their black bread and cheese, most of the men began to smoke. Some rolled out their greatcoats and went to sleep, while others played...", "...back that both Charles Collier and his daughter were somewhere in Europe, but no one appeared to know just where. If his efforts established anything at all, it seemed to be the fact that Lefty had been mistaken in thinking he had seen Virginia in New York; for if she were there, surely some of these people would know of it. The feeling of helplessness, of fighting against greedy and remorseless forces too strong for him to checkmate, pressed upon him heavily. It was a little after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when he called the office of the _Blade_. He wanted to talk to Stillman again. If anybody in New York could find a person wanted, the reporter was the man to do it, and Locke believed that for friendship's sake Stillman would attempt it. Near the telephone switchboard in the hotel were two long shelves, situated a little distance apart, at which patrons could consult the different directories. At one of these, several persons were looking up numbers, so Locke took his book to...", "...the sleeping woods all night Singeth a quiet tune.

Philip was now close at hand at Amiens, and the English, hemmed in between the great French army and the river, were thus without way of escape. It was necessary at least to leave Airaines. Edward was thoughtful and silent. He ordered mass to be said before sunrise, and the trumpets sounded for marching. At ten the English left Airaines, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the French entered the town. They found it full of provisions left by the English; the meat was still on the spits, there was bread in the ovens, wine in barrels, and even tables laid ready for dinner. Here the French took up their quarters. The English meanwhile had taken the little town of Oisemont, and established themselves there for the night.

A tragic event occurred at this farm-house in 1775, when Warren was a boy of fourteen. It was on an October day, in the midst of the apple- gathering season, about the time when the Warren Russet had attained all the maturity it can upon its native tree. Farmer Warren was out in his orchard. His wife, a woman worthy of being the mother of such a son as she had, was indoors getting dinner ready for her husband, her four boys, and the two laborers upon the farm. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she sent her youngest son, John, mentioned in the above inscription, to call his father to dinner. On the way to the orchard the lad met the two laborers carrying towards the house his father's dead body. While standing upon a ladder gathering apples from a high tree, Mr. Warren had fallen to the ground and broken his neck. He died almost instantly. The _Boston Newsletter_ of the following week bestowed a few lines upon the occurrence; speaking of him as a man of good...", "...murmuring, And on the boughs the birds forgot to sing.

A few minutes after midnight we were relieved from our fears by the sudden springing up of a fresh breeze from South-West, and in a moment found ourselves comparatively out of danger. At daylight we were eight miles to the north-east of Caffarelli Island; whence we steered to the South-West by West and South-South-West. Brue Reef was seen as we passed by it. At noon our latitude was 16 degrees 14 minutes 1 second, Cape Leveque bearing South. From <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> until one o'clock we were steering South-South-West, but made no progress, on account of an adverse tide which occasionally formed such strong eddies and ripplings that we were several times obliged to steer off to get without their influence.

This is Mrs. Marvin.\" The morning session had opened, and fresh young voices could be plainly heard. They were singing Ida's favorite, an old song, \"All hail, pleasant morning.\" Mrs. Marvin heard a faint...", "...and then feeling a little better, got on my mule and started. I was so ill as to be obliged to hold on to the pommel of my saddle and several times to get off and lie down.

On reaching camp we partook of a breakfast of United States rations, the first full meal which we had had for a long time. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> those that were able walked to Wilmington, a distance of nine miles. We were here met by officers who provided us with another meal, and then we were quartered in churches and private residences.

He then dismounted, laid his spear across the road, and having said a number of short prayers, concluded with three loud whistles; after which he listened for some time, as if in expectation of an answer, and receiving none, told us we might proceed without fear, for there was no danger. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we passed a number of large villages quite deserted, the inhabitants having fled into Kasson to avoid the horrors of war.

There was a long procession of English cavalry and marines, enlarged by a great number of native cavalry. It was shortly before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> that their majesties appeared at the entrance. The approach was made known by a salute of 101 guns. They were welcomed by the great throng present, every one rising to his feet, and they drove round the grand stand showing themselves to all present.

The heavy fighting of September 19th showed that Bragg realized the situation. Brigades and regiments were shattered. For a time, the Union army was driven back. But at nightfall Thomas had regained the lost ground. He re-formed during the night in order to protect the road leading into Chattanooga. Since the second day was foggy till the middle of the forenoon, the fighting was not renewed till late. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> a break was made in the right of the Federal battle-line, into which the eager Longstreet promptly hurled his men.

We therefore continued to steer to the east, only lying-to a few hours in the night, and in the morning resumed our course again, four miles north and south from each other; the hazy weather not permitting us to spread farther. We passed two or three small pieces of rock weed, and saw two or three birds known by the name of egg-birds; but saw no other signs of land. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we observed in latitude 48 deg. 36' S., longitude 59 deg. 35' E. As we could only see a few miles farther to the south, and as it was not impossible that there might be land not far off in that direction, I gave orders to steer S. 1/2 E., and made the signal for the Adventure to follow, she being by this movement thrown a-stern: The weather continuing hazy till half an hour past six o'clock in the evening, when it cleared up so as to enable us to see about five leagues round us....", "...to ask for the key. They must have the key to find that ball, and the boys trudged back to meet Sam just going home from the Pentzes'. But Sam refused to ask for the key again, He didn't want to bother his father so soon, and he didn't want the bother himself. He had his new \"Caesar\" lesson to study; to-morrow, after school, he and Jonas would look round at the house, and find some way to recover the ball, for even the stern and studious Sam knew the value of a ball. So Thursday <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the boys all hurried up to the Wilson house,--Sam, Jonas, and all. They examined it on every side. They came back to the hole where the ball was lost. \"There's the cold-air box,\" said Jonas. \"Could not Dick crawl in?\" Now, Dick was a very small pattern of a boy, indeed, to be still a boy. Really he might crawl into the cold-air box. He tried it! He did get in!

In the course of half an hour the stranger was again a little abaft the beam, and he was materially nearer than when first seen. No change was made in the route of the stranger, who now seemed disposed to stand out to sea, with the wind as it was, on an easy bowline, without paying any attention to the sail in sight.

Of course, as they drew nearer and nearer, it was possible for those on board of each to note the appearance, equipments, and other peculiarities of his neighbour.

The morning proved for Grenville another exasperation. He thought of nothing by way of labor he could advantageously perform. Their defense, though crude, was fairly complete, and could scarcely be improved.

By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he was fairly in a mood to seek out the island's invaders alone, to hasten some definite action. That the natives intended to starve them into a visit to the spring seemed all too obvious.

Greenwich noon, being that necessarily used by the navigator, is adopted as the standard, but we must not conclude that the ephemeris for Greenwich noon is referred to the meridian of Greenwich in the sense that we refer a longitude to that meridian. Greenwich noon is 18h 51m 48s, Washington mean time; so the ephemeris which gives data for every Greenwich <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> may be considered as referred to the meridian of Washington giving the data for 17h 51m 48s, Washington time, every day. The rule adopted, therefore, is to have all the ephemerides which refer to absolute time, without any reference to a meridian, given for Greenwich noon, unless there may be some special reason to the contrary. For the needs of the navigator and the theoretical astronomer these are the most convenient epochs. Another part of the ephemeris gives the position of...", "...N. E. to E. S.

Sanford had ascertained that the ship sailed early on Thursday morning, and the steamer on which they had taken passage could not arrive at Gottenburg till nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Saturday.

The same day at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they arrived at a plantation. Eagerly foraging here, but not expecting to find anything, they turned a little from the road, and came upon a barn full of maize in the husk. Beating down the door, they fell upon it and devoured it as rapaciously as a herd of swine, till they fell off satiated. A distribution was then made of it to each man, for hunger does not care for cooking. Loaded with this grain they continued their march in high spirits for about two hours, when they came...", "...nothing could be done; the cable was veered out again, and the men sent below. \"We hope you'll think of your promise to us, sir,\" said Bramble to the officer, as he was going down. \"Yes, I will, I swear,\" replied he, slapping Bramble on the back.

The Frenchmen now became very impatient, but there was no help for it; they walked about the deck, swearing and stamping, and throwing out invectives against the fog and rain as they looked up at it.

Other flowers there may be that yield as rich perfume, but they must be crushed before their fragrance becomes perceptible; but _this_ flower at early morn, at burning <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and when the dew of eve is on the flowers, has coursed its way down the garden walk, out through the deep, dark dell, over the burning plain, and up the mountain side--_up_, ever UP it rises into the beautiful blue--up along the cloudy corridors of the day, up along the misty pathway to the skies till it touches the beautiful shore and mingles with the breath of angels.\" Hardly was there a dissenting voice in all St. Antipas that Sabbath upon the proposal that this powerful...", "...very precious treasure was not far distant. Overwhelming as was this feeling, the belief that she was unconscious of her state added to our anxiety. We longed to be permitted an evidence from her own lips that she felt accepted through Christ her Saviour; though her humble walk with God through life would have assured us, had there been no such expression. Our desires were, however, mercifully granted, to our humbling admiration of that grace which had made her what she was. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she roused a little, and, one of the medical men having stated that a few hours would probably produce a great change for better or for worse, her beloved husband concluded it best to inform her that she was not likely to continue long amongst us.

But that day homesteaders crept into dugouts and smothered over buffalo chip fires.

On his return to town Alaric found a letter from Captain Cuttwater, pressing very urgently for the repayment of his money. It had been lent on the express understanding that it was to be repaid when Parliament broke up. It was now the end of October, and Uncle Bat was becoming uneasy. Alaric, when he received the letter, crushed it in his hand, and cursed the strictness of the man who had done...", "...leave off, and come again tomorrow morning.\" \"No water,\" she murmured, turning away. \"I can send you up some from Blooms-End,\" said Clym, coming forward and raising his hat as the men retired.

The train did not run beyond Lindau and a change was necessary. The change revealed the fact that there was a custom-house at that point. An unexpected custom-house is one of the worst features of continental travel; but the officials of Lindau were delightful, drew chalk circles on everything, and sent every one upon their way rejoicing. Our party went around the...", "...give our love to Jane, if you see her, she lives in Illinois.\" Illinois and Dakota were all the same to them! Again we started forth along the graceful, irregular, elm-shaded roads, which intersected the land in every direction, perfectly happy except when we remembered our empty pockets. We could not get accustomed to the trees and the beauty of the vineclad stone walls. The lanes made _pictures_ all the time. So did the apple trees and the elms and the bending streams. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of this day we came to a farm of very considerable size and fairly level, on which the hay remained uncut. \"Here's our chance,\" I said to my brother, and going in, boldly accosted the farmer, a youngish man with a bright and pleasant face. \"Do you want some skilled help?\" I called out. The farmer admitted that he did, but eyed us as if jokers. Evidently we did not look precisely like workmen to him, but I jolted him by saying, \"We are Iowa schoolboys out for a vacation. We were...", "...this place. They'll be all right.\" Another fortnight passed. It was now early in November; the weather gloomy, and by no means favourable to evening strolls. Gammon wanted much to see both Polly and Mrs. Clover; he had all but made up his mind to write to both of them, yet could not decide on the proper tone in either case. Was he to be humble to Mrs. Clover? Should he beg pardon of Polly? That kind of thing did not come easily to him. On a day of thin yellow fog he returned about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> from seeing to a piece of business, the result of which he had to report at once to Mr. Quodling.

The wind however seemed but to aggravate the drought, by the great body of sand it lifted and swept up the valleys, obscuring the near horizon, and especially concealing the whole delta of the Cosi, where the clouds were so vast and dense, and ascended so high as to resemble another element.

Then I again embarked, taking the lagging boat in tow of my own. Passing the mouths of the Cosi, the gale and currents were so adverse that we had to bring up on the sand, when the quantity which drifted into the boat rendered the delay as disagreeable as it was tedious. The particles penetrated everywhere, up my nose and down my back, drying my eyelids, and gritting between my teeth. The craft kept bumping on the...", "...a very lucky one.

From one corner, where an _anciano_ had burned some rubbish, rose a lazy pennon of smoke, but the brown girls, women, and children who usually filled the compound with restless life were in full enjoyment of the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> _siesta_. Within its bright walls, the place dozed in the pleasant shade of its towering cottonwoods. Somehow the stillness recalled to Bull's mind the Spaniard's house he had shown Gordon from the railroad--sacked, burned, its vacant windows staring like empty eyes over the desert. His face clouded.

Here was a great abundance of wild cherries, plums, gooseberries, and currants. The stream, however, like most of the others which we passed, was dried up with the heat, and we had to dig holes in the sand to find water for ourselves and our horses.

With us Mr. Creed, who has been deeply engaged at the office this day about the ending of his accounts, wherein he is most unhappy to have to do with a company of fools who after they have signed his accounts and made bills upon them yet dare not boldly assert to the Treasurer that they are satisfied with his accounts. Hereupon all dinner, and walking in the garden the afternoon, he and I talking of the ill management of our office, which God knows is very ill for the...", "...to myself as I compared our plight with that of Cinderella. We met at breakfast in the hotel dining-room, a queer-looking crowd. As we laughed at each other's appearance, it was hard for each to realize that he or she looked just as absurd; but an unprejudiced observer would have found little to choose between us. As soon as the meal was over, the three men started out to find a way to get us all home again. Everything seemed to conspire to delay us, and it was half-past twelve at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when we entered our own gate, the click of the latch bringing Bruno's face to the window with a series of joyful barks. Poor fellow! His long confinement to the house, his empty plate and bowl, his joyful reception of us, and then his springing out to dash round and round the lot, filled our hearts with compassion.

On his part, had he consulted his own feelings only, he would then and there have turned them out, and locked the doors behind them.

Cook's longitudes in this voyage are all given as west of Greenwich, not divided into east and west, as is usual at this day. The latter system again has only been adopted universally since his time. Though Cook himself gives, at the beginning of the Journal, a note of the method of reckoning days adopted, it may not be amiss to give further explanation here. It was the usual custom on board ships to keep what was known as Ship time--i.e., the day began at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> BEFORE the civil reckoning, in which the day commences at midnight. Thus, while January 1st, as ordinarily reckoned, is from midnight to midnight, in ship time it began at noon on December 31st and ended at noon January 1st, this period being called January 1st. Hence the peculiarity all through the Journal of the p.m. coming before the a.m. It results that any events recorded as occurring in the p.m. of January 1st in the log, would, if translated into the ordinary system, be...", "...speaks out of their eyes.

Only on the south and west was the horizon bounded by jagged peaks and summits of snow-topped mountains. Glacial action has everywhere worn down the surface into rounded rolling domes and slopes, and for hundreds of miles the land is one wide moorland of grass and moss. Here are many flocks of wild sheep and mountain goats, and here moose and caribou are said to abound. During the day, about the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour, a giant bull moose had stalked deliberately through the midst of the camp, neither quickening his pace, nor fearing man. So engrossed were the men in their search for gold, that none dropped pick or shovel to molest him.

She was certain that, at the worst, he could not by any possibility be delayed beyond supper-time, for he was needed to get supper--or, rather, as Lidey expressed it, to help her get supper for mother!

Each one of this cofraternity dwells a day in his turn with the joint mistress, counting from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of one day to the same time of the next, after which he departs, and another comes for the like time. Thus they spend their time without the care or trouble of wives and children, yet maintain their mistresses well according to their rank.

The one narrow road, a mere muddy track along which the army was encamped, was choked with the marching columns. As always happened when we had to change camp, everything that the men could not carry, including, of course, the officers' baggage, was left behind. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Rough Riders struck camp and drew up in column beside the road in the rear of the First Cavalry. Then we sat down and waited for hours before the order came to march, while regiment after regiment passed by, varied by bands of tatterdemalion Cuban insurgents, and by mule-trains with ammunition.

I was invited to go further by seeing from this anchoring-place all open before me; which therefore I designed to search before I left the bay. So on the 11th about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I steered farther in, with an easy sail because we had but shallow water: we kept therefore good looking-out for fear of shoals; sometimes shortening, sometimes deepening the water. About 2 in the afternoon we saw the land ahead that makes the south of the bay, and before night we had again shoalings from that shore: and therefore shortened sail and stood off and on all night under, 2 topsails, continually sounding, having never more than 10 fathom, and seldom less than 7.

One \"dominant\" individual would initiate a series of calls, and others each in turn would take up the chorus. Pairing takes place soon after the breeding aggregations are formed. On the night of June 4, 1954, a clasping pair was captured and kept in the laboratory in a large jar of water. This pair did not separate, and spawning occurred between <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and 1:30 P. M. on June 5. When the newly laid eggs were discovered at 1:30 P.

The pair was still joined, but the male was actually clasping only part of the time, and as the frogs moved about in the water, it became evident that they were adhering to each other by the areas of skin contact, which were glued together by their dermal secretion. They were unable to separate...", "...the world in such a tumult.

A short consultation among themselves followed this proposal, at the end of which they declared themselves quite willing, but stipulated that they should have twenty-four hours clear after signing, in which to provide themselves with an outfit for the voyage.

No sooner, however, were his intentions unmasked, and the line of his operations manifested, than Lord Wellington, with an energy equal to the mighty occasion that demanded it, poured down with the whole force under his command to meet him.

Still the troops pressed forward, and by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came within hearing of the heavy cannonade in front, which indicated the situation of the battle. From this time aide-de-camp followed aide-de-camp in quick succession, who, from their scared looks and hurried gestures, seemed to bode but ill-fortune to the cause we cared for. What the precise situation of the rival armies might be we knew not; but we heard the French were in overwhelming numbers; that the Dutch troops had abandoned their position; the Hanoverians being driven...", "...fire there. First we see the dog, and then the fire. The fire could be put out, and it would be difficult to find the burnt sticks in the dark.

As hour by hour I toiled upward, in places so steep that I had to use both hands and knees, I gradually neared the region of eternal snow. Soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I halted, seating myself upon a rock to rest. Gloomy thoughts oppressed me. Below was nothing but a sea of vapour; above a sky brilliant, without a cloud. Being compelled to pass through that curious gorge of grey, eternal mist, I had lost my bearings entirely, and knew not in what direction I was now journeying.

When <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> came, and there was still no word from them, our anxiety increased. Then Mad Plume's sister returned and told us to take courage. Both Spotted Bull and Lone Runner, chief of the River Crows, and some of the clan chiefs of both tribes, were for accepting the peace pipe, but that other clan chiefs, and a good number of warriors wanted the pipe sent back. The objectors to peace were mostly those who had lost relatives in the Arrow River fight. She thought that these would eventually...", "...him to bed to sleep off the effects of the blow. * * * * * With the ship fully equipped, tested and checked in every possible way, the time for leaving was set for the following Saturday, three days off. Great supplies of stores had to be carried aboard in the meantime. Care had to be exercised in this work, lest the cargo slip free under varying acceleration of the _Solarite_, and batter itself to bits, or even wreck some vital part of the ship. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the day chosen, the first ship ever to leave the bounds of the Earth's gravity was ready to start! Gently the heavily laden _Solarite_ rose from the hangar floor, and slowly floated out into the bright sunshine of the early February day. Beside it rode the little ship that Arcot had first built, piloted by the father of the inventor. With him rode the elder Morey and a dozen newsmen. The little ship was badly crowded now as they rose slowly, high into the upper reaches of the...", "...to himself by a new noise in one of the upper storeys, he found that he was standing on the bottom step of the stairs, holding fast to the round gilt ball that surmounted the last post of the banisters. He moved from there to the warmth of the house-door, and, for some time before going out, stood sunning himself, a forlorn figure, with eyes that blinked at the light. He felt very cold, and weak to the point of faintness. This sensation reminded him that he had had no solid food since <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the day before. His first business was obviously to eat a meal. Fighting a growing dizziness, he trudged into the town, and, having pawned his watch, went to a restaurant, and forced himself to swallow the meal that was set before him--though there were moments when it seemed incredible that it was actually he who plied knife and fork. He would have been glad to linger for a time, after eating, but the restaurant was crowded, and the waiter openly impatient for him to be gone. As...", "...She would still be the loveliest and best, and his would be the privilege of telling her so. And to Osmond, who had dug in the ground that Peter might work under the eye of men, he would return as one who has an account to give, and say, in effect, \"You did it.\" But, laughably, neither of these things had happened. He forgot that he had in him the beginnings of a great painter in remembering that he had shown the obtuseness of an ass. He did not see Electra that night. After the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> dinner he left Rose and grannie intimately together,--the girl, with a gentle deprecation, as if she brought gifts not in themselves worth much, talking about Paris, the air young Peter had been breathing,--and betook himself again to Electra's house. It was all open to the day, but no one answered his knock. He went in and wandered from parlor to library, the dignified rooms that had once seemed to him so typical of her estate as compared to his own: for in those days he had been...", "...commissions for Egypt?\" he cried; \"I am just starting.\" \"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,\" said the Prince, \"will you not stay with me one night longer?\" \"I am waited for in Egypt,\" answered the Swallow. \"To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.

In two hours I killed seventy-three pheasants and partridges and twenty-three hares, and this in spite of the fact that my shooting was erratic. Thus at one spot I killed eight pheasants with as many shells without changing my feet (it was there that the loader was useful) and then a few minutes later missed five running. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the young Countess drove out with her French companion to join me. She watched the shooting until half after twelve and then drove me home for luncheon. It is the custom for the men who start shooting early to be sought out and brought home to luncheon by the ladies, or to be joined by them for lunch in the woods in case of an all-day shoot. The game is shot only by the nobles and their guests and there seem to be no Robin Hoods among the devoted peasantry. If this shooting to...", "...us whithersoever we should be sent. After a melancholy sort of discussion, it was decided that we should take our femmes de chambres, and that the others should remain for the safety of the house, and to send us what we might have occasion for. This settled, they returned with such directions as we were able to give them, (God knows, not very coherent ones,) to prepare for our journey: and as our orders, however confused, were not very voluminous, they were soon executed, and before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> every thing was in readiness for our departure. The people employed by our companions were equally diligent, and we might very well have set out by one o'clock, had our case been at all considered; but, I know not why, instead of so providing that we might reach our destination in the course of the day, it seemed to have been purposely contrived that we should be all night on the road, though we had already passed one night without rest, and were exhausted by watching and...", "...True, the spring sun shone on their books and exercises too, the spring called them into the open air, but even more powerful than its alluring voice seemed the influence exerted on their young minds by what they were now hearing.

His creditors, who had indulged in costly dinners, and given rash presents to their wives and daughters, countermanded their suppers, and withdrew their names from numerous charitable subscription lists. The writs were re-issued. The hatter in the Ward of Chepe altered his placard to \"Ye Gascoigne Shape?,\" and disposed of his invention more rapidly than before. By half-past three in the afternoon the sheriff's...", "...soon the poison through his veins Ran like a fire with fever's pains, Then sank the bright locks of the warrior brave, Whose face bore in anguish the hue of the grave.

It was a little before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when he reached town by the roundabout route, and after putting the horse up at the livery-stable in which Colonel Baldwin was a half owner, he went to the hotel to reconnoitre. The room-clerk who gave him his key gave him also the information he craved. \"Mr. Richlander? Oh, yes; he left early this morning by the stage. He is interested in some gold properties up in the range beyond Topaz. Fine old gentleman. Do you know him, Mr. Smith?\" \"The name seemed familiar when I saw it...", "...broke his vows.

I have not been quite idle, however. I landed about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the shore opposite Silver Island, and walked about three miles to the town of Chin-kiang. It was taken by us in the last war, and sadly maltreated, but since then it has been captured by the Rebels and re-captured by the Imperialists. I could hardly have imagined such a scene of desolation. I do not think there is a house that is not a ruin. I believe the population used to be about 300,000, but now I suppose it cannot exceed a few hundreds. The people...", "...I will begone, sir, as you said; and thank you, sir.\" He slipped back again very quickly, and was vanished. I suppose that he had ridden down in some cart all night, and that he went back in the same way, for I saw no more of him. Well; I had gained two little points--I had kept him from Mr. Rumbald, which was one--(for I did not want my host to consult with any if I could help it)--and I had learned what perhaps was his name. This, however, I would test for myself presently. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we dined; and having observed no difference in my host's manner, that might shew that he had any idea I had met with anyone, I made two remarks. \"I talked with a fellow at the gate this morning,\" I said; \"he seemed to know nothing of the King's coming.\" Rumbald jerked his head impatiently; and I perceived that we had not been seen. Presently I said: \"Who was that pale-looking fellow who wished to speak with you yesterday, Mr. Rumbald, at the _Mitre?_\" He looked sharply...", "...out of your head or your first draft when I call for 'em, and I'll take 'em or leave 'em as suits me.

For every line that rang untrue in the reconstruction she had a true one or she took a crude bit from Mr. Rooney and polished it into place. Fido sat crouched in a front seat and transcribed every word into his prompt copy so as to be a...", "...Christian thought. I shall remember always the little hill that hid my view of the White Mountains I had made such a sacrifice to see. I had reached my stopping-place late at night, in the rain, and when morning came with a flood of sunshine I went eagerly forth to catch a first glimpse of the mountains. They were nowhere in sight. A quiet country road, shaded by tall trees, and a long, low range of hills was all I saw. Deep disappointment filled my soul. I determined to go back. Before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> my companion climbed the hill opposite the house and beckoned eagerly for me to follow. I shall never forget what I saw! There they were, clear, blue, reaching up to the bluer sky. How I loved them that summer,--touched with fire at sunset, purple and gold in the deepening twilight, soft and far away in the early morning mist; and when clouds shut them in, hid them from sight, I knew they were there, calm, still, immovable! I had seen them. Yet for a whole morning a little hill...", "...and recover it. Then some strange impulse made her leave it on the sand of the desert. What if they should be lost and that paper should guide them back? The notion stayed by her, and once in a while she dropped other bits of paper by the way.

She was glad when they emerged once more and climbed to higher ground. The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> camp was a hasty affair, for the Indian seemed in a hurry. He scanned the horizon far and wide and seemed searching keenly for some one or something. Once they met a lonely Indian, and he held a muttered conversation with him, pointing off ahead and gesticulating angrily. But the words were unintelligible to Margaret. Her feeling of uneasiness was growing, and yet she could not for the life of her tell why, and laid it down to her tired nerves. She was beginning to think she had...", "...stone electricity building between the two locks of the canal; and in imagination the picture as viewed from its top would haunt them, with the churning rapids occupying the center of the scene.

Nick of course was solemnly warned that this was sacred Canadian soil, and that on no account was he to try and purloin any strangely marked animals he might discover prowling around. \"You know they have some queer beasts in these foreign lands, Buster,\" George remarked, shaking a finger before the other's stubby nose. \"And make up your mind right now that you're going to let 'em all severely alone.

We had a fresh gale from the north-east until we were in the latitude of 10 deg. 30' north; the north-east trade now became faint and variable, and in 9 deg. 30' north we had frequent calms, with dark cloudy weather, and heavy showers of rain; squalls were seen now rising from...", "...be found possible. On the next day, however, the 3rd of June, the surf was so high that nothing could be attempted. On the 4th there was a thick fog and a gale, and the frigate Trent struck on a rock, and some of the transports were nearly blown on shore. The sea was very heavy, and the vessels rolled tremendously at their anchors. Most of the troops suffered terribly from seasickness. The next day, the weather continued thick and stormy. On the 6th there was fog, but towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the wind went down, whereupon the signal was made, the boats were lowered, and the troops took their places in them. Scarcely had they done so, when the wind rose again, and the sea got up so rapidly that the landing was postponed. The next day the fog and heavy surf continued, but in the evening the sea grew calmer, and orders were issued for the troops to take to the boats, at two o'clock next morning. This was done, and the frigates got under sail, and steered for the four...", "...by the disruption of the ice, and from the ground being so soft that the men dragging the rope sank up to the knees at every step; but these impediments were less regarded than the ceaseless torment of the musquitoes.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they arrived at Medina, and halted upon the banks of the Falem\u00e9, which the rain had discoloured, but little increased in volume. At this place it ran over rocks, at the rate of about four miles the hour. It abounded with fish of a great size. In the afternoon the soldiers were quite worn out with carrying the baggage across the river, and up the steep bank. The carpenter being in a dying state was left with the Dooty, to whom Park gave ten bars, and also directed a soldier to...", "...until they reached a point immediately below South Chickamauga Creek, where the bridge was to be built over the river for the passage of Sherman's army.

The troops were pushed up the hill, and soon gained a commanding eminence, which was immediately fortified, and guns were dragged up for its defence.

Clara went over the whole situation with Paul, who expressed his regret that she had not sooner called upon him for assistance. \"Not,\" he said, \"that I could have done anything better than...", "...like a storm-cloud.

It was near <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> before they reached the head of a long lake. Dusty Star could see the water glimmering far away to the south over the tops of the red Indian willows. Without pausing for an instant, the Indians pushed their way through the thicket, their moccasins sinking deeply in the spongy ground between the willow roots. Then they pulled out a slender canoe of birch-bark concealed among the reeds. Dusty Star had never seen a canoe before. It struck him with astonishment; and when his captors...", "...I'd let old Booky do his searching, then cook up a plan to do him out of whatever he finds.\" \"Maude, you're a wonder!

He returned at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> with arrowheads and a stone axe but there was no sign of ruins. But the old man was not discouraged. These signs of Indians merely gave him the necessary urge to investigate.

It would be very much better for the girl to pass gradually from the darkness of night to the full light of day; and that would in this way be managed, since between midnight and <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she would experience the successive phases of shade and sunshine, to which her sight had to get accustomed. Just as they left the cottage, Nell took Harry's hand saying, \"Harry, is it really necessary for me to leave the mine at all, even for these few days?\" \"Yes, it is, Nell,\" replied the young man. \"It is needful for both of us.\" \"But, Harry,\" resumed Nell, \"ever since you found me, I have been as happy as I can possibly be.

They began now to keep a sharp watch ahead and ere long were rewarded by the sight of a low black line projecting out from the marsh ahead. A closer approach resolved the low black line into a long, shaky, decrepit wharf, its piling rotting...", "...was not long before he found himself overtaking a magnificent vessel whose decks were crowded with passengers. He dropped down some distance, to enable him to see these people more plainly, and while he hovered near he could hear the excited exclamations of the passengers, who focused dozens of marine glasses upon his floating form. This inspection somewhat embarrassed him, and having no mind to be stared at he put on additional speed and soon left the steamer far behind him.

So he rose to a point considerably beyond the clouds, where the air was thin but remarkably pleasant to inhale and the rays of the sun were not so hot as when reflected by the surface of the water.

I hope you will find it convenient to be there.\" These were the strange words the Honourable Hilary had written, and the Honourable Adam knew that it was an order.

At 11 a.m. the 2nd Scots Fusiliers, who had been on the right of the Gordons, and just outside of the pressure of the first attack, had in their turn to fall back, Col. Uniacke with two companies of the Gordons going forward again to aid them in their retirement. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> things were looking pretty serious; the Germans were pressing on towards Gheluvelt in great numbers, both on the main road itself and to the north and south of it, and it seemed doubtful whether their impetus could be checked. At this critical moment, a succession of incidents, small in themselves, but powerful as a combination, brought about a marked change in the fortunes of the day.

But on the right of the Brigade the situation was far worse. There the 137th Brigade, after making some progress, had eventually to give ground, and their left was now considerably behind our right. We were thus in a most awkward salient with both flanks exposed. It was, therefore, not surprising to find soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> very evident signs of a real counter-attack being prepared against the Brigade exposed right flank, and when a little later this attack was launched, the enemy managed to get round the South-East of Montbrehain and into that corner of the village in some strength, and it was decided to withdraw from it.

I went toward him, for, detestable as his conduct had been, common humanity prompted me to see whether I could afford him any relief.

But as the tale of village gossip grew, and the rumors of disaster became more insistent, she had been forced to listen, and her fears once aroused, she had not been slow to awake to her position. Gradually Arthur's absence and her misgivings on his account had taken the second place. The prospect of ruin, of losing her all and becoming dependent on the Squire's niggard bounty, had closed her mind to other terrors. So at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on this day, unable to bear her thoughts alone, she had walked across the fields and seen Josina. But Josina had not been able to reassure her. The girl had said as little as might be about Arthur, and on the subject of the bank was herself so despondent that she had no comfort for another. The Squire had gone to town--for the first time since he had been laid up--in company with Sir Charles, and Josina fancied that it might be upon the bank business. But she hardly dared to hope...", "...(if it can be found proper) against that villain Maccartney. What shall we do with these murderers?

In the meanwhile I carried with me to my work a note book and during the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour I set down everything which I thought might be of any possible use to me. I missed no opportunity for learning even the most trivial details.

If I get next to anything I'll let you know.\" But neither that day nor the day after did he hear a word that sounded in the least suspicious, but on Friday he did; and thus wise: At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he met Kerwin again in the billiard hall. The toastmaster drew him to one side. \"I'm fixed,\" he whispered with a grin of satisfaction. \"How?\" Norse asked. \"Got my dress suit hid.\" \"Where, in the furnace?\" \"No; better'n that. You know that built-in closet in my room? Yes. Well, the top of it is lower than it seems to be from the front, and I've put my suit, and dress-shirt, and all, up there.

CHAPTER XVII A VETERAN OF THE ARMY OF ITALY It was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when Marteau presented himself before the house in which the Major of the first battalion, an old veteran named Lestoype, was quartered. \"Who shall I say wants to see him?\" asked the orderly before the door. \"A soldier of the Empire,\" was the bold answer, and it proved an open sesame to the astonished orderly. Lestoype was writing at a table, but he looked up when Marteau came in. He stared at him a moment and then rose to his feet. \"I report myself ready for duty,...", "...along on our way, we could discern a lonesome hut high up on the shore, with a few sheep and cattle on the slopes of the adjacent hills, but for the most part the coast was barren and desolate. [Illustration: NATURAL BRIDGE.] Early on the following morning the sun-capped peaks of Mount Hecla were visible. There has been no eruption from this mountain since 1845.

A fishing and trading establishment, owned by a company of Danes, is located on one of these islands. The _Arcturus_ touches twice a year to deliver and receive a mail. On the occasion of our visit, a boat came out with a hardy-looking crew of Danes to receive the mail-bag. It was doubtless a matter of great rejoicing to them to obtain news from home.

The sun was staring down, without winking, upon that wonderful old city, as if he loved the sight. The yellow current of old Father Tiber seemed yellower than ever in the glare. Except from sheer necessity, no person moved abroad; for the atmosphere, which early in the morning had seemed like airs from heaven, before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> had become most uncomfortably like a blast from the opposite direction. The Piazza di Spagna was like Tadmor in the wilderness. Not a single English tourist, with his well-read Murray under his arm, was to be seen there; not a carriage driver broke the stillness of the place with his polyglot solicitations to ride. The great staircase of _Trinita de' Monti_ seemed an impossibility; to have climbed up its weary ascent under that broiling sun would have been poor entertainment for...", "...plenty everywhere; but there's no one to go down the river with him.

I'm going down the river with him--down to Bindon.\" The old man's mouth opened in blank amazement. His eyes blinked helplessly. \"What you talkin' about, Jinny! Jake's comin' up with the minister, an' you're goin' to be married at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to-morrow.\" \"I'm takin' him\"--she jerked her head towards the room where Dingley was --\"down Dog Nose Rapids to-night.

Here they were joined by Rory, Earl of Tyrconnel. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Friday they all went on board and lifted anchor, but kept close to the shore waiting for the boats' crews, who were procuring water and fuel; but they had to wait till long after sunset, when the boats came with only a small quantity of wood and water.

So the ladies started downtown with assurances that the four cousins would be models of virtue and good behavior until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when they would look for their reward. Soon after they left, the mist lifted and the air grew warmer and pleasant. \"It's kind of stuffy in the house, isn't it?\" said Jack, after a heated bout with George, where both wore boxing gloves, and the girls were umpires. \"Yes, let's go out and cool off,\" agreed George, mopping his face. \"We can play out in the backyard, you know,\" suggested Anne. \"I'm so warm I don't want to play ball, but let's go out anyway,\" said...", "...subject, I found three more, and had awfully hard work to get them off and painful too for they give one not only a feeling of irritation at their holding-on place, but a streak of rheumatic-feeling pain up from it. On completing operations I went on and came upon the Ajumba in a state more approved of by Praxiteles than by the general public nowadays. They had found out about elephant ticks, so I went on and got an excellent start for the next stage. By this time, shortly after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the first day, we had struck into a mountainous and rocky country, and also struck a track--a track you had to keep your eye on or you lost it in a minute, but still a guide as to direction.

As there are five kinds we ought to be able to select one good enough. They are:-- 1st. The solar day, or <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to noon by the sun. 2nd. An imaginary sun moving uniformly in the ecliptic. 3rd. A second imaginary sun moving uniformly parallel to the equator at all seasons of the year. 4th. One absolute rotation of the earth. 5th. One rotation of the earth measured from the node, or point, of the spring equinox. The difference between 1st and 2nd is that part of the sun's error due to the elliptical orbit of the earth. The other part of the sun's error--and the...", "...brier, through valley and wooded dale went he, and at dusk he came to a gigantic pine standing solitary in a rocky field. Wearied with his long journey, the hunter lay down beneath the pine and slept. When it was dawn he woke refreshed, and turning his eyes toward the level rays of the rising sun, began his journey to the east. Presently he reached a height in the forest, and from this height, he saw, not very far away, a black turret rising over the ocean of bright leaves. At high <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he arrived at the castle. It was ruinous and quite deserted; grass grew in the courtyard and between the bricks of the terrace, and the oaken door was as soft and rotten as a log that has long been buried in mire. Entering the castle, the hunter soon discovered the round room. A table laden with wonderful treasures stood in the centre of the chamber, directly under a shower of sunlight pouring through a half-ruined window in the mildewed wall.

I became absorbed in the glory of the day, the sunshine, the sweet air, the yellowing corn turning from its sappy green to summer's <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of gold, the lark's song like a waterfall in the sky.

Flowers expand at a later hour in a cold climate than in a warm one. \"A flower,\" says Loudon, \"that opens at six o'clock in the morning at Senegal, will not open in France or England till eight or nine, nor in Sweden till ten. A flower that opens at ten o'clock at Senegal will not open in France or England till noon or later, and in Sweden it will not open at all. And a flower that does not open till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> or later at Senegal will not open at all in France or England. This seems as if heat or its absence were also (as well as light) an agent in the opening and shutting of flowers; though the opening of such as blow only in the night cannot be attributed to either light or heat.\" The seasons may be marked in a similar manner by their floral representatives.

Sixteen miles were made next day by alternate rowing and tracking, the foot of Gull Island Lake was reached, and after dinner it was crossed in one and a half hours. Then the heaviest work of the trip thus far was struck and camp was made, about half way up Gull Lake rapid. Supper was made off a goose shot the previous day. It was necessary to double the crews in getting up the latter part of Gull Island rapids, and finally a short carry was made just at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to get clear of them. From the fact that the light, beautifully modelled boats required four men to take them up the rapids we may get some idea of the swiftness of the river as well as the difficulties attending the mode of travelling. As the river in its swiftest parts is never less than half a mile wide, and averages a mile, it can readily be seen that it is a grand waterway, well deserving its name. Nine miles were made this day and camp was reached at the beginning of...", "...faces passed a ripple, as if some breeze of passion shook the souls within; there was a swaying here and there; and a passionless voice spoke half a dozen words in Esperanto, out of sight: \"Englishmen, I assent to the Bill of Worship.\" III It was not until mid-day breakfast on the following morning that husband and wife met again. Oliver had slept in town and telephoned about eleven o'clock that he would be home immediately, bringing a guest with him: and shortly before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she heard their voices in the hall. Mr. Francis, who was presently introduced to her, seemed a harmless kind of man, she thought, not interesting, though he seemed in earnest about this Bill. It was not until breakfast was nearly over that she understood who he was. \"Don't go, Mabel,\" said her husband, as she made a movement to rise. \"You will like to hear about this, I expect. My wife knows all that I know,\" he added. Mr. Francis smiled and bowed. \"I may tell her about...", "...them now. But even to her sleep came at last, the spent sleep of utter exhaustion. The morning sun was shining brightly when she awoke. She got up feeling chilled and stiff, worn and grown old. Mechanically she bathed and breakfasted--Miss Waddle the younger gazing askance at her white cheeks and lustreless eyes. Mechanically she returned to her room, and began packing her trunks. And then, this done, she sat with folded hands by the window, looking out upon the sparkling sea, until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and Mr. Liston should come. Her mind was a blank; the very intensity of the blow benumbed pain. Last night she had lain yonder, and writhed in her torture; to-day she felt almost apathetic--indifferent to past, present, and future. And so, pale and cold, and still, Mr. Liston had found her, so she had shaken hands, and said good-by to the Misses Waddle, and so she had been driven away from her \"honeymoon paradise\" to begin her life anew. They reached New York. If Mr. Liston had...", "...from them the next. I was perfectly ready to fight, but I had no special wish to do so if it could be avoided; and I was therefore glad to see our sails fill out with the steady breeze, and to find that we were dropping the boats astern. The corvette was still coming on, but she no longer gained on us; and the wind still further increasing, we found that the _Flying Fish_ was much the faster craft. We were compelled, however, to haul our wind and stand off the coast; and soon after <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> had run the corvette out of sight. This adventure delayed us. After standing off for some days, we hove to, keeping a sharp look-out. The next morning, having a good breeze, we again stood in towards the coast. No sail like the corvette appearing, we stood on till we reached the mouth of the magnificent river Magdalena, inferior only in size to the Orinoco and Amazon on that part of the continent. After forming numerous lakes, it empties itself, by three mouths, into the...", "...of not going any further. \"I only wished to be alone. I _breathe_ so much better,\" she said, and when I looked inquiringly at her, she continued, \"Never marry a man for his wealth, Lottie, unless you wish to become as hard, as wicked and unhappy as I am. John Douglass is worth more than half a million, and yet I would give it all if I were the same little girl who, six years ago, waded with you through the snow-drifts to school on that stormy day. Do you remember what we played that <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and my foolish remark that I would marry for _money_ and _diamonds!_ Woe is me, I've won them both!\" and her tears fell fast on the sparkling gems which covered her slender fingers. Just then I saw in the distance a young man whom I knew to be Walter Beaumont. He seemed to be approaching us, and when Cora became aware of that, she started up and grasping my arm, hurried away, saying, as she cast backward a fearful glance, \"I would rather die than meet him now. I am not...", "...unlike that to which the cardinals are subject at Rome, upon the death of a pope, where not uncommonly some half dozen are brought out dead before an election takes place. \"The following is a comic picture of an election,\" says Judge Hardinge, in Nichols's Illustrations of Literature, from the pen of Daniel Wray, Esq. dated from _Cambridge_, the 19th of January, 1743. \"The election of a provost of King's is over--_Dr. George_ is the man. The fellows went into chapel on Monday, before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> in the morning, as the statute directs.

But Knapp woke up with, \"Oh, yes. For years. Studious fellow. Books to be exchanged at the public library, I think. No--\" Knapp spoke heavily. \"Come to think of it, guess that was special work. He told me once he was taking some sort of correspondence course.\" \"Special work!\" chuckled Worth Gilbert. \"I'll tell the world!\" \"Oh, well, give...", "...at the board, nor ever will be able, at least so much as myself.

The River Jezeer runs into the Tigris at this point, so that the town can only be reached by wading through the water. We were making preparations to go on shore when we observed a little man being carried across the water on the back of a half-naked Arab. He had that incongruous look made up of the European overcoat with a fur collar, the black trousers, and the brown boots, all surmounted with a fez, which we had learnt to associate, curiously enough, both with...", "...you have a drug-shop along. He must die, and die soon, and he knows it. Come on, unless you want to see him go?\" I most certainly did not, so we went along, keeping our eyes on the ground lest we run afoul of a snake. I looked back a moment later and saw that the stricken man had laid down, and then I knew that his suffering would soon be over. None of the other natives seemed to give a second thought to him; under Buno's rule they had grown more callous than ever. It was almost <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> when we reached Buno's kraal, and there was a large gathering of witch-doctors about his hut. The witch-doctors of our burial-party joined them, and Tuys informed me that practically all the witch-doctors in Swaziland were there. \"Now would be a good time for some target practice,\" he said grimly. \"In about five minutes a few quick shots could remove most of the sources of trouble in this country. If those witch-doctors were all killed, Swaziland would be a happier land.\"...", "...proposed to emigrate farther into Gaul, and the Sequanians, whose lands bordered on those of the Helvetians, gave them permission to march through their country. Such was the state of affairs when Caesar arrived in Gaul. Feeling that the passage of such a large body of emigrants (368,000) through Gaul would be dangerous to the province (Gallia Narbonensis), he determined to interfere. The Helvetians were met at BIBRACTE, near Autun, and after a terrible battle, which raged from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> until night, were defeated with great slaughter (58). The survivors, about one third, were treated kindly, and most of them sent back to Switzerland. Caesar now turned his attention to the Germans who had settled west of the Rhine. After several fruitless attempts at negotiation, during which the bad faith of Ariovistus became conspicuous, the forces came together. Though the Germans were brave, they were no match for the drilled legionaries, who fought with the regularity of a...", "...4. This forenoon we spoke a French ship bound to the Mauritius. Saturday 5. Tenerife. The next day at nine in the forenoon we saw the island of Tenerife bearing west-south-west half west about twelve leagues distant. It was covered with a thick haze except the north-westernmost part which is a remarkable headland, resembling a horse's head, the ears very distinct. To the eastward of this head* lie two round rocks, the northern boundary of Tenerife. I had a good observation at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> by which I make the latitude of the two rocks 28 degrees 44 minutes north and their longitude by our timekeeper 16 degrees 5 minutes west. To the southward of these and near the shore is a high needle rock: about four leagues farther to the southward the coast inclines towards the west to the road of Santa Cruz, where we anchored at half-past nine on Sunday morning in twenty-five fathoms water, and moored along shore in the same depth, with the cupola tower of the church of St....", "...I lived the tranquil, subconscious life of early childhood. At first my mind, altogether unimpressed and undeveloped, may be compared to a photographer's apparatus fitted with its sensitized glass. Objects insufficiently lighted up make no impression upon the virgin plates; but when a vivid splendor falls upon them, and when they are encircled by disks of light, these once dim objects now engrave themselves upon the glass. My first recollections are of bright summer days and sparkling <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> times,--or more truly, are recollections of the light of wood fires burning with great ruddy flames. CHAPTER II. As if it were yesterday I recall the evening when I suddenly discovered that I could run and jump; and I remember that I was intoxicated by the delicious sensation almost to the point of falling.

Nayland Smith, ignoring my entreaties, composed himself for slumber in the white cane chair in my study. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he retired to the bathroom, and returning, made a pretense of breakfast; then resumed his seat in the cane armchair. Carter reported in the afternoon, but his report was merely formal. Returning from my round of professional visits at half past five, I found Nayland Smith in the same position; and so the day waned into evening, and dusk fell uneventfully. In the corner of the big room by the empty fireplace, Nayland Smith lay, with his long, lean frame extended in the white cane...", "...march!

Though we were approaching the sub-ranges of the Sierra del Crystal, the country was very like that about Mbata; streamlets flowing to the Mbokwe, wet yellow soil forming slippery muds, unhealthy as unpleasant in the morning sunshine; old and new clearings and plantations, mostly of bananas, mere spots in the wide expanse of bush, and deserted or half-inhabited villages.

About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they emerged into an open space, which Harold pronounced to be a small prairie; but in the act of stepping into it, rejoiced at a temporary relief from the viny forest, he grasped the arm of his cousin, and drew him behind a bush, with a hurried, \"Back! back!

The boys gazed at each other in dismay; their hearts beat...", "...branches above us, and Lena Lingard peered down over the edge of the bank. \"You lazy things!\" she cried. \"All this elder, and you two lying there! Did n't you hear us calling you?\" Almost as flushed as she had been in my dream, she leaned over the edge of the bank and began to demolish our flowery pagoda. I had never seen her so energetic; she was panting with zeal, and the perspiration stood in drops on her short, yielding upper lip. I sprang to my feet and ran up the bank. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> now, and so hot that the dogwoods and scrub-oaks began to turn up the silvery under-side of their leaves, and all the foliage looked soft and wilted. I carried the lunch-basket to the top of one of the chalk bluffs, where even on the calmest days there was always a breeze. The flat-topped, twisted little oaks threw light shadows on the grass. Below us we could see the windings of the river, and Black Hawk, grouped among its trees, and, beyond, the rolling country, swelling gently...", "...which would have made him jeopardize by any sin of omission or commission the winning of the long odds. He found Bruce that night, and told him all.

Before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day it was announced to Lady Catharine, at Kerton Manor, that Bruce was waiting for her in the drawing-room. It was with a diffidence and sense of guilt very strange to her pure, straightforward nature that she obeyed the summons. His back was to the door as she entered. \"I can not tell you how sorry I am,\" she began. Bruce turned toward her his ghastly face, ravaged and deformed by passion and sleeplessness, like a cane-brake in the Western Indies over which a...", "...men some rum to cheer them after their fatigues. _Tuesday, 25._--We rose this morning at a late hour, when we visited the nets, which produced but few fish: my people, indeed, partook of the stores of M.

The wind was Southerly throughout the day, and too strong for us to depart, as we were at the foot of a grand traverse. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I had an observation, which gave 61. 29. North latitude. Such was the state of the weather, that we could not visit our nets. In the afternoon, the sky darkened, and there was lightning, accompanied with loud claps of thunder. The wind also veered round to the Westward, and blew a hurricane. _Wednesday, 26._--It rained throughout the night, and till eight in the morning, without any alteration in the wind.

In the evening Mrs. The. and Joyce took us all into the coach home, calling in...", "...of our musicale,\" Lily Condor had explained, \"and Flora won't be in shape again for a good three months. Of course, there isn't anything in it but glory. I'm just one of those 'sweet charity' artists. But I think she is a dear, and I know that _you_ have influence.\" Stillman pretended to be annoyed at Mrs. Condor's assumption that his word would carry any weight in the matter, but as a matter of fact he felt pleased in secret masculine fashion. Chancing to pass Flint's office at the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour, he dropped in. It happened that Miss Munch was standing near the counter, and she answered his inquiries with suave eagerness. \"Oh, Miss Robson isn't with us any more.

And when she...", "...my hands of it.\" That evening, when she discussed the matter with her daughter, Lady Baldock spoke of Violet and Lord Chiltern, as though their intended marriage were the one thing in the world which she most deplored.

But his resignation had been sent in and accepted, and he was simply awaiting the coming of his successor. About <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> his successor came, and he had the gratification of resigning his arm-chair to Mr. Bonteen. It is generally understood that gentlemen leaving offices give up either seals or a portfolio. Phineas had been put in possession of no seal and no portfolio; but there was in the room which he had occupied a special arm-chair, and this with much regret he surrendered to the use and comfort of Mr. Bonteen. There was a glance of triumph in his enemy's eyes, and an exultation in the tone of...", "...to the N W and W N W. At day-light in the morning I discovered a number of other islands from S S E to the W, and round to N E by E; between those in the N W I determined to pass. At noon a small sandy island or key, 2 miles distant from me, bore from E to S 3/4 W. I had passed ten islands, the largest of which may be 6 or 8 leagues in circuit. Much larger lands appeared in the S W and N by W, between which I directed my course. Latitude observed 17 deg. 17' S; course since yesterday <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> N 50 deg.

To keep an account of the boat's run was rendered difficult,...", "...the delicate intoxication of spring time, to which she was peculiarly susceptible. She basked in sunshine as she rattled about Melbourne streets and suburbs in Beatrice's little basket-carriage, and as she sat in Beatrice's bow-windowed drawing-room, gossiping over afternoon tea. She had a month's allowance of society dissipation of the most seductive description in that week--music, dancing, _tableaux vivants_, dressing, shopping, sightseeing, swarms of gay and witty company from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> till midnight, every conceivable kind attention from her cousin, and the most flattering homage from everybody else--all in an easy and cosy way that was very charming and luxurious. It certainly cheered her up a great deal. We _do_ get cheered, against our intention and desire, against our belief almost, by these little amenities that appeal to our superficial tastes, even when we seem to ourselves to be full of trouble. It is well for us that we are so susceptible to light...", "...These latter pests are the curse of the back country. The weather was hot. That day and on several others one hundred and thirty degrees was reached, and even that temperature was exceeded now and then over sandhills and plains which quivered in the heat. But the boys would not have minded the heat if the flies had only left them alone. Long before dawn, before even the morning star had risen, flies buzzed around them, making life well-nigh unbearable. A halt was made about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> for dinner, the packs and saddles taken off the horses for an hour, and then the journey was resumed, each man riding a fresh horse, for no one rides the same horse all day in Central Australia, if he can possibly help it. Evening camp was usually made near a water-hole or native well, but sometimes the horses had to go as long as two days without a drink. They were unsaddled and hobbled out, and allowed to roam about all night and pick up scanty bits of food. It amazed the...", "...but with some circumstances of fiction. In defending Maximilian upon those charges, his friends had betrayed a natural warmth at the injustice offered to his character; and the liveliness of the dispute on this point had nearly ended in a way fatal to their unanimity on the immediate question at issue. Good sense, however, and indignation at the Landgrave, finally brought them round again to their first resolution; and they separated with the unanimous intention of meeting at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the following day, for the purpose of carrying it into effect. But their unanimity on this point was of little avail; for at an early hour on the following morning every one of those who had been present at the meeting was arrested by a file of soldiers, on a charge of conspiracy, and marched off to one of the city prisons. The Count St. Aldenheim was himself the sole exception; and this was a distinction odious to his generous nature, as it drew upon him a cloud of...", "...they made up themselves. But don't fret. Everything's all lovely, and I guess the Corrugated is saved. Come up and look 'em over.\" Yep!

Then Marston wheels in the tea wagon full of decanters and club soda, and when I left they was clinkin' glasses real chummy. \"Son,\" says Old Hickory, as he pads into the office about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> next day, \"I believe I forgot the usual caddie fee.

The rest of the day and the whole night we tried to get the land alongside with divers winds and on varying courses in 7, 6, 6, 4, 3, and 21/2 fathom; towards daybreak we were so near the land that one might have recognised persons on shore. In the morning of the 15th the wind blew hard from the East; course held S. by E. in 3 and 21/2 fathom along a sandbank, situated about one mile from the mainland; at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we were in 14 deg. 36. The land which we have hitherto seen and followed, extends S. and N.; it is low-lying and without variety, having a fine sandy beach in various places. In the afternoon we dropped anchor owing to the calm, having sailed {Page 36} 11 miles South.

Of course, the very first evening, bedtime came early, and weary eyes were very glad to shut. But before <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day Johnnie had discovered that his new companion could perform ever so many tricks: he could shoulder arms, stand on his hind feet, pretend to smoke a pipe, carry a basket, and beg in the most enchanting manner. Johnnie played soldier with Luce for flag-bearer, for nearly an hour, till his auntie called him in. \"I think, dear,\" she said, \"that I must have you read a while every morning. Edie has promised to practise an hour a day, and Mabel is going to sit by me and...", "...XIII roof, extended the full length of the house. The shutters of the place were seldom opened, and there was here, in consequence, almost perpetual twilight. The old things, belonging to a bygone century, lying there under the dust and cobwebs attracted me from the first day; and, little by little, the habit of slipping up there with my Telemaque had grown upon me. I usually stole up after the noon dinner, secure in the thought that no one would dream of looking for me there. At this <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour of hot and radiant sunshine, the garret, by contrast, was almost as dark as night. Noiselessly I would throw open a shutter of one of the dormer windows and a flood of sunshine poured in; then I climbed out on the roof, and with elbows resting upon the sun-warmed old slate tiles overgrown with golden mosses, I would read my book. Around me, on this same roof, thousands of Agen plums were drying. This fruit, intended for winter use, was spread out on mats made of reeds;...", "...me the last farewell in the presence of the venerable ecclesiastic who had confessed her at midnight. The tears which gather fast as I write these words are probably the last honours I shall pay to this poor victim of a man who is still alive, and whose destiny seemed to be to make women unhappy. I sat weeping by the bed of her I loved so dearly, and in vain Madame Lamarre tried to induce me to come and sit with her. I loved the poor corpse better than all the world outside. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> my brother and his wife came to see me; they had not seen me for a week, and were getting anxious. They saw the body lovely in death; they understood my tears, and mingled theirs with mine. At last I asked them to leave me, and I remained all night by Charlotte's bed, resolved not to leave it till her body had been consigned to the grave. The day before this morning of unhappy memory my brother had given me several letters, but I had not opened any of them. On my return from the...", "...Cardinal to negotiate on the basis of the substituted project of Concordat.

We spent the entire night at it, without dismissing our servants or carriages, like men who hope every hour to finish the business on which they are engaged. At mid-day we had come to an understanding on all the articles, with one single exception\". This one article, of which we shall speak later, appeared to the Cardinal to be a substantial question, and to involve a principle which, as has often been the case, the Holy See might tolerate as a fact, but...", "...the seaman in reply. Land! In one moment the word ran like electric fire through all the veins of the _Phoenix_; the upper deck was crowded in a minute, but all were disappointed. No one saw land but Mr. Patterson, whose elevation and keen sight gave him an advantage.

Then the three hundred prisoners fell into a wild excitement--some became irritable, others absurdly affectionate to people they did not care a button for.

The retreat was effected in confusion. Grimwood's force was the first to be withdrawn and was saved from disaster by the gallant stand made by two field batteries as it crossed the level ground. The cavalry scampered home in Grimwood's track. A dramatic episode brought the battle of Lombard's Kop to a close. Just as the baffled troops were entering Ladysmith a battery of naval guns, which had arrived...", "...too long upon my crown of my head, I to bed. I met this day in Westminster Hall Sir W.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> our observations showed that we were nearly a degree south of the line; and I began to be sanguine that the breeze we now had would run us into the trades. In this, however, I was disappointed; for about sundown the wind fell so light that we barely had steerage-way.

Whenever it was in his power to accede to such a request it was his invariable custom not to refuse; he therefore willingly returned an answer in the affirmative. He reached Rochester about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on the day fixed for the benefit, rehearsed half-a-dozen pantomime scenes, and having dined, went to the theatre, every portion of which was crammed before six o'clock. On his appearance, he was received with a tremendous shout of welcome; his two comic songs were each encored three times, and the whole performances went off with great _eclat_. Mrs. Baker, the manager or manageress, at once offered him an engagement for the two following nights, the receipts of the house to be...", "...taking supper. I perceived at once that there was little chance of his life being saved. He had received an injury of the head which had evidently caused concussion of the brain.

Unfortunately for themselves, the Helvetii thought the Romans were flying, and became in turn the pursuers. They gave Caesar an opportunity, and a single battle ended them and their migrations. The engagement lasted from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> till night. The Helvetii fought gallantly, and in numbers were enormously superior; but the contest was between skill and courage, sturdy discipline and wild valor; and it concluded as such contests always must. In these hand-to-hand engagements there were no wounded. Half the fighting men of the Swiss were killed; their camp was stormed; the survivors, with the remnant of the women and children, or such of them as were capable of moving (for thousands had perished, and little...", "...smile the morning's beam!

One said, \"Dear Angel, let him in! In the morning I was sick, and this child came and played with me, and showed me the butterflies, and I forgot my pain.

Instead, however, of keeping to the southward, where we might have found a continuance of fine weather, our captain, in his anxiety quickly to reach the scene of action, notwithstanding the advanced season of the year, ordered a northerly course to be steered.

All of us was so sleepy we could hardly stay awake, and I could look out of the window and see the river and the hills on the other side, and I could even see people fishin'. Well, near <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we all began to smell somethin' like onions, and it got worse and worse, and seemed to come up from the registers, for Jas. Walker, the janitor, was keepin' a little fire yet, or had for early mornin'. And the professor got over the register and smelt and he says, \"Who put asoefetida in the furnace--who did such a cowherd thing as that?\" Nobody said nothin'.

But Robert felt so much interest in the process that he was glad to have the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> halt made near such a small fishing-place. He took his lunch and sat on the bank with the boys. They were very dirty, and one of them had his shirtsleeve split to the shoulder, revealing a sun-blistered elbow joint that still worked with a right good will at snaring.

Both Mr. Poole and Mr. Browne were better, and the men generally complained less than they had done. On Sunday, the 12th, we had thunder with oppressive heat, but no rain. On Monday the wind, which had kept with the regularity of a monsoon to the E.S.E., flew round to the N.W., the thermometer at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> standing at 108 degrees in the shade. From the period at which we left Flood's Creek we had not seen any hills to the eastward, the ranges having terminated on that side. The hills we had passed were detached from each other, and to the westward of our course. The fall of the creek on which we were at this time encamped was consequently to the eastward, but there was a small hill about five miles to the E.N.E., under which it ran; that hill was the southern extremity of the...", "...I'll find it.\" He returned penless. I considered buying another. But we were planning to go up together the last week of the hunting season, and I thought I would wait on the chance. We got off at the little station and hunted our way up, making great sweeps and jogs, as hunters must, to take in certain spots we thought promising--certain ravines and swamp edges where we are always sure of hearing the thunderous whir of partridge wings, or the soft, shrill whistle of woodcock. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we broiled chops and rested in the lee of the wood edge, where, even in the late fall, one can usually find spots that are warm and still. It was dusk by the time we came over the crest of the farm ledges and saw the huddle of the home buildings below us, and quite dark when we reached the house.

This <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> my wife comes to me alone, and tells me she had those upon her and bid me remember it. I asked her why, and she said she had a reason. I do think by something too she said to-day, that she took notice that I had not lain with her this half-year, that she thinks that I have some doubt that she might be with child by somebody else.

After my train has left, you can then take the carriage direct to the Greenock Station for your own journey.\" There was very little more for me to do, and the day threatened to be sixty hours long. So about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I resolved to take a walk up Argyle Street, go through the Arcade to Buchanan, and get my luncheon at McLaren's. It was to be a kind of farewell walk over the well known pavements and I thought if I saw a pretty brooch or bracelet made of Scotch pebbles, I would buy it as a memorial of the happy days, I had spent in Glasgow.

About eleven in the morning, the Chaplain makes his rounds; his practiced hand shoots the letter between the bars, toward the bed or on to the little table in the corner.

I bought there two sheep and some corn; we staid there three days, and had our corn converted into kouskous. We departed from Debbou early on Monday, the first day of Raky Gamon, [Footnote: May 4, 1810.] and arrived at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at the village of Diggichoucoumee, the residence of the King of Bondou: we stayed there four days and killed two sheep. I gave to Almami Sega two bottles of powder; bought one sheep. Departed early and went to Sabcouria, where we slept; it is the last village of Bondou to the northward. Left Sabcouria early, and passed Gouloumbo: we slept on the road. Next morning at nine A. M. we stopt at Dramana, in sight of Saint Joseph, the Fort of Galam; we staid there five days. I was...", "...Lady Muriel was the real obstacle; for Kate had kept him informed as to the progress of her friend's love affair, and he realized that as matters now stood there would be the utmost difficulty in persuading Daniel to abandon his present post. Steps, however, in the desired direction ought to be taken; and at any rate there would be no harm in ascertaining the possibilities of the matter. He therefore telephoned to Lord Blair asking for an immediate interview; and as the clock struck <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he was being ushered into the Great Man's presence. Lord Blair received him in a very businesslike manner. A large map of the Oases was spread upon the writing-table, entirely covering the chronic litter of papers heaped thereon, and, indeed, covering the greater part of his lordship himself as he sat in his desk-chair; while upon a side-table there were numerous chorographic memoranda, and a variety of type-written reports made upon the subject the last few years. Lord...", "...turned, and eagerly stepped to the chart. He saw zigzag prickings or lines upon the white sheet, as though somebody had been trying to represent flashes of lightning. Each line terminated in a little dotted circle. These were the 'runs.' But, then, these were also the Doldrums, and the motive power of that ship, the _Alfred_, lay in the breeze that, in the Doldrums, blows in the delicate catspaw that scarcely has power to run a shiver into the glazed breast. 'This was our situation at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> yesterday,' said the commander, putting his finger upon the northernmost little circle. 'There is no land for leagues, as you may observe.' 'What are those rocks?' observed Captain Parry, peering. 'St. Paul's Island--a horrible hornet's nest of black fangs, entirely out of the boat's reach. I am not sure that I ever heard of a boat effecting a landing. Anyone cast ashore there must perish. There is nothing to eat or drink. It is the desolation of hell!' added the commander,...", "...on his wife's; \"we shall at least have the stern satisfaction of having done our duty. And has not the Lord been very favorable to us, though He has thus severely tried us by the death of our son? Is it not thanks to His providence that three generations of my family have been able to commence, continue, and finish this great work?\" \"Yes, Samuel,\" said the Jewess, affectionately, \"and for you at least this satisfaction will be combined with calm and quietness, for on the stroke of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> you will be delivered from a very terrible responsibility.\" So saying, Bathsheba pointed to the box. \"It is true,\" replied the old man; \"I had rather these immense riches were in the hands of those to whom they belong, than in mine; but, to day, I shall cease to be their trustee. Once more then, I will check the account for the last time, and compare the register with the cash-book that you hold in your hand.\" Bathsheba bowed her head affirmatively, and Samuel, taking up...", "...And nights that darken days. And as the strong spring round him grew Stronger, and all blithe winds that blew Blither, and flowers that flowered anew More glad of sun and air and dew, The shadow lightened on his soul And brightened into death and died Like winter, as the bloom waxed wide From woodside on to riverside And southward goal to goal. Along the wandering ways of Tyne, By beech and birch and thorn that shine And laugh when life's requickening wine Makes night and <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and dawn divine And stirs in all the veins of spring, And past the brightening banks of Tees, He rode as one that breathes and sees A sun more blithe, a merrier breeze, A life that hails him king.

Then the buffaloes told him to come down and swore not to kill him but to support him and keep him as their servant. They told him to make a leaf bowl and they filled this with their milk, as much as he could drink, and they arranged that he should stay at the sleeping place and keep it clean, and when he wanted milk he was to play on his flute and they would come at the sound. So every <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> he used to blow the flute and the cows came, running and gave him more milk than he wanted so that he used even to bathe himself in milk, and this made his hair grow very long. One day a parrot belonging to a Raja saw him drying his long hair in the sun and the parrot went to the Raja and told him that he had found a husband for the Raja's daughter, with beautiful long hair; but that no one could go near where he lived because of the wild buffaloes; however the parrot undertook...", "...a regime of warm quarters and abundant food. The carpenter looked woefully thin after he had emerged from a bath. He must have worn a lot of clothes when he landed from the boat, and I did not realize how he had wasted till I saw him washed and changed. He was a man over fifty years of age, and the strain had told upon him more than upon the rest of us. The rescue came just in time for him. The early part of the voyage down to Elephant Island in the Southern Sky was uneventful. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Tuesday, May 23, we were at sea and steaming at ten knots on a south-westerly course. We made good progress, but the temperature fell very low, and the signs gave me some cause for anxiety as to the probability of encountering ice. On the third night out the sea seemed to grow silent. I looked over the side and saw a thin film of ice. The sea was freezing around us and the ice gradually grew thicker, reducing our speed to about five knots. Then lumps of old pack began to...", "...you the whole case against me--the only possible case against me. In fewer words still I will blow it to pieces, so that not a trace of it remains. As to whether I have committed this crime, the truth is in one sentence: I could not have committed this crime. Pauline Stacey fell from this floor to the ground at five minutes past twelve. A hundred people will go into the witness-box and say that I was standing out upon the balcony of my own rooms above from just before the stroke of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to a quarter-past--the usual period of my public prayers. My clerk (a respectable youth from Clapham, with no sort of connection with me) will swear that he sat in my outer office all the morning, and that no communication passed through. He will swear that I arrived a full ten minutes before the hour, fifteen minutes before any whisper of the accident, and that I did not leave the office or the balcony all that time. No one ever had so complete an alibi; I could subpoena half...", "...charge of the hog, and have it conveyed to the King his master; to which he objected, being afraid to take charge of an unknown animal, and the additional responsibility of taking charge of it for his master. I told him I found it impossible for me to carry it any farther; I should therefore leave it with him, and he might do with it as he pleased. That the village belonged to his master, so did the hog, and I was sure he would take good care of it. We departed early and arrived at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at Fabougou. After dinner we went to Giongoey, where we arrived after sun-set; we staid there two days. Early in the morning we departed, and at ten A.M. arrived at the lake Sonne; stopped a little under a tree; crossed the lake; stopped awhile at Tonneguela; arrived and stopped at Gommingtora, where we spent the night; received a sheep.

Then they can't possibly reach us till we get to Kamatlah.\" \"What does it matter if they do? We have both rifles and have left them only one revolver. Besides, I don't like to leave two bound men alone in so wild a district for any great time. No, we'll start Dud on the back trail. That grizzly you promised Big Bill might really turn up.\" The two men struck the headwaters of Wild-Goose Creek about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and followed the stream down. They traveled steadily without haste. So long as they kept a good lookout there was nothing to be feared from the men they had left behind. They had both a long start and the advantage of weapons. If Elliot had advertised for a year he could not have found a man who knew more of Colby Macdonald's past than Gideon Holt. The old man had mushed on the trail with him in the Klondike days. He had worked a claim on Frenchman Creek with him and had by...", "...the 15th, we find the following: \"End of Kingfisher: long, quiet pools and shoals where we grounded a few times; several small, splashy rapids; then a larger one near an old boat landing.

Struck one or two rocks, lightly; but made the run in safety.\" \"At the third rapid we saw some geese--but they got away. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we ate a cold lunch and because of the low water removed the skags, carrying them in the cockpit. The scenery in upper Red Canyon is impressive: pines and fir come down on the sloping sides to the river's edge; the rocks are reddish brown in colour, often broken in squares, and looking like great building blocks piled one upon another. The canyon is about fifteen hundred feet deep; the river is clear again, and averages about two hundred feet in...", "...then, although the boats drew only two and a half feet water, there was little enough for them. The bottom was of mud, sand, or shingle, with every here and there a large boulder stone, some of them ten or twelve feet high. Early on the morning of the 6th three Esquimaux came off in their kayaks, and although we were going at the rate of four miles an hour they easily overtook us. As they were going towards Churchill, I sent a few lines to Mr. Sinclair by them. Our latitude at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> was 60 deg. 17' 59\" N. Thermometer in air 49 deg., in water 45 deg. The total distance run, measured by Massey's log, was ninety-five miles, which agreed very nearly with our latitude, the difference being easily accounted for by the circumstance that the ebb tide runs much stronger to the northward than the flood does in an opposite direction. In the afternoon there was a strong breeze, which, although fair, was rather too much onshore and raised a heavy sea. At 5 P.M., having...", "...of the day was past, so he lay on my bed till six o'clock, and then he said he was better; but he hardly spoke all the way home.' Wilmet went at once to see after him, and found him already in bed; but whether sleepy, suffering, or sorrowful, she could not make out, for he hid his eyes from the candle, and only muttered 'No, thank you,' in reply to whatever she offered, till she yielded to his evident longing for darkness and silence. He was up and about in the morning; but when at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> Bernard rushed in from school, he was neither in the drawing-room, garden, nor office, and the door of his--or rather Mr. Froggatt's--bed-room was locked. Bernard bounced at it, calling, 'Let me in, I say; I'll not make a row.' 'There aren't any more of you?' parleyed Lance. 'No! Let me in, I say!'--kicking at the panels--'I must speak to you!'

Dinner followed not long after, in the beautiful new public library building, so admirably administered by Dr. Locke, to whose kindly activity we owed a large share of the day's greetings; and here the guests tarried and rested amid familiar surroundings until the departure of their train for Ottawa, close upon ten o'clock. Arriving at Ottawa towards <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of Wednesday, the westerners soon were commingling with their fellows from other parts of the Union and Canada, forgetful of geographical sections and national boundary lines. Before nightfall, all of us realized that we simply were members of a household of co-workers gathered under the family roof-tree of the citizens of Ottawa and the members of the government of the great Dominion. A peculiarity of Canada's hospitality, as we experienced it, was that the government itself,...", "...she done forgot to order things f'om town.\" Convicted, Charlotte looked at Willy, then hastily took the defensive. \"Mandy ought to have reminded me,\" she declared. \"No, _ma'am_,\" responded Mandy. \"I done quit this thing uv tellin' an' havin' you say things give out too soon.\" Willy sat stony.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it registered forty degrees. The wind still swept a gale that whistled and shrieked at the corners of the house, and the three women passed the morning in Charlotte's room, shivering about the open fire-place. Pete spent his day chopping and bringing in arm-loads of fat pine wood. All the sense of dissatisfaction with Aden returned. Desolate grey sand is a hideous exchange for sward, and orange trees look like toys from a Noah's ark. At dinner there was a furrow between King's...", "...his hand on her as she moved. \"Stay!--stay! One word----\" She flung him off her again. \"This is no time for words. Go to him--coward!--and let the balls that kill him reach you too, if you have one trait of manhood left in you!\" Then, swiftly as a swallow darts, she quitted him and flew on her headlong way, down through the pressure of the people, and the throngs of the marts, and the noise, and the color, and the movement of the streets. The sun was scarce declined from its <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> before she rode out of the city, on a half-bred horse of the Spahis, swift as the antelope and as wild, with her only equipment some pistols in her holsters, and a bag of rice and a skin of water slung at her saddle-bow. They asked her where she went; she never answered. The hoofs struck sharp echoes out of the rugged stones, and the people were scattered like chaff as she went at full gallop down through Algiers. Her comrades, used to see her ever with some song in the air and...", "...the heady wine of Mount Tmolus, with which a wealthy devotee had presented them. This they drank, and insisted on their guests drinking, unmixed. By the time the mutton bones had been picked bare, and the cask drained to its dregs, not a man out of the twelve was sober. A heavy slumber, lasting late into the morning, was the natural consequence of this debauch, and when the sleepers were at last aroused, they set about the preparation for a start in a very languid fashion. It was nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> before the party was fairly on its way. Darkness came on before the next stage could be reached. It was while the travellers were bivouacking in a wholly unprotected situation that a company of marauders, who had indeed been watching their movements for some days in the hopes of finding such an opportunity, fell upon them. The result was disastrous. Alcibiades and Callias, who had been sleeping with their horses picketed close to their camp fire, were roused by the noise, and...", "...words, ye cowde nott ner wolde nott do ffor all myn advyce.

The remainder of my mail, like that addressed to Norm, were attempts to direct my money into the hands of others; while his letters requested money for investment, mine were in the form of catalogs and most of which could not be classified as an investment, but rather, an accumulation of commodities to be purchased. Junk mail, however, was better than none. The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour sent Norm downstairs again, and the three of us visited for a while before again pursuing our own interests. Afternoon would find Dad bustling around the house, fixing one of the numerous household maladies, peering under the hood of a car, or during outdoor months, maintaining the yard. Norm could usually be seen dozing in a lawn chair, strategically positioned for the best view and the most sunshine. Even frigid temperatures would not keep him indoors if the sun was...", "...sailed into the Bay State stock in earnest, for I felt surer than before that Addicks was nearing his finish. A few minutes after the Exchange opened, Addicks' banker rushed into my office and said the Delaware financier begged that I would return to New York at once, and whispered to me that in a conversation just held on the telephone Addicks had stated that he would accept my terms. I informed the banker I was not anxious for the job, but as he urged his own interest, I jumped on the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> train and in the evening was again in New York. It was a warm day and I was pleased to get a wire on the train from Addicks asking me to meet him at the pier, as we should hold our conference on his yacht, the _Now-Then_, at that time one of the fastest steam-yachts afloat. It was a night of memorable beauty. In the golden light of a dazzling sunset we flew up the majestic Hudson.

Thus the eastern edge will give the shadow for all hours before 6 o'clock in the morning. From 6 o'clock until noon the western edge will be used. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> it will change again to the eastern edge until 6 o'clock in the evening, and finally the western edge for the remaining hours of daylight. The centres of the two dials will be at the points where the styles meet the dial face; but, in drawing the hour-lines, we must be careful to draw only those lines for which the corresponding style is able to give a shadow as explained above.

In the afternoon the lady was gone, the old house all open, and their mother sweeping, dusting, airing in great spirits. So they had a splendid frolic tumbling on feather beds, beating bits of carpet, opening closets, and racing from garret to cellar like a pair of distracted kittens.

Small things please country people, and there was not much work being done that day. It was an excuse for a holiday, as eagerly seized upon by the townsfolk, old and young, as by the young gentlemen of Dr Bewley's establishment. But that was not all. The villages near Plymborough were many, and the people for miles round flocked into the place to see the procession and stop afterwards about the market-place to visit the exhibition of beasts and listen to the...", "...an antelope which were brought into camp during the halt and divided.

Just as I finished setting it, I looked forward and saw the Platte river again. After descending a half a mile we were on its banks, being 77 miles since we left it on Saturday last, after having wound around among the hills and bluffs all the way. When we arrived near the river the road was more level but sandy and harder on our teams. There are also some low places where the water stands, making it soft, but scarcely any feed for teams...", "...weakling.\" She broke into bitter weeping. Dick was calling: \"Mamma!

Then she performed her entire toilet, laughing stridently from time to time. Sometimes tears would trickle fast down her beautiful face, so pale and worn with its great anxiety.

One need not always wait until <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to eat the first meal. Those in good health have found that they can easily go till noon before breaking the fast; but in proportion as one is weak or ailing the rule should be to stop all work as soon as fatigue becomes marked, and then rest until power to digest is restored. To eat when one is tired is to add a burden of labor to all the energies of life, and with the certainty that no wastes will be restored thereby. For the highest efforts of genius, of art, of the simplest...", "...yet it troubled me lest there should be any or any designed by them who put this into the head of the Auditor, I suppose Auditor Beale, or Creed, because they saw me carrying my account another way than by them. 9th (Lord's day).

Hewitt wired to Lincoln asking that the bed should be forwarded by the night boat to him in New York. Hewitt and his men met the boat, secured the pattern bed, and gave some hours to puzzling over the construction. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on Monday, Hewitt wired to Lincoln that he could make thirty mortar-beds in thirty days. In another hour he received by wire instructions from Lincoln to go ahead. In twenty-eight days he had the thirty mortar-beds in readiness; and Tom Scott, who had at the time, very fortunately for the country, taken charge of the military transportation, had provided thirty flat-cars for the transit of the mortar-beds to Cairo.

The day I left Pajala I saw the sun at noon; it was hardly above the horizon; it had barely risen and shown itself when it was sunset and it disappeared under the horizon. Then came a long snowstorm, and for a wonder one without a gale. After the snowstorm the sky suddenly cleared, and at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> I saw the sun's lower rim touching the horizon. It was of a fiery red. Then after a while it disappeared. The next day only the upper half of the sun was above the horizon at noon, and just as the rim was ready to sink I fancied I heard the sun say to me: \"To-morrow you will not see me; then you will have entered 'The Land of the Long Night,' and when you go further and further north you will be in that land.

By the hour of <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the Praca presented a sea of human faces. The long seats beneath the shade of trees had been resigned to the children, while the platform in the centre of the square, occupied on ordinary occasions by the military bands, now presented a waving parterre of the smiling and observant faces of peasant girls, who, notwithstanding their proverbial timidity and gentleness, had managed to secure that elevated position. Meantime the balconies were filling fast with the families of the...", "...a game of auction to-night, of course. You and I against mine host and Paula.\" She didn't wait for his answer. Without a glance in the direction of Peg and Benson she wheeled her horse and rode away. Greyson waved his hat to Peg, called something to her companions and cantered after his guest. For one long, silent moment Courtlandt followed the two with his eyes, then he resumed his directions to Benson where he had dropped them. \"Tell Mrs. Simms to have Simms report to me to-morrow <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> at the ranch.

We'll pay you what we owe, and then you can buy a present even if the prize doesn't arrive in time.\" \"Oh, thank you!\" It was strange to see how voluble happiness was making the child. \"Will you really? I've wanted and wanted, but I couldn't ask. I've got an engagement down town to try on my gymnasium suit to-morrow afternoon and I shall be so glad. I can mail it then.\" \"All right,\" said I, \"we'll get it for you.\" Then we forgot all about it till <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day. That was election day and full of excitement, even if we hadn't been late to breakfast, because the fudges kept us awake the night before. Martha had gone into her room early to study. Though she had closed the door I am afraid the girls made a lot of noise; and she woke up with a headache. Of course Berta and I and the others had a right to cut late if we wanted to do so, but we didn't mean to keep anybody from working. Martha returned from breakfast just as I was...", "...should hear them. Wise old Towser knew enough not to bark when men about him kept so still. He lay always where with nose or paw or tail he could touch Tom. The latter was the commander of the expedition and Towser felt it and became his abject slave accordingly. At the close of the second night they had reached the Tennessee River. By day they camped upon shore in some hidden place, first craftily secreting the boat amid rushes and reeds. From their second hiding-place, they saw about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> a Confederate gunboat, a small stern-wheel steamboat, with cotton-bales at her bow and stern screening her two guns. Though she was making all possible speed up the current, she moved but slowly. Her decks were thick with excited men. A babble of voices reached the fugitives, peering at her behind a mass of bushes. The few words that could be made out told them nothing. The sight of her, however, warned them that a new danger might await them on the traveled waters of the...", "...familiar to the ears of the present generation of Londoners,\" Mr. Charles Knight informs us that:--\"In one of the many courts on the north side of Fleet-street, might be seen, somewhere about the year 1820, 'The last of the London shoe-blacks.'

He was a short, large-headed son of Africa, subject, as it would appear, to considerable variations of spirits, alternating between depression and excitement, as the gains of the day presented to him the chance of having a few pence to recreate himself beyond what he should carry home to his wife and children. For he had a wife and children, this last representative of a falling trade; and two or three little woolly-headed _decrotteurs_ nestled around him when he was...", "...hunters had killed and left us. this was a fortunate Supply as all our bears oil was now exhosted, and we were reduced to our roots alone without Salt. the river is 30 yds wide and runs with great velossity. the bead as all the Mountain streams is composed of Smooth Stone. beyond this river we assended a Steep Mountain about 2 Miles to it's Sumit where we found the old road which we had passed on as we went out. comeing in on our right, the road was now much plainer and much beaten. at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> we arived at the quawmash flatts on Vally Creek and halted to graize our horses and dined haveing traveled 12 Miles here is a pretty little plain of about 50 acres plentifully Stocked with quawmash and from appearance this forms one of the principal Stages of the indians who pass the mountains on this road. we found that one of our pack horss with his load and one of Capt.

Fading events held little interest for him, since the mill could never grind again with the water that was past. In the morning the big sound looked smooth enough to tempt them upon its treacherous bosom. The crossing was made with ease; and later on came Sapelo with its particular troubles, the wind having risen meanwhile. But the boats proved seaworthy, and the young Corinthians who manned them had learned many a valuable lesson from past experiences; so that by <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> they had navigated this dangerous sheet of water and were well along their way. \"There's a lighthouse away over there, Jack,\" announced Josh, pointing ahead. \"Yes; that must be Doboy Light, and the sound of the same name will be the next to take our attention, boys,\" Jack replied, composedly, as though he had the entire map of the coast region impressed on his mind by now. \"Is there any end to 'em?\" asked Nick, dolefully. \"Two more before we reach Fernandina, St. Simon's...", "...kept her store, a matter which Hal was content not to know, though the pair cherished a hope some day to retire on it from fooling. \"Thou art a good lad, Steve,\" said Hal. \"I'm right glad thou leavest this father of mine behind thee.

But he writes to me in the very same slighting terms that I did to him, without the least respect at all, but word for word as I did him, which argues a high and noble spirit in him, though it troubles me a little that he should make no more of my anger, yet I cannot blame him for doing so, he being the elder brother's son, and not depending upon me at all. 20th.

Constans found himself panting for breath. As the hours dragged on Constans felt a vague uneasiness pressing down upon him, and he could see that the people also were growing restless under the unaccountable delay. The laughter and talk little by little died away; men stood in silent groups staring through the open gate, up the long avenue of the Palace Road, shading their bent brows under their hollowed hands.

There was no mistaking that great head with its mane of coarse, white hair--the old Dom Gillian.

And with equal indifference did Dom Gillian regard his...", "...stay the march of King James's governor?\" \"I have stayed the march of a king himself ere now,\" replied the gray figure, with stern composure. \"I am here, Sir Governor, because the cry of an oppressed people hath disturbed me in my secret place, and, beseeching this favor earnestly of the Lord, it was vouchsafed me to appear once again on earth in the good old cause of his saints.

Gradually the dust from the street, and the smoke from the neighboring chimneys settled thicker and thicker upon it, and of course the view of the busy, noisy town, of the quiet green fields and of the great, shining ocean, became dimmer and dimmer until at last they were lost sight of altogether and nothing could be seen but the round form of the window, so thick was the grime and dirt upon it. Now the men ceased coming to the top story at their <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> time, and the owner of the mill brought no more guests to its side, and the little round window, left to itself, became sad and lonely. Day after day passed and no one came near it. In fact, people seemed to have forgotten that it was in existence. One day two boys climbed to the attic in which it had been built, and the little round window said eagerly to itself, \"Now I shall hear some of the praise that belongs to me.\" But in a very few moments one of the boys said \"Whew! how...", "...which he has for breakfast in the shade of a pile of ties. There he watches the making up of trains, the flying switches, the flatheads scuttling along packing the journal boxes; and far beyond he can see the machine shops with the forked tongues of blacksmiths' forges and the blink of brasses in the roundhouse.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> comes with blowing of whistles; and hungry again he goes back to the lunch counter while the waiter is busy and sandwiches are easy prey. But instead of stealing them he comes out on the platform with empty hands and stares back, not understanding why it is so, till the groan of the work hour swelling again calls up the memory of black-browed Regan who has been big boss of it all. \"'T is sure he would never run and hide from a policeman,\" says Tim, and ponders how Regan would...", "...crushing mill up the ravine to be made into oil. Gita ate the green lemons plucked from the trees as a child of the North would eat apples, but she loved the good olive-oil better. When the grandmother made a feast, it was to fry the little silvery sardines in oil, so crisp and brown. The olive-tree is a native of Asia Minor, and often mentioned in the Bible. Some of the trees in the garden where Gita now worked were so old that the Romans saw them when they conquered the world. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the olive-pickers paused to rest. Gita went away alone, and ate the handful of chestnuts given her by grandmother. When she returned to the town at night she would have another bit of bread and a raw onion.

Below, this path traversed the ravine, and climbed the opposite slope to the wall of a pretty villa, one of the houses occupied for the winter by rich strangers.

But he did not succeed in finding the right ingredient, for as often as he called Frau Vorkel to come and inhale the new mixture, she gave such plausible and politic answers to his dangerous questions that he could be by no means sure of her absolute truthfulness. Then too the operations progressed slowly because that day at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> his finger had been badly cut by the bursting of a glass retort. So presently he ceased work for a while and insisted that Frau Vorkel should take the phial in her own hand and inhale its contents once more, because it pleased him to try the power of the elixir.

I can give but a faint idea of the pleasure of this meeting. He gave me the first information of the whereabout of Dr. W.; we talked nearly all night, and about <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the next day I again bade him farewell on board the steamer. I have for some time neglected our servant. When we separated, the question was who should _not_ keep him. We were all heartily tired of him, and I would not have had him with me on any account.

For that was how the thought of death presented itself to me. Against this appalling thought I struggled with all my power, and prayed and prayed again, morning, <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> and night, wrestling with God, as the phrase was, trying as it were to wring something from His hands which would save me, and which He, for no reason that I could discover, withheld from me.

About five o'clock another halt was made for supper, thirty miles having been reeled off during the afternoon. \"We'll do a bit of traveling as we did last night,\" said Nestor. CHAPTER XVIII. A TRICK OF THE ENEMY. The gas and oil lamps were lighted, and, as the sun sank to rest behind the hills, the auto began the night trip. The...", "...sounds of distant music, of the white, calm gaze of marble fauns and dryads, who gazed on her from amidst the coolness of hanging foliage. She who had never rested on any softer couch than her truss of hay or heap of bracken, dreamed that she slept on roses. The fragrance of innumerable flowers breathed all around her. A distant music came through the silence on her drowsy ear. For the first time in her life of toil and pain she knew how exquisite a pleasure mere repose can be. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she awoke, crying aloud that the Red Mouse claimed her soul from Thanatos. When her vision cleared, and her dream passed away, the music, the flowers, the color, the coolness, were all real around her. She was lying on a couch as soft as the rose-beds of Sybaris. About her were the luxuries and the graces amidst which the rich dwell. Above her head, from a golden height, a painted Eros smiled. The light, on to which her startled eyes opened, came to her veiled through soft,...", "...dark there played upon my flageolette, it being a fine still evening, and so to supper and to bed. This day I paid Godfrey's debt of 40 and odd pounds. The Duke of York went last night to Portsmouth; so that I believe the Queen is near. 10th. By myself at the office all the morning drawing up instructions for Portsmouth yard in those things wherein we at our late being there did think fit to reform, and got them signed this morning to send away to-night, the Duke being now there. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to the Wardrobe; there dined. My Lady told me how my Lady Castlemaine do speak of going to lie in at Hampton Court; which she and all our ladies are much troubled at, because of the King's being forced to show her countenance in the sight of the Queen when she comes. Back to the office and there all afternoon, and in the evening comes Sir G. Carteret, and he and I did hire a ship for Tangier, and other things together; and I find that he do single me out to join with me apart from...", "...this again! I know it was really You who disposed of my day when I wanted to do something else with it! Give me an open mind, Lord, so that whenever I go to the country, whenever I start a new day, I'll be able to accept whatever comes, and rejoice in it!\" It is amazing how much difference a little thing like one's mental attitude can make. After that, when I went to the country, I never took with me any preconceived notions of what time I would return. I might get back home for my <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal, or I might get back by sunset, or I might even stay overnight--what difference did it make? My time belonged to the Lord, and it was up to Him to dispose of it. I found that with this attitude of mind I could go anywhere, take advantage of any opportunities offered, stay more time or less time than I had expected, and still enjoy every moment, because God had planned it, and had worked it out in the best possible way.[4] CHAPTER 7 _The Right to a Normal Romance,...", "...to trivial matters. Only, however, with regard to very trivial matters. When he arrived at Southampton on the evening of the 24th, he went at once on board the _Esperance_. \"We shall sail at noon to-morrow,\" he said to the captain. Captain Jellyby was a pleasant old salt, with a genial, open, sunburnt face, and those bright peculiar blue eyes which men who spend most of their lives on the sea often have, as though the reflection of some of its blue had got into them. \"At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to-morrow,\" replied the captain. \"Yes, and that is somewhat late; but we shan't have finished coaling before.\" \"But we stop at Plymouth surely?\" \"Well, perhaps. I cannot positively say. We may be able to go straight on to Teneriffe.\" Gerald did not make any further comments. He retired to his cabin and unpacked one or two things, then he went into the saloon, and taking up a book appeared to be absorbed with its contents. In reality he was not reading. He had written a...", "...had grown so fond of this life of danger and peril that a return to the peaceful pursuits of home-life seemed tame and dull. War hardens and blunts the finer feelings, making men callous and indifferent to the gentler ministrations of home. It was with mixed feelings of joy and regret that the regiment embarked on the steamer for New Orleans. The voyage was a break in the daily life, but when land soldiers are penned up on board a boat there is not much r to break the monotony. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> of the fourth day they laid up at a little landing to \"wood up.\" Not a house was to be seen, the tall trees stood up black and gloomy, and the dull gray sky lowered ominously over them. Glad to feel the earth beneath their feet, a few of the more venturesome leaped ashore for a \"run in the timber,\" as they expressed it, though they prudently kept near the boat. Ralph was sitting on the deck when he heard the report of a rifle, and jumping up, he called out, \"Our men are...", "...wonders why, now?\" Thus discussing Indian Jake's strange behavior and stranger reticence, and conversing of home, a subject of which they never tired, they traveled on and out upon the dazzling white of the marsh. As David had predicted, the glare was intense, and when they reached the cluster of spruce trees where they were accustomed to boil their kettle for dinner at midday, Andy complained that his eyes pained him badly and he could not see aright. \"We'll wait a bit, till th' <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> glare is past,\" suggested David. \"There's plenty o' time t' get back t' th' tilt, with th' long day now. My eyes hurt wonderful bad too.\" So they built up their fire and for an hour lounged upon a seat of spruce boughs they had arranged, holding their eyes closed, while they talked, to relieve them from the intense light reflected by the snow. The rest, however, was of no avail. The pain in their eyes grew steadily worse, and it was becoming more difficult to raise the lids,...", "...and tables and napkins to the hearth and floor. The guest room itself was large and airy, and the window panes glittered in the furtive rays of the sun. The host of the inn was at the same time a baker, and his last baking, just out of the oven, spread a delicious odor through the whole house. Stacks of fresh loaves were carried past them in clean baskets, since after church service the members of the congregation were in the habit of getting here their white bread or to drink their <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> shoppen. The hostess, a rather handsome and neat woman, dressed in their Sunday finery all her little brood of children, leisurely and pleasantly, and as she was done with one more of the little ones, the latter, proud and glad, would come running to Vreni, showing her all their finery, and innocently boasting and bragging of their belongings and of all else they held precious. When at last the fragrant coffee was brought and served for them, together with other good things, at...", "...think. She was absurdly quiet and virtuous all the next day, gathered out her stockings and mended them; began a personal expenditure account for the New-year, heading it carefully with \"darning silk, 50 cents\"; wrote a long letter to Chris, and--listened for the telephone. If only he would call her, so she could explain. Still, what could she explain? She had done it. It was water over the dam--and it is no fault of Audrey's that she would probably have spelled it \"damn.\" By <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> she was fairly abject. She did not analyze her own anxiety, or why the recollection of her escapade, which would a short time before have filled her with a sort of unholy joy, now turned her sick and trembling. Then, in the middle of the afternoon, Clay called her up. She gasped a little when she heard his voice. \"I wanted to tell you, Audrey,\" he said, \"that we can probably use the girl you spoke about, rather soon.\" \"Very well. Thank you. Is--wasn't there something else,...", "...is a very particular account of this island.] This road seems to be well sheltered from the south and east winds. One of my seamen had been on board a Dutch India ship, who put in at this isle in her way out in 1770. They were very sickly, and in want of refreshments and water. The Portuguese supplied them with some buffaloes and fowls; and they watered behind one of the beaches in a little pool, which was hardly big enough to dip a bucket in. By reducing the observed latitude at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to the peaked hill, its latitude will be 3 deg. 53' S.; and its longitude, by the watch, carried on from St Helena, is 32 deg. 34' W.; and by observations of the sun and moon, made before and after we made the Isle, and reduced to it by the watch, 32 deg. 44' 30\" W. This was the mean result of my observations. The results of those made by Mr Wales, which were more numerous, gave 32 deg. 23'. The mean of the two will be pretty near the watch, and probably nearest the truth. By...", "...unshackled in her loose draperies, quite unabashed in her state of semi-nudity--gay, reckless, wooing pleasure on the wing, surely she might have posed as the embodied archetype of France itself. So has this pagan among modern nations borrowed something of the antique spirit of wantonness. Along with its theft of the Attic charm and grace, it has captured, also, something of its sublime indifference; in the very teeth of the dull modern world, France has laughed opinion to scorn. At <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the tents were all deserted. It was at this hour that the inn garden was full. The gayety and laughter overflowed the walls. Everyone talked at once; the orders were like a rattle of artillery--painting for hours in the open air gives a fine edge to appetite, and patience is never the true twin of hunger. Everything but the _potage_ was certain to be on time. Colinette, released from her Greek draperies, with her Parisian bodice had recovered the _blague_ of the studios....", "...he would not offer them money. He would watch his chance to outwit them, he would match his intelligence against their cunning, his patience against their brute force. It would be worth a week's captivity to turn the tables on these two rogues and get back to civilization in time to set at work the police machinery of a hundred cities, so that, whatever way they might turn, there would be no escape for them. He turned several schemes over in his mind as he watched Haney preparing their <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal of bread, coffee, beans and bacon. Jim was taking a pebble from the shoe of one of the horses. Wellesly sauntered up and watched the operation, asked some questions about the horses and gradually led Jim into conversation. After a time he broke abruptly into the talk with the question: \"What is the name of these mountains?\" \"The Oro Fino,\" Jim answered promptly. Then he remembered that he and Haney had been insisting that they were the Hermosas ever since the day before...", "...under water and poured oil on the troubled waters.\" In the meantime, the endangered transport, which had promptly and intelligently obeyed the steering order, had barely escaped the torpedo fired at her. Spirits now ran high in the troopship fleet. Uncle Sam's soldiers had seen the threatened ships saved, and had also seen Uncle Sam's sailors show how easily a submarine may be fought--sometimes. After that the fleet proceeded on its uninterrupted way for so long a time that the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> meal had been eaten calmly by the voyaging soldiers. Few of them thought it worth while to cut that meal short in order to go on deck again. Especially did Pete and his friends feel indifferent to the best that the Huns could do out here on the water. Just then there came a terrific shock. It was an explosion, followed by a crash that caused the ship to stagger over to starboard, though she quickly righted herself. \"They've got us!\" yelled Pete, jumping up from the table,...", "...that afternoon. The play was one especially interesting to young girls--a drama built on lines, showing how one ambitious girl succeeded in the world with nothing but a kind heart and a worthy purpose to start with. It abounded in scenes of rural home life, wholesome and picturesque, and one of the features, most conspicuous in the advertising on the billboards was that of the character Katherine, the heroine, holding a neighborhood meeting in a cornfield, among the laborers during the <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> hour. The girl appeared in the posters perched upon a water barrel and from that pulpit in the open she, as the daughter of a blind chair caner, won hearts to happiness with the gospel of brotherly love--the new religion of the poor and the oppressed. While Rose-Mary and Alma enthused over the prospect of a particularly pleasant afternoon, Dorothy seemed nervous, and it was with some misgivings that she finally agreed to attend the party that was really arranged for her special...", "...Sunday, October 11th, we held a large meeting in Trafalgar Square, my daughter Christabel, Mrs. Drummond and I speaking from the plinth of the Nelson monument. Mr. Lloyd-George, as we afterward learned, was a member of the audience. The police were there, taking ample notes of our speeches. We had not failed to notice that they were watching us daily, dogging our footsteps, and showing in numerous ways that they were under orders to keep track of all our movements. The climax came at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on October 12th, when Christabel, Mrs. Drummond and I were each served with an imposing legal document which read, \"Information has been laid this day by the Commissioner of Police that you, in the month of October, in the year 1908, were guilty of conduct likely to provoke a breach of the peace by initiating and causing to be initiated, by publishing and causing to be published, a certain handbill, calling upon and inciting the public to do a certain wrongful and illegal act,...", "...for him. It was such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his pride. It happened that in his wanderings he was taken and sold as a slave, and his master, who was a wicked magician, demanded that he go out in search of a piece of pure white gold. \"See that thou bringest it,\" said the magician, \"or it will go hard with thee.\" So the Star-Child went in search of the piece of white gold but he could not find it, although he sought for it from morn to noon, and from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to sunset. Then he set his face toward home, weeping bitterly, for he knew that the magician would beat him with an hundred stripes. But suddenly he heard, from a thicket a cry, and, forgetting his own sorrow, he ran to the place. He saw a little Hare caught in a trap. The Star-Child had pity on it and released it and the Hare said to him, \"What shall I give thee in return for my freedom?\" And the Star-Child said to it, \"I am seeking for a piece of white gold nor can I,...", "...in it, should be induced to modify their proposition somewhat if they wish it to be adopted by other countries. In other words, to leave to each country the greatest latitude possible in adopting a universal hour. With regard to the Ottoman Empire, I must state that it is placed in a somewhat exceptional position in this respect, and is, therefore, obliged to ask for more latitude even than the other countries concerned. In our country we have two modes of reckoning time: one from <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> to noon, or from midnight to midnight, as everywhere else, (heure a la franque), the other (heure a la turque) from sundown to sundown. In this latter case the hours count from the moment when the disk of the sun is bisected by the horizon, and we count twice from _0h._ to _12h._, instead of counting without any interruption from _0h._ to _24h._ We are well aware of the inconveniences this system of counting produces, because _0h._ necessarily varies from day to day, for the...", "...the lawn to his own little kitchen. The performances he went through during the next hour would have confirmed the opinion of Mr. Bearse and his coterie that \"Shavings\" Winslow was \"next door to loony.\" He cooked a breakfast, but how he cooked it or of what it consisted he could not have told. The next day he found the stove-lid lifter on a plate in the ice chest. Whatever became of the left-over pork chop which should have been there he had no idea. Babbie came dancing in at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> on her way home from school. She found her Uncle Jed in a curious mood, a mood which seemed to be a compound of absent-mindedness and silence broken by sudden fits of song and hilarity. He was sitting by the bench when she entered and was holding an oily rag in one hand and a piece of emery paper in the other. He was looking neither at paper nor rag, nor at anything else in particular so far as she could see, and he did not notice her presence at all. Suddenly he began to rub...", "...crowd this sensation of immensity even more deeply into the mind. We cast about for some comparison to the scene. The sweep of the Gemmi precipices rising around the village of Leukerbad in Switzerland is like it in kind; but almost another Gemmi, mortared with ice and glacier, would need to be reared upon the first, to overtop the snows of the Gavarnie Cirque. We turn back to the porters at last, and the cavalcade of chairs forms again. The men are earning three francs each by this <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> holiday, and they are in good spirits. They do not think the sum too little and we certainly do not deem it too much. When we regain the inn at the village, they wait about unobtrusively for their pay, and after arming ourselves with coin for the division we come out among them. At once we become the centre of a large and respectful assemblage, all other loungers drawing near to witness the coming ceremony. Our informal words of appreciation become rather a speech when delivered...", "...to eat this old salt horse three times a day.\" Riley voiced in with: \"Begorra, and it's crame in their tay they are having, and divil a thimbleful do we get here.\" This last expression from the Irishman pleased the cook, who brought his fist down sharply on the pork-barrel, crying: \"And, men, your only salvation lies in the ballot-box.\" The cook's ballot-box amused me. Who ever heard of a sailor voting? Out of ten of our crew, we had not one American citizen! Our position at <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> today was 17 deg. 24 north latitude,--longitude 142 deg. 10 west. The wind has been steady from the northeast for the last forty-eight hours. I am satisfied that this is the commencement of the trade-winds. During the middle watch I was very sleepy, and decided to walk on the deck load as far forward as the mainmast, and back again, and so on. I noticed one of the crew standing against the weather main-rigging. As the night was dark, I could not make him out, and, remembering...", "...of it paid me well for the interruptions which my sleep had suffered. The king had slept just as usual--like the dead. The Marcos could not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful they were.

It turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is just a June day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be out of doors. Toward <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the guests arrived, and we assembled under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances. Even the king's reserve melted a little, though it was some little trouble to him to adjust himself to the name of Jones along at first. I had asked him to try to not forget that he was a farmer; but I had also considered it prudent to ask him to let the thing stand at that, and not elaborate it any. Because he was just the kind of person you could depend on to spoil a little...", "...Boldwood should be the giver. The announcement had had an abnormal and incongruous sound, as if one should hear of croquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or that some much-respected judge was going upon the stage. That the party was intended to be a truly jovial one there was no room for doubt. A large bough of mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and suspended in the hall of the bachelor's home. Holly and ivy had followed in armfuls. From six that morning till past <span class=\"clocktext\">noon</span> the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared and sparkled at its highest, the kettle, the saucepan, and the threelegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; moreover, roasting and basting operations were continually carried on in front of the genial blaze. As it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into which the staircase descended, and all encumbrances were cleared out for dancing. The log which was to form the back-brand..."]
