Madame Recamier was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old, with a reputation unsullied by a breath, and a beauty which was remarkable even twenty years afterwards. The manner in which Madame Swetchine speaks of her, in a letter to Madame de Montcalm, forms the least satisfactory passage we remember in all her correspondence: \"Madame Recamier seems sincerely to prefer a secluded life. It is fortunate, her beauty and celebrity being on the decline: ruins make little sensation in a country of ruins. It seems that to be...", "...ships in a semicircle.

The whole fleet opened with a tremendous roar of artillery, to which the Russians replied almost as heavily. Fort Constantine was several times silenced, and greatly damaged; but, on the other hand, the Russians managed to kill <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> and wound 234 men in the English fleet, and a slightly smaller number in the French. They had an unpleasant knack of firing red-hot shot in profusion, and of hitting the vessels even at the distance at which they lay.

The expense of the naval armament, which Leo sent against the Vandals, has been distinctly ascertained; and the curious and instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire. The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied seventeen thousand pounds of gold; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> thousand pounds of gold, and seven hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid into the treasury by the Praetorian praefects. But the cities were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration. The whole expense, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the African campaign, amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds...", "...development of manufacturing. The census of 1870 was faulty and inadequate, but it was sufficiently accurate to indicate that the manufacturing region was preeminently that north of the Potomac-Ohio river line and east of the Mississippi. By 1890 it was apparent that the industrial interests were shifting slightly toward the West; nevertheless the leading states were those of southern New England, and New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In these states no fewer than four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> industries employed more than a million dollars of capital each. The manufacturing of cotton, woolen and silk for the rest of the country was done here; foundry products, iron and steel manufactures, silver and brass goods, refined petroleum, boots and shoes, paper and books, with a host of other articles, were sent from this section to every part of the world. All along the line, from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania, capital engaged in manufacturing doubled between 1880 and...", "...passenger in the stern.

The renderings contained in this volume are the product of many happy hours during the past five years. No method was adopted in the work. As the translator waded through the closely printed pages of the Greek offices, what appeared at first sight to be lines worthy of translation were taken up and examined, sometimes to be cast aside again because of some unremovable blemish, at other times to be moulded to the form which they now bear. Of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pieces, thirty-five appear for the first time in English verse. For the original, the translator has gone to the service-books, and for the most part has confined himself to the hymns which are to be found in the Triodion, containing the Lenten services; and in the Pentecostarion, in which are found the hymns for the services of Easter and Pentecost. A few specimens are also given from other offices, particularly that for Christmas. Renderings from the work of the...", "...Ingratitude, Jimmy!

Several other translations followed, and that of King James last of all, in 1611. King James's translation was made by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> translators, divided into six companies, and laboring on their work three years. The Douay Bible was first translated and published complete in 1609, almost simultaneously with the Bible of King James.

The year embodied in the Pyramid was 365 days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> and seven-tenths seconds. If a person took a rod of a cubit length, and measured one of the base sides of the Pyramid, he would find this twenty-five inch measure to be contained as often as there are days in the year, with the same fraction in inches as the hours, minutes, and seconds.

I know no further details of her life until her marriage, which took place in 1806. She was then twenty-six years and a half old. My father, Francois Louis Gounod, was born in 1758, and was therefore slightly over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years of age at the time of his marriage. He was a painter of distinguished merit, and my mother has often told me that great contemporary artists, such as Gerard, Girodet, Guerin, Joseph Vernet, and Gros, considered him the best draughtsman of his day. I remember a story about Gerard, which my mother used to tell with pardonable pride. Covered as he was with honour and glory, a Baron of the Empire, owning an enormous fortune, the famous artist was noted for the smartness...", "...the desired income. Hence, concludes Cassel, if the rate falls below two per cent. the average man will decide that life is too short to provide for the future by means of an interest-income, and will expect to draw upon his principal. This means that he will not need to save as much as when he sought to accumulate a capital large enough to support him out of its interest alone. The argument is plausible but not conclusive. If the rate of interest is so low that a man must save for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years in order to obtain a sufficient interest-income to support him in his declining years, he will rarely attain that end. In the great majority of instances men who are unable to save more annually than the amount that they will need each year in old age, will expect and be compelled to use up a part or all of their capital in the period following the cessation of their economic usefulness. Nevertheless, it does not follow that they will save less at one and one-half per...", "...glass. The line is marked with a knot for each mile; the real distance between each knot being, however, 1/120 of a mile, since a half-minute is 1/120 of an hour. A knot being thus the same portion of a mile that a half-minute is of an hour, the number of knots carried off while the glass is running out will show the number of miles the vessel goes in an hour. Many glasses, however, are made for twenty-eight seconds, which, of course, reduces the number of feet for a knot to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> and six tenths. But as the line is liable to stretch and the glass to be affected by the weather, in order to avoid all danger of a vessel's overrunning her reckoning, and to be on the safe side, it is recommended to mark forty-five feet to a knot for a twenty-eight second glass.

Before the American Government took over the railway there was one class and one fare between Colon and Panama, for which the modest sum of $25 gold was demanded, or 5 pounds for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> miles, which makes even our existing railway fares seem moderate.

Taking the numbers under training in these three divisions, the charitable or voluntary institutions, the private institution, and that for paupers, we find the total to be somewhat about eighteen hundred. Scotland and Ireland have various institutions for idiots and imbeciles, which may be briefly enumerated. In the former an idiot school was established at Baldovan, near Dundee, in 1853. It was on the estate of Sir John Ogilvie. There are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> inmates. In 1862 an institution was opened at Larbert, Stirlingshire, by a society formed for that object, called the \"Scottish National Institution for the Education of Imbecile Children.\" Dr. Brodie, who now, we believe, has a private institution at Liberton, near Edinburgh, for ten pupils, was the first superintendent. It was superintended by Dr. Ireland from 1870 to 1881. In January, 1881, there were one hundred and twenty-four inmates.[226] Thus only about a hundred...", "...spot from an old verderer, who had it from his grandfather, who bore no unimportant part in it--as will be seen.

It was quartered oak and had a number of patent arrangements about it that made it unusually expensive. Walter confessed it cost him <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> dollars. This was one of the things he went in debt for. It seems he had become enamoured of just such a dresser in one of the rooms he had been caring for, a suite belonging to Van Shaw, the son of the steel magnate at Allworth. Of course, we want our son to go through school with all the comforts around him necessary for his proper culture and education.

And this we may reasonably expect from Congress at its present session. But, it may be urged, how are we to meet the interest on our debt and current expenses of $284,000,000 in the aggregate, if we repeal these taxes? The answer is a simple one. The Commission estimate our imports at $400,000,000, and our duties now average <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> per cent. Should this continue, we should draw from this source alone $188,000,000. There is also the revenue from public lands and miscellaneous sources, which the Secretary and the Revenue Commission both rate at $21,000,000, making an aggregate of $209,000,000; although the Commission, to guard against the effects of any change in the tariff, modestly rate these items at only $151,000,000.

The last week of 1889 in New York City saw two prominent brewers buried, and two others of the guild were near death. None of them were, or are, over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old. Kidney and heart disease were the causes of death in the case of the first two. Similar ailments have marked the other two gentlemen for the grave. The question arises, Was it beer or champagne that caused these diseases? In this connection the statement a physician of Bellevue Hospital once made is not amiss. These are his words: \"The worst cases of alcoholic ailments coming under our observation are those resulting from excessive beer drinking.\" In...", "...spring of 1915 was so unusual that it is believed that a short account, together with a list of the records, will be of interest to the readers of BIRD-LORE. In considering the following remarks, it may be well to bear in mind that records of the bird migration in this locality have been made each year for the past thirty-one years. Also, the amount of time spent in making observations during the past season is significant. From March 19 to May 7, field trips were made by Mr. Bruner on <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> days out of a possible fifty. Prior to and after this period observations were made by him for several weeks at intervals of from two to four days. Mr. Brimley was in the field for twelve days from March 30 to April 28, but was unable to pay full attention to birds. The duration of each trip averaged about four hours, this figure not including the time spent in going to and from the city. Observations for the most part were made independently by each of the writers, and on...", "...Sadurni, a Catalan embroiderer who flourished in the middle of the fifteenth century.

In 1543 complaint is made that Villalobos is infringing the Portuguese demarcation line, and plundering the natives, which he denies. An account of his expedition (summarized, like the other documents), written by Fray Jeronimo de Santisteban to the viceroy Mendoza, relates the sufferings of the Spaniards from hardships, famine, and disease. Of the three hundred and seventy men who had left New Spain, only one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> survive to reach the Portuguese settlements in India. The writer justifies the acts of Villalobos, and asks the viceroy to provide for his orphaned children. Another account of this unfortunate enterprise was left by Garcia Descalante Alvarado, an officer of Villalobos; it also is written to the viceroy of New Spain and is dated at Lisbon, August 1, 1548.

ALTERATION OF THE CRIMINAL CODE. At this period Mr. Peel applied the powers of his clear and dispassionate mind to the simplification and improvement of our criminal code. On the 9th of March he introduced a bill to consolidate the various acts which related to offences against property. He explained the nature of these acts at great length; but the bill was not carried through the commons during this session, Mr. Peel stating,...", "...and that it did not include any of the epigrams of Meleager's townsman Philodemus of Gadara, the friend of L.

But the prefatory poem which Meleager wrote for it has fortunately been preserved, and gives us valuable information as to the contents of the Garland. This poem,[7] in which he dedicates his work to his friend or patron Diocles, gives the names of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> poets included by him besides many others of recent times whom he does not specifically enumerate. It runs as follows: \"Dear Muse, for whom bringest thou this gardenful of song, or who is he that fashioned the garland of poets? Meleager made it, and wrought out this gift as a remembrance for noble Diocles, inweaving many lilies of Anyte, and many martagons of Moero, and of Sappho little, but all roses, and the narcissus of Melanippides budding into clear hymns, and the...", "...puff of gas in the cylinder which drives back a piston.

The descent upon Morris Island from Folly Island was undoubtedly one of the most skilful achievements of the war. Under the superintendence of Brigadier-General Vogdes, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pieces of artillery, with two hundred rounds of ammunition for each gun, and provided with suitable parapets, splinter-proof shelters, and magazines, were placed in position, by night, within speaking distance of the enemy's pickets, and within view of their observatories.

Cannons was the pride of the neighbourhood, and the duke--of whom Pope wrote, 'Thus gracious Chandos is beloved at sight'-- was as popular as he was wealthy.

They were all written at Cannons between 1718 and 1720, and number in all eleven overtures, thirty-two solos, six duets, a trio, quartet, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> choruses. Some of the above are real masterpieces; but, with the exception of 'The waves of the sea rage horribly,' and 'Who is God but the Lord?' few of them are ever heard now. And yet these anthems were most significant in the variety of the choruses and in the range of the accompaniments; and it was then, no doubt, that Handel was feeling his way toward the great and immortal sphere of his oratorio music.

The missions were all placed under the care of friars of the begging Orders, chiefly Franciscans, and the system of the Jesuit government was left unchanged.

These Tory ministers advance <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> thousand pounds of the public money to the duke, knowing that he is insolvent and cannot pay the interest. Their mode of securing the principal is still more nefarious.

How he got it remains a mystery, and from that day until his death, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years afterward, Dale kept the dangerous secret of the person who risked so much for him. It is supposed that he was provided liberally with money, and even with a passport, for he got out of England quickly and went to France.

Dale was then an active, handsome young fellow of twenty-three, and had seen more hard service than many...", "...There the sonnets number sixty-three. Mr. Wyndham insists that Drayton's latest published sonnets have alone an obvious resemblance to Shakespeare's sonnets, and that they all more or less reflect Shakespeare's sonnets as printed by Thorpe in 1609. But the whole of Drayton's century of sonnets except twelve were in print long before 1609, and it could easily be shown that the earliest fifty-three published in 1594 supply as close parallels with Shakespeare's sonnets as any of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> published subsequently. Internal evidence suggests that all but one or two of Drayton's sonnets were written by him in 1594, in the full tide of the sonnetteering craze. Almost all were doubtless in circulation in manuscript then, although only fifty-three were published in 1594. Shakespeare would have had ready means of access to Drayton's manuscript collection. Mr. Collier reprinted all the sonnets that Drayton published between 1594 and 1619 in his edition of Drayton's...", "...out to the battlefield for the purpose of counting the bodies again, and of ascertaining if this had been a menagerie with a few double-headed persons in the party.

Twenty men killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> scalps in the possession of a single Indian, without counting those secured by other participants in the contest! The more the warriors pondered over this fact, the more perplexing it became.

And the chief priest of the temple, taking pity upon him, buried him by the side of the Ronins; and his tomb still remains to be seen with those of the forty-seven comrades. This is the end of the story of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> Ronins. * * * * * A terrible picture of fierce heroism which it is impossible not to admire. In the Japanese mind this feeling of admiration is unmixed, and hence it is that the forty-seven Ronins receive almost divine honours.

CDXXVII.--DOMESTIC ECONOMY. THE following bill of fare (which consists of a dish of fish, a joint of meat, a couple of fowls, vegetables, and a pudding, being in all seven dishes for sevenpence!) had its rise in an invitation which a _young_ lady of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> sent to her lover to dine with her on Christmas Day.

On the first of September, 1604, a great religious conclave was held at Hampton Court by the established church and the Puritans, and there it was determined to make a new, revised and complete edition of the Bible, by the royal authority of King James. On the first of May, 1607, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> of the most learned men of the British realm assembled in three parties at Oxford, Cambridge and Westminster to make a new Bible for the guidance of mankind. Hebrew, Greek and Latin scholars made up the great conclave; and after four years of detailed labor the King James edition of the Bible was published to the world, cutting loose forever from the power of Rome. Although the \"Word of God\" has been revised several times since by man there are yet a large number of...", "...heads to a living superior.

Then we paddled across the bay, or upper lake, out into the broader swells of Cass Lake itself, pulled four miles across to the northernmost point of Colcaspi, or Grand Island, and made our second Saturday night's camp upon its white sands at or very near the spot where Schoolcraft and his party had encamped in July, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years before. The landward side of the beautiful beach is skirted by an almost impenetrable jungle. We had frequently seen traces, old and new, of deer, moose, bears and smaller animals, but had seen none of the animals themselves save one fine deer, and our sleep had been wholly undisturbed by prowlers; so we sank to rest on Grand Island with no fears of invasion.

The barque was named _Don Miguel_, of three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> tons measurement, hailing from Havana; with a crew of fifty-six, all told; and she mounted twelve twelve-pounders, with an ample supply of ammunition for them in her magazine. The brigantine rejoiced in the name _El Caiman_. She was a trifle bigger than I had estimated her to be, her papers showing her tonnage to be two hundred and thirty.

IV THE WAR AIMS OF FRANCE A French statesman, Mr. Louis Barthou, has summed up the War aims of France in the three words: \"Restitution, Reparation, Guarantees.\" Restitution means the surrender of all occupied territories, of the territories occupied by force during forty-seven months, as well as the territories occupied by force during <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years. Between the five departments forming Flanders-Argonne and the five departments forming Alsace-Lorraine, France is unable to make any distinction. France wants Metz back on the same ground upon which she wants Lille back. If Germany is to keep Metz she might as well keep Lille. Her claim to Strasbourg is not better than her claim to Cambrai. And this is a thing which \"the man in the street\" fails sometimes to understand. He says: \"Yes, we know, Alsace-Lorraine was...", "...the Nation. * * * * * SOME CURIOUS AND SUGGESTIVE FACTS. What proportion of the funds contributed by living donors to missionary societies comes directly from church collections? We presume the answer from a large majority of the contributors would be, three-fourths or four-fifths. But the curious fact is, that, for the three years, 1886, 1887 and 1888, the average contributions to the American Missionary Association from church collections are <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> per cent., from Sunday-schools seven per cent., from Woman's Missionary Societies five per cent., from individual donors forty-one per cent. It thus appears that less than one-half the total sum comes from collections in the churches. Another curious fact is, that these receipts directly from the churches are uniform, not differing to the extent of three per cent. in the past three years. So that, with all the importunity and pressure, the plate collections in the churches...", "...I couldn't possibly change it to Mezzerow.\" \"But if you changed it, the name would stay,\" said Marcus. \"I'll give you money to see that it gets done.

Never was there a more flagrant exposure of the insolent impunity with which Tory...", "...company directed its attention toward the undertaking, embalming, and ice-cream parlors of our highly esteemed fellow-townsman, Mr. A.

The approach is by such a low door that one has to stoop exceedingly in order to enter. The tomb occupies the whole length of the chapel, and answers the purpose of an altar. We could not look into the sarcophagus. The illumination of this chapel is very grand both by night and day; <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> lamps are kept continually burning above the grave. The portion of the chapel containing the tomb is so small, that when the priest reads mass only two or three people have room to stand and listen.

One day he took ten of these gold-pieces and went to town; not to the cross-roads, but to the larger place, some ten miles distant, where was a distillery, and there he bought two barrels of whisky. Whisky in those days, before the time of present taxes, was sold from the distillery at prices ranging from thirty-five to fifty cents a gallon, about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> gallons to a barrel. The team of horses dragged wearily home the heavy load; but they did not stop when home was reached, either in front of the house or at the barn-yard gate. Instead, they were turned aside through a rude gate leading into the flats, and thence drew the load to the mouth of the little cave, where, unseen by any one, Appleman tilted the barrels out and left them lying on the sward. Other things had been bought in town that day, and Appleman had no...", "...twice we had crossed the equinoctial line; for, as I said before, we went 5 deg. beyond it to the south, and now we were in 15 deg.[96] to the north. Being in this state of mind, it pleased the Holy Spirit to give us some rest from our great hardships; for as we were searching for a port in which to repair our ships, we came upon a people who received us with much friendship. We found that they had a very great quantity of oriental pearls, and exceedingly good ones. We stayed with them <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> days, and obtained from them 119 marcs of pearls for very little merchandise in exchange. I believe the pearls did not cost us the value of forty ducats. What we gave them was nothing but bells, and looking-glasses, and beads,[97] and ten bells, and tin foil. For one bell a native gave all the pearls he had. Here we learnt how they fished for them, and where, and they gave us many shells in which they are born.

Contrary to the Christian doctrine of forgiveness, the Japan of olden days endeavoured to exalt the original instinct of human nature, \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" into a decree. And how deep this notion has rooted itself into the hearts of the people is best illustrated by the story of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> Ronins, which everybody in Japan knows by heart, and which is the favourite nursery tale of each Nippon child. Simple as the story is, it is very characteristic. A nobleman is betrayed by his adversary and put to death. Forty-seven of his followers become bandits and swear to revenge their lord. After many vicissitudes the object of their revenge falls into their hands and they kill him. When brought to justice all the forty-seven commit hara-kiri.

In order to explain why such a question should be brought up <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years after the treaty had been signed, he showed that it was founded on some indefinite or ambiguous clauses of the treaty of 1783, but not proposed until 1820.

Eighty thousand shells rained upon one shallow sector of a thousand yards, and these were so marvellously placed that the crater of one cut into that of its neighbor, pulverizing everything that lived and turning the man-filled trenches into tombs.

For example; two thousand dollars put aside every year, and subjected to compound interest, will aggregate in twelve years a principal capable of yielding an annual income of two thousand dollars. At two per cent. the same amount of yearly saving will not lead to the same income in less than thirty-five years. If the rate be one and one-half per cent., <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years will be required to produce the desired income. Hence, concludes Cassel, if the rate falls below two per cent. the average man will decide that life is too short to provide for the future by means of an interest-income, and will expect to draw upon his principal. This means that he will not need to save as much as when he sought to accumulate a capital large enough to support him out of its interest alone. The argument is plausible but not conclusive.

Ruperta, carried away by the general enthusiasm, nodded all sparkling to Compton, and that made his heart beat and his soul aspire. So next over he claimed his rights, and took the ball. Luck still befriended him: he bowled four wickets in twelve overs; the wicket-keeper stumped a fifth: the rest were \"the tail,\" and disposed of for a few runs, and the total was no more than Huntercombe's first innings. Our hero then took the bat, and made <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> runs before he was disposed of, five wickets down for a hundred and ten runs. The match was not won yet, nor sure to be; but the situation was reversed. On going out, he was loudly applauded; and Ruperta naturally felt proud of her admirer. Being now free, he came to her irresolutely with some iced champagne. Ruperta declined, with thanks; but he looked so imploringly that she sipped a little, and said, warmly, \"I hope we shall win: and, if we do, I know whom we...", "...that no argument could keep down. \"If we could prove to you,\" continued Mr. Witherspoon, \"that we came by these four fowls honestly, I hope you will be frank enough to apologize to my boys for unjustly suspecting them of being hen thieves?\" \"Go on then and do it, mister; but I warn you I'm sot in my ways, and hard to convince.

I went under cover of this escort to the end of their march, and the next morning proceeded to La Grange with no convoy but the few cavalry men I had with me. From La Grange to Memphis the distance is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> miles. There were no troops stationed between these two points, except a small force guarding a working party which was engaged in repairing the railroad. Not knowing where this party would be found I halted at La Grange.

The amazement had been universal. The count looked like a gentleman, and was very well preserved; but he was at least <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old, and Miss Genevieve was hardly twenty. Now, if the bride had been poor, they would have understood the match, and approved it: it is but natural that a poor girl should sacrifice her heart to her daily bread. But here it was not so.

Within the same period the United States have been a party to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> arbitrations--being more than half of all that have taken place in the modern world. The questions settled by these arbitrations have been just such as have commonly caused wars, namely, questions of boundary, fisheries, damage caused by war or civil disturbances, and injuries to commerce.

At the present time the fissure is traced by a line of several hundred insignificant mounds of fragmental materials which mark where the lava issued (Fig. 216).

As Alexius had done to his brother, so this chief welcomed Baldwin as his son; but Baldwin, having once entered into the city, cared nothing for the means which had brought him thither, and the death of his adoptive father was followed by the establishment at Edessa of a Latin principality which lasted for fifty-four, or, as some have thought, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years. Baldwin had anticipated the unconditional surrender of Samosata; but the Turkish governor had some of the Edessenes in his power, and he refused to give up the city except on the payment of ten thousand gold pieces.

No difficulty is insurmountable; nothing is impossible to those who will and those who love.\" The difficulty that at that moment seemed most insurmountable was the want of money. The hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> young men required feeding, and the seminary was poor. The bishop sold the few fields at Riese that were all he possessed to meet the immediate need, and others, stirred by his zeal and eloquence, came forward to help him.

The entire income he obtained from his cure never at any time exceeded three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pounds, and in the year when it reached that high figure there had been an unusually large number of marriages. It was not surprising that the vicar should desire to improve his circumstances by receiving one or two pupils.

The small settlement was the meeting place of four roads by means of which Pope's army of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> thousand men would be united. Jackson, informed of the advance, immediately set his three divisions in motion for Culpeper, hoping to crush Banks, hold the town, and prevent the uniting of the Army of Virginia.

Even before dinner we measured the rams and found that the horns of the one he had killed exceeded the published records for the species by half an inch in circumference. The horns were <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> inches in length, but were broken at the tips; the original length was fifty-one inches; the circumference at the base was twenty inches. Moreover, mine was not far behind in size. As I snuggled into my fur sleeping bag that night, I realized that it had been the most satisfactory hunting day of my life.

And the spirit of Hickory Ridge was aroused in civic pride. They yearned to win out over all competitors, just as they had done...", "...Courier_. The fruits of his unwearying devotion to authorship began to mature in 1833, when he was awarded a hundred-dollar prize for a short story in the Baltimore _Saturday Visiter_, and when the first prize for a poem in the same competition was withheld from him only because of his success with the \"MS.

His poems, tales, and critical articles appeared in no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> American periodicals, from dailies to annuals, and he served in the editorial offices of five. First of these was the _Southern Literary Messenger_, with which he was connected in Richmond, Virginia, from July, 1835, till January, 1837.

There are trustworthy accounts of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> groups, reliefs, and statues by his hand, and it is not probable that these are all that he executed. Praxiteles represented youth and beauty and such subjects as are most pleasing to popular taste.

'THE CORNHILL,' 'GOOD WORDS,' AND LONDON SOCIETY' THE CORNHILL MAGAZINE, which began in 1860 with Thackeray as editor, showed from the very first that the aim of the Magazine was to keep the level of its pictures equal to that of its text. In looking through the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> volumes of the first series it is gratifying to find that this purpose was never forgotten. Many a rival magazine has been started since under the happiest auspices, with the most loyal intention to have the best and only the very best illustrations; but in a few years the effort has been too exacting, and the average commonplace of its padding in prose and verse has been equalled by the dull mediocrity of its pictures. Only those who have experienced the difficulty which...", "...neighbor, Mexico, it will be found that the Government of Haiti has been more stable and that the country has experienced less bloodshed and anarchy.

In Mexico, during its 99 years of independence, there have been <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> rulers and eighty-seven administrations. \"Graft\" has been plentiful, shocking at times, but who in America, where the Tammany machines and the municipal rings are notorious, will dare to point the finger of scorn at Haiti in this connection.

General Howe was sufficiently impressed to draw in his troops, and keep very closely shut up in Philadelphia, but his country was not moved at all. The fact that it had taken <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> days to get their army from the Elk River to Philadelphia, and that in that time they had fought two successful battles and yet had left the American army still active and menacing, had no effect upon the British mind.

At <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> minutes past nine they had traversed three out of the five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral. At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently the storm would not be long in bursting forth. The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.

It is commonly known that banking facilities in the Southern and Western sections of the country are small indeed as compared with the New England, Eastern, Central, and Pacific Coast sections, where large cities abound. To illustrate, in 1909, when the total banking power was close to twenty-one billions, more than half was represented by <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> cities, and close to one-quarter was held by the two hundred banks in New York and Chicago. In other words about 1 per cent. of the country's banks held close to one-quarter of the country's banking power.

The _Conquest_ was hit by four or five twelve-inch shells, and lost <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> of her crew killed and wounded. Later, the _Penelope_ was torpedoed by an enemy submarine. The explosion carried away her stern-post and rudder; the whole after part of her had practically been blown off.

In looking over the rings of growth, I found that a few of them were much thicker than the others; and these thick rings, or coats of wood, tell of favorable seasons. There were also a few extremely thin rings of growth. In places two and even three of these were together. These were the results of unfavorable seasons,--of drought or cold.

But, first, whenever in written words or in reported conversation, Ben speaks of Shakespeare by name, he speaks of his WORKS: in 1619 to Drummond of Hawthornden; in 1623 in commendatory verses to the Folio; while, about 1630, probably, in his posthumously published Discourses, he writes on Shakespeare as the friend and \"fellow\" of the players, on Shakespeare as his own friend, and as a dramatist. On each of these three occasions, Ben's...", "...highest improvement; yet we shall find, that even at this late period few measures had been taken to preserve the health of seamen, more than had been known to our uninstructed ancestors.

But he had got into the newspapers before he got into Parliament. The town was kept ringing with Mr. Disraeli's name. In London he was just as much talked of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years ago as he is to-day. If the rudeness of a little terseness is passed over, I may fairly say that publicity was Mr. Disraeli's passion; in the circumstances of his position, audacity was his only means; and, with his style of character and intellect, inaccuracy was his necessity.

An instance will suffice to illustrate this: When the present war began in 1895 the duty on a hundred kilogrammes of woolen cashmere was fifteen dollars and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> cents if Spanish, three hundred dollars if foreign. These differential duties opened a reign of prosperity for industry in Spain, where foreign goods were imported or smuggled, to be later sent to Cuba as Spanish.

Built by Cocquereau, the treasurer of Louis XI., the castle was given by Louis XIV. to de Maintenon, and here in 1685 in its little chapel, he is supposed to have married her, though it is generally conceded that that ceremony occurred at Versailles but that they came here immediately afterwards. The King was but <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> and she fifty years of age, so that he lived with her thirty years. She certainly possessed charms past understanding to have enchained such a man at that comparatively youthful age, to have enchained and held him as she did for thirty years.

She must have been far different and far more to have held this Louis, who probably was as nearly natural as it was possible for him to be, here in...", "...beginning. In this last move there was a brisk fire upon our troops, and some execution was done. One cannon-ball passed through our ranks, not far from me. It took off the head of an enlisted man, and the under jaw of Captain Page of my regiment, while the splinters from the musket of the killed soldier, and his brains and bones, knocked down two or three others, including one officer, Lieutenant Wallen, --hurting them more or less. Our casualties for the day were nine killed and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> wounded. At the break of day on the 9th, the army under Taylor was ready to renew the battle; but an advance showed that the enemy had entirely left our front during the night. The chaparral before us was impenetrable except where there were roads or trails, with occasionally clear or bare spots of small dimensions. A body of men penetrating it might easily be ambushed. It was better to have a few men caught in this way than the whole army, yet it was necessary that...", "...the Civil War our navy was suffered to fall into neglect and decay. The thirty-seven cruisers, all but four of which were of wood; the fourteen single-turreted monitors built during the war; the muzzle-loading guns, belonged to a past age. By 1881 this was fully realized and the foundation of a new and splendid navy was begun by the construction of three unarmored cruisers--the _Atlanta_, _Boston_, and _Chicago_. Once started, the new navy grew rapidly, and in the course of twelve years <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> vessels were afloat or on the stocks. [17] NEW REFORMS DEMANDED.--Meantime the wonderful development of our country caused a demand for further reforms. The chief employers of labor were corporations and capitalists, many of whom abused the power their wealth gave them. They were accused of importing laborers under contract and thereby keeping wages down, of getting special privileges from legislatures, and of combining to fix prices to suit themselves. In the campaign of...", "...later, the forty-seven Ronin (\"wave-people\"--Samurai who had lost their natural lord and their rights) were to die in glorious suicide, carrying out the feudal idea of fidelity. You know the story probably; at any rate, you will find it in Mitford's tales of old Japan. It is a beautiful story, full of noble details, telling how, by the mean contrivance of a certain lord, the Prince of Ako was put in the wrong, and his condemnation to death and confiscation obtained. And how, then, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> gentlemen, faithful vassals of the dead lord, swore to avenge the honor of their master, and for that purpose to put aside all that might stand in the way. For this end they put aside all else they cared for, even wife and children, and through every obstacle pursued their plan up to the favorable moment when they surprised, on a winter night, in his palace, among his guards, the object of their vengeance, whose suspicions had been allayed by long delay. And how his...", "...was ceded to Japan as the outcome of the Chino-Japanese War in 1895, while as the result of the recent conflict with Russia, Japan has obtained back the southern half of the large island of Sakhalin, which formerly entirely belonged to her, as well as Port Arthur and Dalny on the mainland, not to speak of the preponderating influence she has obtained in Korea, which is now practically under the suzerainty of Japan. The population of the Empire according to the last census was about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> millions, and, like that of Great Britain, it is annually increasing. The proximity of Japan to the Asiatic Continent, despite the lessons in geography which the late war afforded, is not, I think, generally understood. The nearest point of the Japanese coast is only 100 miles distant from Korea, while between the two lies the important island of Tsu-shima, which Japan found so useful as a strategic position during the war with Russia. The island of Sakhalin, the southern...", "...him to escape, or he will be killed. The visitor, terribly frightened, is glad to get off through a side door.

CHAPTER XXXIV. CONCERT SALOONS. There are seventy-five concert saloons in New York, which employ seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> waiter girls. The brothels usually termed dance-halls, are included in this estimate, but, as we design referring especially to them in another chapter, we shall pass them by, for the present, and devote this chapter to the concert saloons proper. Eight years ago, a Philadelphia manager opened a concert mall which he called the \"Melodeon,\" at the old Chinese Assembly Rooms on Broadway. This was the first institution of the kind ever seen in New York, and imitations of it...", "...believe?\" a voice within him seemed to ask. \"I believe there is an absolute difference between right and wrong,\" was the answer. \"Have you ever put yourself on the side of the right to follow it regardless of consequences?\" was the next question. \"I have not,\" was the answer, \"but I will.\" So Horace Bushnell kneeled there in his room and dedicated himself to the service of the right. And what was the result? After he had been a preacher of the Gospel in Hartford, Connecticut, for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years he said, \"Better than I know any man in Hartford I know Jesus Christ.\" When I was a lad I was overtaken by darkness while some eight or ten miles from home. The night was intensely black, so much so that I lost my way absolutely. I found myself after some hours in a dense forest. I made up my mind to dismount from my horse and sleep on the ground, as I saw no chance of finding my way home. But I had no sooner dismounted than the lightning began to flash and the...", "...the unanimous \"all hail!\" of intellectual Christendom; finally, not by the hasty partisanship of his own generation, nor by the biassed judgment of an age trained in the same modes of feeling and of thinking with himself,--but by the solemn award of generation succeeding to generation, of one age correcting the obliquities or peculiarities of another; by the verdict of two hundred and thirty years, which have now elapsed since the very _latest_ of his creations, or of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years if we date from the earliest; a verdict which has been continually revived and re-opened, probed, searched, vexed, by criticism in every spirit, from the most genial and intelligent, down to the most malignant and scurrilously hostile which feeble heads and great ignorance could suggest when cooperating with impure hearts and narrow sensibilities; a verdict, in short, sustained and countersigned by a longer series of writers, many of them eminent for wit or learning,...", "...possession, in 1713, by the peace of Utrecht; but in 1779 it was assailed by the united forces of France and Spain, and the siege continued till the 2nd of February, 1783. The chief attack was made on the 13th September, 1782. On the part of the besiegers, besides stupendous batteries on the land side, mounting two hundred pieces of ordnance, there was an army of 40,000 men, under the command of the Duc de Crillon. In the bay lay the combined fleets of France and Spain, comprising <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> sail of the line, beside ten battering ships of powerful construction, that cost upwards of L50,000 each. From these the heaviest shells rebounded, but ultimately two of them were set on fire by red-hot shot, and the others were destroyed to prevent them from falling into the hands of the British commander. The rest of the fleet also suffered considerably; but the defenders escaped with very little loss. In this engagement 8,300 rounds were fired by the garrison, more than...", "...had drawn him into the adventure; they moderated Licquet's zeal, and the prefect confided to him the drawing up of the general report of the affair, a task of which he acquitted himself so well that his voluminous work seemed to Fouche \"sufficiently luminous and circumstantial to be submitted as it was to his Majesty.\" Then they began, but in no haste, to concern themselves with the trial of the other prisoners. It was necessary, according to custom, to interrogate and confront the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> persons imprisoned; of this number the prosecution only held thirty-two, of whom twenty-three were present. These were Flierle, Harel, Grand-Charles, Fleur d'Epine and Le Hericey who by Allain's orders had attacked the waggon; the Marquise de Combray, her daughter and Lefebre, instigators of the crime; Gousset the carrier; Alexandre Buquet, Placene, Vannier, Langelley, who had received the money; Chauvel and Lanoe as accomplices, and the innkeepers of Louvigny, d'Aubigny...", "...I might illustrate it in this way: You can't eat grass; at least, you wouldn't do very well on it. But the steer eats grass and you eat the steer, so you get the grass, don't you? Your corn, wheat, oats, timothy, potatoes, so far as we know, can't touch free nitrogen in the air, but clover can and then feed it to those other crops. \"Let us look into how we got the phosphorus. On land that would not grow over six to eight bushels of wheat per acre we have succeeded once in growing <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> and three-fourths bushels to the acre, on all the land sowed, of wheat that sold away above the market price and weighed sixty-four pounds to the measured bushel, and never put on a pound of phosphorus. We got it from that tillage we told you about. Our land in northeastern Ohio is not very good naturally. It is nothing like what you have in this state. Most of you know that is the poorest land we have in the state in general, but we have a fair share of clay and sand in...", "...scene, we resumed our journey. My two companions had been telling me that we should have to cross the North River in a boat, and I did not understand how a boat could be made to carry our team and be perfectly safe, but when we arrived there, I was much surprised to see other teams that were to cross over with us, and a number of people. At that time an old scow crossed from New York City to the Jersey shore, once in about two hours. What a great change has taken place in the last <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years; now large steam ferry boats are crossing and recrossing, making the trip in a few minutes. It was the first time that I had ever crossed a stream, except on a bridge, and I feared that we might upset and all be drowned, but no accident happened to us; we landed in safety, and went on our way rejoicing towards Elizabethtown. At that place I saw a regiment of soldiers from Kentucky, who were on their way to the northern frontier to fight the British. They were a rough...", "...an animating prospect to the afflicted Christian. [4] The first edition of this work was republished in this country. In England it has reached the fifth edition, much enlarged.

He bought a tract of 276 acres in the northern part of Detroit and began to plan the construction of his present factory, a number of huge buildings covering more than <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> acres. In this mammoth plant Ford had at last the opportunity, unhampered by any want of capital, to put into operation his old ideas of factory management. Here 1800 men were to work, quickly, efficiently, without the loss of a moment or a motion, all of them integral parts of one great machine. Each department makes one part of the Ford car, complete, from raw material to the finished product, and every part is carried swiftly and directly, by gravity, to the assembling...", "...Caius being his proper name. He, as we have seen, repaired these steps, and so they were called after him; but that was not their previous name. The question arises, What was that name? Why, none other than the Porta Carmenta, the missing third gate of Roma Quadrata, \"the gate _since_ called Carmental by the Roman state.\" It was up this gateway that the Romans brought the Sabine women when they ran off with them in the Circus Maximus. Valerius Antias says they were five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> in number; Plutarch says there were six hundred and eighty-three, and that the event took place on the 18th of August. But before this the gate had another name, the original name in the Arcadian period. We know from Virgil and Diodorus Siculus that it existed before the time of Romulus, and was incorporated by him into his city. Let us see what that name was. \"Hercules, after he had gone through Liguria and Tuscany, encamped on the banks of the Tiber, where Rome now...", "...my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the king. 47:26.

But I will sleep with my fathers, and thou shalt take me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of my ancestors. And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast commanded. 47:31.

On the poll, Captain Sharpe was restored, and Mr Dampier, who had voted against him, prepared, together with his associates, to return over land to the Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, on the 17th April, 1681, they quitted Captain Sharpe, without electing any commander, and resolved to repass the Isthmus of Darien, though only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> men. This was one of the boldest enterprises ever ventured upon by so small a number of men, yet they succeeded without any considerable loss. Landing on the continent on the 1st of May, they repassed the isthmus in twenty-three days; and on the 24th embarked in a French privateer, commanded by Captain Tristian, with whom they joined a fleet of nine buccaneers, on board of which were nearly 600 men. With this great force they were in hopes of doing great things against the...", "...rang through the world, and startled Philip in the depths of his Escorial. The first Englishman, and the second of any nation, he then ploughed his memorable \"furrow round the earth,\" carrying amazement and, destruction to the Spaniards as he sailed, and after three years brought to the Queen treasure enough, as it was asserted, to maintain a war with the Spanish King for seven years, and to pay himself and companions, and the merchant-adventurers who had participated in his enterprise, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pounds sterling for every pound invested in the voyage. The speculation had been a fortunate one both, for himself and for the kingdom. The terrible Sea-King was one of the great types of the sixteenth century. The self-helping private adventurer, in his little vessel the 'Golden Hind,' one hundred tons burthen, had waged successful war against a mighty empire, and had shown England how to humble Philip.

One feels that there is no one-sided use of any material. The Spanish, the Venetian, the French, the Dutch nowhere displaces the English. In Froude's Elizabeth one gets the impression that the Simancas manuscripts furnish a disproportionate basis of the narrative; in Ranke's England, that the story is made up too much from the Venetian archives. Gardiner himself copied many Simancas manuscripts in Spain, and he studied the archives in Venice, Paris, Brussels, and...", "...made about five minutes after death, and a male child about four pounds in weight was extracted.

Another reason is that soapmakers have had every interest in using soda in preference to potash--particularly when latterly soda has been so cheap.

It will be evident, therefore, that the use of potash instead of soda is decidedly more advantageous to the soapboiler, and more particularly in the present age, when the demand is for cheap articles, often quite without regard to the quality or purpose for which they are to be used. As far as consumers are concerned, this has been a mistake. Potash soap, though it may cost more, is in most cases actually the most economical.

His mother, Marilla by name, was an excellent type of the devout Christian woman of her day; she believed firmly in that God, whose inscrutable wisdom directed the ways of her race through paths that were truly hard. She hesitated not to teach her son Daniel to love, fear and obey the God in whom she trusted, using whatever light she had. Christopher...", "...in Cheshire; is described as of Nantwich in three legal documents from 1713 to 1725; by the same description, administered to her brother John in 1720, and made her will on August 22, 1727, which was proved on October 10 in the same year.

He opened it as rapid steps approached along the passage, accompanied by the jingle of spurs and the clatter of sabretache and trailing sabre. Colonel Grant appeared, followed by a young officer of Light Dragoons who was powdered from head to foot with dust. The youth--he was little more--lurched forward wearily, yet at sight of Wellington he braced himself to attention and saluted. \"You appear to have ridden hard, sir,\" the Commander greeted him. \"From Almeida in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> hours, my lord,\" was the answer. \"With these from Sir Robert.\" And he proffered a sealed letter. \"What is your name?\" Wellington inquired, as he took the package. \"Hamilton, my lord,\" was the answer; \"Hamilton of the Sixteenth, aide-de-camp to Sir Robert Craufurd.\" Wellington nodded. \"That was great horsemanship, Mr. Hamilton,\" he commended him; and a faint tinge in the lad's haggard cheeks responded to that rare praise. \"The urgency was great, my lord,\" replied...", "...with some of the people, that five of them died that night; though their deaths were attributed to the sea water which they had previously drank.

As they had no rope with, which to make fast their boat to the shore and prevent it from being dashed to pieces, they remained in it the whole night. Next day at dawn, sixteen weak, miserable and exhausted wretches, the sad remains of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> who had originally taken refuge in the large boat, went on shore and laid themselves down in the snow. Hunger, however, soon obliged them to examine if there might not remain some of the provisions which they had brought with them from the ship: All they found was a very small ham, an inconsiderable remnant of cheese, and some biscuit dust in a bag, mixed with the dung of mice. These they warmed by means of a small fire, which they made of the boat seats, and in some measure...", "...and in the lantern-light their flesh looked an unhealthy, mottled pink. Each wore his hair wound in a short queue, bent forward and tied in a stiff loop on the crown. As one of the vast hulks lumbered by, cooling his moon-face with a tiny fan, Daunt pointed him out to Barbara. \"That is the famous Hitachiyama,\" he told her, \"the champion wrestler of Japan.\" \"How big he is!\" \"It runs in families,\" he said. \"They diet and train, too, from babyhood. He weighs three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pounds.\" A roar came from the lighted canvas and a man emerged and wrote something on a sign-board like a tally-sheet. Daunt stopped and perused it. \"You may be interested, ladies and gentlemen,\" he said, \"to learn that Mr. Terrible-Horse has knocked out Mr. Small-Willow-Tree, but that Mr. Tiger-Elephant has been allowed a foul over Mr. Frozen-Stork.

Arbuckle, who had come here in 1850 and was associated for a short time with S. Lazard, conducted a dry goods store. From 1852 to 1856, Arbuckle was City Treasurer. In the same building, and adjoining Arbuckle's, John Jones, father of Mrs. J. B. Lankershim and M. G. Jones, carried on a wholesale grocery business. Jones had left England for Australia, when <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old, and a year later touched the coast of California at Monterey and came to Los Angeles. Twice a year, Jones went north in a schooner, for the purpose of replenishing his stock; and after making his purchases and having the boat loaded, he would return to Los Angeles. Sometimes he traveled with the round-bellied, short and jolly Captain Morton who recalled his illustrious prototype, Wouter van Twiller, so humorously described by Washington Irving as \"exactly five...", "...by the recent programme, in a sufficiently efficient state to retain the supremacy of the seas? Let us face the situation boldly, and allow a well-known and distinguished officer to reply to that question. Admiral of the Fleet Sir Thomas Symonds, G.C.B., writing to me, says-- Our weak Navy, with its inefficient _personnel_, has now to perform an enormously increased duty, such as defending increased commerce, food, and coals. Our guns are the worst in the world in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> vessels, mounting 350 muzzleloaders, where the French and all foreign Navies use _only breechloaders_. Dimensions, expense, and very many other reasons are given for this ruinous custom, but all other Navies mount breechloaders on vessels of the same dimensions as our own. As to expenses, such economy (so-called) means the most execrable parsimony--to ruthlessly murder men and disgrace our flag and Navy. Our forty-seven feeble vessels, weak in...", "...to her solitary evening meal, alone, except for the nearly blind old pointer who laid his grizzled muzzle upon her knees, gazing wistfully into her face, as seating herself upon the step of the sun-dial, she fondled his smooth, depressed black head. 'Poor Ponto!' she said, 'we are grown old together. Our young ones are all gone.' Grown old? Less old in proportion than Ponto--still in full vigour of mind and body, but old in disenchantment, and not without the traces of her <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years. The auburn hair was still in rich masses of curl; only on close inspection were silver threads to be detected; the cheek was paler, the brow worn, and the gravely handsome dress was chosen to suit the representative of the Charlecotes, not with regard to lingering youthfulness. The slow movement, subdued tone, and downcast eye, had an air of habitual dejection and patience, as though disappointment had gone deeper, or solitude were telling more on the spirits, than...", "...* * Another need for humanitarian diplomacy arose the following year. The attitude and proscriptions of the Roumanian authorities had doubtless encouraged anti-Semitic activity in Russia, and the latter Government, no longer contenting itself with the application of restrictions in the book of laws which compelled Jews to live in the Pale settlements, officially encouraged mobs to massacre and loot, culminating on April 19-20, 1903, with the outbreak in Kishineff, where <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> Jews were killed, ninety-two severely wounded, and some five hundred more slightly injured. In addition great material losses were inflicted: seven hundred houses were destroyed, six hundred stores pillaged, and thousands of families utterly ruined. When these facts became known, they called forth an expression of indignation throughout the civilized world. In New York a mass meeting was called at Carnegie Hall by hundreds of the foremost New York Christians, in protest...", "...runs and unfamiliar intervals. But slowly, after the first few moments, there had crept to her inner ear a strange, errant rhythm. She had felt her feet stealthily gliding, her arms bending, with those of the score of listening children who at the first twittering of the strings, had crept from stables and servants' quarters like infant toads in a shower. Afterward Haru, in her pretty broken English, had told her stories--old legends that are embalmed in the _geisha_ dances, of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> _Ronin_, and of the great _Shogun_ who slept by the huge stone lanterns in Uyeno Park. * * * * * When Barbara and her uncle started on their walk--he was to show her the Chapel--the Ambassador strolled with them as far as the main gate of the compound.

The party received <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> rifles, and a number of fusils with plenty of powder and lead.\" McKee, Dixon, and Girty were open and active agents in exciting the Indians to attack the American frontiers. They held frequent talks with them and supplied them liberally with goods and munitions of war.

The avowed cause of difference was commercial policy; they were the Free Traders, but they also justly foresaw that the reaction would extend to other matters. They took the name of the _Liberale Vereinigung_, but were generally known as the _Sezessionisten_; they hoped to become the nucleus of a united Liberal party in which all sections should join together on the principles of Free Trade and constitutional development. At the elections of 1881 they secured <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> seats, but they were not strong enough to maintain themselves, and with great reluctance in 1884 formed a coalition with the Progressives (_Freisinnigen_), who had gained greatly in strength owing to the breach among the government parties.

The amount was probably more than the late proprietor expected, as he said he would refuse a thousand pound cheque in exchange for his books.

He was in the habit of saying, \"What will Sam Sotheby make of this or that after I am gone?\" In 1833 and 1834 the library of P. A. Hanrott was sold by Evans in five parts, and during <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> days, for L22,409. There were 10,826 lots.

Suppose, for example, that the distance between A and O is exactly five degrees, and that the length of the intervening line is three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> miles; then, dividing the latter by the former number, we find the length of a degree to be sixty-nine miles and four tenths.

Of the franc tireurs eight were killed, fourteen wounded. Of the Uhlans <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> were killed, and nineteen wounded remained on the ground. Their large number of killed, in proportion to the wounded, was accounted for by the fact that the firing was so close that, in many cases, the coats of the dead men were actually singed by the explosion; while the slightly wounded men had been able to regain their horses, and escape.

His first great work was an edition of Panini's _Acht Bucher grammatischer Regeln_ (Bonn, 1839-1840), which was in reality a criticism of Franz Bopp's philological methods. This book Bohtlingk again took up <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years later, when he republished it with a complete translation under the title _Paninis Grammatik mit Ubersetzung_ (Leipzig, 1887).

He was now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old, a man of few words and modest demeanour, small in stature and slight in frame, delicately organized, but endowed with wonderful nervous energy and sleepless intelligence.

It sends me back to work with much too good an opinion of myself,--and that is bad for literary self-judgement.

From 1818, her _consumption_, only, of cotton, is given, as best representing her relations to slave labor for that commodity.

Though the record was marred at places, they behaved well and retained to a large degree public sympathy. When the price of anthracite rose from about $5 a ton to $28 and $30, the parts of the country using hard coal were threatened with a fuel famine and had begun to realize it.

It originally weighed about fifty-six pounds, but that portion of it preserved in the British Museum is stated in the official catalogue to weigh <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pounds nine ounces and fifty-three grains--just double the weight of the Devonshire aerolite. When we come to inquire into the various opinions which have been held in different ages respecting the origin of aerolites, and the power which causes their descent, we must go back to the times of the ancient Greeks, and we find that those of their philosophers who had directed their attention to the subject had four theories to account for this singular phenomenon.

In estimating the character of Toussaint L'Ouverture, regard must be paid, not to the enlightened age in which he lived, but to the rank in society from which he sprang--a rank which must be classed with a remote and elementary age of mankind. Born <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years before the commencement of the revolt, he had reached the prime of manhood, a slave, with a soul uncontaminated by the degradation which surrounded him. Living in a state of society where worse than polygamy was actually urged, we find him at this period faithful to one wife--the wife of his youth--and the father of an interesting family.

The Acropolis was also enriched with another figure of Athena in bronze--also the work of Phidias.

But it is probable that the second of these returns, when he said that he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old, gives his correct age. This would place his birth in 1386, and various deductions from other sources justify this attribution. We gather also that Donatello lived with his mother Orsa, his father having died before 1415. The widow, who is mentioned in 1427, and not in 1433, presumably died before the latter date. One sister, Tita, a dowerless widow, is mentioned in the earliest _denunzia_, living with her mother and Donatello, her son Giuliano having been born in...", "...ye listened, ye men of Cavalla, to the history of the Mamelukes of the last century, the events of all the other lands of the world would sound to you, compared with the deeds that have been done in the land of the Egyptians since the year 620, after the birth of the great prophet Mohammed, like nursery-tales.

In 1741, it was estimated that about one hundred and twenty-five white men--traders, pack-horse men, servants, and townsmen--depended for their livelihood upon the traffic centring at the Augusta station; another estimate, made in the same year, placed the number of horses...", "...His cousin, Cardinal Pucci, as skilful in the art of hoarding as Leo in that of lavishing, advised him to have recourse to indulgences. Accordingly, the pope published a bull, announcing a general indulgence, the proceeds of which were, he said, to be employed in the erection of the church of St. Peter, that monument of sacerdotal magnificence. In a letter, dated at Rome, under the seal of the Fisherman, in November, 1517, Leo applies to his commissary of indulgences for one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> gold ducats, to pay a manuscript of the thirty-third book of Livy. Of all the uses to which he put the money of the Germans, this was, doubtless, the best. Still it was strange to deliver souls from purgatory in order to purchase a manuscript history of the wars of the Roman people. There was at this time in Germany a young prince who might be regarded as in many respects a living image of Leo X. This was Albert, a younger brother of the elector, Joachim of Brandenburg....", "...the point of a sharp knife. It is quick and effective.

Thanks to his strenuous efforts, supplies were massed at Salamanca, good food and careful nursing emptied the hospitals and filled the ranks, and the cavalry was supplied with remounts by dismounting the \"field officers\" of the infantry. The month of July saw an interesting duel round Salamanca between Marmont and Wellington. The two armies were very nearly equal in numbers, the French having <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> thousand men and the English forty-four thousand. The French had the advantage of a broad base with lines of retreat either on Burgos or Madrid. The English had to cover their single line of communication, which ran through Ciudad Rodrigo. The French had the further advantage that their infantry marched better than the English. Owing to these causes their commander was so far able to outgeneral his adversary that by July 22nd he was actually threatening the English line of...", "...person, whose labours surpass any of the boasted pedestrian achievements, is William Brackbank.

The extent of this bombardment will be understood from the statement that one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pieces of artillery were employed, which fired seven thousand three hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, in one instance piercing a single small house with fifty round-shot. An eye-witness of this scene says: \"The enemy had planted more than a hundred pieces of artillery on the hills to the northern and eastern sides of the town, and, from an early hour in the forenoon, swept the streets with round-shot, shell, and case-shot, firing frequently a hundred guns a minute....", "...in this case bore the name of the person to whom the letter was addressed, and occasionally also that of the sender, just as the envelopes of letters are sometimes initialled to-day.

In Smolensk, for example, it was only about thirty per cent., whilst in Samara it was 436, and in Viatka, where the peasant element predominates, no less than 1,262 per cent.! In order to meet this increase, the rates on land rose from under ten millions in 1868 to over <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> millions in 1900. No wonder that the landowners who find it difficult to work their estates at a profit should complain! Though this increase is disagreeable to the rate-payers, it does not follow that it is excessive. In all countries rates and local taxation are on the increase, and it is in the backward countries that they increase most rapidly.

As he shoved off, he desired Commander Roberts of the _Thracian_ to get as close as possible, so as to render all the assistance in his power.

In consequence of this extraordinary combat, Alva ordered seven thousand pairs of skates, and directed his soldiers to be instructed in their use.

Then, too, the Latin tongue was generally employed for purposes of instruction, though surgeons, for the most part, lectured in the vernacular; Cullen, in 1770, was the first in Great Britain to deliver purely medical...", "...miles south-west of Montreal. Here the Americans killed Lieutenant Rototte and a sergeant, and took the little post, which was held by a few voyageurs. Exactly a month later, on November 23, these Americans were themselves defeated and driven back again. Three days earlier than this a much stronger force of Americans had crossed the frontier at Odelltown, just north of which there was a British blockhouse beside the river La Colle, a muddy little western tributary of the Richelieu, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> miles due south of Montreal. The Americans fired into each other in the dark, and afterwards retired before the British reinforcements. Dearborn then put his army into winter quarters at Plattsburg, thus ending his much-heralded campaign against Montreal before it had well begun. The American government was much disappointed at the failure of its efforts to make war without armies. But it found a convenient scapegoat in Hull, who was far less to blame than his superiors...", "...at the very last, his physician had forbidden him to receive company, he was found by his brother giving a dinner to a party of poor boys. At twenty-three years of age he was ordained, and was known from that time as \"Father Mathew.\" After a short time in Kilkenny, he went to Cork, which was his home for the rest of his life. He was not thought much of as a scholar, nor at first as a preacher; but he had a warm heart and every one liked him. Thus he passed quietly along until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years old; and it did not seem as if the world would ever hear of \"Father Mathew.\" There was a little band of Quakers in Cork, who had started a total abstinence, or \"teetotal society.\" They interested Father Mathew in their work, and, in 1838, he signed the temperance pledge and enrolled himself as a member. Very soon every one in Cork had heard of what Father Mathew had done. He began at once to preach that men ought not to be drunkards, and that they ought not to...", "...of his age and the forty-seventh of his reign. 31. On the same day his body was prepared for burial and borne to the church of the Virgin Mary, which he had founded, in the midst of the lamentation of all his people, and there laid to rest.

He was impatient at the slow movement of the siege.\" The Siege of Louisbourg started by Warren's and Pepperrill's demand that the fortress surrender, and the historic answer of Duchambon, the French commander, that they should have their answer from the cannon's mouth. It is not my purpose to tell of it in detail, for it lasted <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> days and strained the nerves of everyone to the breaking point. But one or two things happened in the time which, to my mind, make our Captain seem a very human person. There was, for instance, his amazing kindness, as unfailing to his captives as to his own men. When the great French man-of-war _Vigilant_ came to the aid of the beleaguered fortress, Warren joyously captured the monster, in full sight of Louisbourg and under the big guns there. It was this incident, by the...", "...visited by Emerson, and there he remained for six years, before removing to London. Not only had Carlyle then translated \"Wilhelm Meister\" and written the \"Life of Schiller,\" but he had made numerous translations from Musaeus, Tieck, and Richter, and had published essays on these and other German authors. Jean Paul Richter had a peculiar attraction for him, and there can be no doubt that Carlyle owed his extraordinary style, in some degree, to his study of the German humorist. The <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years of Carlyle's London life (1834-1881) were years of incessant literary activity. The thirty volumes which came from his pen during that time not only secured for him a permanent place amongst the historians, biographers, and essayists of our literature, but they kindled for him a glow of intense personal enthusiasm amongst the best of his contemporaries, such as, perhaps, no other English author has enjoyed. At his death on the 5th of February, 1881, the world knew...", "...Of his one thousand Red Sticks eight hundred were dead. Five hundred and fifty-seven bodies were found upon the Horseshoe battle-field. One hundred and fifty more had perished in the river. Only one warrior was unwounded.

Of the Cherokee and Creek scouts, twenty-three had been killed, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> wounded. Chief William Macintosh also had fought bravely, but he had not been harmed. The Red Sticks now agreed to a treaty of peace with the United States; and Chief Menewa, scarred from head to foot, was the hero of his band. \"One of the bravest chiefs that ever lived,\" is written after his name, by white historians.

And it follows that though the offence was committed by one or two, the responsibility must be shared by all; and in return for kindness in the past, they are in danger at present of sacrificing their lives to the machinations of these very men, and others whom I could mention.

His confidence in the French was encouraged by the fact that several of the forts in the Illinois country were still occupied by French garrisons. Pontiac resolved to make another effort to rouse his people. He set his squaws to work on a wampum war belt, broad and long, containing symbols of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> tribes which belonged to his confederacy. When the belt was done he sent a delegation of chiefs to the south with it. These messengers were instructed to show the war belt and offer the hatchet to all the tribes along the Mississippi River as far south as New Orleans. They were then to visit the French Governor at New Orleans and invite him to assist them in war against their common enemy. Pontiac, in the meantime, went about among his old French friends asking for their...", "...duns.\" We also have the only full team that has gone through all the campaigns of the Army of the Potomac.

For <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> minutes by the clock that American crowd pours out its concerted enthusiasm, and makes a new \"record\" for the length of a political demonstration.

Their three bags, which weighed <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pounds on leaving Cape Evans, had increased their weight to one hundred and eighteen at the conclusion of the trip. Other weights increased in the same proportion, and the sledge had dragged very heavily in consequence.

Besides his geography, the standard work of ancient times on the subject, he wrote in <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> books a large historical work on the period between 150 (where Polybius ended) and 30 B.C.E. Nearly the whole of it has disappeared, but we can tell from Josephus' excerpts that he appreciated the Jews and their religion as did few other pagans of the time.

Josephus was a skilful commander and his men showed dauntless courage, but Rome on its side had all the experience of war together with overwhelming numbers. The first attack failed and a siege began. Josephus showed wonderful craft in obtaining food for his garrison and in breaking the force of the Roman battering rams. But these means could only delay the end; they could not change it. The besieged were worn out by sleeplessness and starvation after holding out for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> days. The wall was scaled when the exhausted watchmen were asleep. All were either slain or sold into slavery. The city and its fortifications were levelled to the ground. Josephus with forty companions escaped to a cave. Against his advice to surrender, they all decided that they would die by their own hands. Josephus by strategem alone managed to escape this fate.

In the navy, Maury, Semmes, Buchanan, and other men of ability resigned their commissions and devoted themselves to the (by no means easy) task of building up a navy for the South; but Farragut of Tennessee remained with the navy to carry the flag of his country to New Orleans and to Mobile. It was easy and natural during the heat of 1861 to characterise as traitors the men who went with their States to fight against the flag of their country. Looking at the matter now, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years later, we are better able to estimate the character and the integrity of the motives by which they were actuated. We do not need to-day to use the term traitors for men like Lee and Johnston.

The first specimen of copper plate engraving for books in England is a frontispiece to Galen's _De Temperamentis_, printed at Cambridge 1521, and the number of books containing copper plates engraved before 1600 is extremely limited, the most notable being portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Lord Leicester, and Lord Burleigh in Archbishop Parker's Bible of 1568; Saxton's Atlas, 1579, the first atlas in England; Harrington's translation of Ariosto, 1591, with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> engraved plates.

The picture is <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> feet high by forty-three wide, and it occupied the painter eight years. It was during its progress that Michael Angelo entered on his friendship with Vittoria Colonna.

The compact, it is true, was loose and indefinite, and contained within itself the germs of that misunderstanding which, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years later, was developed into a terrible war. Still, for the present, Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, was also in some undefined way legitimate representative of the Old Roman Empire within the borders of Italy.

And yet these anthems were most significant in the variety of the choruses and in the range of the accompaniments; and it was then, no doubt, that Handel was feeling his way toward the great and immortal sphere of his oratorio music. Indeed, his first oratorio, 'Esther,' was composed at Cannons, as...", "...any one else.

But the most interesting reaction upon it was that of the Abbe Richard who criticized it from point of view of the divine right of kings in his long and tiresome work entitled _La Defense de la religion, de la morale, de la vertu, de la politique et de la societe, dans la refutation des ouvrages qui ont pour titre, l'un Systeme Social etc. Vautre La Politique Naturelle par le R.

For a discussion of the variations this tale underwent when it passed over into other collections and spread through Europe, see Benfey, 1 : 421 ff. Apparently Benfey did not know of these two Buddhistic birth-stories; but he has shown very ingeniously that most of the fables in the \"Pancatantra\" go back to Buddhistic writings. Nor can there be any doubt in this case, either, though it is not to be supposed that the five hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> Jatakas were invented by the Buddhistic scribes who wrote them down. Many of them are far older than Buddhism. Our Zambal form of the story does not represent the purest version. A variant much closer to the Buddhistic and close to the Tagalog is a tale collected by Wenceslao Vitug of Lubao, Pampanga. He says that the story is very common throughout his province, and is well known in the Visayas. His version follows in abstract form:-- A crocodile goes out to look for...", "...further--I mean to the jail. Few men seem aware of the frightful extent of crime amongst us, and the extent of the remedy, more awful yet.

Of these 377 were women; 851 men. Five were sentenced for an indefinite period, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> for an additional period of solitary imprisonment. In what follows, I make no account of that. But the whole remaining period of their sentences amounts to more than 544 years, or 198,568 days. In addition to this, in the year ending with June 9, 1846, we sent from Boston to the State Prison, thirty-five more, and for a period of 18,595 days, of which 205 were solitary.

But the attempts were renewed with dogged persistence, and now the course of the Canal had been fully protected, and baffled Nature could rage...", "...pleased the majority of them a great deal. For three afternoons of the week a part of each company went out for target practice. The targets were set up in a field some distance from the lake, where it would be perfectly safe to shoot at them.

It may be remarked that these northern attributes of lofty vaulting and the high development of the _arc-boutant_ were not general throughout the south, or indeed in any other region than the north of France.

In 1790, less than six per cent of the total population lived west of the Alleghanies; in 1820, nearly thirty-two per cent were domiciled in this vast region. In the National Legislature the West had acquired notable weight. By the apportionment of 1822, it had <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> out of two hundred and thirteen members of the House; in the Senate, eighteen out of forty-eight. But these figures do not tell the whole tale. As Professor Turner has well said, rightly to estimate the weight of Western population we must add the people of western New York and of the interior counties of Pennsylvania, and of the trans-Alleghany counties of Virginia, as well as the people of the back-country of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, North Carolina, and Georgia....", "...his serious attention to the tilling of the land for the next harvest.

I, for one, can hardly imagine it without him. Though technically \"in residence,\" he had not rooms of his own in College during his first term. The \"House\" was very full; and had it not been for one of the tutors, the Rev. J. Lew, kindly lending him one of his own rooms, he would have had to take lodgings in the town.

Brongniart enumerates <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> liassic acrogens, most of them ferns; and fifty gymnosperms, of which thirty-nine are cycads, and eleven conifers. Among the cycads the predominance of Zamites, and among the ferns the numerous genera with leaves having reticulated veins (as in Figure 349), are mentioned as botanical characteristics of this era.

Though short in stature, his physical development left little to be desired: he was active, agile, and enjoyed excellent health at all times. For a man of <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> he had aged remarkably in appearance. That is probably to be accounted for by mental worry. With two murders on his conscience we know from Sue Thompson that all she learnt of his secrets was what escaped from him in his troubled dreams--Peace may well have shown traces of mental anxiety.

On the following day, however, he received word that 2000 men were approaching from Caracas, and as the enemy were also rallying in force in the vicinity of the town he was compelled to retire to the ships. This movement was executed with difficulty, and for two hours de Grammont with a handful of his bravest companions covered the embarkation from the assaults...", "...took the opposite side.

Accounts differ, and it is not easy to ascertain with what intention he went to Aspendus, and did not bring the fleet after all. That one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> Phoenician ships came as far as Aspendus is certain; but why they did not come on has been variously accounted for. Some think that he went away in pursuance of his plan of wasting the Peloponnesian resources, since at any rate Tamos, his lieutenant, far from being any better, proved a worse paymaster than himself: others that he brought the Phoenicians to Aspendus to exact money from them for their discharge, having never intended to employ them: others again that it was...", "...as possible. Whoever the creditor may be, the State or a private individual, a leg or a wing may be saved by dint of procrastination. The maxim is true, and, on this occasion, success once more demonstrates its soundness. During the year 1792, the peasant begins to discharge a portion of his arrears, but it is with assignats. In January, February, and March, 1792, the assignats diminish thirty-four, forty-four, and forty-five per cent. in value; in January, February, and March, 1793, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> and fifty percent.; in May, June, and July, 1793, fifty-four, sixty, and sixty-seven per cent. Thus has the old credit of the State melted away in its hands; those who have held on to their crowns gain fifty per cent. and more. Again, the greater their delay the more their debts diminish, and already, on the strength of this, the way to release themselves at half-price is found.

From Noah to Jacob, by the same chronology, it had dwindled to one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years. In the ninetieth psalm we read, \"The days of our years are threescore years and ten.\" From actual statistics it is shown to average now less than one fourth of threescore and ten years.

In 1796, now <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years ago, it arose out of the French revolutionary war--so disastrous for Holland--that the Dutch surrendered it per force to the British, who are not very likely to surrender it in _their_ turn on any terms, or at any gentleman's request.

He imprisoned them in the castle tower, had them tried and condemned, obtained the approval of Ferdinand, and then, while some were pardoned, informed the remaining twenty-seven that they had two days in which to prepare for death.

The effect of the plague prophylactic was first tested at the Byculla Jail, in Bombay, when the epidemic reached that establishment. From the first day after the inoculation till the end of the outbreak there were in the jail twelve cases and six deaths among one hundred and seventy-two uninoculated inmates, and two cases, with no deaths, among one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> inoculated. A year later, almost exactly a similar result was observed when the plague attacked the so-called Umarkhadi Common Jail, in Bombay. In this case after the inoculation there were ten cases and six deaths among one hundred and twenty-seven uninoculated inmates, and three cases, with no deaths, among one hundred and forty-seven inoculated. These and other observations show that the vaccine for the plague begins to exercise its effect within some twenty-four hours...", "...nearly as good.

They study it by day and by night, from youth to old age; but how are the great mass of clergymen even, amidst their parish cares and homiletical labors, and with their limited means and restricted libraries, to obtain much of this knowledge? Some of it they may obtain, but much of it they will not, and cannot. The only way in which the vast stores of Biblical learning accumulated during the last two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years, by the labors of seven and a half generations toiling in succession, each generation beginning where that which preceded it left off, and each adding something to the stock which it received, can become available for the general benefit of the people, is by an improved text and translation of the Bible, into which, as far as possible, they shall all be brought, and to the perfection of which they shall contribute.

The growing plants should be cultivated two or three times with a good cultivator. Cowpeas were formerly gathered by hand, but such a method is of course slow and expensive. Pickers are now commonly used. Some farmers use the cowpea crop only as a soil-enricher. Hence they neither gather the seeds nor cut the hay, but plow the whole crop into the soil. There is an average of about <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> pounds of nitrogen in each ton of cowpea vines. Most of this valuable nitrogen is drawn by the plants from the air. This amount of nitrogen is equal to that contained in 9500 pounds of stable manure. In addition each ton of cowpea vines contains ten pounds of phosphoric acid and twenty-nine pounds of potash. There is danger in plowing into the soil at one time any bountiful green crop like cowpeas.

For instance, the height of the nave is thirty-four feet less than in the Cathedral of Amiens and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> less than that of Beauvais. Neither is it so long or wide as those of Rouen and Amiens. However, while it is not so vast, it is in its interior much more impressive than Amiens.

Of course all this was work in which no minister had the least right to share; but the whole crisis was one so completely without precedent that it is impossible to blame Morris for what he did.

On his way through Malwan, he sent seven of his regular battalions to protect his capital. One column, under Captain Mackintyre, was intercepted on the way, and all killed or made prisoners. Holkar then fell upon the other party, which he also overpowered and defeated. He next attacked Scindia's artillery on the march; but Major Brownrigg, an officer in the latter's service, with four battalions, repulsed his assailants.

It is incredible to me that Shakespeare should leave London at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> or forty-eight years of age, in good health, and retire to Stratford to live as a \"prosperous country gentleman\"!

Other steps of the same stern character were taken by this fierce soldier, whose power grew so great as to excite official dread. A general sent against him by Vouti, the emperor, who boasted of having gained <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> victories, was completely defeated, and all the results of his campaign were lost.

Another instance was that of a policy-holder who applied to the office for a loan, for which 1 per cent, more interest was demanded than his banker asked, and a rise of 1 per cent, in case of delay in paying the interest, and a charge was to be made for the office lawyer investigating the validity of their own policy, upon which the office had received premiums for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years.

Thereupon, <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> of his principal vassals pledged themselves to wreak vengeance, and, after nearly two years of planning and watching, they finally succeeded in achieving their purpose.

The American champion who stepped forward was Mr. John Wise, of Lancaster, Pa., whose career, commencing in the year 1835, we must now for a while follow. Few attempts at ballooning of any kind had up to that time been made in all America. There is a record that in December, 1783, Messrs. Rittenhouse and Hopkins, Members of the Philosophical Academy of Philadelphia, instituted experiments with an aerial machine consisting of a cage to which <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> small balloons were harnessed. In this strange craft a carpenter, by name Wilcox, was induced to ascend, which, it is said, he did successfully, remaining in the air for ten minutes, when, finding himself near a river, he sought to come to earth again by opening several of his balloons. This brought about an awkward descent, attended, however, by no more serious accident than a dislocated wrist. Mr. Wise, on the other hand, states that Blanchard had won the distinction of...", "...for, and they therefore looked with greater equanimity upon a bill which might retain in office the existing office-holders, most of whom belonged to their party.

A little study of the debate makes it clear that the passage of the act was due to conviction in favor of reform on the part of a few and to fear of public opinion on the part of many others. Undoubtedly many of the absentees were members who would not vote for the measure and were fearful of the results of voting against it. The President signed the bill January 16, 1883.

I do not suppose the mood lasted long; but the ill-health and persistent weakness explain to me as nothing else could his retirement to Stratford. It is incredible to me that Shakespeare should leave London at <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> or forty-eight years of age, in good health, and retire to Stratford to live as a \"prosperous country gentleman\"! What had Stratford to offer Shakespeare--village Stratford with a midden in the chief street and the charms of the village usurer's companionship tempered by the ministrations of a wandering tub-thumper? There is abundant evidence, even in \"The Winter's Tale\" and \"Cymbeline,\" to prove that the storm which wrecked Shakespeare's life had not blown itself out...", "...Street, in which he lived and worked for forty-five years, and in which he died. A far greater contemporary painter, who moved on the fringes of Sir Joshua's circle, was Gainsborough. That he did not come familiarly into the circle, and sometimes make one of the memorable company that gathered round Reynolds's dinner-table, was owing to some lack of geniality in himself, that kept him from responding to Sir Joshua's friendly advances. He came from Bath to London in 1774, when he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years of age, took a studio at Schonberg House, Pall Mall, and it was not long before celebrities and leaders of fashion were flocking to it to sit for their portraits, and he was recognised as a successful rival of Reynolds. Reynolds was so far from feeling jealousy or resentment that he promptly paid his popular rival a visit; but Gainsborough did not trouble himself to return the call. No doubt it was to some extent owing to Reynolds, too, that in the year of his...", "...Americans to regain control of Narragansett Bay, may be cited against the opinion expressed by Bancroft, that the seizure of this important naval centre by the British was a mistake. The tenure of the island, however, depended upon the control of the surrounding waters, and upon the active destruction of the American means of transport. Saumarez's galley was one of the force stationed in the eastern, or Seakonnet, passage; and in the five months thus employed it is recorded that he was <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> times under fire. Sullivan was at this time preparing for his attack upon the British lines, expecting co-operation by the French fleet. This arrived on the 29th of July, and six days later Seakonnet Channel was entered by a detachment superior in force to the British there. The latter burned their ships and retreated to Rhode Island, where the officers and seamen, Saumarez among them, continued actively engaged in the defence of the works.

Also we remark that the average of the lowest of Matiegka's groups, the shiftless and incompetent, is nearly 48.61 ounces, which is much above the average (46.96) yielded by Dr. Russell's 141 measurements of pure Blacks. Look at it another way. The defect of the day-labourer's brain, as compared with the scholar's, in Matiegka's groups, is precisely six per cent. Even if the average white brain weighed only fifty ounces, a defect of six per cent. would reduce it only to <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> ounces, which is still above the average of the Blacks. This latter, then, falls appreciably below the lowest white standard. Once more, we now come to see clearly the immense significance of the admittedly \"somewhat less developed Negroid brain.\" The famous lines of Browning seem to have been written especially for this occasion: _Oh, the little more, and how much it is! And the little less, and what worlds away!_ The difference between the averages of the...", "...completed his course in the full term of three years. If the number obtained exceeded the number expected, the student might be expected to finish his course in a proportionately shorter period. This was a genuine mathematician's device, and was very instructive.

Notions of discipline were severe, according to the spirit of the times. The Professor on one occasion, reporting the misconduct of some of the students, deplores the abolition of the rod; and mentions that, though a dark cabin is used for confinement, a \"black hole\" is much needed! There is no mention of such a place of confinement being instituted; but the Admiralty revokes the abolition of flogging.

Both he and Schwarzenberg desired to end the war on the frontier, if possible; Prussia's power and Alexander's ambitions for European preponderance were far more dangerous to Austria than a Napoleonic empire confined to France. Bluecher, leaving twenty-eight thousand men before Mainz, crossed the Saar on January ninth with <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> thousand; Schwarzenberg, with the main army arrayed in four columns, two hundred and nine thousand strong, crossed the Rhine at or near Basel and moved toward Langres. The thin, straggling French columns began to retreat concentrically toward Chalons on the Marne.

At the time, however, nothing was thought of it; but presently Burr brought to the house the serious and somewhat pedantic James Madison and introduced him to the hoyden.

Before very long he had proposed marriage to the young widow. She hesitated, and some one referred the matter to President Washington.

The plants grew to a good size and at one time I counted <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> good-sized trusses on it. The winter and everblooming quality, with the large and beautifully colored flowers, makes this Pelargonium a great acquisition to the amateur as well as the florist.

La Fontaine is well known in this country by the English translations of his work. A version containing some of his best fables was published anonymously in 1820, but is known to be from the pen of John Matthews of Herefordshire. In his preface, Matthews states that the fables are not altogether a translation or an imitation of La Fontaine, because in most of them are allusions to public characters and the events of the times, where they are suggested by the...", "...scout he had noticed that Tom carried more rations than a scout would be likely to take on a long hike, through a country where food could easily be bought in a hundred towns and villages, and also that one who limped as Tom did should choose to go on a hike of more than a hundred miles.

The early joint productions of Drake and Halleck were poems known as _The Croakers_, published in 1819, in the New York _Evening Post_.

He curses the dealer in...", "...then forgot each other's presence, and dropped their eyes, and you saw that they were away again and wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know nothing about. I had them taken out and sent to their friends. The queen did not like it much. Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter, but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pite. However, I assured her that if he found he couldn't stand it I would fix him so that he could. I set <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes, and left only one in captivity. He was a lord, and had killed another lord, a sort of kinsman of the queen. That other lord had ambushed him to assassinate him, but this fellow had got the best of him and cut his throat. However, it was not for that that I left him jailed, but for maliciously destroying the only public well in one of his wretched villages. The queen was bound to hang him for killing her kinsman, but I would...", "...of many donors, charity in the Feudal Age is allowed more than ordinarily to cover a multitude of sins--alike those of the givers and the receivers. Upon the St. Aliquis barony there is an astonishing number of unabashed drones and parasites. These miserable folk, however, have some excuse. Conditions of life in the Feudal Age, even for the cavaliers, are very severe. Men and women begin the duties of life young, mature young, grow old young. Henry II of Anjou and England was only <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> when they began to call him \"old.\" Philip Augustus was only fifteen when he was capable of assuming the actual duties of a responsible monarch. Many a baron is gray headed at forty. When he is fifty his sons may often be intriguing to supplant their superannuated father. If this is true of the nobility, what of the toiling peasantry? We have seen how Georges and Jeanne are aged before their time. Grinding toil by weakening the body, of course, leaves it exposed to many...", "...from Nantes to the West-Indies the Company Gautier is said to have given a tender; but it is doubtful if they can make up their capital.\" The _Messageries Imperiales_ is one of the largest and strongest companies in all Europe. They have the following different lines: the Italian, the Constantinople direct, the Levant, the Egyptian, the Syrian, that of the Archipelago, the Anatolia, the Thessalian, the Danubian, the Trebizond, the Algiers, the Oran, and the Tunis lines, and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> sea-steamers. They have already obtained the Brazilian service. Mr. Iselin and others have proposed for the United States line, and will doubtless get it. The Company Gautier may not get the West-India service, it is said. They had the line from Havre to New-York, with the steamers Alma, Cadis, Barcelona, Franc-Contois, Vigo, and the Lyonnaise, and without subvention. They found it impossible to run it without subsidy, and hence, sought a new home for their steamers....", "...mythological--the acts of the great spirit Day-Sin, the incarnation of Brahma, and similar themes--or historical, treating of the doings of the early dynasties. In these the names of the personages are changed. An example of the latter class is to be found in the _j[=o]ruri_, or musical romance, in which the universally popular tale of _Chiushingura_ (_The Loyal League_) has been amplified and adapted for theatrical representation. This famous narrative of the feudal fidelity of the <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> _ronins_, who about the year 1699 revenged their chief's judicial suicide upon the arrogant official to whom it was due, is stirring rather than touching in its incidents, and contains much bloodshed, together with a tea-house scene which suffices as a specimen of the Japanese comedy of manners. One of the books of this dramatic romance consists of a metrical description, mainly in dialogue, of a journey which (after the fashion of Indian plays) has to be carried out on the...", "...carrying half a loaf under his arm, for the car-conductor as he punched the tickets, and for the dealer in roast chestnuts, who was roasting his first panful. In short, the sun gave pleasure to everybody in the world. M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy, on the contrary, rose in quite a different frame of mind. On the previous evening he had dined with the Minister for Agriculture. The dinner, from the removal of the _potage_ to the salad, bristled with truffles, and the banker's stomach, aged <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years, experienced the burning and biting of pyrosis. So the manner in which M. Jean-Baptiste Godefroy rang for his valet-de-chambre was so expressive that, as he got some warm water for his master's shaving, Charles said to the kitchen-maid: \"There he goes! The monkey is barbarously ill-tempered again this morning. My poor Gertrude, we're going to have a miserable day.\" Whereupon, walking on tiptoe, with eyes modestly cast down, he entered the chamber of his master,...", "...forty-seven in English, from the time of Edward VI. (1549) to that of Queen Victoria, whilst thirty-five others are in foreign languages. There are nine Primers from the time of Henry VIII. to Elizabeth; and there are no fewer than thirty-one editions of the New Testament. Examples of some of the choicest known Books of Hours and Missals are also in this collection, whilst among the six editions of the 'Imitatio Christi' there is a sixteenth-century manuscript on two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> folios of paper, written by Francis Montpoudie de Weert, for the use of Bruynix, Priest, Dean of Christianity. Among the _incunabula_ there is a very large copy of the 'Chronicon Nurembergense,' 1495, and two Caxtons: first, the 'Polychronicon' of Ralph Higden, 1482; and, secondly, the 'Golden Legend,' 1483, which latter was successively in the Towneley and the Glendening collections. The other more notable articles include fine copies of the four Folio Shakespeares, first...", "...to pay a fine of 200_l._ The King _v._ Luke Lyons. The defendant is a brewer, and was brought up under an indictment charging him with having made use of various deleterious drugs in his brewery, among which were capsicum, copperas, &c. The defendant was ordered to pay the fines of 20_l._ upon the first count, 200_l._ upon the third, and 200_l._ upon the seventh count in the indictment. The King _v._ Thomas Evans. The charge against this defendant was, that he had in his possession <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> barrels of stale unpalatable beer. On, the 11th of March, John Wilson, an excise officer, went to the storehouse, and found forty-seven casks containing forty-three barrels and a half of sour unwholesome beer. Several samples of the beer were produced, all of them of a different colour, and filled with sediment. A fine of 30_l._ was ordered to be paid by the defendant. [2] Of this root, several varieties are imported. The white sort, which has no wrinkles, and no...", "...my mother's brother, was Prime Minister. My uncle, who had been born as far back as 1792, was a very tiny man, who always wore one of the old-fashioned, high black-satin stocks right up to his chin. I liked him, for he was always full of fun and small jokes, but in that rigorously Tory household he was looked on with scant favour. It was his second term of office as Prime Minister, for he had been First Lord of the Treasury from 1846 to 1852; he had also sat in the House of Commons for <span class=\"clocktext\">forty-seven</span> years. My father was rather inclined to ridicule his brother-in-law's small stature, and absolutely detested his political opinions, declaring that he united all the ineradicable faults of the Whigs in his diminutive person. Listening, as a child will do, to the conversation of his elders, I derived the most grotesquely false ideas as to the Whigs and their traditional policy. I gathered that, with their tongues in their cheeks, they advocated measures in which they did not..."]
