We dismissed Marin with a present of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> louis, and my brother-in-law besought of me to grant him four and twenty hours undisturbed reflection, whilst, on my side, I assured him I should not rest until we had completely discomfited our enemies. On the following day Comte Jean laid before me several projects, which were far from pleasing in my eyes; too much time was required in their execution. I knew the king too well to be blind to the danger of allowing this mere whim of the moment to take root in his mind.

Nevertheless, it was done neatly and expeditiously, leaving us all, Mr. Warren and Mary, my uncle and myself, with a cluster of some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> Injins around us, standing in the centre of the highway.

She made me promise, on my honour, never to tell a soul about this money-lending, or about her speaking to me, as if I did I should lose the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds, and it was very important that I should not do this, she said; no one would ever know about her coming to see me--for, of course, no one knew her in the village. When she came down to Barrowfield she would generally stop the night, sometimes two nights, at that little cottage opposite--so that she could watch me, and wait her opportunity to get money.

She came down again, looking <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> times prettier in her working clothes. Now he was in his element. He arranged Liza and Hans on the sledge of timber, which had then driven up, and made a picturesque group of them all: Hans and Liza sitting side by side on the timber, the horses standing there so patiently after their long journey through the forests, the driver leaning against his sledge smoking his long china pipe. \"That will be something like a picture,\" he said to Bernardine, when the performance was...", "...go with you,\" she said at once. \"What's in the wind?\" he asked himself. He saw in the suggestion a device for seeing Emanuel. \"The fact is,\" she added, \"I want to show you a house up at Hillport that might do for us.\" He winced. She had said nothing about a removal for quite some time. He hated the notion of removal. (\"Flitting,\" he called it.) It would mean extra expense, too. As for Hillport, he was sure that nothing, except cottages, could be got in Hillport for less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds a year.

Blackheath, indeed, has always played a considerable part in the history of southern England, partly because it was the last great open space on the southern confines of London, and partly because of the royal residence at Greenwich.

When the American immigrant writes home that he works only nine, ten, or twelve hours and earns from $1.50 to $2.00, the able-bodied wage earner in the fatherland who hears this will not be satisfied until he also stands where the shorter day and the higher wages govern.

The Hudson's Bay Company by the introduction, at a great expense, of rams and other stock, have improved the breed of domestic animals, which are now abundant. Wheat, barley, oats, maize, potatoes and hops thrive; flax and hemp are poor and stinted. The river banks are cultivated for half a mile inland, but the back...", "...preparing the tea, Bevis got the matchlock to practise again. They were always ready for tea, and it is a curious fact that those who live much out of doors and work hard, like gold-diggers abroad, and our own reapers at home labouring among the golden wheat, prefer it to anything while actually engaged and in the midst of their toil; but not afterwards. Bevis set up the rest in the gateway of the stockade, and took aim at the piece of paper pinned on the teak-tree, which was between <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> and sixty yards distant. Twice he fired and missed the teak: then he let Mark try, and Mark also missed; and a third time he fired himself. None of the four bullets struck either the tree or the branches; so, though they could hit it at thirty yards, they could not rely on their gun at sixty. Directly after tea they began to work again at the preparations for the raft, cutting some more poles and sawing up those they had already into the proper lengths. Sawing is very hard...", "...sail farther westward. The ships' boats were several times lowered, and the crews made to row close inshore in the bays and inlets, for the purpose of discovering an opening. On these occasions natives were sometimes seen upon the beach, or moving about in bark canoes, with whom the French contrived to establish a friendly intercourse and traffic, by means of signs and presents of hatchets, knives, small crucifixes, beads, and toys. On one occasion they had in sight from forty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> canoes full of savages, of which seven paddled close up to the French boats, so as to surround them, and were driven away only by demonstrations of force. Cartier learned afterward that it was customary for these savages to come down from parts more inland, in great numbers, to the coast, during the fishing season, and that this was the cause of his finding so many of them at that time. On the 7th day of the month a considerable body of the same savages came about the ships, and...", "...gulls and ducks of various kinds (one new and one dark brown large-winged), cormorants, avocats, white spoonbills, crows, kites, pigeons and magpies of various kinds, and plenty of fish.

I have always accorded to General Johnston due credit for boldness in his attack on our exposed flank at Bentonville, but I think he understates his strength, and doubt whether at the time he had accurate returns from his miscellaneous army, collected from Hoke, Bragg, Hardee, Lee, etc. After the first attack on Carlin's division, I doubt if the fighting was as desperate as described by him, p. 385, et seq.

The counterforts or spurs of hills are favorable for artillery, as they enable it to see, with an enfilading fire, the slopes of the principal range. Batteries should seldom be placed so as to fire over other troops, for they will not only be intimidated by this fire, but also exposed to the opposing fire of the enemy's artillery. A large number of pieces should never be crowded into the same place, but an interval should be left between the guns of forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet, according to the locality. The most favorable position for this arm in ordinary ground, is in the intervals between the regiments or brigades of the line, and far enough in advance of this line not to draw upon the other troops the fire of the enemy's artillery. The flanks of the line are also favorable for the action of this arm. Sometimes artillery has been employed to form a part of the line of battle; but such instances are exceptions, and can never be comprised in...", "...bitterness. But Mr. Gladstone has since had another sad experience of death entering the family circle. July 4, 1891, the eldest son, William Henry Gladstone, died.

He gave us for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years a most precious son. He has now only hidden him for a very brief space from the sight of our eyes.

Then, to give some activity to their courage, the whole body of the mutineers was led towards the harbor on pretense of capturing stores. The Adelantado went out to meet them with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> armed followers, the best he could collect from the wearied companions of the Admiral. Porras refused all offers of conference, and led his band to the attack. There was a plan laid among them that six of the stoutest should attack the Adelantado simultaneously, thinking that if their leader should be overpowered the rest would flee.

And here an appearance was observed which was new to most of us, and strikingly beautiful to all. Standing at the bow and looking forwards, at a distance of forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards from the ship, a number of luminous streamers were seen rushing towards us. On nearing the vessel they rapidly turned, like a comet round its perihelion, placed themselves side by side, and, in parallel trails of light, kept up with the ship.

Sandys was instructed to collect some L1,000 owed the company either as rent or as dues. When Virginia became a royal colony in 1624, the quitrents were then payable at the rate of one shilling for every <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> acres patented. For 1631 the estimate was made by the Assembly that the quitrents would bring in as much as 2,000 pounds sterling, if paid. But little effort was being made to collect the rent and it was not until 1636 that Jerome Hawley was appointed treasurer. His arrival in the colony the following year initiated plans for collection. Proceeds from this source of revenue were to be used for the treasurer's salary; any surplus amount was to be used at the discretion of the...", "...all the maritime strength of the enemy had been collected in two great masses, one in the Mediterranean and one in the Atlantic.

Of course, it is easy to except to such statistics--to say that the averages are untrustworthy; but it would be very strange if so many distinct and independent indications were all wrong.

The indication, then, is of a more tropical nature in the Black; he attains his maximum sooner, but he maintains it not so long nor so high; and this might certainly have been expected. Similar is the indication of the respiration.

It is said that if any painter who knew him, and even any who did not know him, asked him for some drawing that he needed, Raffaello would leave his own work in order to assist him.

Not until the following day did the Admiralty decide to pursue the vessel which had vanished so suddenly in full sail. It was then too late to overtake her. It was shortly afterwards that the sad news reached St. Petersburg that the fugitive vessel had run upon the rocks of Dago. Her mainmast and bowsprit were all that was ever picked up, so it was plain to all men that the _Gladova Strela_, with her <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men and seven guns, had gone to the bottom.

The building was quite unnoticed except by the inhabitants of the island. The ordinary track of vessels was then far distant from the...", "...positive answer can be returned. As a tree is judged by its fruits, so is literature judged not by theory but by the effect which it produces on human life; and the judgment is first personal, then general. If a book has power to awaken in you a lively sense of pleasure or a profound emotion of sympathy; if it quickens your love of beauty or truth or goodness; if it moves you to generous thought or noble action, then that book is, for you and for the time, a great book. If after ten or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years it still has power to quicken you, then for you at least it is a great book forever. And if it affects many other men and women as it affects you, and if it lives with power from one generation to another, gladdening the children as it gladdened the fathers, then surely it is great literature, without further qualification or need of definition. From this viewpoint the greatest poem in the world--greatest in that it abides in most human hearts as a loved and honored...", "...Early in the autumn of 1829, Mr. Young and his party of trappers set out on their return home. On their route they visited Los Angelos, formerly called Pueblo de los Angelos, \"the city of the angels,\" a name which it received on account of the exceedingly genial climate, and the beauty of the surrounding country. It is situated on a small river of the same name, 30 miles from its mouth, and on the road between the cities of San Jose and San Diego. It is about three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles east of San Francisco, and a hundred miles to the south. Although to very many thousands of readers, anything on the subject of the climate of California may seem superfluous, yet there are as many thousands who have no really distinct idea of the country or the climate, and we therefore quote from Rev. Dr. Bushnell, whose article on those topics in the \"New Englander,\" in 1858, attracted justly such universal attention: \"The first and most difficult thing to apprehend...", "...Otherwise, it would be too terrific a shock for you when you awakened.

Many who had been prominent in the cause, hastened to take advantage of this proclamation. Those who had most property to lose were the first to submit. The middle ranks remained generally steadfast in this time of trial. In this dark day of peril to the cause, and to himself, Washington remained firm and undaunted.

The invaders had seven guns, but the people of Banawi had more than sixty -- a fact the invaders did not know until too late. However, they did not retire until they had lost a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> heads. They annihilated one of the groups of the enemy, getting about fifty heads, and burned down the dwellings.

He brings the head to his ato and it is put in a small funnel-shaped receptacle, called \"sak-o'-long,\" which is tied on a...", "...the unfortunate counter-slave will break any of the code of rules, so that the instant the customer has gone she may be fined, with an added warning that if a similar thing again occurs she will be dismissed.\" \"In no other trade would men and women conform to such rules,\" I exclaimed, for she had often told me of these things before. \"Who takes the fines?\" \"The firm, of course,\" she answered. \"They're supposed to go towards the library; but the latter consists of only about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> worn-out, tattered books which haven't been added to for the past three years.\" \"I don't wonder that such an existence should crush all life from you.

When Judith returned with Maud Day there were thirty or forty people and almost as many dogs milling about the yard. The log school had weathered against the red wall of the mesa for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years. There probably was not a person in the crowd who had not gone to school there, who did not, like Judith, love every log in its ugly sides. Judith caught Douglas' sardonic gaze, tossed her curly head and urged Swift up the steps, where she looked toward the road to the Pass, shading her fine eyes with a mittened hand. Finally she cried, \"I see the preacher coming!\" \"Somebody ought to go in and build the fire if we ain't going to freeze to death!\" exclaimed Grandma...", "...Joe Heizler and \"Red Jacket.\" Probably the owner of this latter distinctive appellation had been christened by some other name, but he was known always and only as Red Jacket.

Accordingly they got together their limited capital, and without troubling themselves to check their trunks, started for Oswego. They reached that flour-y and flourishing town with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents in their pockets, failed to get a very cordial reception from Landlord Hartmann, and proceeded to look about for work. Ben was the only one of the trio who had pluck and energy enough to succeed. He found employment on board of a schooner lying in port, and by working like a beaver, earned enough to support his companions. Finding that board bills would be inconvenient to settle, it occurred to Ben that housekeeping would be more economical.

By the time that he reached the first ranks, which were some way off, the worst of the attack was over. It had been short and sharp, for the Asiki had hoped to find the Ogula unprepared and to take their camp with a rush. But the Ogula, who knew their habits, were waiting for them, so that presently they withdrew, carrying off their wounded and leaving about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dead upon the ground. As soon as he was quite sure that the enemy were all gone, Jeekie, armed with a large battle-axe, went off to inspect these fallen soldiers. Alan, who was helping the Ogula wounded, wondered why he took so much interest in them. Half an hour later his curiosity was satisfied, for Jeekie returned with over twenty heavy gold rings, torques, and bracelets slung over his shoulder. \"Where did you get those, Jeekie?\" he asked. \"Off poor chaps that peg out just...", "...at their back, leaving nothing but the child's head out, as appears by the figure.

The method of the Indian settlements is altogether by cohabitation, in townships, from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> to five hundred families in a town, and each of these towns is commonly a kingdom. Sometimes one king has the command of several of these towns, when they happen to be united in his hands by descent or conquest; but in such cases there is always a vicegerent appointed in the dependent town, who is at once governor, judge, chancellor, and has the same power and authority which the king himself has in the town where he resides. This viceroy is obliged to pay his principal some...", "...and for enabling the population to support themselves during this period of suffering. It was calculated that seven millions sterling could scarcely repair the damage of the city; and that not less than eighty thousand lives had been lost, either crushed by the earth or swallowed up by the waters. Some conception of the native mortality may be formed from that of the English: of the comparatively small number of whom, resident at that time in Lisbon, no less than twenty-eight men and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> women were among the sufferers. The royal family were at the palace of Belem when this tremendous calamity occurred. Pombal instantly hastened there. He found every one in consternation. \"What is to be done,\" exclaimed the king, as he entered \"to meet this infliction of divine justice?\" The calm and resolute answer of Pombal was--\"Bury the dead, and feed the living.\" This sentence is still recorded, with honour, in the memory of Portugal. The minister then threw himself...", "...on the shores of Hudson Bay is as unchangeable as the shores and scenery of the coast are monotonous. The swampy, treeless flats that surround the Bay simply change from the frozen, snow-clad expanse which stretches as far as the eye can see in winter, to the summer green of the unending grey willows and stunted shrubs that cover the swampy shores. For a few open months the green prevails, and then nature for eight months assumes her winding sheet of icy snow. For two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years life has been as unvarying on these wastes as travellers tell us are the manners and customs of living of the Bedouins on their rocky Araby.

An investment that had turned out fortunately gave me about forty pounds a year. I had done from time to time a little work for the press, which had been worth to me about thirty pounds a year more.

If I migrated to a cottage, how would matters stand with me? I should lose my two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds per annum of course, and this was an alarming prospect. But, on the other hand, I reminded myself that I had never really possessed it. I prepared various tables in which I arranged the items of my expenditure under two heads, viz. the expenditure that was inevitable, and the expenditure that was evitable, because it was the result of town life. I shall best explain by giving a sample of these tables:-- TABLE I. INEVITABLE EXPENDITURE.

The solution is, however, on consideration, not quite so simple. We have to ask not only when did Spring begin, but on what day did Boccaccio think it began; when did he think the sun entered Aries? As we know, Chaucer, Boccaccio's contemporary, thought Spring began on 12th March,[707] but Chaucer's \"Treatise on the Astrolabe\" was written in 1391, more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years after the _Filocolo_. All sorts of opinions have been expressed by scholars as to the date that was in Boccaccio's mind as that which marked the entry of the sun into Aries.

The vast scope of these plans bears witness to his amazing ability. Three strong armies, comprising a force of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand men, appeared in the field in the spring of 1644, ready to co-operate with the Scots in the coming campaign. The presence of the Scottish army indeed changed the whole face of the war.

'T was written by a man named Catlin, who came up the river, painting pictures of Indians, a long time ago; maybe <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years. He said he thought the Mandans were Welshmen, and told some story about some foreign prince that brought a colony of Welshmen over here, and Catlin thought that maybe the Mandans were descended from that colony.

The clever detective would probably have picked them out for what they were, \"hobo guns,\"--tramp thieves and \"hold-up\" men,--but the ordinary citizen would have classified them merely as \"dirty tramps,\" which would also have been the truth, but not the whole truth.

Judging by the rate at which Isabel was proceeding, it was clear that she must reach Lyons before that day closed; for, though she might not accomplish her purpose of arriving at Vienne on the day before, yet the distance to Lyons itself was but two easy days' journey.

Thus was the minstrel revenged on this grudging heart. If, however, any reader would like to see closer the actual life of a minstrel of the thirteenth century, I would suggest that he obtain the excellent little book on Rutebeuf, one of the most famous of them all, published in the Grands Ecrivains Francais series.

He coughs with cold and gapes with hunger. He has no mattress, but only straw, and a bed of straw is not a bed. He fears to face his wife without money for food and rent. If he cannot dig, emphatically, to beg he is not ashamed. All his goods are in pawn, and his time is wasted in the tavern, playing dice, which are his curse and his downfall.

In a short time, he mustered three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> Spaniards, and four thousand Indians. One hundred and fifty of his company were mounted, and all were equipped in the most thorough manner for the undertaking. He provided, moreover, against famine by a large stock of provisions, and an immense drove of swine which followed in the rear.1 It was the beginning of 1540, when he set out on this celebrated expedition.

Alas! it must be admitted that it is not exclusive. By an astonishing concession in the organization any person can gain admittance by paying the sum of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents. This tax is sufficient to exclude the deserving poor, but it is only an inducement to the vulgar rich, and it is even broken down by the prodigal excursionist, who commonly sets out from home with the intention of being reckless for one day.

Well, the Navy Department officials rebuked them, and made them take the walk over again in three days, on the ground that taking it in one day did not comply with the regulations!

The preliminaries of peace in September, 1762, terminated the Chevalier's military career, and he returned to the political world, where he had already made...", "...'this hymn of Cowper's has been translated by Mr. Gladstone into Italian.'

Later on a kind of parenthetic observation runs, that 'Oxford is an ancient seat of learning, and may be the fountain of intellectual light; but it has ever been the home of political darkness and the defender of exclusive privilege.' As Mr. Gladstone's earlier political career is very sweepingly condemned, and the evil influences of the University deplored, it is to be presumed that the half-century of harvest is a small stretch of the exuberant poetic licence that...", "...As ground for his belief in a better day, Bright speaks--and his language is prophetic--of the people \"sublime in their resolution.\" It is that resolution which, in spite of our unprepared condition and of all the mistakes that have been made, as well as of disasters that could not have been foreseen, and of a power in the enemy far greater and a wickedness more diabolical than anyone dreamed of, will \"bring victory home.\" To have watched the action of the electorate during the last <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years leads to the conclusion that in spite of apparent vacillations it has been characterised by good sense and good feeling, and that its judgment, so far as conditions from time to time permitted of its true expression, has been sound.

In one regard the Troopers were fortunate, an artesian well being within <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet of their camp. This, however, supplied the wants of the men only, the horses, at first, having to be led more than a mile for water.

The cry was followed by a splash, and turning, Sam saw that Ulna had fallen from the rock into the fierce current that roared and foamed above its base. Sam threw aside his rifle and sprang back to the rescue of the young Indian, but before he had gone ten feet Ulna was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards away, bravely battling with the maddened waters, above whose roar came the words: \"God bless you! Farewell!\" Sam stood petrified with horror. To plunge into the water and attempt to help Ulna in that way would be madness.

Let those who knew me at that time, let the blacks themselves be asked. They will all reply that not a single negro upon that plantation, consisting of more than four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> laborers, refused to work; and yet this plantation was thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves the most idle of any in the plain. I inspired the same activity into three other plantations of which I had the management.

There was therefore no lagoon between, and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the rocks. But this white column appeared about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards inland. The rocks at the place were rugged, and they stretched across the sandy beach into the sea. Scarce had we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight, when another column flew upwards for a few seconds, not far from the spot where the first had been seen, and disappeared; and so, at long, irregular intervals, these strange sights recurred.

A llanero, or native of the elevated plains of Venezuela, he rose naturally to great influence among his fellow-herdsmen, and when the revolution began, in 1810, and he declared in favor of the cause of freedom, his reputation for courage was so great that they were very ready to enlist under him. He chose from among them one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> picked horsemen, and this band, under the title of \"Guides of the Apure,\" soon made itself the terror of the Spaniards.

The sheep would, it is true, be an encumbrance; the cattle could scarcely be termed so; and it was probable that the first day they would make a journey of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty miles, traveling at a moderate pace only, as they would know that no instant pursuit could take place. Indeed their strength, which the peon had estimated at five hundred men, would render them to a certain extent careless, as upon an open plain the charge of this number of men would sweep away any force which could be collected short of obtaining a strong body of troops from Rosario.

A freight was derailed just south of Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right of way with wreckage of every description. Macloud's train was twelve hours late leaving Hampton. Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran into a wash out some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles further on; with the result that they did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks had closed for the day. He wired the facts to Croyden. The following day, he sold the stocks, the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving there at nine o'clock in the evening. Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall. \"I'm sorry, for the girls' sake,\" said he, \"but it's...", "...and I went with her one morning to pay my respects to that great and good lady, and was to have done so a second time, but was prevented by our departure from town.

After a few moments a lady entered, to whom Mademoiselle d'Este presented me. The Queen Dowager was then apparently between <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> and sixty years old; a thin, middle-sized woman, with gray hair and a long face, discolored by the traces of some eruption. She looked in ill health, and was certainly very plain, but her manner and the expression of her face were very gentle and gracious, and her voice, with its German accent, sweet and agreeable. She asked Mademoiselle d'Este if she was going to the Duchess of Sutherland's ball, and on her replying that she was not going, and giving...", "...for no more than fifty dollars as his cash reserve. While under ordinary circumstances this is his maximum demand, various circumstances may diminish it.

If most of his purchasing is done at the beginning of the month, his average money demand may be perhaps ten dollars. Many a workman purchases on credit, spends his <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars within an hour after he receives it, and goes without money for the rest of the month. The average demand of a community for money required as a reserve is affected by the methods of doing business. With a given method of use a reduction in the supply of money results in loss of time and waste of effort; an increase in the supply results in a lowering of its value relative to other things. In either case the equilibrium of the marginal utilities of income must be...", "...in which countries it produces the gum-sandarach, which exudes like tears from every part of the plant.

The evergreen cypress (_Cupressus sempervirens_) is a cone-like, tapering tree, with its branches growing close to its trunk, and rarely attaining the height of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet even in its native country. The male catkins are longer than those of the arbor vitae, and the female ones contain more ovules. The cone is buckler-shaped, and it divides, when ripe, into eight or ten corky scales, each of which has four nuts attached; the cone being partially divided into cells, which may be seen, when the scales have been removed to show the interior. The pollen of each male flower is contained in four cells, attached to the lower part of the inside of the...", "...a fresh spirit, with only the character of the people and his own ideals to work from. _Siberia_, produced in 1892, was a success with the critics and actors, and may fairly be called the first original Yiddish play of the better type. The play struck a new note. It fell into line with the Russian spirit of realism now so marked in intellectual circles in the Ghetto. Life and types are what Gordin tried for, and Jacob Adler had found his playwright. Since then Gordin has written about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> plays, some of which have been successful, and many have been marked by literary and dramatic power. Some of the better ones are _Siberia_, the _Jewish King Lear_, _The Wild Man_, _The Jewish Priest_, _Solomon Kaus_, _The Slaughter_, and the _Jewish Queen Lear_.

Meanwhile the British Navy had achieved its first success and suffered its first disaster. On August 5 the third Destroyer Flotilla, shepherded by H.M.S. _Amphion_, and patrolling the approaches to the Channel, found the small Hamburg-American converted liner _Koenigin Luise_ laying mines off the estuary of the Thames. She was chased by a destroyer and sunk by a torpedo, some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> being saved out of a crew of 130. Early next morning, however, the _Amphion_ herself struck a mine and was sunk, and about 130 of the crew and one officer--a paymaster--were lost, besides twenty German prisoners. In officially announcing the disaster to the House of Commons (Aug. 7) the First Lord of the Admiralty said that this indiscriminate scattering of mines, imperilling even neutral merchantmen, was a new fact calling for the attention of the nations. He added, however,...", "...he had shot himself; he said it sickened him.

No girl can well keep body and soul together on four dollars a week and some business managers have been known to inform their women employees with frankness that a \"gentleman friend\" is a necessary adjunct to a limited income. The women who suffer most from low wages are probably the teachers in our primary schools. They start usually on a salary of about three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars a year. For this each teacher performs all the minute labour and bears all the nervous strain of instructing sixty pupils six and a half hours a day and of correcting dozens of papers far into the night. And when crime increases or the pupils are not universally successful in business, the school teacher has the added pleasure of getting blamed for it, being told that she ought to have trained them better. These facts lend some colour to Mark Twain's sage reflection that...", "...fled along the streets was no easy task, but it was accomplished and for nearly a week these committees arranged and cared for the homeless multitude.

Those well-fed trees with plenty of sun, air and plant food are distinctly superior to the other trees. A good walnut tree rents for as much as an acre of ground. It is the product that is received without labor that appeals to me, and as the trees produce well, there is sometimes seven or eight dollars worth of profit to each tree, and the landlord is in the position to command most of the seven or eight dollars because he furnishes the trees.

A good tree will occasionally produce three or four hundred pounds of nuts, especially a fine tree out by itself.

They are subjected to a regie like cigars, and to the octroi, and these imposts, M. Fournier tells me, now amount to about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> per cent, of their value. A knowledge of this circumstance may, perhaps, divert the wrath of travellers in France from the hotel-keeper, who claps a couple of francs for bougies into your bill if you pass half a summer's day in his house, to the Government which concerns itself much more actively with squeezing percentages out of the industries than with balancing the national budgets of France.

Internal condition 1392. Intestine troubles. The main result of the threefold division of 1392 was a succession of civil wars which led to the temporary eclipse of Bavaria as a force in German politics. Neighbouring states encroached upon its borders, and the nobles ignored the authority of the dukes, who, deprived of the electoral vote, were mainly occupied for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years with intestine strife. This condition of affairs, however, was not wholly harmful. The government of the country and the control of the finances passed mainly into the hands of an assembly called the _Landtag_ or _Landschaft_, which had been organized in 1392. The towns, assuming a certain independence, became strong and wealthy as trade increased, and the citizens of Munich and Regensburg were often formidable antagonists to the dukes. Thus a period of disorder saw the...", "...him. \"The forest rangers have been making a fire trail of this old path. We can make great time here.\" He pushed on at top speed.

Fifty steps he went at that gait, then walked fifty. Then he ran <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> more. So they went down the mountain in a mere fraction of the time it had taken them to ascend. But long before they reached the bottom, Lew dropped back to a steady walk. \"We've got to save our wind for the climb up Old Ironsides,\" he said over his shoulder. It was well he did so.

Early in 1735 the settlement of Newbury (then spelled Newberry) was begun. In a little over three years a colony was sent out across the Merrimac. The plantation was at first called merely from the name of the river. In 1639 it was named Colchester by the General Court; but October 7, 1640, this name was changed to Salisbury, so that in 1638, almost two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago, Salisbury began to be settled. It seemed as if there was need of new settlements at that time to counteract the depletions in the Old World, for the Thirty Years' War was still impoverishing Germany; Richelieu was living to rule France in the name of his royal master, Louis XIII; England was gathering up those forces of good and evil which from resisting tyranny at last grew intoxicated with power, and so came to play the tyrant and regicide.

And so on the 23rd of December 1853 Borrow made his way from Yarmouth to Plymouth by rail, and thence walked twenty miles to Liskeard, where quite a little party of Borrow's cousins were present to greet him.

He journeyed on and on, his bright eyes watching for signs of seals beneath the snow-covered ice. He did not realise how far he was from home.

We can estimate his value to us as an historian from our ignorance of what was happening in Judea during the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years after his account comes to an end. It is true that he brings before us, for the most part, but the external facts and the court scandals in place of the vital movements and the underlying principles; and in dealing with contemporary events he has a perverted view, borrowed largely from Roman foes and feebly corrected.

They were only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty yards from him, and although they were motionless for some time, their eager faces showed that they were waiting for some movement. It was pure chance, but John happened to be looking at a rather large man who sat his horse easily, his gloved hand resting on his thigh.

My father could manage to provide us with one, but the expense of two was more than he could assume. I was then within a few weeks of being eighteen; and it was arranged that I should devote the intervening time to learning how to operate a machine, by attending one of the schools for beginners then opened by lady teachers, and that the new purchase should be my birthday present. So, paying ten dollars for instruction, and agreeing to work eight weeks without wages, I...", "...it was that, an hour later, the new colored butler was carrying the papers back to Bartlett & Bangs's, and Mr. Randolph's new secretary was sawing wood in Madam Bartlett's cellar. It was a humble beginning, but he whistled jubilantly as he worked. Already he saw himself climbing, by brilliant and spectacular deeds, to a dazzling pinnacle of security in the family's esteem. CHAPTER 11 Madam Bartlett's accident had far-reaching results. For <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years her firm hand had brooked no slightest interference with the family steering-wheel, and now that it was removed the household machinery came to a standstill. She who had \"ridden the whirlwind and directed the storm\" now found herself ignominiously laid low. Instead of rising with the dawn, primed for battle in club committee, business conclave, or family council, she lay on her back in a darkened room, a prisoner to pain. The only vent she had for her pent-up energy was in...", "...and remembered who I was, you took a turn up round the postoffice to make sure of it, and while you were in there you saw the notice of the reward for the stolen bond plates. That gave you the notion with which you pieced out your fairy story about how you got the dollar tip. Having discovered my identity through a piece of damned carelessness on my part and having seen the postal notice of the reward, you undertook to enlarge your little game. That's the reason you wouldn't take <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents. It was your notion in the beginning to make a touch for a tip. And it would have worked. But now you can't get a damned cent out of me.' Then I threw a little brush into him: 'I'd have stood a touch for your finding the fake tanner, because there isn't any such person.' \"I intended to put the hobo out of business,\" Walker went on, \"but the effect of my words on him were even more startling than I anticipated. His jaw dropped and he looked at me in astonishment. \"'No...", "...every pound tells. We have brought plenty of tobacco with us to last some time. Have you got a gun?\" he asked the man suddenly. \"Yes,\" he said, \"we have got two. The wolves are troublesome sometimes in winter. Fetch the guns, Elizabeth.\" The guns were brought down. One was a double-barrel of German make, the other a long single-barrel. \"How much do you want for this?\" he asked, taking up the former. \"I don't use it much,\" the man said, \"one will be enough for me, I will take <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> roubles.\" \"No, no,\" Godfrey said. \"You value your goods too high; money is not as plentiful with me as all that. I can't go higher than twenty roubles,\" and he laid the gun down again. \"I will take thirty,\" the man said. After a good deal of bargaining Godfrey obtained the gun, a flask of powder, and a bag of bullets and shot for twenty-five roubles. Then he paid for the other goods he had purchased. Luka made them into a bundle and lifted them all on to his shoulder. Then...", "...is up against, as we had to outfit ourselves about the same as an exploring party would. \"We must get lead guns, beads, mirrors and other trinkets,\" said Lewis. \"What's the big idea?\" I asked. \"Are we to open a five and ten cent store for the native Indians up there?\" \"Not exactly,\" laughed Lewis, \"but we must have something to trade with. What use is a silver or gold coin to a native back hundreds of miles in the jungle? He'd rather have a twenty-five cent kitchen knife than a <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollar gold piece.\" The \"lead guns\" are not lead, as I learned, but the very cheapest sort of cheap guns, manufactured in England solely for trading with semi-civilized and uncivilized people. No live American boy would take one as a gift, but I found that the natives treasured them above everything else they possessed. We were fortunate in finding a Dutch captain, a man who has navigated the turbulent waters of the Mazaruni for twenty years.

The immortal Shakespeare, like yourself and others, sometimes got his dates confused; for instance, in his \"Coriolanus,\" he says of C. Marcius, \"Thou wast a soldier even to Cato's will,\" when in fact Marcius Coriolanus was banished from Rome and died over two hundred years before Cato was born. Again, his reference in the same play, of Marcius sitting in state like Alexander: the latter was not born for a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years after Coriolanus's death. He also says in \"Julius Caesar,\" \"The clock strikes three,\" when in truth and in fact there were no striking clocks until more than eight hundred years after the death of Caesar. Another inaccuracy is to be found in \"King Lear\" in regard to spectacles. Spectacles were not worn until the thirteenth century. And still another in this immortal writer's statements in his play of \"Macbeth,\" where he speaks of cannon:...", "...Beginning at the bottom of a rough-barked tree (for a smooth bark conceals no larvA|), the creeper silently climbs upward in a sort of spiral, now lost to sight on the opposite side of the tree, then reappearing just where he is expected to, flitting back a foot or two, perhaps, lest he overlooked a single spider egg, but never by any chance leaving a tree until conscience approves of his thoroughness. And yet with all this painstaking workman's care, it takes him just about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> seconds to finish a tree. Then off he flits to the base of another, to repeat the spiral process. Only rarely does he adopt the woodpecker process of partly flitting, partly rocking his way with the help of his tail straight up one side of the tree. Yet this little bird is not altogether the soulless drudge he appears. In the midst of his work, uncheered by summer sunshine, and clinging with numb toes to the tree-trunk some bitter cold day, he still finds some tender emotion...", "...clear blue sky.

Chupin had been greatly edified. \"Now I know you as well as if I were your concierge,\" he muttered, addressing the unconscious Wilkie; \"and when I've followed you home, and learned your number, I shall have richly earned the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> francs M.

Wilkie was eating his dinner with an excellent appetite. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed, not without envy, \"these fighting-cocks take good care of their stomachs.

As a means of reproducing effects which an artist would otherwise get by pencil or crayon, it remains entirely unequalled, and it is of obvious advantage to art that twenty-five or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> copies of an original work should exist, which, without the aid of lithography, might have only been represented by a single sketch, perhaps stowed away among the possessions of one private collector.

We can see the smoke boil up, and hear the discharge of musketry from the Yankee lines. One man's horse is seen to blunder and fall, one man reels in his saddle, and falls a corpse, and the other is seen to surrender. But, look yonder! the man's horse that blundered and fell is up again; he mounts his horse in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards of the whole Yankee line, is seen to lie down on his neck, and is spurring him right on toward the solid line of blue coats. Look how he rides, and the ranks of the blue coats open. Hurrah for the brave rebel boy! He has passed and is seen to regain his regiment. I afterwards learned that that brave Rebel boy was my own brother, Dave, who at that time was not more than sixteen years old.

Then he needed a knapsack for his provisions, a telescope so as to recognize villages perched on the slope of distant hills, and finally, a government survey map to enable him to find his way about without asking the peasants toiling in the fields.

Rendered confident by these supplies, the Carthaginians crossed over to the Balearian islands, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles distant. The Balearian islands are two in number; one larger than the other, and more powerful in men and arms; having also a harbour in which, as it was now the latter end of autumn, he believed he might winter conveniently.

At that time he had received a gift from each one of the angels, and that of the Angel of Death had been the revelation of the secret that incense can hold him at bay. [595] Moses, in applying this remedy, had in mind also the purpose of showing the people the injustice of their superstition concerning the offering of incense. They called it death-bearing because it had brought death upon Nadab and Abihu, as well as upon the two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> followers of Korah. He now wished to convince them that it was this very incense that prevented the plague, and to teach them that it is sin that brings death. [596] Aaron, however, did not know why he employed incense, and therefore said to Moses: \"O my lord Moses, hast thou perchance my death in view?

The moon being very much less than the earth, the velocity she can impart to meteoric bodies is still less. It amounts, in fact, to only about a mile per second.

The ordinary wage was ten dollars a day, and men who could be trusted, and who were brave enough to pack the gold out to the coast, received twenty and even as high as <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars a day. There is a letter, written by Sir Matthew Begbie, describing how the mountain trails were infested that winter by desperadoes lying in wait for the miners who came staggering over the trail literally weighted down with gold. The miners found what the great banks have always found, that the presence of unused gold is a nuisance and a curse. They had to lug the gold in leather sacks with them to their work, and back with them to their shacks, and they always...", "...say, \"D--n 'em, I'll fight 'em as long as I live.\" Whit thought he was killed, but he is living yet.

This cape is a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> leagues distant, easterly, from the aforementioned land where the three Christians were murdered, and eight degrees south of the equinoctial line. While sailing on this course, we one day saw many people standing on the shore, apparently in great wonder at the sight of our ships. We directed our course towards them, and, having anchored in a good place, proceeded to land in the boats, and found the people better disposed than those we had...", "...the yards, gave us three cheers, which were heartily returned by the _Great Eastern_. She then steamed ahead towards Trinity Bay. The _Albany_ was signalled to go on immediately to Heart's Content, clear the N.E. side of the harbour of shipping, and place a boat with a red flag for Captain Anderson to steer to for anchorage. Just before dinner we saw on the southern horizon, distant about ten miles, an iceberg, probably the one that the _Albany_ had met with. It was apparently about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty feet in height. The fog came on very thickly about 8 p.m., and between that and 10 we were constantly exchanging guns and burning blue lights with the _Terrible_, which, with the _Niger_, went in search of the _Lily_ station-ship. The _Terrible_ being signalled to come up and take her position, informed us that they had made the _Lily_ out, and that she bore then about ENE., distant about four miles. Later in the night Captain Commerell said that if Captain Anderson...", "...went round once more, and a comely maid soon brought me meat, bread, fruits, and date wine.

You'd all be ever so much more miserable if I came, and so should I.\" \"But what good can it do?\" pleaded his cousin. \"I don't know--he might turn up. I might find him after all. If it hadn't been for your father coming, Raby--I'd have begged you to stay too. He'd be more likely to come if he knew _you_ were here.\" Raby flushed. Between Percy and his cousin there was no hypocrisy. \"Oh, Percy,\" she said, \"do you want to make me <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> times more miserable?\" And she gave up further attempt to move him. The travellers were away a month, during which time Percy kept his lonely vigil at Clarges Street. As the reader knows, it was useless. Jeffreys was never near the place, and the lad, watching day after day, began slowly to lose hope. But that month's experience was not wholly wasted. Memories of bygone talks with his friend, of good advice given, and quiet example unheeded at the time, crowded in on...", "...Mount or Aylmer Lake. This lake is placed by Hearne about seventy-five miles from Cat (Clinton-Colden) Lake, while actually it is only a very few miles from it, forming, with it, but one body of water with a rapid between them. On the Cook map it is shown as having its discharge in a stream flowing south-westward into the east end of Great Slave Lake. If his Cat Lake should prove to be Walmsley Lake his distances would not be quite so inaccurate, for Walmsley and Aylmer Lakes are about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles apart.

The rooms in it are so many and so great that the owners of such a bank (having become princes by its success) could inhabit them with a majesty worthy of their new title. But who lives above his shop since Richardson died? And did old Richardson? Lord knows!... Anyhow, the bank is glorious, and it is but one of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> houses that I saw in Lynn. Thus, in the same street as the Globe, was a facade of stone. If it was Georgian, it was very early Georgian, for it was relieved with ornaments of a delicate and accurate sort, and the proportions were exactly satisfying to the eye that looked on it. The stone also was of that kind (Portland stone, I think) which goes black and white with age, and which is better suited than any other to the English climate. In another house near the church I saw a...", "...scarlet. \"I--we have been waiting a long time now.\" There was a long silence, and the curate wondered whether he had been too mercenary in his request. Then Lord Caversham asked:-- \"What are you getting at present?\" \"A hundred and twenty a year.\" This was about two thirds of the salary Lord Caversham paid his chauffeur. He asked another question in his curious, abrupt staccato manner:-- \"How much do you want?\" \"We could make both ends meet on two hundred; but another <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> would enable me to make her a lot more comfortable,\" said the curate wistfully. The great man surveyed him silently--wonderingly, too, if the curate had known. Presently he asked: \"Afraid of hard work?\" \"No work is hard to a man with a wife and a home of his own,\" replied the curate with simple fervor. Lord Caversham smiled grimly. He had more homes of his own than he could conveniently live in, and he had been married three times; but even he found work hard now and...", "...Mr. Burns to be the only genuine and real painters of Scottish costume in the world.

Mark was at present the manager of a small china manufactory at Longshaw, the farthest of the Five Towns in Staffordshire, and five miles from Bursley. He was an exceptionally clever potter, but he never made money. He had the dreamy temperament of the inventor. He was a man of ideas, the kind of man who is capable of forgetting that he has not had his dinner, and who can live apparently content amid the grossest domestic neglect. He had once spoilt a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds' worth of ware by firing it in a new kiln of his own contrivance; it cost him three years of atrocious parsimony to pay for the ware and the building of the kiln. He was impulsively and recklessly charitable, and his Saturday afternoons and Sundays were chiefly devoted to the passionate propagandism of the theories of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

When Lord George looked through the eyelets of his mask into the mirror that was placed in his hand, he saw a face that was saintly, itself a mirror of true love. How wonderful it was! He felt his past was a dream. He felt he was a new man indeed. His voice went strangely through the mask's parted lips, as he thanked Mr. Aeneas. \"Proud to have served your Lordship,\" said that little worthy, pocketing his fee of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> guineas, while he bowed his customer out. When he reached the street, Lord George nearly uttered a curse through those sainted lips of his. For there, right in his way, stood La Gambogi, with a small pink parasol. She laid her hand upon his sleeve and called him softly by his name. He passed her by without a word. Again she confronted him. \"I cannot let go so handsome a lover,\" she laughed, \"even though he spurn me! Do not spurn me, George. Give me your posy of wild flowers....", "...With this dire threat, and turning occasionally to bestow another fierce glance upon the steward, she walked to the door and, opening it to its full extent, closed it behind her with a crash and darted across the alley to her own house. The two men gazed at each other without speaking, and then Mr. Wilks, stepping over to the door, turned the key in the lock. \"You're not afraid of Teddy?\" said the staring Nugent. \"Teddy!\" said Mr. Wilks, snapping his huge fingers. \"I'm not afraid o' <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> Teddies; but she might come back with 'im.

The son of a hardworking country doctor, it had fallen to his lot to emigrate to Australia at the early age of sixteen. He had not a friend in that vast, but sparsely-populated, land, and was without influence of any sort to help him forward. When, therefore, in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years' time, he found himself worth upwards of half-a-million pounds sterling, he was able to tell himself that he owed his good fortune not only to his own industry, but also to his shrewd business capabilities.

He had invested his money prudently, and the rich Stations, and the streets of...", "...a right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet it seemed a pitiful thing and somehow wrong, though why wrong I was not deep enough to explain if I had been asked to do it.

By four o'clock in the morning the battle had entirely ceased, and our \"cracker line\" was never afterward disturbed. In securing possession of Lookout Valley, Smith lost one man killed and four or five wounded. The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry, captured. In the night engagement of the 28th-9th Hooker lost 416 killed and wounded. I never knew the loss of the enemy, but our troops buried over one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> of his dead and captured more than a hundred. After we had secured the opening of a line over which to bring our supplies to the army, I made a personal inspection to see the situation of the pickets of the two armies.

THE JUNGFRAU-JOCH[58] BY SIR LESLIE STEPHEN I was once more standing upon the Wengern Alp, and gazing longingly at the Jungfrau-Joch. Surely the Wengern Alp must be precisely the loveliest place in this world. To hurry past it, and listen to the roar of the avalanches, is a very unsatisfactory mode of enjoyment; it reminds one too much of letting off crackers in a cathedral. The mountains seem to be accomplices of the people who charge <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> centimes for an echo. But it does one's moral nature good to linger there at sunset or in the early morning, when tourists have ceased from traveling; and the jaded cockney may enjoy a kind of spiritual bath in the soothing calmness of scenery....

Ten days afterwards we reached Champion Bay, where we intended to remain for three days, having settled to commence our journey on the 1st of April. We had enough to do in preparing stores, shoeing horses, and starting a team with our heaviest baggage to a spot about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles inland. On the 31st March we were entertained at dinner by Mr. Crowther (Member of the Legislative Council for the district) at the Geraldton Hotel. It was from that point we considered the expedition really commenced, and my Journal will show that we numbered our camps from that place. Our final start was not effected without some trouble. The horses, happily ignorant of the troubles which awaited them, were fresh and lively, kicking, plunging, and running away, so that it...", "...weapons we thought them, and were always game and happy enough to use them when luck sent any fighting our way.

Still there is no doubt that, thanks to science and the enormous expenditure of cash, the lot of the present-day fighting-man is infinitely better than it was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago, while far more men and much better material were employed on a war of conquest during the sixties and the seventies of the last century than were deemed necessary fifty years previously; in fact you may say it has been so way back to the days of romance, when Samson used to play a lone hand against the Philistines, or even when Sir Galahad and his compeers used to start out holy-grailing, giant-killing, dragon-hunting or lovely-maiden-rescuing.

The southern road, leading through Khuramabad to Dizful and Shuster, has no great natural difficulties, though part of it lies through a mountainous region. Some blasting and much boulder-lifting would, according to Colonel Bell, remedy the evils of the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles of it which he regards as bad. But, apart from this, the Shuster-Burujird route, the most _natural_ route for north and south-western Persian commerce to take to and from the sea, is at present useless to trade from its insecurity, as the Feili Lurs, through whose territory it passes, own no authority, live by robbery when they have any one to rob, and are always fighting each other.

The inquisitions of the Despensers, as is usual in the case of attainted persons, do not give the date of death. Note 4.

Concealing herself as best she could within the small copse she noticed that the track descended to where usually a ford was discoverable. She could note horses' hoofs on the bank top, but the cart road to the farm ran on the farther side of the burn, winding in and out of the rolling pasture. To the right hand <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards away, a light wooden bridge with hand-rail leapt from rock to rock above the foaming water. Boiling amidst the rocky chasm it poured an amber flood across the ford below. A bold rider might have perhaps leaped his horse across; that might possibly have been safer than to walk a horse through where a stumble might mean doom to both. No, Mrs. Chesters decided; if she went up to the farm she would have to dismount and walk across the little bridge. As she reflected thus...", "...promptly. \"If I had been too greedy I'd have deserved to lose altogether, and very likely I would have lost.

The grounds committee of another country club offered two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> for that same canoe a month later. \"Now, fellows,\" Dick went on, \"suppose we leave here and decide how we're to lay out this money for our summer camp?\" The vote was carried instantly.

Assuredly it was a late season. It was still impossible for vessels to reach St. Michaels or Teller, the latter being the starting-point for the new Bluestone and Kougarok districts; and the Nome dailies were issuing sensational extras with large head-lines telling that \"Fifteen Hundred People\" were \"Starving at the Mouth of the Yukon\"--at St. Michaels, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles away. Many of the neighboring creeks were yet filled with ice and snow, so as to allow only preliminary operations for mining, or none at all. The prospect was made more dismal by the stormy and cold rainy weather which then prevailed.

To such a pass had eleven months of war reduced that formidable army who had so confidently advanced to the conquest of South Africa.

These operations on August 26th and 27th were met with some resistance, and entailed a loss of forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> killed and wounded; but it soon became evident that the punishment which they had received at Bergendal had taken the fight out of the Boers, and that this formidable position was to be abandoned as the others had been.

Four days later the House resolved to grant half-pay to the disbanded officers till they should be otherwise provided for. The half-pay was meant to be a retainer as well as a reward.

Cotton was twenty cents a pound during all of the twenties; it was as low as seven cents when nullification was the critical issue; but from 1850 to 1860 cotton sold at ten or twelve cents.

McBain was right. The young blood in Rory's veins soon reasserted itself, and after half-an-hour's rest he seemed as well as ever. His first action on awaking was to put his hand to his brow, and his first words were,-- \"What is it at all, and where am I? Have I been in any trouble?\" \"Trouble, Rory?\" said Allan, pressing his hand. \"Well, you and Ralph went tumbling over a cliff.\" \"Only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet of a fall, Rory,\" said Ralph. Rory sat bolt upright now, and opened his eyes in astonishment. \"Och! now I remember,\" he said, \"that we had a bit of a fall--But fifty feet! do you tell me so? Indeed then it's a wonder there is one single whole bone between the two of us.

The neighboring nations and tribes in Arabia, Palestine, and Syria, found their way to it, accordingly, across the deserts on the eastern side, when driven by want, and thus opened a way of communication. At length the Persian monarchs, after extending their empire westward to the Mediterranean, found access by the same road to Pelusium, and thence overran and conquered the country. At last, about two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years before the time of Cleopatra, Alexander the Great, when he subverted the Persian empire, took possession of Egypt, and annexed it, among the other Persian provinces, to his own dominions. At the division of Alexander's empire, after his death, Egypt fell to one of his generals, named Ptolemy. Ptolemy made it his kingdom, and left it, at his death, to his heirs. A long line of sovereigns succeeded him, known in history as the dynasty of the Ptolemies--Greek princes, reigning...", "...and low a broader destiny and a purer patriotism. CHAPTER XXXII. WAR EXECUTIONS. To have looked upon seventeen beings of human organism, ambition, sense of pain and of disgrace, brought forward with all the solemnities of a living funeral, and launched from absolute cognition to direct death, should put one in the category of Calcraft, Ketch, and Isaacs. Yet, I do not think it would be right to so classify me. I know an excellent clergyman, who has seen and assisted in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> odd executions. He says, as I say, that each new one is an augmented terror. But he is upon the spot to smooth the felon's troubled spirit, and I am with him to teach the felon's boon companions the direness of the penalty. Without either the Chaplain or myself, capital punishment would lose half its effectiveness. And this is why I write the present article,--to relieve myself from the pertinacious inquiries with which I have been assailed since my return from the melancholy...", "...the manufacture of hats. Kit Carson saw at a glance, that his favorite occupation was gone; that he and the other trappers would be compelled to seek some other employment. In company with five men of a decidedly higher order than the common run of trappers, he struck for the head waters of Arkansas river. Following this stream down along the immense defile which nature seems to have opened for it through the Rocky mountains, they approached Fort Bent, which is about one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles east of that gigantic barrier. Mr. Carson's companions on this trip, were some of them at least, very peculiar characters,--very interesting specimens of the kind of men who are drawn from the haunts of civilization to the wilderness. One was a man, probably partially insane, who was known through all the Rocky mountain region as \"old Bill Williams.\" He had been a Methodist preacher in Missouri. For some unknown reason he left the States and joined the Indians, adopting...", "...force very inadequate, even for covering parties. As there was a prospect that each of the inconveniences would shortly be removed, I advised to defer it. To convince them that my disapprobation arose from no jealousy of honour, I told Colonel Littlefield that if the enterprise should hereafter be thought more advisable, I would leave to him the execution: if I should think proper to send him on that command, I would act with the covering party. One hundred and fifty continentals and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> militia was the force proposed for this evening; but as there are a number of volunteers on the spot, I consented to and encouraged an excursion to Frog's Neck, under Colonel Littlefield.

In his letter of January 8th we note that he expects to go to Elmira for a few days as soon as he has time. But he did not have time, or perhaps did not receive a pressing invitation until he...", "...the Committee on Foreign Relations took for the text of its report. The time had arrived, in the opinion of the committee, when forbearance ceased to be a virtue and when Congress must as a sacred duty \"call forth the patriotism and resources of the country.\" Nor did the committee hesitate to point out the immediate steps to be taken if the country were to be put into a state of preparedness. Let the ranks of the regular army be filled and ten regiments added; let the President call for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand volunteers; let all available war-vessels be put in commission; and let merchant vessels arm in their own defense. If these recommendations were translated into acts, they would carry the country appreciably nearer war; but the members of the committee were not inclined to shrink from the consequences. To a man they agreed that war was preferable to inglorious submission to continued outrages, and that the outcome of war would be positively advantageous.

There was no cultivation, for there was no water; and it was water that the prisoners, parched by their painful march, most needed. To find a stream they must have diverged <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> versts eastward, to the very foot of the mountains. There flows the Tom, a little affluent of the Obi, which passes near Tomsk before losing itself in one of the great northern arteries.

From the point of view of national life, this means the exhaustion of one of the most important factors in our civilization within the immediate future.

The Duke, hearing of his approach, mustered his Guards to the number of eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men, and armed besides hard upon two thousand of the townsmen and apprentices, taking an oath of them that they would serve him loyally; for he feared and distrusted them; and of the whole force, eleven hundred had horses.

Dry-farming, however, is well established. There are large areas, especially in Nevada, that receive less than ten inches of rainfall annually, and one of the leading problems before the dry-farmers of this district is the determination of the possibility of producing crops upon such lands without irrigation. On the older dry-farms, which have existed in some cases from forty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, there are no signs of diminution of soil-fertility. Undoubtedly, however, even under the conditions of extremely high fertility prevailing in the Great Basin, the time will soon come when the dry-farmer must make provision for restoring to the soil some of the fertility taken away by crops. There are millions of acres in the Great Basin yet to be taken up and subjected to the will of the dry-farmer.

Not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years have passed since its demolition; yet no traces of it are to be found. A few rocky fragments, appearing now to bid defiance to time, indicate the scite of the fortress, which once arose on the summit of Mont Ste.

The railroad originally was as completely dissociated from steam propulsion as was the ship.

The sum of thirty dollars constitutes a member for five years and of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars a life member. Patrons of one hundred and five hundred dollars will not be wanting amongst so many generous and appreciative Catholics as there are in the country.

Slowly and gradually an interchanging came about by which appropriate limbs fastened themselves to the proper animals. The last of these misjointed creatures is...", "...in giving his report. Nothing, however, came out of the Commission's report. The fact was it was too big a question for the Tory Government to tackle. During the winter I attended several meetings and gave advice. I told the men if the employers would not employ them they were not to starve, but to throw themselves and their families upon the rates. Many of them did. On my own Board I moved a resolution to put into force an old Act of Parliament that enabled the Guardians to hire <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> acres of land on which to set the unemployed to work and to pay the men labourers' wages. This, of course, was defeated, but I warned the Board that the day was not far distant when they or some other authority would have to deal with the problems of the land and the unemployed, for the men would not starve.

At the very period when the able minister was trying to make the people feel the importance of the diminution in the talliages, he wrote to the king, \"I entreat your Majesty to read...", "...birthright; and the attempt to crush it by introducing the pernicious usages of Spain was everywhere received with execration.

Moreover there were war taxes to be paid, and the soldiery seem to have robbed and plundered at their will. He petitioned the Count of Schwarzburg for his salary as he \"knew not where to find bread for himself and his young family.\" The Count ordered his salary to be paid, but the keeper of the funds immediately resigned. It is supposed that Bach...", "...affairs during this period of growth and development in the city. Very much of this has been due to the enterprise and enlightenment of her own people. Liverpool shipowners have been in the vanguard of steamship enterprise, which has contributed so greatly to her prosperity; her merchants have built up her great trade in cotton and grain, and her citizens have not been slow to promote every sanitary improvement which made for the health and well-being of her people. During the past <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years the town has been re-sewered, the streets paved with an impervious pavement, and a new water supply has been introduced. The city has been encircled by a series of public parks and recreation grounds, baths and washhouses have been established, free libraries have been opened in the various suburban centres of population, cellar dwellings have been abolished, and rookeries in the shape of courts and tenement houses have been done away with, and in their place clean and...", "...to furnish a soldier for the war. Thus we have seventy shekels paid to a certain man, in the fifth year of Darius, to go to the city Shiladu.(525) Again, a certain Bel-iddin had to find twenty-five shekels to pay a substitute to go for him to the presence of the king.(526) Another man paid the wages of a soldier for two years.(527) This was an _aes militare_. In another case we find the _rikis kabli_ for a horseman for a certain troop, for three years. It consisted of an ass worth <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> shekels, thirty-six shekels for its keep, twelve coats, twelve breastplates (?), twelve _musapallatum_, twelve leather _mitu_, twenty-four shoes, thirty _KA_ of oil, sixty _KA_ of bdellium sixty _KA_ of some aromatic, all as equipment, _siditum_, to go to the camp (?).

There is a pathetic incident connected with this young man, and it may as well be set down here. Clemens found, a few weeks after his arrival in England, that so great was the tax upon his time that he could make no use of Thompson's services. He gave Thompson fifty dollars, and upon the possibility of the young man's desiring to return to America, advanced him another <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars, saying that he could return it some day, and never thought of it again. But the young man remembered it, and one day, thirty-six years later, after a life of hardship and struggle, such as the life of a country minister is apt to be, he wrote and inclosed a money-order, a payment on his debt. That letter and its inclosure brought only sorrow to Mark Twain. He felt that it laid upon him the accumulated burden of the weary thirty-six years' struggle with ill-fortune. He...", "...the young people being young.

The two gentlemen made their way readily to the open door, and stepped at once into full view of the ball-room. It was a space of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet long and thirty wide, running all across the house from back to front. Chandeliers of most primitive construction had been hung from the roof, and so skilfully decked with green that the rough splinters of wood which formed them were completely hidden. Flags and garlands ornamented the rough brick walls, and with plenty of light and flowers, and no small amount of taste and skill, the volunteer decorators had in fact succeeded in making out of rather unpromising materials, a...", "...\"My faith,\" said Nana, bringing the ten big silver pieces and quite determined to laugh about it, \"I am going to entrust you with this, gentlemen. It is for the poor.\" And the adorable little dimple in her chin became apparent. She assumed her favorite pose, her amiable baby expression, as she held the pile of five-franc pieces on her open palm and offered it to the men, as though she were saying to them, \"Now then, who wants some?\" The count was the sharper of the two. He took <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> francs but left one piece behind and, in order to gain possession of it, had to pick it off the young woman's very skin, a moist, supple skin, the touch of which sent a thrill through him. She was thoroughly merry and did not cease laughing. \"Come, gentlemen,\" she continued. \"Another time I hope to give more.\" The gentlemen no longer had any pretext for staying, and they bowed and went toward the door. But just as they were about to go out the bell rang anew. The marquis...", "...she was the mother of Actaeon.

The kingdom of Xerxes, who then ruled over Persia, stretched from India to the AEgean Sea and from the Caspian to the Red Sea. He reigned over Chaldean, Jew, Phoenician, Egyptian, Arab, Ethiopian and half a hundred other nations. From these he assembled an army, the greatest that has ever gone to war.

He was so constantly called Le Capitaine that his real name was seldom heard. It may however as well be known to us that this was Theodore Campan. He was a tall, well-looking man; always dressed in black garments, of a coarse description certainly, but scrupulously clean and well brushed; of perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years of age, and conspicuous for the rigid uprightness of his back--and for a black wooden leg. This wooden leg was perhaps the most remarkable trait in his character. It was always jet black, being painted, or polished, or japanned, as occasion might require, by the hands of the capitaine himself. It was longer than ordinary wooden legs, as indeed the capitaine was longer than ordinary men; but nevertheless it never seemed in any way to impede the rigid punctilious...", "..._Leopard_, and whether Burr ever tried again--and he ground his teeth with the only passion he showed. But in a moment that was over, and he said, \"God forgive me, for I am sure I forgive him.\" Then he asked about the old war--told me the true story of his serving the gun the day we took the _Java_--asked about dear old David Porter, as he called him. Then he settled down more quietly, and very happily, to hear me tell in an hour the history of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years. How I wished it had been somebody who knew something! But I did as well as I could. I told him of the English war. I told him about Fulton and the steamboat beginning. I told him about old Scott, and Jackson; told him all I could think of about the Mississippi, and New Orleans, and Texas, and his own old Kentucky. And do you think, he asked who was in command of the \"Legion of the West.\" I told him it was a very gallant officer...", "...all the world judges them useful to the public, let me tell you, I think them necessary to my kingdom. As to the doctrine, imputed to them, of withdrawing churchmen from obedience to sovereigns, or teaching subjects to attempt on their lives, it is proper to see, on one side, what they say, and, on the other, what they teach their scholars. What convinces me there is no such thing is, that, for these thirty years past, that they have taught in France, above <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand scholars have been brought up in their colleges, have conversed and lived with them, and not one has yet been found, in that vast number, who pretends to have heard any such discourse among them, or any thing coming up to the doctrine with which they are reproached.

He remarked: \"You see those lazy, loafing, good-for-nothing darkies; they're not worth digging graves for; yet they are the ones who create impressions of the race for the casual observer. It's because they are always in evidence on the street corners, while the rest of us are hard at work, and you know a dozen loafing darkies make a bigger crowd and a worse impression in this country than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> white men of the same class. But they ought not to represent the race. We are the race, and the race ought to be judged by us, not by them. Every race and every nation should be judged by the best it has been able to produce, not by the worst.\" The recollection of my stay in Washington is a pleasure to me now. In company with the doctor I visited Howard University, the public schools, the excellent colored hospital, with which he was in some way connected, if I remember...", "...Gilgit on the 1st December, arriving there on the 19th. I spent Christmas in Gilgit, and started on the 2nd January 1895 for Hunza, where I expected to remain for the rest of the winter. News of the murder of Nizam-ul-mulk, Mehter of Chitral, reached Gilgit on the 7th January, and Dr. Robertson, Political Agent at Gilgit, at once made preparations for a visit to Chitral. Captain Townshend, who was at Gupis with Gough of the 2nd Gurkhas, received orders to march with two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> rifles of the 4th Kashmir Infantry. The first detachment started under Gough, the second following under Townshend The British Agent, Captain Campbell, and Surgeon Captain Whitchurch, joined the second party at Ghizr, and they all crossed the pass together.

I shall then be able to write down hasty plans that my friends may be able to finish, shall tear up bad pages and improve good ones, and shall glance rapidly through the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> volumes I have already written. Human will can do miracles.\" Balzac pleaded pathetically, almost as though he thought his interlocutor could grant the boon of longer life if he willed to do so. He had aged ten years since the beginning of the interview, and he had now no voice left to speak, and the doctor hardly any voice for answering. The latter managed, however, to tell his patient that everything must be done to-day, because in all probability to-morrow would not exist for...", "...child, through the fall you are _lost_. Have you been truly brought as a penitent to Christ? If so, you are _found_. Do not forget this--all the while any one knows not what it is to come to Christ for mercy and pardon, he is lost.

It is interesting to look over household and personal accounts of, say, a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago. Some of these, which deal with the expenses of Mr. Gervase Scrope, and of his son Thomas, both of Cockerington, Lincolnshire, lie before me; and from them I find that \"my dark-coloured cloth suit, trimmed with silver buttons and loops, was made November 21st, 1730, and cost in all L17 17s. 6d.\" This included two pairs of breeches. The cloth for the suit cost 18s. a yard; but Mr. Scrope had a cloak in 1732, the cloth of which cost L1 2s. a yard. In 1729, however, he...", "...to occupy and defend it to the last.

The order of battle was thus formed:-- Twelve guns, under Major Lloyd, flanked by 50 Madras sappers, under Captain Henderson, were on the right. On Lloyd's left stood the 22nd Queen's Regiment, under Colonel Pennefather, not 500 strong, half Irishmen, strong of body, high-blooded soldiers, who saw nothing but victory.

Eight years later they totally defeated a superior Peloponnesian force at the battle of Leuctra and brought the supremacy of Sparta to an end. This engagement from a military standpoint is one of the most interesting in ancient history. Epaminondas, the skilful Theban commander, massed his best troops in a solid column, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men deep, and hurled it with terrific force against the Spartan ranks. The enemy, drawn up twelve men deep in the customary formation, could not withstand the impact of the Theban column; their lines gave way, and the fight was soon won.

Turn to the Book of Numbers, and read, \"When the people offered incense upon the strange altar, there came down fire from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> who offered the incense. And Nahab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the Lord.\" Second Kings, vi. 17: \"Elisha said, they that be for us are more than they that are against us; he prayed, and God opened the young man's eyes, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.\" Thus we see that this element--in its destructive form--is the ready manifestation of God's displeasure....", "...were still; the only sound was the light crunch of our feet, the crackle now and then of a fallen twig.

Many of these earthly rulers retired to the seclusion of the monastery because their hopes had been crushed by political defeat, or their consciences smitten by reason of crime or other sins.

In its behalf he spent twelve years of constant toil, and made over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> voyages, more than thirty of which were across the Atlantic. He devoted his entire fortune to the undertaking, of which he was the projector and cheerfully incurred the risk of poverty rather than abandon it.

A mere resolution that a newspaper, in criticising hotel prices, has abused the liberty of the Press, will not persuade any reader of the paper to think so. The worst thing that has been, or could have been done to the landlords by a newspaper, was the publication of their bills: do they resolve this to be exceeding the bounds of just criticism?

Under a magnificent marble canopy, still and stern in death, lies the last of the Tudors--that splendid personage who, for more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, ruled over England and kept all Europe at bay; and who by word and deed encouraged those who laid the foundation of the great transatlantic England. Yes! there sleeps Queen Elizabeth--the old lioness. And in spite of vanities and weaknesses that we are apt nowadays to dwell on all too hardly, she was perhaps the greatest woman that England has ever seen. Her tomb, built by James the First, \"of white marble and touchstone from the royal store at Whitehall,\" is not only a...", "...morning, while all his suite slept, he passed hours in prayer before the altar in the dimly lighted church, imploring the help of the Almighty for the attainment of his sole object in life--the destruction of the Turkish power. At last, 1448, he set out against the Sultan with an army of twenty-four thousand of his most trusty soldiers. This time it was on the frontier of Servia, on the \"Field of Blackbirds,\" that Hunyady encountered Sultan Amurath, who had an army of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand men--again more than five times the number of the Christians. Hunyady at first withdrew himself into his intrenched camp, but in a few days felt himself strong enough to engage with the enemy on the open field. The battle lasted without interruption for two days and a night. Hunyady himself was several times in deadly peril. Once his horse was shot under him. He was to be found wherever assistance, support, encouragement, were needed. At last, on the morning of the third...", "...had all but fallen a victim, he felt an instinctive aversion for that person, and displayed a marked affectation in trying to avoid any meeting with him. In Sonora, as in other countries, it is not easy to meet at a moment's notice persons who will discount large bills to render you a service. The man who had given the money for these must be very rich, and most desirous to assist the Marquis. However much the senator thought of the subject, he could not call to mind any landowner for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> leagues round capable of acting in such a way. Moreover, the discounter must have been aware of the plot formed against the majordomo, for otherwise he would not have proposed to take the bills. Could Kidd be the traitor? In a moment the senator recognised the absurdity of such a suspicion. It was not probable that the bandit had declined to kill the majordomo; but that he should have allowed him to escape without robbing him was an utterly unlikely circumstance. Moreover, Kidd...", "...edifices seem to have been erected on the platform by later kings--one by Xerxes and the other by Artaxerxes Ochus; but the latter of these is in so ruined a condition, and the former is so like the palace of Darius, that but few remarks need be made upon either. The palace of Xerxes is simply that of Darius on a larger scale, the pillars in the portico being increased from two rows of four to two rows of six, and the great hall behind being a square of eighty instead of a square of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet, with thirty-six instead of sixteen pillars to support its roof. On either side of the hall, and on either side of the portico, were apartments like those already described as abutting on the same portions of the older palace, differing from them chiefly in being larger and more numerous. The two largest, which were thirty-one feet square, had roofs supported on pillars, the numbers of such supports being in each case four. The only striking difference in the plans of the...", "...crossing, she snatched it up and if he had not prevented would have slung it across her own back. When they got into the train and it had run out of the city she was as delighted as a girl and talked as the boy had never heard her talk before. All through the night as the train rattled along, the grandmother told Tom tales of Winesburg and of how he would enjoy his life working in the fields and shooting wild things in the woods there. She could not believe that the tiny village of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years before had grown into a thriving town in her absence, and in the morning when the train came to Winesburg did not want to get off. \"It isn't what I thought. It may be hard for you here,\" she said, and then the train went on its way and the two stood confused, not knowing where to turn, in the presence of Albert Longworth, the Winesburg baggage master. But Tom Foster did get along all right. He was one to get along anywhere. Mrs. White, the banker's wife, employed his...", "...I once more encountered my family of Tuscarora Indians. The man was at this time wide awake, but still half drunk; and, although a fine-made fellow, had that horrid brutal look which accompanies continued debauch. He was attended as I at first saw him, only that now, as he stood by the public-house door talking with a couple of negroes, the boy and the hound only were beside him. I looked about for my lady of the tribe, and perceived her squatted on her heels against the wall, about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> paces lower down, \"burd alane.\" From a slight furtive glance of the urchin, I perceived that he recognised me; he spoke a couple of words to his father, who, turning his head in the direction where I stood, muttered an interjectional \"Ugh!\" and resumed his previous calm attitude, contrasting oddly with the _insouciant_ look and merry grimaces of his negro companions. I next walked on to the solitary squaw, in hopes of claiming acquaintance; but she kept her eyes fixed upon a...", "...but he finally entered everybody in the time-book at two and a half cents an hour, gave each a plot of ground that wouldn't do for anything else, and started them off, while he kept on at real work.

If Edith's five rows of okra do not net or gross--I forget which is the right term for it--I know she will wilt away, and I dread Sue if her <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> tomato-plants go down before the humble cutworm. Sue won't be humble. Miss Editha came out with us one afternoon and sowed a row of ladies'-slippers and princess-feathers, and it was funny to see old Dr. Chubb, who had driven the ten miles just for the pleasure of seeing Sam (only, Sam said it was in hopes of seeing me), digging and raking for her, while Colonel Menefee, in true military style, commanded them both. Father came once and took Sam away down to a field by himself,...", "...feet, so he took a stone and hammered off a specimen for future reference. In the meantime Ches, on the burro, got around the turn of the trail. Suddenly the boy set up a shout of excitement. \"Oh, Mister!\" he yelled, with a string of profanity, his promise forgotten in his heat. \"Come quick, an' look at der cat! Come quick, quick, quick! What a cat! You never see sich a cat!\" Jim dashed forward. \"Well, I should say cat!\" he remarked, as he took in the situation. On a ledge about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet above the road crouched a full-grown mountain lion, ears back, eyes furtively glimpsing every avenue of escape, yaggering at the intruders savagely. The small boy in Jim Felton rose on the instant. \"Pelt him, Ches! Pelt him!\" he cried, and let fly the rock in his hand by way of illustration. A wild animal seems to have little idea of a missile. The lion held his ground and let the stone strike him in the side. Then, with a screech like the vital principle of forty...", "...swung round and the muzzles sank until the long chases pointed at the _Australien's_ waterline. The Field-Marshal knew full well that it only needed the touch of a finger on a button to smash the _Australien_ into fragments, and he knew too that the first shot from the flagship would be the signal for the whole Fleet to open fire, and that would mean massacre unspeakable. He was as brave a man as ever wore a uniform, but he knew that on the next words he should speak the lives of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand men depended. He took one more look round the ring of steel which enclosed him on every side, and then with livid lips and grinding teeth gave the order for the flag to be hauled down. The next moment he unbuckled his sword and hurled it into the sea; then with a deep groan he dropped fainting to the deck. It would be useless to attempt to describe the fury and mortification with which the officers and men of the French Force saw the flags one by one flutter down from...", "...Rockingham; continues a strait road for many miles till it nearly reaches Leicester, and passing thro' the town it is found to leave the county near Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The other road, called the _Via_ _Fossata_ or Fosse, always known, and every where remarkable, traverses the island in a north-east direction, from near Grimsby on the coast of Lincolnshire, passes thro' Bath, and terminates at Seaton, a village situated on the coast of Devonshire, a distance of more than two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles. This road enters Leicesteshire at a place called Seg's Hill, on the wolds, or antiently wild and uncultivated parts of the county; from thence it passes the village of Thurmaston and approaches the East gates of Leicester, by the street called the Belgrave Gate.

When the lance has buried itself in the huge body of the whale, the fire communicates with the explosive part of the filling in the tube, situated about in the centre of the lance, and in a few moments, thirty seconds perhaps, it bursts like a bomb, and destroys the life of the whale. The bomb lance may be fired with effect at a whale, at a distance of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards or more. \"The huge body is now towed to the ship; a hole is cut into the blubber near the head, into which a strong hook is inserted--a difficult and dangerous operation. A strong tension is then applied to this hook, and by it the blubber is hoisted up, as it is generally cut by the spades in a spiral strip, going round and round the body, the whale being secured alongside of the ship, and somewhat stretched by tackles both at the head and tail.

For a few weeks Yen-ping devoted itself to funerals, a thousand a week, and now this little city, one of the most isolated in China, can truly be said to be on the road to health. [Footnote: \"Doctoring China,\" by Tyler Dennet, _Asia_, February, 1918, p. 114.] There are very few such progressive cities in China, however, and a missionary told us that recently a young child and his grandfather were buried on the same day although their deaths had been nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years apart. The funeral rites are in themselves fairly simple, but it is the great ambition of every Chinese to have his resting place as near as possible to those of his ancestors. That is one of the reasons why they are so loath to emigrate. We often passed eight or ten coolies staggering under the load of a heavy coffin, transporting a body sometimes a month's journey or more to bury it at the dead man's birthplace. A rooster usually would be fastened to the coffin for,...", "...fresh meat in exchange for pemmican. During the latter part of the day we had seen numerous tracks of the moose, buffalo, and marten. December 26. The weather was so cold that we were compelled to run to prevent ourselves from freezing; our route lay across some large meadows which appeared to abound in animals, though the Indians around Slave Lake are in a state of great want. About noon we passed a sulphur-stream which ran into the river; it appeared to come from a plain about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards distant. There were no rocks near it and the soil through which it took its course was composed of a reddish clay. I was much galled by the strings of the snowshoes during the day and once got a severe fall occasioned by the dogs running over one of my feet and, dragging me some distance, my snowshoe having become entangled with the sledge.

So you may imagine him visiting Ritchie and his tanks north of the Somme, paying a brief unhappy visit to Proyart, and then with Westbrook pushing forward to a gully beyond Rainecourt to look for Rankin and his tank. The enemy were unkind that day. In these later actions the Carrier tanks had proved their worth incontestably. South of the Somme forty-six tons of stores and ammunition had been carried by nine ancient, unsuitable tanks, manned by eight officers and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men[33] to nine different points, each within 400 yards of the enemy, and each inaccessible by day to wheeled transport. If the old bad system of carrying parties had been employed, 2500[34] men would have been needed instead of 58. Further, these loads were carried forward eight to nine miles in all, and at least sixteen lorries were therefore set free. Lastly, the Carrier tanks followed so closely the advancing infantry that in the majority of cases the stores and ammunition...", "...the Child of the Lower Orders\"; but the monument was never raised, and no one knows where his bones found their last resting-place. Cobbett himself gained nothing by this resurrectionist performance, except an additional couplet in the party-songs of the day:-- \"Let Cobbett of borough-corruption complain, And go to the De'il with the bones of Tom Paine.\" The two were classed together by English Conservatives, as \"pestilent fellows\" and \"promoters of sedition.\" It is now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years since Paine died; but the _nil de mortuis_ is no rule in his case. The evil associations of his later days have pursued him beyond the grave. A small and threadbare sect of \"liberals,\" as they call themselves,--men in whom want of skill, industry, and thrift has produced the usual results,--have erected an altar to Thomas Paine, and, on the anniversary of his birth, go through with a pointless celebration, which passes unnoticed, unless in an out-of-the-way corner of some...", "...whom Darius had in his service, and who alone were considered fit to stand the charge of the Macedonian phalanx, was drawn up on either side of the royal chariot.

In advance of the line on the left wing were placed the Scythian cavalry, with a thousand of the Bactrian horse and a hundred scythe-armed chariots. The elephants and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> scythe-armed chariots were ranged in front of the centre; and fifty more chariots, with the Armenian and Cappadocian cavalry, were drawn up in advance of the right wing. Thus arrayed, the great host of King Darius passed the night that to many thousands of them was the last of their existence. The morning of the first of October[50] dawned slowly to their wearied watching, and they could hear the note of the Macedonian trumpet sounding to arms, and could see King Alexander's...", "...muriate of potash is applied. The trees have grown as fast as could be desired, and all of them are now in bearing. The apples from these young trees sold for enough last year to net ninety cents for each tree, which is more than the trees have ever cost me. In 1898 these orchards yielded $38; in 1899, $165; in 1900, $530; in 1901, $1117. Seven years from the date of planting these trees, which were then three years old, I had received in money $4720, or $1200 more than I paid for the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> acres of land on which they grew. If one would ask for better returns, all he has to do is to wait; for there is a sort of geometrical progression inherent in the income from all well-cared-for orchards, which continues in force for about fifteen years. There is, however, no rule of progress unless the orchards are well cared for, and I would not lead any one to the mistake of planting an orchard and then doing nothing but wait.

Under this _first_ etymological notion of Pamphlets may be comprehended the _vulgar stories_ of the Nine Worthies of the World, of the Seven Champions of Christendom, Tom Thumb, Valentine and Orson, &c., as also most of apocryphal lucubrations. The greatest collection of this first sort of Pamphlets are the Rabbinic traditions in the Talmud, consisting of fourteen volumes in folio, and the Popish legends of the Lives of the Saints, which, though not finished, form <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> folio volumes, all which tracts were originally in pamphlet forms. The _second_ idea of the _radix_ of the word _Pamphlet_ is, that it takes its derivations from [Greek: pan], _all_, and [Greek: phileo], _I love_, signifying a thing beloved by all; for a pamphlet being of a small portable bulk, and of no great price, is adapted to every one's understanding and reading. In this class may be placed all stitched books on serious subjects, the best of which fugitive pieces have...", "...to the sun, just gaining the horizon, he exclaimed, \"As old Bardianna says--shut your eyes, and believe.\" \"And what may Bardianna have to do with yonder orb?\" said Media.

Yet even thus blindly does all Mardi subscribe to an astronomical system, which not one in <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand can astronomically prove. And not many centuries back, my lord, all Mardi did equally subscribe to an astronomical system, precisely the reverse of that which they now believe. But the mass of Mardians have not as much reason to believe the first system, as the exploded one; for all who have eyes must assuredly see, that the sun seems to move, and that Mardi seems a fixture, eternally _here_.

Early Germans in America.--In the Colonial days, next to the English, the Germans were foremost in settling and developing our country. Long before the Puritans thought of emigrating to America, Germans had landed in various parts of the New World. As early as 1538, J. Cromberger established a printing-office in the City of Mexico, from which he issued numerous books. From 1528 to 1546 German explorers came to Venezuela also with a printing-press and with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miners to explore the mountains. A number of German craftsmen accompanied the first English settlers who came with Captain John Smith to Virginia. Soon after Henry Hudson had discovered the river which bears his name, Christiansen, a German, became the explorer of that stream. He also built the first homes on Manhattan Island, 1613, and laid the foundations of New Amsterdam and Fort Nassau, the present cities of New York and Albany.

Sometimes, of course, you'll find it just reversed, and the man that's rated at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand dies worth half a million. But that's the exception, these days, and the other's the rule.

In the forts and vessels were found above a hundred pieces of artillery, most of them swivels and other light guns, with a large quantity of powder, shot, and shell.

In failing to allow this, the reviewer thinks that the author has made an absurd mistake, which seriously detracts from the value of the book as a work of realistic imagination. Instead of placing the realization of the ideal social state a scant <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ahead, it is suggested that he should have made his figure seventy-five centuries. There is certainly a large discrepancy between seventy-five centuries and fifty years, and if the reviewer is correct in his estimate of the probable rate of human progress, the outlook of the world is decidedly discouraging. But is he right? I think not. _Looking Backward_, although in form a fanciful romance, is intended, in all seriousness, as a forecast, in accordance with the...", "...away until only the bare rocks remain, poverty will be our lot for many years. Nature will, however, if we give her a chance, renew the soil. The rocks will crumble and, by and by, seeds will sprout and tiny plants obtain a foothold.

Now <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years have passed and a new soil is being formed, but it will be a long time yet before it will be as good as it was in the first place. Upon the Western prairies only grain has been raised for so many years that in many places the soil will scarcely grow a crop worth gathering. Many farmers have never thought of this, but the wise ones understand that they must frequently add plant food to the soil to replace that taken by crops.

Chester's father had died of pneumonia about four years before the story commences, leaving his widow the cottage and about two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars. This sum little by little had melted, and a month previous the last dollar had been spent for the winter's supply of coal. Mrs. Rand had earned a small income by plain sewing and binding shoes for a shoe shop in the village, but to her dismay the announcement had just been made that the shop would close through the winter on account of the increased price of leather and overproduction during the year. \"What shall we do, Chester?\" she asked, in alarm, when the news...", "...\"It was January cotton.

The Prussian forces, about two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand strong, now gathered on the Saxon and Silesian frontier, covering the line from Pirna to Landshut.

He had just received a barrel of whiskey, which he was retailing at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents a glass. The sutler's glass held a little more than a thimbleful. There was a run on the whiskey for a time. Then trade slacked up, and the sutler was at a loss to account for it, as it was contrary to all precedent, the rule being that the more liquor the boys got the more they wanted. Finally the call for whiskey ceased. \"What's the matter with the men?\" the sutler asked one of his clerks. \"I don't know--they never acted like this before.\" \"They're not buying our...", "...are such good men of business that they can command a hundred dollars a thousand words for all they write.

Then he walked to and sat down on a mossy log. \"Guess I'm getting old,\" he remarked. \"I doubt if I'll be hunting Bennett's Woods more than another forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years.\" Bud said nothing as Gramps laid his grouse carefully in the leaves beside the log and ejected the two spent shells from his double-barreled twelve shotgun.

This cluster of rocks is situated in 0 degs. 58' north latitude, and 29 degs. 15' west longitude. It is 540 miles distant from the coast of America, and 350 from the island of Fernando Noronha. The highest point is only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet above the level of the sea, and the entire circumference is under three-quarters of a mile. This small point rises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean. Its mineralogical constitution is not simple; in some parts the rock is of a cherty, in others of a felspathic nature, including thin veins of serpentine. It is a remarkable fact, that all the many small islands, lying far from any continent, in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, with the exception of the...", "...ones also, struggled with you for your slippers as you doffed them, and not unfrequently the charge of the pair was divided between two.

CHAPTER XIII The next dispensary to be started was at Lapovo, an important railway junction on the Belgrade-Nish line. On Sunday, July 18th, at 5 a.m., Colonel Guentchitch, the head of the Army Medical Service, accompanied me and one of our doctors to Lapovo to choose the site. The day was, as usual, a feast day, and we stopped on the way, at an artillery encampment, to watch the soldiers dancing the kolo. One soldier stood playing the fiddle, whilst <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty others were holding hands, and dancing, quite silently, in a circle round him. How could even their enemies have painted these simple-minded, clean-living peasant soldiers, as fierce, fighting-loving savages? A suitable camping-ground was found adjoining and above the railway, on either side of a long one-storied building which was not yet completed; this could later be used as hospital with eighty beds. The doctor of the reserve hospital in Lapovo, two miles from...", "...In 830 B.C. it was the turn of Muzazir, which hitherto had escaped invasion, to receive a visit from the Tartan.

She devoted three-quarters of an hour to Mr. Chisholme, who gradually thawed in her genial sunshine. She finally sold him <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand dollars worth of Liberty Bonds and went on her way elated. The regular Bond Committee had labored for weeks with this stubborn man, who managed one of the largest enterprises in Dorfield, yet they had signally failed to convince him or to induce him to subscribe a dollar.

He saw that every Negro who drove a team of mules gave to the army one more white soldier with a musket in his hands; and so with the sympathy and approval of the gallant Gen. Geo. H. Thomas, Gen.

In September, 1862, an order from Washington directed the employment of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand Negro laborers in the Quartermaster's Department, under Generals Hunter and Saxton!

The last rebel had been forced to lay down his arms, and slavery, that had existed under the most aggravated form for about two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, had been swept from the land, and there remained not the shadow of a doubt that every colored man, woman and child were entirely free. Then, like the Jews of old, after the drowning of Pharaoh and his rebel army in the Red sea, there arose a loud and long-continued song of joy from the hearts of all the 4,000,000 of freed people all over Secessia--from Mason and Dixon's line to the Rio Grande river; and from the wild Atlantic waves to the State of Missouri in the far west....", "...a short distance from each other.

Cacich Miossich.[23] This work, although executed with little critical taste or judgment, and disfigured by many interpolations, might have given to the literary world a foretaste of the treasures, which <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years afterwards were to be discovered here. Whilst Slavic poetry found so many votaries among the Dalmatians, it is a remarkable fact, that all their historians wrote in Latin or Italian. They possess indeed a very old chronicle, of the date of A.D. 1161, written in the Slavic language by an anonymous Presbyter of Dioclea, and translated by himself into Latin; but in the more flourishing period of the Dalmatian literature, the love of their own language was overcome by the...", "...will understand a great many things that are not very clear to him just now. Of course he probably will not choose to believe this; youths of twenty are not apt to believe much that is told them, since they have so little to learn! But, if I were back to twenty again, and, with my later knowledge, were earning twenty-two dollars per week, I should not only be satisfied, but I should be intensely thankful. I think, too, that the knowledge that there were thousands of men of forty and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years who were not earning as much would help me to endure the ordeal. I think that instead of rebelling at the fact that I was earning twenty-two dollars, I should rather devote my time to trying to find the best way of doubling it. I might not be able to make twenty-five dollars for a year or two, but I should endeavor to do so. In fact, if we look over the field, there are more young men of twenty-one who are worth less than twenty-five dollars per week than there are who are...", "...give up.

Nelson's admiration for Glynnis increased. She responded intelligently to his commands, and learned quickly. She was strong and athletic, with the reflexes of an animal. They made good time. When darkness came Nelson estimated they had made almost <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles since the raid, even over rough terrain. He hoped that that would be enough. He was tired, and though the girl attempted to hide her own fatigue, her attempts were becoming more and more exaggerated. He searched out a camp site. He found one on a hill, overlooking a river. There was protection from the wind. The moon was up and there was plenty of light from it; but Nelson didn't think the searchers would be out at night. After they had eaten, Nelson leaned back against...", "...houses, so far as he could make out, and the four miles that had been declared at their last stopping-place to separate them from the next village appeared already more like five or six. Certainly the three of them had between two and three shillings, all told; there was no actual need of a workhouse just yet, but naturally it was wished to spend as little as possible. Then on a sudden he caught a glimpse of a light burning somewhere, that appeared and vanished again as he moved, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards more brought him to a wide sweep, a pair of gate-posts with the gate fastened back, and a lodge on the left-hand side. So much he could make out dimly through the November darkness; and as he stood there hesitating, he thought he could see somewhere below him a few other lights burning through the masses of leafless trees through which the drive went downhill. He knew very well by experience that lodge-keepers were, taken altogether, perhaps the most unsympathetic class...", "...carried her fast enough. It was small comfort to tell herself that Onistah was a Blackfoot and knew every ruse of the woods. His tracks would lead straight to him and the veriest child could follow them. Nor could she persuade herself that Whaley would stand between him and West's anger. To the gambler Onistah was only a nitchie. The train passed out of the woods to the shore of the lake.

Although at this distance considerable accuracy could be attained at the target upon a quiet day, it was difficult to shoot with any precision at an unmeasured range owing to the high trajectory of the bullet. Thus for sporting purposes it was absolutely essential that the hunter should be a first-rate judge of distance in order to adjust the sights as required by the occasion. It was accordingly rare to meet with a good rifle-shot <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago. Rifle-shooting was not the amusement sought by Englishmen, although in Switzerland and Germany it was the ordinary pastime. In those countries the match-rifle was immensely heavy, weighing, in many instances, 16 lbs., although the bullet was exceedingly small. The idea of non-recoil was paramount as necessary to ensure accuracy. It will be at once perceived that the rifle was a most inferior weapon, failing through a low velocity, high trajectory, and weakness of...", "...The boys, as well as the girls, spent those days at the Fair Grounds, showing the tricks Julia and the pig could do, and also going about seeking votes for their pets. The result of this faithful work was seen when the prizes were awarded. Dandelion Scout Camp won First Prize of a hundred dollars for having the heaviest and finest pig exhibited that year. Another fifty dollars came for Antoinette's being the best amateur trick animal shown that year. Julia won second prize of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars for having the required number of points in breeding and development. Then, after the fair closed, an animal trainer who made his living going about giving shows of trick animals made an offer for the two pets, saying he had seen them perform at the fair. \"What shall we do?

Abraham surmised that the Lord meant to play the devil with the Sodomites, and he was anxious about Lot who dwelt with them. So he began a parley. \"Now, my Lord,\" said Abraham, \"you surely don't mean to destroy indiscriminately; you, the judge of all the earth, must act on the square. Suppose there are <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> righteous men in Sodom, won't you, just for their sake, spare the place?\" Knowing that there were nothing like fifty righteous men in Sodom, the Lord promptly acceded to Abraham's-request; so promptly indeed that Abraham smelt a rat, and determined to drive a closer bargain. So he asked the Lord to knock off five. \"Very well,\" was the reply, \"if I find forty-five righteous men I'll spare the city.\" Abraham was still suspicious. He knew that Jehovah loved a bit of destruction, and...", "...I replied. But I doubt if he heard me. \"Come, come, old fellow,\" he cried, \"take off that brass crown and toddle into the study.

At length, after some further excuses, the Old Squire was induced to make a beginning, and having begun, told us the following story which I give in words as nearly like his own as I can now remember. \"It was in the year 1812. I was little more than a boy at that time, and the country was quite new here. We had a clearing of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> acres and had not yet built our present buildings; and our only neighbors, nearer than the settlement in the lower part of the township, where the village now stands, were the Edwardses. Old Jeremy Edwards came here at about the same time that my father came. \"Eighteen-twelve was the time of our second war with England. Soldiers for it did not volunteer then; troops had to be raised by draft. Father and neighbor Edwards were both drafted.

He addressed them all on board, and gave them a most serious lecture on the sin of swearing. Vessel after vessel was taken by him, the commanders of which were generally patted on the back by Misson for their gallant defence, and always treated with courteous hospitality. His greatest prize, among dozens of others, was a Portuguese vessel of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> guns. The vessels were locked together. His crew found that instead of having it all their own way, they were vigorously attacked. Expecting no quarter, they contended fiercely, cleared the decks, and a number followed the Portuguese on board their own ship. Misson seeing this called out, \"_Elle est a nous; a l'abordage!_\" and a crowd of his men boarded. He engaged the captain, struck him so that he fell down the main-hatch, and the Portuguese almost immediately struck.

In many cases the loopholes were extremely small, but scientific evaluation has no room for even the smallest of loopholes and we had asked for a scientific evaluation.

They said that they had tried hard to be objective and not to be picayunish, but...", "...and have already found wide application in industry. Just as the old idea that there were a few special catalysts has been succeeded by the belief now held that every substance can be made to act as a catalyst in suitable circumstances, so it is now stated freely that, instead of there being a small class of colloids, any substance can be prepared in a colloid state. Incidentally, colloidal preparations are widely used as catalysts. Colloid chemistry may be said to have arisen some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago in the researches of Thomas Graham, who showed that a large class of liquids or semi-liquids would not diffuse through animal membranes, as do ordinary solutions of salts. Because many of these substances were sticky he gave to the whole class the name which they now hold, colloid. Since then his conception has been extended, and it is now realised that, strictly speaking, we should talk rather of a substance in a colloidal state than of a colloid, since typically...", "...all right.

No one else expressed an opinion, and Steve, taking my lady's rein, led her horse on until he came to the hollow part of the road. Here the moonlight disclosed a kind of water-lane, running away between the osiers, at right angles from the road. Steve turned into it, leading my lady's horse, and in a moment was wading a foot deep in water. The Waldgrave followed, then the women. I came last, with Marie's rein in my hand.

Anyway, John Nepomuk was duly canonized some three hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years after his supposed immersion in the waters of Prague. Since then many churches have been dedicated to his saintly memory; many statues, depicting him with all the truthfulness inherent in the narrative of \"the oldest inhabitant,\" adorn shrines by the wayside: he was apparently popular all over the country--in any case he brought the people at least one holiday.

On either side of the portico were guard-rooms, which opened upon it, in length twenty-three feet, and in breadth thirteen. Behind the portico lay the main chamber, which was a square of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet, having a roof supported by sixteen pillars, arranged in four rows of four, in line with the pillars of the portico. [PLATE XLV., Fig. 2.] The bases for the pillars alone remain; and it is thus uncertain whether their material was stone or wood. They were probably light and slender, not greatly interrupting the view. The hall was surrounded on all sides by walls from four to five feet in thickness, in which were doors, windows, and recesses, symmetrically arranged. The...", "...was not.

To her mind there was little doubt what he would do. People did not generally give away their money, especially such large sums as <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars seemed to her.

A whistle rang its shrill cry, and a volley of two hundred and fifty carbines and revolvers smashed every glass in the building. The sentinel had already given the alarm, and the drum was calling the startled negroes to their arms. They returned the volley twice, and for ten minutes were answered with the steady crack of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> guns. A white flag appeared at the door, and the firing ceased. The negroes laid down their arms and surrendered. All save three were allowed to go to their homes for the night and carry their wounded with them. The three confederates in the crime of their captain were bound and led away.

Eventually, however, the Argive ambassadors succeeded in obtaining from them this concession: For the present there was to be a truce for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, but it should be competent for either party, there being neither plague nor war in Lacedaemon or Argos, to give a formal challenge and decide the question of this territory by battle, as on a former occasion, when both sides claimed the victory; pursuit not being allowed beyond the frontier of Argos or Lacedaemon. The Lacedaemonians at first thought this mere folly; but at last, anxious at any cost to have the friendship of Argos they agreed to the terms demanded, and...", "...was still unfinished and the garrison feeble.

Moreover, with the spread of democratic ideas, the position of a monarch anywhere in the civilized world to-day is not what it was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago.

I had hardly made the humiliating discovery, when the boatswain hoarsely issued the unwelcome order, \"Lay aloft, lads, and send down the royal yards and masts!\" My pride would not allow me to shrink from my duty, and especially a duty like this, which belonged to light hands. And while I heartily wished the masts and yards, which added so much to the beauty of the ship, and of which I was so proud in port, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> fathoms beneath the keelson, I hastened with my wonted alacrity aloft, and commenced the work of sending down the main-royal yard. Seasickness is an unwelcome malady at best. It not only deprives a person of all buoyancy of spirit, but plunges him headlong into the gulf of despondency.

Within are few buildings of interest, due perhaps to the fact that about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago it was almost demolished by an earthquake. According to tradition, the same thing happened in the early part of the Ming period, when the town, which, so it is said, then stood in the hollow where the lake now lies, was first shaken by an earthquake and then overwhelmed by a rush of water from underground. Later a new city was built on the present site.

These 500 men then walked slowly towards the first net, carrying the other in front of them, and driving lots of antelopes before them. When they came within a mile of the first net they staked the second, and there were perhaps <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty antelopes enclosed in a space of about a mile square.

Lupin dragged me <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards lower down, to a corner in which we were able to hide. And we saw coming down the lane, carrying a little dog under her arm, a young and very much over-dressed woman, wearing a quantity of jewellery, a young woman whose eyes were too dark, her lips too red, her hair too fair.

The Persians overran Syria and captured Antioch, carrying off its population into captivity (540). However, they failed to take Edessa (544).

Finally, a <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years' peace was concluded in 562 A. D. The Roman suzerainty over Lazica was acknowledged by the Persians, but the Romans obligated themselves to pay the Persians a heavy annual subsidy, in return for which the Persians undertook the defence of the Caucasus. In this way the Persians became technically Roman _foederati_; however, as in the case of the Visigoths in the fourth century, this was equivalent to a confession that the Romans were unable to subdue their enemy, who looked...", "...with them all. \"'At one time Mr. Denny was reckoned as Seattle's wealthiest citizen.

Rations consisted of bread, tea, coffee, sometimes meat and potatoes. Water was a luxury, and so little was wasted for external application that several troopers offered to play the part of Othello without any make up. The war kit of the men was somewhat of the Christmas-tree order. On them were haversacks containing food, horse-brush, currycomb, and towel, water-bottle, bandolier with <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cartridges, waistbelt and gun weighing ten pounds. Often as not they turned in to rest, if not exactly thus equipped, at least booted and spurred, ready to be up and doing at a moment's notice! On the morning of the 14th of December the troops advanced from Frere to Chieveley. Reveille was sounded at 3 A.M., and soon the camp was one buzz of active life. In the warm glow of camp-fires tents were struck, kits packed, horses fed and watered, and the men breakfasted.

He commenced his readings with an unbiassed mind, and was not aware at the outset, to what conviction they would bring him.

The biography of a Queen, who lived two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago, cannot be like the biography of a contemporary or immediate predecessor; but the inherent interest of the subject, will excuse many deficiencies. Omissions may, perhaps, be pardoned, if there are no misrepresentations; and the absence of minute cavilling and trifling distinctions, may not be complained of, if the narrative leads, by a lucid arrangement, to satisfactory general deductions.

Now and then the Keltic or Iberian names of Gallic or Spanish articles were taken up, but the inflectional system and the syntax of Latin retained their integrity. In the post-Roman period additions to the vocabulary are more significant. It is said that about three hundred Germanic words have found their way into all the Romance languages.[11] The language of the province of Gaul was most affected since some four hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> Gothic, Lombardic, and Burgundian words are found in French alone, such words as boulevard, homard, and blesser. Each of the provinces of course, when the Empire broke up, was subjected to influences peculiar to itself.

Of course we had to watch the burning logs and stumps for a few days, until all danger of more fires was over, and if there'd been a high wind in that time we might have had trouble.

These little \"creepers\" would run right up under the bows of gunboats unnoticed; as soon as shore was touched, if a plug was pulled out of the bottom of a boat it would immediately and entirely submerge itself, until wanted for use again. The price for carrying one person across the river was <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars in gold, which tempted to the business the most dare devil men on either side of the line. As to merchandise, the plan was to \"work\" the local storekeepers, for in the North it was perfectly legitimate to allow all the merchandise desired to go to the line just on the borders of territory patrolled by us, which might be only an hour's sail with fair wind to put it at night within the reach of the Confederates.

If the constant drop of water wears away the hardest stone it seemed perfectly reasonable to believe that the constant biff of boulders might batter through the hardest bottom.

He procured a number of carrier-pigeons, and several days before the expected arrival of every English mail-steamer took three of them to Halifax. There he boarded the vessels, procured the latest British papers, collated and summarized their news upon thin paper, secured the dispatches thus prepared to the pigeons, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles or so outside of Boston released the birds. The winged messengers, flying homeward, reached the city far in advance of the steamers, and the intelligence they brought was at once delivered to Mr. W.G.

A detachment of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> hussars had been appointed to meet the king at this spot. They were there at the assigned moment. The breaking down of the carriage, however, detained the king, and the hussars, observing the suspicions their presence was awaking, departed half an hour before the arrival of the carriages. Had the king arrived but one half hour sooner, the safety of the royal family would have been secured. The king was surprised and alarmed at not meeting the guard he had anticipated, and drove...", "...ornamentation, etc. When men have work they have money; and when men have money they spend it.

One man at a machine will do as much work in a factory to-day as required the work of fifty men <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago; but the enhanced volume of production can have only one purchaser now where there was once fifty, hence the fitful existence of the one and the desperate struggle for existence of the forty-nine.[15] As iron and steel cannot compete with muscle and brain in the volume of production, so iron and steel cannot compete with muscle and brain in consumption.

In one division there were about twenty regimental medical officers and three field ambulances, with nine medical officers each--about 750 men to the three ambulances. For transport each ambulance had <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> horses, and seven motor and three horse ambulances, with general service wagons and carts in addition. The following represented a few of the specific achievements of the corps: A school of massage and Swedish remedial drill was organized for training nurse sisters and soldiers for this service in hospitals.

She had declared to herself that she would bear it; but the misfortune to be borne was a broken world falling about her own ears.

Then she had pictured to herself the somewhat ascetic and very laborious life of an old maiden lady whose only recreation <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years hence should consist in looking at the portrait of him who had once been her lover. And now she was told that he was coming to Matching as though nothing had been the matter!

From the time of the Punic Wars, about two centuries and a half before Christ, the silver denarius, worth nearly seventeen cents, had been the standard of the Roman currency, and it kept its weight and purity unimpaired until Nero, when it diminished from 1/84 to 1/96 of a pound of silver, the pure metal being mixed with 1/10 of copper.[38] Under Trajan, toward 100 A.D., the alloy reached twenty per cent; under Septimius Severus a hundred years later it had mounted to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty per cent, and by the time of Elagabalus, 220 A.D., the coin had degenerated into a token of base metal, and was repudiated by the government. Something similar happened to the gold. The aureus, though it kept its fineness, lost in weight down to Constantine. In the reign of Augustus it equalled one-fortieth of a Roman pound of gold, in that of Nero one forty-fifth, in that of Caracalla but one-fiftieth, in that of Diocletian one-sixtieth, and in that of Constantine one...", "...that he ever knew what it was to lie down beaten.

Indeed they doubted whether it could be captured by an assault of less than 5000 men, a number which appeared at this stage of the campaign so appalling that it is mentioned as a sort of standard of comparison with the impossible. The garrison surrendered just as relief was approaching it, and after a strain which it had endured for no less than ten days; but the capture of Reading was not effected entirely without bloodshed; certainly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men were killed (counting both sides), possibly a few more; and the whole episode is a grotesque little foot-note to the comic opera upon which rose the curtain of the Civil Wars. It was not till the appearance of Cromwell, with his highly paid and disciplined force, that the tragedy began. Even after Cromwell had come forward as the chief leader, in fact if not in name, the apparent losses are largely increased by the random massacres to which his soldiers were unfortunately...", "...and vitality that Dr. Sangrado used to get from his patients with his lancet. It was a great political manoeuvre, no doubt, and it commended itself to all the hungry politicians in France so promptly and so warmly, that within three years' time, in 1882, M. Tirard, who was then Finance Minister, and who is now on the box of the Carnot coach, had to admit that the expenditure then contemplated in carrying out this great idea could not possibly fall short of nine thousand one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> millions of francs! This, observe, was seven years ago. To-day it has swelled, at the least, into eleven and perhaps to twelve thousand millions of francs. Why not? Gambetta, Leon Say, and Freycinet proclaimed the millennium of civil engineers and local candidates. What becomes of equality and fraternity if the smallest hamlet in the recesses of the Jura is not as much entitled to a local railway at the public expense as the largest port on the Bay of Biscay? Once let it be...", "...the demands of the fast mail-trains, will ere long swell from a regiment into a brigade, and so into a division, till poets and painters be called on to drop the theme of \"waiting for the mail.\" The greater portion of the fifty-odd thousand employes of the department do not give it their whole time, many of the country postmasters being engaged in other business. But the undivided efforts of them all, with an auxiliary corps, would be demanded for the handling of eight hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> millions of letters and cards, and a greater bulk of other mail-matter, under the old plan of rates varying according to distance and number of sheets, and not weight--stamps unknown. The introduction of stamps, with coincident reduction and unification of rates, has been the chief factor in the extraordinary increase of correspondence within the past thirty years; the number of letters passing through the mails having within that period multiplied twenty-fold. The number...", "...and there the motion too. I speak of those which are perceived by sight. 44. But for a fuller explication of this point, and to show that the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things placed at a distance, it is requisite that we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what is meant in common discourse, when one says that which he sees is at a distance from him. Suppose, for example, that looking at the moon I should say it were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me. Let us see what moon this is spoken of: it is plain it cannot be the visible moon, or anything like the visible moon, or that which I see, which is only a round, luminous plane of about thirty visible points in diameter. For in case I am carried from the place where I stand directly towards the moon, it is manifest the object varies, still as I go on; and by the time that I am advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth,...", "...to kill his wife, And spoil his servants.

Paulus was not reckoned wealthy for a senator, but his estate was valued at sixty talents, nearly L15,000, or $75,000. In other words, the daily interest of his capital was fifteen dollars, enough to purchase one hundred and eighty bushels of wheat--as much as a farmer could raise in a year on eight jugera--a farm as large as that of Cincinnatus. Each of the daughters of Scipio received as a dowry <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> talents, or $60,000. The value of this sum, in our money, when measured by the scale of wheat, or oil, or wine--allowing wheat now to be worth five shillings sterling a bushel--against fivepence in those times, would make gold twelve times more valuable then than now. And hence, Scipio left each of his daughters a sum equal to $720,000 of our money. In estimating the fortune of a Roman, by the prices charged at an inn per day, a penny would go further then than a dollar would...", "...Arab vessel, to replace one which he said had been wrecked. This new one was fifty feet long, twelve feet broad, and five feet deep. The planks were of a wood like teak, here called Timbati, and the timbers of a closer grained wood called Msoro. The sight of this dhow gave us a hint which, had we previously received it, would have prevented our attempting to carry a vessel of iron past the Cataracts. The trees around Katosa's village were Timbati, and they would have yielded planks <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet long and thirty inches broad. With a few native carpenters a good vessel could be built on the Lake nearly as quickly as one could be carried past the Cataracts, and at a vastly less cost.

Every exertion has been made to overcome the difficulty of navigating the Missouri with the power of steam; but all will not do. The current of that river, from the immense quantity of sand moving down with the water, is too powerful for any boat yet constructed. The loss either to the government or to the contractor will be very great. Small steamboats of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> tons burden, with proper engines, would, I think, have done much better. Boats like those employed, of twenty to thirty feet beam, and six to eight feet draught of water, must have _uncommon_ power to be propelled up a river, every pint of whose water is equal in weight to a quart of Ohio water, and moves with a velocity hardly credible.

Their pay, one with another, is four dollars per mensem. The mines are rented from the rajah at the rate of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> bunkals of gold per mine per annum, beside a capitation tax of three dollars per head on every Chinaman. There are thirty thousand Chinese in the Sambas districts, and they feel themselves strong enough to oppose or evade this tax; it hence becomes a perpetual contest between greedy extortion on the one side, and avaricious chicane on the other; there are beside about twelve thousand Malays and Dayers. The Laurat gold mines are situated to the eastward of the town of Sambas,...", "...On this human plane most things are learned by imitation. What language would the child speak if it were never allowed to hear spoken language? It would never be anything but \"An infant crying in the night. And with no language but a cry.\" There are but few original thinkers on earth at any one time. The rest are imitators and none too perfect at that. We are imitators in everything from religion to breakfast foods. Few of us ever have an original idea. We trail along from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> to a hundred years behind those we are trying to imitate. When there is little else but imitation going on in the world why deny it to vocal students? The argument against imitation can come from but two classes of people--those who cannot produce a good tone and those who are more interested in how the tone is made than in the tone itself. The following are the qualities the teacher undertakes to develop in the student in preparing him for artistic singing. They are...", "...which may be described as a series of cupshaped plates dipping in the water at the end of a trail rope. By means of controlling cords worked from the car, the whole series of plates could be turned at an angle to the direction of the wind, by which the balloon's course would be altered. Count de la Vaulx attempted this grand journey on October 12th, starting from Toulon with the intention of reaching Algiers, taking the precaution, however, of having a cruiser in attendance. When <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles out from Marseilles a passing steamer received from the balloon the signal, \"All's well\"; but the wind had veered round to the east, and, remaining persistently in this quarter, the Count abandoned his venture, and, signalling to the cruiser, succeeded in alighting on her deck, not, however, before he had completed the splendid and record voyage of 41 hours' duration.

We did not move from our camp until ten, A.M., owing to the delay necessary in crossing the river. The cavalry accompanying us commenced crossing early in the morning, and at ten, the Twelfth were ordered to fall in. After a march of a mile, we came upon the edge of the river, at the place of crossing, in time to see the last of the cavalry pass over. The river at this place was, perhaps, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> rods in width, and the convenience for crossing were two scows, in each of which forty men could be taken over at once, and so shaped that our teams could drive on or off at either end. The river was not deep at this place, and the mode of propelling was by pushing with poles. Some very amusing incidents occurred in connection with our passing over the Kentucky River. Some of the teams, consisting of a government wagon and four mules each, were in readiness, and crossed at the...", "...went down that to its mouth. \"And now, one last touch to show what nerve those captains really had.

Clark had left twenty men, the Indian girl and her baby, and they had <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> horses.

They certainly had good luck in getting together. \"On that same day, Sergeant Ordway took six boats and nine men and started down the Missouri to meet Lewis at the Great Falls, or the mouth of the Marias.

Morning and evening she went to the Rue de la Goutte-d'Or to look at the shop, which was still to be let; and she would hide herself as though she were committing some childish prank unworthy of a grown-up person. This shop was beginning to turn her brain. At night-time, when the light was out she experienced the charm of some forbidden pleasure by thinking of it with her eyes open. She again made her calculations; two hundred and fifty francs for the rent, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> francs for utensils and moving, one hundred francs in hand to keep them going for a fortnight--in all five hundred francs at the very lowest figure. If she was not continually thinking of it aloud, it was for fear she should be suspected of regretting the savings swallowed up by Coupeau's illness. She often became quite pale, having almost allowed her desire to escape her and catching back her words, quite confused as though she had been thinking of something wicked.

At their feet--perhaps a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet down--the blue-green waves lapped the shore in the afternoon breeze, and on the horizon, across the thirty or forty miles of fresh water, the south shore of the lake could be dimly seen in a summer haze.

Here messengers welcome them forward, women singing, tom-tom beating, urchins stealing fearful glances through the woods. The trail ends at a fort with triple palisades of high trees, walls separated by ditches and roofed for defense, with one carefully guarded narrow gate. Inside are fifty large wigwams, the oblong bark houses of the Huron-Iroquois, each <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet long, with the public square in the center, or what we would call the courtyard. It needs no trick of fancy to call up the scene--the winding of the trumpet through the forest silence, the amazement of the Indian drummers, the arrested frenzy of the dancers, the sunrise turning burnished armor to fire, the clanking of swords, {17} the wheeling of the soldiers as they fall in place, helmets doffed, round the council fire!

The successful founding of a considerable colony in Brazil aroused interest at home, and many courtiers solicited the Crown for grants. It was decided to partition the whole coast into feudal fiefs, each proprietor undertaking the expenses of colonisation and being given virtually sovereign powers in return for a tax on the expected production. Each of these \"captaincies\" measured <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> leagues along the coast, and extended indefinitely into the interior. In 1534 twelve such fiefs were created, covering the whole coast from the mouth of the Amazon to the island of Santa Catharina--these being the points where the Tordesillas line met the seaboard. Six of these proprietors succeeded in establishing permanent colonies. Martim Affonso's settlement has already been described. In 1536 his brother, Pero Lopes, established Santo Amaro within a few miles of Sao...", "...haste to have done, she sought to explain that, without the necessary preparations, there could be no concert; without a concert Miss Ellis could not be known; without being known, how could she procure any more scholars? and without procuring scholars, how avoid being reduced again to the same pitiable state, as that from which Miss Arbe had had the pleasure to extricate her? And, in short, to save further loss of time, she owned that it was too late to make any change, as the whole <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds was entirely spent. It was not, now, chagrin alone, nor disappointment, nor anxiety, that the speaking features of Ellis exhibited; indignation had a strong portion of their expression; but Miss Arbe awaited not the remonstrance that they announced: more courteous, while more embarrassed, she took Ellis by the hand, and caressingly said, 'Lady Aurora knows--for I have written to her ladyship myself,--that every smiling is laid out for your benefit;--only we must have a...", "...but if the lightning, as frequently happens, has severed the crown of a proud tree, and let in the sunlight, or split a giant down to its roots, or scorched it dead, or a tornado has been uprooting a few trees, then the race for air and light has caused a multitude of baby trees to rush upward--crowded, crushing, and treading upon and strangling one another, until the whole is one impervious bush. But the average forest is a mixture of these scenes. There will probably be groups of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> trees standing like columns of a cathedral, grey and solemn in the twilight, and in the midst there will be a naked and gaunt patriarch, bleached white, and around it will have grown a young community, each young tree clambering upward to become heir to the area of light and sunshine once occupied by the sire.

This fortress, together with Dubno, farther south on the Ikwa, a tributary of the Styr, and with Rovno itself formed a very powerful triangle of permanent fortifications erected by Russia in very recent times.

Ten yards away another, much smaller, but growing upon an exposed, rocky point, was no higher than my head, yet I counted five hundred and seven rings; for half a thousand years it had stood at its post. I found the counting of these annual rings extremely difficult, as they were so dense that it was hard to distinguish them and they averaged from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> to a hundred rings to an inch of thickness, but the small magnifying glass I carried made it possible. The most striking thing I discovered about the timberline trees was their irregularity. There was no similarity of form, as prevails among trees of the deep forest.

After dinner, I made a little expedition in my boat along the coast to the south-ward, accompanied by some of the gentlemen: At the different places we touched at, we collected eighteen pigs; and I believe, might have got more.

It was Hayes's intention to remain on the island till a passing sperm-whaler called there, and then charter her to take the ship's company and all the rest of the traders and natives to either Providence Island or Samoa. In a month quite a town had been built, and a great sea wall of coral stones built to keep the sea from encroaching on the northern side. Standing apart from the rest of the houses was Captain Hayes's dwelling-house--an enormous structure, a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet long and fifty wide. Here he ruled in state, and from his door watched his boats, manned by their savage crews, pulling to and fro on their mission of collecting coco-nuts. These, as soon as the boats touched the stone wharf he had built on the west side of the sea-wall, were carried up to the \"Plaza\" of the town, where they were quickly husked by women, who threw them to others to break open and scrape the white flesh into a pulp. This was then placed in slanting troughs to...", "...thousand unexampled demands are pressing us on every side. If the Prayer Book is not enriched with a view to meeting those demands, it is not for lack of materials. A Saturday reviewer has tried to fasten on the Church of England the stigma of being the Church which for the space of two centuries has not been able to evolve a fresh prayer. If the reproach were just it would be stinging indeed; but it is most cruelly unjust. In the devotional literature of the Anglicanism of the last <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, to go no further back, there may be found prayers fully equal in compass of thought and depth of feeling to any of those that are already in public use. Not to single out too many instances, it may suffice to mention the prayers appended to the book of Ancient Collects edited a few years since by a distinguished Oxford scholar. The clergy are acquainted with them, and know how beautiful they are. Why should not the whole Church enjoy the happiness of using them?[97] Why is...", "...serious enemies of the potato. It is needless to say that the ground must be kept clean by thorough cultivation until the vines take full possession of the field. In harvesting, extreme care should be used to avoid cutting and bruising the potato, since bruises are as dangerous to a sweet potato as to an apple, and render decay almost a certainty. Lay aside all bruised potatoes for immediate use. For shipment the potatoes should be graded and packed with care. An extra outlay of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents a barrel often brings a return of a dollar a barrel in the market. One fact often neglected by Southern growers who raise potatoes for a Northern market is that the Northern markets demand a potato that will cook dry and mealy, and that they will not accept the juicy, sugary potato so popular in the South. The storage of sweet potatoes presents difficulties owing to their great tendency to decay under the influence of the ever-present fungi and bacteria. This tendency can...", "...find an overseer endeavoring in every way to overreach the apprentices, taking away the privileges which they enjoyed during slavery, and exacting from them the utmost minute and mite of labor, there you will find abundant complaints both against the master and the apprentice. And the reverse. The cruel overseers are complaining of idleness, insubordination, and ruin, while the kind master is moving on peaceably and prosperously. 12. The domestic apprentices have either one day, or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents cash, each week, as an allowance for food and clothing. This is quite insufficient. Many of the females seem obliged to resort to theft or to prostitution to obtain a support. Two girls were brought before Mr. Hill while we were with him, charged with neglect of duty and night-walking. One of them said her allowance was too small, and she must get food in some other way or starve. 13.

The same regulations applied to boats and vessels passing from one town to another. Compare that bill with the one under debate.

From these I prepared most artistically, a strong, delicious drink. I mixed with it, finally, one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> drops of opium that I took from the medicine chest. The dose was rather large, but I had to do, not with men, but with beasts. After I had poured it all into a large bowl, I carried it to the captain, who immediately took ten or twelve spoons full of it, and was quite delighted; I told him that he might drink as much of it as he pleased. \"Well,\" he said, kindly, \"since you are so skilful, go and get two dozen bottles of Bordeaux; you can share them with the officers.\" I...", "...at haphazard; and he thought it would be a good work for the State to make use of all accessible data of this kind at once in constructing a model of the rocky floor of the region under review.

Another contribution of Professor Orton's which may appropriately be given special notice is his part of the article on Ohio in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, in which a succinct, clear, and comprehensive account of the geology of the whole State is given, with its salient features delineated so sharply that one may almost conceive from it a definite geological picture of the region.

It is true there is a sort of morose, detracting, ill-bred people who pretend utterly to disrelish these polite innovations. And as to the similitude from diet, they allow the parallel, but are so bold as to pronounce the example itself a corruption and degeneracy of taste. They tell us that the fashion of jumbling <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> things together in a dish was at first introduced in compliance to a depraved and debauched appetite, as well as to a crazy constitution, and to see a man hunting through an olio after the head and brains of a goose, a widgeon, or a woodcock, is a sign he wants a stomach and digestion for more substantial victuals. Further, they affirm that digressions in a book are like foreign troops in a state, which argue the nation to want a heart and hands of its own, and often either...", "...that when unstrung bends back past the straight line is termed reflexed. One that continues to bend toward the belly is said to follow the string. A lateral deviation is called a cast in the bow.

The weight of a hunting bow should be from fifty to eighty pounds. One should start shooting with a bow not over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds, and preferably under that. At the end of a season's shooting he can command a bow of sixty pounds if he is a strong man. Our average bows pull seventy-five pounds. Though it is possible for some of us to shoot an eighty-five pound bow, such a weapon is not under proper control for constant use.

Early in the month of February a particularly exciting action was fought between a large party of the 10th (Western Canada) Battalion and an equally numerous party of Germans. It had been decided to creep up, cut the German barbed wire, and bomb their front-line trenches. Lieut. Kent and Sergeant Milne, of the 10th, with two privates, succeeded in cutting the wire, and were joined by a column of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men. While waiting immediately in front of the German trench for the best opportunity of bombing the enemy positions, a patrol of thirty or forty Germans stumbled across them from the flank. A fierce medley in the dark followed, the Germans attacking with bombs and revolvers, and our men with grenades, bayonets, and knobkerries.[3] The enemy machine-guns took the alarm and fired blindly into the scrimmage.

The first year of his Eastern sojourn was salaried in a sum which took the souls of all his young contemporaries with wonder, if no baser passion, in the days when dollars were of so much farther flight than now, but its net result in a literary return to his publishers was one story and two or three poems.

For a good five minutes the mad chase went on, up the bank, through the bushes, over rocks and stumps, through the deep woods,--but never more than forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards distant from the dead rabbit. The mink kept always some ten or fifteen feet ahead of his furious pursuer, and felt quite at ease as to the outcome, because aware that he had the brook at hand as a safe refuge in case of need.

It is just to the Minister to add, that Captain Dashmore had shown as little regard for orders from a distance, as had immortalized Nelson himself; but then the disobedience had not achieved the same redeeming success as that of Nelson, and Captain Dashmore ought to have thought himself fortunate in escaping a severer treatment than the loss of promotion.

This method is very unlike that employed in the Philippines, and the natives of the islands need have no fear of Indian competition under such conditions.

It was usual for a Roman statesman, after filling the office of praetor or consul, to undertake for a year or more the government of one of the provinces. These appointments were indeed the prizes of the profession of politics. The new governor had a magnificent outfit from the treasury. We hear of as much as one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand pounds having been allowed for this purpose. Out of this something might easily be economized. Indeed we hear of one governor who left the whole of his allowance put out at interest in Rome. And in the province itself splendid gains might be, and indeed commonly were, got. Even Cicero, who, if we may trust his own account of his proceedings, was exceptionally just, and not only just, but even generous in his dealings with the provincials, made, as we have seen, the very...", "...prisons below are hewn out of the rock itself. Up to what we should call the third story, every room is vaulted. Above that the floors are laid on beams, and the walls are not more than eight feet thick--comparatively flimsy for such a place!

Nothing can give any idea of the crookedness of it all, of the small dark corridors, the narrow winding steps, the dusky inclined ascents, paved with broad flagstones that echo the lightest tread, and that must have rung and roared like sea caves to the tramp of armed men. And so it was in the cities, too. In Rome, bits of the old strongholds survive still. There were more of them thirty years ago. Even the more modern palaces of the late Renascence are built...", "...however, squatters had invaded the country, and tried to force the Indians west of the Mississippi. Particularly envious were these whites of the lands at the mouth of the Rock River, where the ancient village and burial place of the Sacs stood, and where they came each year to raise corn. Black Hawk had resisted their encroachments, and many violent acts had been committed on both sides. Finally, however, the squatters, in spite of the fact that the line of settlement was still <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles away, succeeded in evading the real meaning of the treaty and in securing a survey of the desired land at the mouth of the river. Black Hawk, exasperated and broken-hearted at seeing his village violated, persuaded himself that the village had never been sold--indeed, that land could not be sold: \"My reason teaches me,\" he wrote, \"that land cannot be sold. The Great Spirit gave it to his children to live upon, and cultivate, as far as is necessary for their...", "...So I didn't mind anything about her till Eupolia began to grow, and I came to think about going into trading again.

With the _Miraflores_ steaming along in his wake, in the same formation as that adopted by the gun-running steamers, Jim started off on his search for the _Union_, heading west-south-west for the mouth of the Straits of Magellan, with a man at either masthead of each of the two vessels, and a prize of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> _pesos_ to the seaman who should first sight her. He did not feel altogether happy at the idea of sailing under the Peruvian flag and adopting such a ruse, even for a short period; but his orders to capture or sink the _Union_ were precise and imperative, and he considered that, in this case at least, the end justified the means employed, for he knew that he would never succeed in getting alongside the corvette if her captain were once allowed to entertain the slightest...", "...Russian campaign. _January_ 28.--Continued my reading with the commentary of the D. of W.[456] If his broad shoulders cannot carry me through, the devil must be in the dice.

I have taken refuge in a little hamlet <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles away, where there are thirteen peasant cabins. The house which I inhabit was a tiny priory, occupied once by a single monk.\" And after a very long and profoundly pessimistic discourse upon the sad condition of affairs which he likens to the barbarity which formerly engulfed Greece and Egypt and Assyria, Sicily, and Italy, he terminates thus: \"Adieu my good friend, I would have wished to have talked to you of yourself, of your family, of those whom you love, the regrets...", "...Amen. ADDRESS BY MR. EDWARD W. SHELDON MR. SHELDON It is with profound gratification that the Governors welcome your generous presence to-day on an occasion which means so much to us and which has perhaps some general significance.

A summary of its origin and development may be appropriate. A hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ago the only institutions on this side of the Atlantic which cared for mental diseases were the Pennsylvania Hospital, chartered in 1751, a private general hospital which had accommodations for a few mental cases, and the Eastern State Hospital for the insane, at Williamsburg, Virginia, a public institution incorporated in 1768. No other one of the thirteen Colonies had a hospital of any kind, general or special. With a view of remedying this deplorable lack in New York,...", "...coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old \"Admiral Benbow.\" CHAPTER XXIV THE CRUISE OF THE CORACLE It was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the southwest end of Treasure Island. The sun was up, but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs. Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land. That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself, if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags....", "...open----\" \"That's my affair,\" said Mr. Sheldrake warmly. \"It happens to be mine as well.

Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he had written after it on his card, \"just out of Smithfield, and close by the coach-office.\" Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if he were going to take me <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles. His getting on his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation. I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was, and...", "...The judges occupied the front of the coach. I had a seat among the insignificant people at the back. On the whole, I was content to sit behind. The proceedings, in the streets of Ahmednugger, were distinctly exciting--almost too exciting, I felt, for me.

Mr. Colson and Mr. Johns, each with his eight horses, and a coach load of passengers, went down those streets at full speed, as if they had been <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards wide, and as if there had not been a soul in sight. What damages were done, and what was the list of the killed and wounded, I have never been informed. I never quite realized what it meant to belong to a subject race, till then. It appeared to me that, in the eyes of my companions, a native had, as a matter of course, no rights at all. We drove over whole streets full of them, in style. My heart was in my mouth most of the time. We dashed round impossible corners, shaking...", "...as the gazelle. FOSSIL FOOTPRINTS. There are three superimposed masses of gypsum in the neighbourhood of Paris, separated by intervening deposits of laminated marl. In the uppermost of the three, in the valley of Montmorency, M. Desnoyers discovered in 1859 many footprints of animals occurring at no less than six different levels. (Sur des Empreintes de Pas d'Animaux par M. J. Desnoyers. Compte rendu de l'Institut 1859.) The gypsum to which they belong varies from thirty to <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet in thickness, and is that which has yielded to the naturalist the largest number of bones and skeletons of mammalia, birds, and reptiles. I visited the quarries, soon after the discovery was made known, with M.

The form of it was a circle two hundred and sixteen feet in circumference at the base, and composed of sixteen large cottonwood poles about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> feet long, and at their thicker ends, which touched the ground, about the size of a man's body: they were distributed at equal distances, except that one was omitted to the east, probably for the entrance.

But now, let me speak to the second proposition of my two-headed thesis, viz., that war _ought_ not to be abolished, if such an abolition were even possible. _Prima facie_, it seems a dreadful doctrine to claim a place for war as amongst the evils that are salutary to man; but conscientiously I hold it to be such.

It is true that everything combines to give them a frightful appearance in battle; their somber costume, their strange evolutions, the shrill sound of their trumpets, make them resemble, seen in the midst of the smoke, a legion of unchained devils. When the Arabs saw them advancing on the run they took flight. The chasseurs have a terrible weapon. Their rifles, which are loaded with oblong balls, pierce a board <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> millimeters in thickness at a distance of more than a quarter of a mile; and as all the chasseurs are excellent marksmen, they make frightful havoc in the enemy's ranks.

CHAPTER VI PONIES Next morning the Captain decided that he had various affairs to attend to, so we put on our riding clothes and went down to the stables. The Captain had always forty or <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> polo ponies in the course of education, and he was delighted to have them ridden, once he was convinced of your seat and hands. They were beautiful ponies, generally iron gray in colour, very friendly, very eager, and very lively. Riding them was like flying through the air, for they sailed over rough ground, irrigation checks, and the like without a break in their stride, and without a jar. By the same token it was necessary to ride them. At odd moments they were quite likely to...", "...to whom we have above referred, and with whom Mr. Edison entered into close confidential relations, so that the inventions made were held jointly, under a partnership deed covering \"any inventions or improvements that may be useful or desired in automatic telegraphy.\" Mr. Harrington was assured at the outset by Edison that while the Little perforator would give on the average only seven or eight words per minute, which was not enough for commercial purposes, he could devise one giving <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty words, and that while the Little solution for the receiving tape cost $15 to $17 per gallon, he could furnish a ferric solution costing only five or six cents per gallon. In every respect Edison \"made good,\" and in a short time the system was a success, \"Mr. Little having withdrawn his obsolete perforator, his ineffective resistance, his costly chemical solution, to give place to Edison's perforator, Edison's resistance and devices, and Edison's solution costing a few...", "...steam engines, which gave 20 h.p. each and drew the machine through the air by means of two 4-bladed screws. The craft was controlled by altering the inclination of its wings, and also by a rudder, the pilot sitting in a carriage below the planes. In 1890, after its inventor had spent a large sum of money, the machine--which, unlike those of Phillips and Maxim, ran upon wheels and was free to rise--did actually make a flight, or rather a leap into the air, covering a distance of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards. But then, on coming into contact with the ground again, it was wrecked. Ader's experiments were regarded by the French Government as being so important that he received a grant equalling L20,000 to assist him in continuing his tests; and this goes to show how, even from the first, the French nation was--by reason of its enthusiasm and imagination--able to appreciate what its inventors were striving to attain, and eager to encourage them in their quest. For just an opposite...", "...to the harbour were surrendered.\" The information upon which Seymour proposed to act was partly a declaration made by Lieutenant Dorrien, of the _Invincible_, and which (omitting immaterial parts) was as follows:-- \"On the morning of the 9th day of July, 1882, at about 7.30 a.m., I drove through the Rosetta Gate, and ... reached the old quarantine station, where I ... proceeded on foot to the fort marked on Admiralty Chart 'Tabia-el-Silsileh,' and when within <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards of the said fort I observed inside two working parties of Arabs about 200 strong, under the superintendence of soldiers, parbuckling two smooth-bore guns--apparently 32-pounders--towards their respective carriages and slides, which were facing in the direction of the harbour, and which seemed to have been lately placed ready for their reception.\" On the 10th, the Admiralty telegraphed to the Admiral directing him to substitute for the word...", "...deepening distances against the departure of light grew faint, and prominent points became obscure, and lines retired into masses, while Carne maintained his dreary watch, with his mood becoming darker. As the sound of joyful voices, and of good-will doubled by good fare, came to his unfed vigil from the open windows of the dining-room, his heart was not enlarged at all, and the only solace for his lips was to swear at British revelry. For the dining-room was at the western end, some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards away from him, and its principal window faced the sunset, but his lurking-place afforded a view of the southern casements obliquely. Through these he had seen that the lamps were brought, and heard the increase of merry noise, the clapping of hands, and the jovial cheers at the rising of the popular Marquis. At last he saw a white kerchief waved at the window nearest to him, the window of the Admiral's little study, which opened like a double door upon the eastern...", "...is house policy--sound policy--to encourage employees to look out not only for the store's interest, but for their own. An ambitious salesman is indeed an asset; and there are ways of keeping him ambitious. There is, for instance, the system of bonuses for punctuality, which takes the final form of extra holidays in the summertime. A week's holiday with pay is given without fail to each and every employee of eight months' standing. But a record of good attendance and punctuality for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> long weeks brings another week of vacation, also with full pay. Department-stores not so long ago used to penalize their workers for tardiness. The new Macy plan works best, however. The list of those bonus possibilities is long. There is, of course, chief amongst them, the bonus which takes the concrete form of a sales commission. The salesclerk is set a moderate quota for his or her week's work. On sales that reach above this figure he or she is paid a percentage commission....", "...extinction, and yet not daring to leave it, they sought a refuge in this underground place, of which, as it chanced, one of their brethren had the secret. This he had inherited from his father, so that it was known to no other living man.

These preparations being made, the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> of them who remained removed themselves to the vaults where now they had already dwelt three months, and here, so far as was possible, continued to practise the rules of their order. Miriam asked how they kept their health in this darkness, to which they replied that sometimes they went out by that path which she had just followed, and mingled with the people in the city, returning to their hole at night. Ithiel and his companion were on such a journey when they found her. Also...", "...at Sunium, in which several of the most eminent Athenians were embarked for the festival of Apollo; nor could the sanctity of the voyage preserve the captives from the ignominy of irons. The Athenians resolved upon revenge, and a civil dissension in Aegina placed it in their power.

With twenty ships from Corinth, and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> of their own, the Athenians invaded Aegina; but, having been delayed in making the adequate preparations, they arrived a day later than had been stipulated. Nicodromus fled; the oligarchy restored, took signal and barbarous vengeance upon such of their insurgent countrymen as fell into their hands. Meanwhile, the Athenian fleet obtained a victory at sea, and the war still continued. XVIII.

Then to the express car I hurried, for the train would soon start; but again, I was met with a rebuff. There were no stores in sight, and few houses. Surely Grand River Junction would be a most dismal place to get left in, especially in my condition--only <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents, and that borrowed money. In desperation I ran to the front part of the engine. In the intense darkness, both fireman and engineer failed to observe a silent form spring upon the cow-catcher. The wheels began to revolve, and barring all accidents, I was due to reach Pensacola in time for dinner. Being thinly dressed and facing the damp night winds at a fifty-mile an hour rate is certainly not an enviable position. In a short time my body was so benumbed with cold...", "...full distance of this ride is 41 miles. ~Tour Three from Waterford.~ Proceeding up the Cork road we ride up Ballyaneeshagh Hill, and on the left see Butlerstown Castle, an ancient building: which, in the days of Cromwell, held out for sometime against his forces.

The whole number of magnitudes recorded are _sixteen_, of which the first six only are visible to the naked eye; the rest are _telescopic stars_. These magnitudes are not determined by any very definite scale, but are merely ranked according to their relative degrees of brightness, and this is left in a great measure to the decision of the eye alone. The brightest stars, to the number of fifteen or twenty, are considered as stars of the first magnitude; the <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty next brightest, of the second magnitude; the next two hundred, of the third magnitude; and thus the number of each class increases rapidly, as we descend the scale, so that no less than fifteen or twenty thousand are included within the first seven magnitudes.

We should have guessed much more, but labor and stone are cheap in Ireland; such a structure could hardly have been erected in America for less than half a million dollars. \"And where did all the money come from?\" for Nenagh shows little evidence of wealth. \"O, they have been long in raising it and much of it came from America.\" [Illustration: ANCIENT ORATORY, KILLALOE.] The church inside is hardly in keeping with the exterior, but this will no doubt...", "...Stormont asked. \"You bet!\" said the other, giving the clerk a patronizing smile. \"This young fellow is surely a sport.

I certainly put the marker out. He allowed I couldn't hold my cue and was going to cut the cloth. Why, I'd play any man in this old town for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars!\" \"And beat him!\" said Stormont. \"Watson told me how you play. But won't you sit down and take a smoke.\" \"I surely will,\" Drummond replied, and pulling up an easy chair, put his wet snow-boots on Stormont's bed, after which he lighted a cigar. \"Now,\" he resumed, \"if you have anything to say to me, you can go ahead.\" \"You're a store clerk, I think. It's a poor job making a profit for another man and Watson tells me you are enterprising.

They had done duty in the convent at Santa Inez, and the monastery of Santa Barbara, and had been brought hither in Governor Micheltorrenas' time to keep the daughters of Robles from the insidious contact of the outer world, when they took the air in their cloistered pleasance.

The first thing I did when I got the letter with the money was to order a foot tub for each floor, slippers for the patients when they are in the house, scissors for the pharmacy and for each floor, and various other small things that I have been longing for and that will save many steps. Now that the capacity of the hospital has been increased by <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> beds, it is more difficult than ever to get money from the general fund for things of that kind; it really has to be kept for food and heating. We also need instruments and basins, etc., for a table for dressings in the new ward, as we have absolutely nothing. Then it is so nice to have a fund that we can draw on in case of need. Sometimes the men are terribly poor and cannot afford to get anything for themselves when they leave.

It was again very unequal--perhaps more so than the earlier volume, though it went higher and oftener high. But the author became dissatisfied with it very shortly after its appearance in the month of October, and withdrew it when, as is said, less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> copies had been sold. One may perhaps not impertinently doubt whether the critical reason, _v. infra_--in itself a just and penetrating one, as well as admirably expressed--which, in the Preface of the 1853 collection, the poet gave for its exclusion (save in very small part) from that volume tells the whole truth. At any rate, I think most good judges quarrel with _Empedodes_, not because the situation is unmanageable, but because the poet has not managed it. The contrast, in...", "...elements, and the wind rose and blew with terrific force, while the rain poured down as if the flood-gates of heaven were indeed opened. The lightning was so vivid, that for the second that it lasted you could see the country round to the horizon almost as clear as day; the next moment all was terrific gloom accompanied by the stunning reports of the thunder, which caused every article in the waggons, and the waggons themselves, to vibrate from the concussion. A large tree, not <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards from the caravan, was struck by the lightning, and came down with an appalling crash. The Caffres had all roused up, and had sheltered themselves under the waggons. The Hottentots had also begun to move, but had not yet recovered their senses--indeed, they were again stupified by the clamour of the elements.

And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin. There came against the land Tiglath-pileser the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Tiglath-pileser a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.

Daniel Poe was the leader of the wagon train, but Henry Ware, whom they had known but a few days, was its leader in battle. \"Take <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> men,\" he said to Ross, \"the best marksmen and the stanchest fighters, and cross there. Then come silently among the thickets up the bank, to strike them when they strike us.\" Paul listened with admiration. He knew Henry's genius for battle, and, like the others, he was inspired by his comrade's confidence. The fifty men were quickly told off behind the wagons, and, headed by Tom Ross and Jim Hart, they disappeared at once in the woods. Shif'less Sol remained with Henry and...", "...returned, for the envoys sent by the latter spoke to him thus: \"These strangers are invincible. If you treat them kindly, they are amiable, but if you resist them, they turn hard and cruel.

It was the same treatment that had been extended to Poncha. After concluding peace with Coquera, Vasco returned to the country of Chiapes.

Malta got great praise for this, and I never knew of her catching a bird afterward. She was well fed in the house, and had no need to hurt such harmless creatures. She was very fond of her home, and never went far away, as Jim and I did. Once, when Willie was going to spend a few weeks with a little friend who lived <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> miles from Fairport, he took it into his head that Malta should go with him. His mother told him that cats did not like to go away from home; but he said he would be good to her, and begged so hard to take her, that at last his mother consented. He had been a few days in this place, when he wrote home to say that Malta had run away. She had seemed very unhappy, and though he had kept her with him all the time, she had acted as if she wanted to get away.

He knew that he was their idol, and by a rare exception this knowledge did not spoil him, for he had such joy in loving, so much affection to spread far and wide that it seemed only natural that he should be loved in return; he was really like an elderly child. After a life of ungilded mediocrity he had but recently come to be known, and though the one experience had not given him pain, he delighted in the other. He was over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> without seeming to be aware of it, for if there were some white threads in his big fair moustache,--like an ancient Gaul's,--his heart was as young as those of his children. Instead of going with the stream of his generation, he met each new wave; the best of life to him was the spring of youth constantly renewed, and he never troubled about the contradictions into which he was led by this spirit always in reaction against that which had preceded it. These inconsistencies were...", "...But don't be worried--everything's for the best.\" He patted the pale hand reassuringly, inclined himself affectionately, but Mr. Carteret was not easily soothed. He had practised lucidity all his life, had expected it of others and had never given his assent to an indistinct proposition. He was weak, yet not too weak to recognise that he had formed a calculation now vitiated by a wrong factor--put his name to a contract of which the other side had not been carried out. More than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years of conscious success pressed him to try to understand; he had never muddled his affairs and he couldn't muddle them now. At the same time he was aware of the necessity of economising his effort, and he would gather that inward force, patiently and almost cunningly, for the right question and the right induction. He was still able to make his agitation reflective, and it could still consort with his high hopes of Nick that he should find himself regarding mere vague, verbal...", "...goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter. http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03 Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90 Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want, as it appears in our Newsletters.

It was an absurdly easy stroke, and the Bishop's uncle took it with an absurd amount of conceit and carelessness. Hardly troubling to aim, he struck...", "...as the idol of his followers and as provisional dictator, Thiers dreading lest civil war might be kindled by the decision of his rival. Hardly less anxious were the days while a general election was going on. Bordeaux remained feverish and excited till February 13, when deputies from all parts of France met to decide their country's fate in the Bordeaux theatre. Notabilities from foreign countries were also there, to see what would be done at that supreme moment. Seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> deputies had been sent to the Assembly, and it was clear from the beginning that that body was not Republican. But the Anti-Republicans were divided into three parties,--Imperialists, Legitimists, and Orleanists, each of which preferred an orderly and moderate republic to the triumph of either of the other two. Moreover, that was not the time for deliberations concerning a permanent form of government. The deputies were met to make a temporary or provisional government, qualified...", "...his loyalty to the House of Hanover. CHAPTER IV YEAR 1763 The An. Dom. 1763, was, in many a respect, a memorable year, both in public and in private. The King granted peace to the French, and Charlie Malcolm, that went to sea in the Tobacco trader, came home to see his mother. The ship, after being at America, had gone down to Jamaica, an island in the West Indies, with a cargo of live lumber, as Charlie told me himself, and had come home with more than a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> hoggits of sugar, and sixty-three puncheons full of rum; for she was, by all accounts, a stately galley, and almost two hundred tons in the burthen, being the largest vessel then sailing from the creditable town of Port-Glasgow. Charlie was not expected; and his coming was a great thing to us all, so I will mention the whole particulars. One evening, towards the gloaming, as I was taking my walk of meditation, I saw a brisk sailor laddie coming towards me. He had a pretty...", "...then made up so much of the daily business of life, political and private, and lay at the bottom of the terrible convulsion then existing in the Netherlands. We turn from it with a shudder, reminding the reader only how persistently the statesman then on his trial had advocated conciliation, moderation, and kindness between brethren of the Reformed Church who were not able to think alike on one of the subtlest and most mysterious problems that casuistry has ever propounded. For <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, he said, he had been an enemy of all compulsion of the human conscience. He had always opposed rigorous ecclesiastical decrees. He had done his best to further, and did not deny having inspired, the advice given in the famous letters from the King of Great Britain to the States in 1613, that there should be mutual toleration and abstinence from discussion of disputed doctrines, neither of them essential to salvation. He thought that neither Calvin nor Beza would have...", "...put all the Vaudois they should find there to the sword; although they were included in the promise of Pianezza, \"that no harm should befall them.\" This band of assassins had reached the summit of Mont Rummer, from whence they were about to rush down upon Rora, when they were perceived by Joshua Janavel, who had retired there for refuge. With only seven others he took up an advantageous position, and falling upon the enemy with great spirit, forced them to retire; killing no less than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> in the pursuit. On the news of this defeat, the Marquis sent to say that these troops had not acted under his orders, and were robbers, whose destruction he was pleased to hear of. On the very next day, Pianezza, notwithstanding, sent 600 men to make another attack, by the hill of Cassulet. Janavel was again fortunate enough to discover them from a distance, and assembled twelve men, armed with pistols and cutlasses, muskets, or slings. This feeble force he divided, and placing a...", "...He doesn't get the civility of Mr. here in Askatoon,\" interposed Kitty. Mona made an impatient gesture. \"If you will listen, I want to tell you about Mr. Crozier's money. He thinks he has no money, but he has. He has a good deal.\" She paused, and the Young Doctor and Kitty leaned forward eagerly. \"Well, but go on,\" said Kitty. \"If he has money he must have it to-day, and now. Certainly he doesn't know of it. He thinks he is broke,--dead broke,--and there'd be a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand dollars for him if he could put up ten thousand dollars to-night.

In any case I shall not be bullied.\" The Young Doctor almost laughed outright, despite the danger of the situation. He was...", "...II THE MUSICAL ROMANCE OF AMELIA A SUBTLE thrill was disturbing the atmosphere of high-bred serenity which the Misses Ryder, with a strenuousness far afield from serenity, fostered in their Select School for Young Ladies. As a matter of fact, this aristocratic calm existed only in the intent and the imaginations of the lady principals, and in the convictions of parents credulous concerning school prospectuses. With <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> girls of assorted sizes and temperaments collected under one roof agitation of one sort or another is fairly well assured. Miss Ryder's teachers were by no means blind to the excitement pervading the school, but its cause was wrapped in mystery. Amelia Bowers seemed to be occupying the centre of the stage and claiming the calcium light as her due, while Amelia's own particular clique gathered in knots in all the corners, and went about brimming over with some portentous secret...", "...the Caledonians or men of the woods,[5] whose home, as their name implies, was the great woodland region of the Mounth or Grampians.

Seventy years later, in the year 210, <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand Roman legionaries had perished in the Caledonian campaigns of the Roman Emperor Severus, and over a century and a half later, in 368, there had followed the second conquest of the Roman province of Valentia which comprised the Lothians and Galloway in the south, by Theodosius. Lastly, the final retirement of the Romans from Scotland, and indeed from Britain, took place, on the destruction of the Roman Empire in spite of Stilicho's noble defence, by Alaric and the...", "...proprietors became a charge to the descendants who endeavored to maintain them. Neglect soon came to the relief of unprofitable care; decay followed neglect. Mansions became tenantless and roofless. Trees spring in their deserted halls and wave their branches through dismantled windows. Drains filled up; the swamps returned. Parish churches in imposing styles of architecture and once attended by a goodly company in costly equipages, are now abandoned. Lands which had ready sale at <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars per acre now sell for less than five dollars; and over all these structures of wealth, with their offices of art, and over these scenes of festivity and devotion, there now hangs the pall of an unalterable gloom.\"[79] In a later essay the same writer dealt with developments in the 'fifties in more sober phrases which are corroborated by the census returns. Within the decade, he said, as many as ten thousand slaves had been drawn from Charleston by the attractive prices of...", "...day to his lonely rooms in Staple Inn, Holborn, he turned aside with his cab for a few minutes to make a passing call at the bank in Lombard Street. He was short of ready money, and wanted to cash a cheque for fifty pounds for expenses incurred in his defence at Tavistock. The cashier stared at him hard; then, without consulting anybody, he said, in a somewhat embarrassed tone, \"I don't know whether you're aware of it, Mr. Waring, but this overdraws your current account. We haven't <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds on our books to your credit.\" He was well posted on the subject, in fact, for only that morning he had hunted up Cyril's balance in the ledger at his side for the gratification of his own pure personal curiosity. Cyril stared at him in astonishment. In this age of surprises, one more surprise was thus suddenly sprung upon him. His first impulse was to exclaim in a very amazed voice, \"Why, I've six thousand odd pounds to my credit, surely;\" but he checked himself in...", "...to say about it when describing my descent. Two miles further north brought us to the beginning of the rapids, which apparently end the boat-navigation. The only canoes are used for ferrying; I saw no water-traffic, and there were no longer any fish-weirs. Moreover, the country has been deserted, I was told, since the arrival of strangers. The natives have probably been treated with little consideration. A quarter of an hour's hauling, all hands being applied to the canoe, took us about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards over the Impayim rapid, whose fall is from four to five feet deep. Immediately after the Butabue influent on the right bank the bed bends abruptly east, and we reached the far-famed rapids of that name. Here the whole surface, as far up as the eye can see, is a mass of rocks and of broken, surging water. The vegetation of the banks, bound together by creepers, llianas, and rattans, is peculiarly fine.

It was a magnificent cave, illumined by the soft, invisible light, so that everything in it could be plainly seen. The walls were of polished marble, white with veins of delicate colors running through it, and the roof was arched and fantastic and beautiful. Built beneath this vast dome was a pretty village--not very large, for there seemed not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> houses altogether--and the dwellings were of marble and artistically designed. No grass nor flowers nor trees grew in this cave, so the yards surrounding the houses carved in designs both were smooth and bare and had low walls around them to mark their boundaries. In the streets and the yards of the houses were many people all having one leg growing below their bodies and all hopping here and there whenever they moved. Even the children stood firmly upon their single legs and...", "...imagination, fiery energy, and a tactical resolution which was rare indeed in the 18th century.

Always on the march, in camps, or on the field of battle during more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years, and under the reigns of three emperors, he had scarcely passed two years together without fighting. Yet his political activity was not inconsiderable, and his advice was always sound and well-considered; while in his government of the Netherlands, which he exercised through the marquis de Prie, he set himself resolutely to oppose the many wild schemes, such as Law's Mississippi project, in which the times were so fertile. His interest in literature and art has been alluded...", "...accustomed to a daily supply of food--plain, perhaps, but sufficient--and will look for as much in the homes of their husbands. A girl like Marion Beecher does not expect to secure a position which will enable her to send her own clothes to a laundress or hire a cook who can make pastry; but it is not fair to ask her to wash the family's blankets or to boil potatoes for a pig. Probably her friends would think her lucky in marrying a curate or a dispensary doctor with one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds a year, and the prospect of one-third as much again after a while. But Hyacinth remembered that he was poorer than any curate. He determined to put the matter plainly before Marion without delay. The Rectory door was opened for him by Elsie Beecher, and, in spite of her wondering protests, Hyacinth walked into the dining-room and asked that Marion should be sent to him. The room was empty, as he expected. He stood and waited for her, deriving faint comfort and courage...", "...form most pleasing to your Majesty, or in the following mode.

Monsieur Menard was a man of about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years of age, very short and stout, and with a very fat face. He had a double chin, which was quite in harmony with a nose like a huge chestnut. Like Monsieur Tartufe, he had red ears and a florid complexion. His stomach was beginning to embarrass him a little, but his short legs, with their enormous calves, seemed strong enough to support an even heavier bulk. Monsieur Menard had passed almost the whole of his life in teaching young people; he had retained the mild and benign...", "...is the grandest railway journey in the world, but we can show them several quite as picturesque and attractive in our own beloved Rocky Mountains.

Presenting his rifle, he threatened her with instant death if she did not immediately move. Opening her neck-handkerchief she told him to shoot if he dared.

They afterwards related their adventure to one of the settlers, and said that were <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> such women as she in the settlement, the Indians never would have molested the inhabitants of the Mohawk Valley. On many subsequent occasions Mrs. Van Alstine exhibited the heroic qualities of her nature. Twice by her prudence, courage, and address, she saved the lives of her husband and family.

The French government had learned that an expedition from England was destined to seize this important halting-place on the road to India, and Suffren's first mission was to secure it. In fact, the squadron under Commodore Johnstone[168] had got away first, and had anchored at Porto Praya, in the Cape Verde Islands, a Portuguese colony, on the 11th of April. It numbered two ships-of-the-line, and three of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> guns, with frigates and smaller vessels, besides thirty-five transports, mostly armed. Without apprehension of attack, not because he trusted to the neutrality of the port but because he thought his destination secret, the English commodore had not anchored with a view to battle.

An officer, newly arrived, when the depredations were most alarming and frequent, looked from the window of his cottage, in the twilight, and discerned many blacks crouching among the stubble of a corn field lately reaped.

Another small party of soldiers observed a body of <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty, on the borders of a creek, flowing into Oyster Bay: as they were approached by the British, they made for a point of land.

How lovely! There were not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand Christian Scientists at this time, but, if each chipped in five dollars toward Mother's jackets, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars dropped into her lap. I am only giving my interpretation of Mrs. Eddy's strange request, when I say that clearly what she wanted was not tea jackets, but money to finance her very elaborate and expensive preparations to contest Mrs. Woodbury's suits.

It was apparently the perfectly normal arm that any woman over <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> might possess.

In the two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pages of this volume are more than a thousand of these gems, each worth; its setting. Dr. McKenzie says aptly of Goethe that he is able by virtue of his own genius to set more than the common man and to put his visions and his reflections in such form that others who would never have seen the tilings for themselves or been able to think deeply upon them, can have the benefit of his generous study and thought. He was many-sided. His mind took a wide range and seemed almost equally...", "...is found in the Sclavonic and Tartar dialects.

All the steam-tugs in the Harbor were moored in Gowanus bay, and each tug was rigged with a long boom projecting from her bow, on which a torpedo, containing some <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> pounds of dynamite, was carried. With the tugs, and serving as flag-ship for the squadron, was the U.S. torpedo-boat \"Alarm,\" Lieutenant-Commander H.H. Gorringe.

Under the date of August 8th \"Bread tickets\" were purchased to the amount of one dollar; and on August 30th, fifty cents worth of \"Yeast Powd'r\" was charged to their account.

The Reverend Ezekiel Gear, who was the chaplain at the fort, evidently believed that cleanliness was next to godliness, for on July 31, 1855, he paid thirty cents for a scrub brush; on August 4th, he bought a broom for <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents; on August 30th, he purchased twenty-five cents worth of starch, and on October 19th, a large broom.

Some of these were loading wine for Trieste, and it was interesting to watch the system adopted to save the difficulty of embarking the heavy casks in lighters, in the absence of cranes or winches.

Thus arranged, they were towed by boats until alongside the vessel, when they were easily hoisted up on board. As boats could not lie against the perpendicular wall of the quay except during a perfect calm, there was considerable trouble in carrying on the commerce of the port according to modern requirements; but the inventions of necessity had simplified many difficulties at the expense of increased manual labour.

Nor does that enable you to get anything very gorgeous in the shape of a house, but one obtainable for about the same price in New York or Boston, minus those comforts which Americans have come to consider as a matter of course, until they learn better in England.

These alley-ways are excavated to the depth of the cellars, arched over, and covered with flag stones, in which, at intervals, are open gratings to give light below; the whole length of which space is occupied by water closets, without doors, and under which are open drains communicating with the street sewers.

The slaves greatly outnumbered their opponents, of whom there were probably not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> or sixty, but nearly all these had muskets. Some of the firearms, I observed, did not go off, probably because they had no locks, or it may have been that their powder was bad. The parties were indeed more evenly matched than at first appeared to have been the case. They fought with the greatest desperation. Those who had muskets which would go off kept at a distance firing at the slaves, while their comrades either charged with their bayonets, or holding the barrels in their...", "...only refused to return an answer, but murdered the ambassadors whom Cortes had sent to them.

I lived in Moore County until 1889, then I moved to Raleigh. I have feeling. I don't like for people to have a feeling that slaves are no more than dogs; I don't like that. It causes people to have the wrong idea of slavery. Here is John Bectom, a well, healthy friend of mine, 75 years of age. If we had been treated as some folks say, these big, healthy niggers would not be walking about in the South now. The great Negro leaders...", "...several resolved to elope: at a late hour they broke past the astonished constables, and returned to their homes. They were, however, recalled by the sheriff, and kept under stricter watch until the trial ended. Amusements of the turf, officially patronised in other countries, were discouraged in this. From an early date, occasional matches were made for large stakes; but in 1827, races were regularly established at Ross. The course was lined off, a stand erected, in which about <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> well dressed persons were spectators. The riders were equipped in different colored clothing, and as they darted along, obscured at intervals by foliage, the scene was picturesque and animated. A race was contested by Messrs. Gregson and Hardwicke, which the latter lost. A public dinner followed; but the waiter was blindfolded, and his pudding stolen as he entered the tent. The hats and coats disappeared; and one cavalier was robbed of his boots. \"These things,\" said the...", "...\"Meiwyr,\" men of the field. Al. \"Meinir,\" the slender maid, which might refer to the daughter of Eudav. {171b} The Gorchan Maelderw clearly indicates that the fire was kindled in the presence of the army, and not for religious purposes before the Deity. {171c} This stanza explains the expression used in line 116. Seven days, then, we may suppose, formed the whole space of time during which the events related in the Gododin occurred. The action of Homer's Iliad occupied nearly <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> days. {171d} The daily operations are somewhat differently stated in the fragments of the Gododin, which are appended to \"Gorchan Maelderw.\" There they are as follows,-- \"On Tuesday they put on their splendid robes; On Wednesday bitter was their assembly; On Thursday messengers formed contracts; On Friday there was slaughter; On Saturday they dealt mutual blows; On Sunday they were pierced by ruddy weapons; On Monday a pool of blood knee deep...", "...You can't git just what I mean. \"An' then _I_ begun to see. I can't tell you all; I was half out; but just this for a sample: I had a sitter last week, an old lady; an' the sittin' was a failure. Yes, I was fishin' and pumpin', but she was close-mouthed an' suspicious. I got it out of her that she was worried about her boy. I tried a bad love affair for a lead, an' there was nothing doing. I tried bad habits and it was just as far away; and I give it up and was thankful I got <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> cents out of her. Well, while I sat there listenin' to Mrs. Markham, right into my mind came a picture--the old lady leanin' over a young man--her pale and shaky and him surprised an' mad,--and he held a pen in his hand, an' I got the word 'forgery!' That's one of the things I saw while that influence come from Mrs. Markham; and if you only knew how seldom I git anything real nowadays, you'd be as crazy as me about her. I just had to use all the force I've got to look stupid when...", "...some letters on it, wrapped it up in paper, and afterwards laid himself down to sleep. When he awoke, he perceived that the paper, by a shower of rain or some accident having got moist, had received an impression from these letters; which induced him to pursue the accidental discovery.\" Not only are these accounts evidently deficient in authenticity, but it should be remarked that the earliest of them was not put before the world until Laurence Coster had been nearly a hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years in his grave. The presumed writer of the narrative which first did justice to his memory had been also twelve years dead when his book was published. His information, or rather the information brought forward under cover of his name, was derived from an old man who, when a boy, had heard it from another old man who lived with Coster at the time of the robbery, and who had heard the account of the invention from his master. For, to explain the fact of the early appearance of...", "...himself for having neglected to acquire such a simple accomplishment. He might have learnt it when young, had he not been indifferent, or lazy about it. Often had he been advised to learn it by companions, but had treated the matter lightly and let the chance go by--and now, only fifty yards or so of deep water intervened between the end of the ledges of rock and the outside of the cavern, where he might perhaps find foothold enough to scramble along the base of the cliffs--but those <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards were equal to the Atlantic to him, he could not swim that distance to save his life. Once or twice, in a fit of desperation, he had almost plunged in to attempt it, and take his chance. Fortunately his courage failed. Had he taken the plunge his fate would no doubt have been sealed. Returning to the inner end of the cave he searched among the wreckage for wood, with which to make a raft, but it was so shattered that he found no pieces large enough to be thus used. He...", "...to bring the chilly atmosphere of opposition about old Jolyon, and disclose all the menace to his new-found freedom. Ah! He would have to resign himself to being an old man at the mercy of care and love, or fight to keep this new and prized companionship; and to fight tired him to death. But his thin, worn face hardened into resolution till it appeared all Jaw. This was his house, and his affair; he should not budge! He looked at his watch, old and thin like himself; he had owned it <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years. Past four already! And kissing the top of Holly's head in passing, he went down to the hall. He wanted to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson. At the first sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch, and saw at once that the victoria was empty. \"The train's in, sir; but the lady 'asn't come.\" Old Jolyon gave him a sharp upward look, his eyes seemed to push away that fat chap's curiosity, and defy him to see the bitter disappointment he was...", "...at the store. The business was such that I found it more than play. Many a time I did not get rest or sleep for forty-eight hours at a time. I have frequently taken in one hundred dollars in twenty- four hours for drinks, at five cents a drink. I paid attention to business, making the interest of my employers my interest. On account of my faithful services I was permitted to prepare hot lunches during the night, to sell to gamblers. What I made was my own. In this way I made from <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> to one hundred dollars a month extra. One day while I was absent from the store a French half-breed, by the name of Shaunce got on a drunken spree and cleared out the store and saloon. Hearing the disturbance I ran to the store. I entered by the back door and went behind the counter. As I did so Shaunce ran to the counter and grabbed a large number of tumblers, and threw them about the house, breaking them all. \"Shaunce, you must either behave, or go out of the house,\" I...", "...city, or possibly to revenge his master, he charged through the gate, killing and destroying as he went, and for an hour was master of the city. They set out poisoned fruit to tempt him but he would not eat. They sought to blind him with darts, but his small eyes were uninjured, though his head and great sides bristled with arrows. At the order of Chalginna, a gang of workmen set a great stake deep in the earth, without the wall beside the road near the great gate and not more than <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> yards from King Erigalla's prison; to this they fixed a few links of heavy chain. The mahout who had driven him before the city had been sacked was forced by threats of death to bring him to the stake and fasten the chain upon his leg, a few inches above his five great toes; and Gisco too was a prisoner, and so near that when the king spoke his name he heard and answered. It was well for the sanity of the king in the first months of that imprisonment that the elephant was a...", "...followed him. And of them that possessed Nisyros and Krapathos and Kasos and Kos the city of Eurypylos, and the Kalydnian Isles, of them Pheidippos and Antiphos were leaders, the two sons of king Thessalos son of Herakles. With them were arrayed thirty hollow ships. Now all moreover that dwelt in the Pelasgian Argos and inhabited Alos and Alope and Trachis and possessed Phthia and Hellas the home of fair women, and were called Myrmidons and Hellenes and Achaians; of all these, even <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> ships, Achilles was captain. But these took no thought of noisy war; for there was no man to array them in line of battle. For fleet-footed goodly Achilles lay idle amid the ships, wroth for the sake of a damsel, Briseis of the lovely hair, whom he had won from Lyrnessos and the walls of Thebe, and overthrew Mynes and Epistrophos, warriors that bare the spear, sons of king Euenos Selepos' son. For her sake lay Achilles sorrowing; but soon was he to arise again. And of them that...", "...of people took the pledge, including eight prelates, and seven hundred of the Roman Catholic clergy. A multitude of them were faithful. Dr. Justin Edwards said that ten thousand drunkards had been permanently reformed in five years. Through the great Washingtonian movement in Ohio, sixty thousand took the pledge. In Pennsylvania, twenty-nine thousand. In Kentucky, thirty thousand, and multitudes in all parts of the land. Many of these had been habitual drunkards. One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> thousand of them, it is estimated, were permanently reclaimed. Two of these men became foreign ministers; one a governor of a State; several were sent to Congress. Hartford reported six hundred reformed drunkards; Norwich, seventy-two; Fairfield, fifty; Sheffield, seventy-five. All over the land reformed men were received back into the churches that they had before disgraced; and households were re-established. All up and down the land there were gratulations, and praise to God....", "...the Secretary's books. The Vice-President receives a salary of $7000 per annum for his services, which are not light. The Secretary and Assistant Secretary, and Roll-keeper do the rest of the work of the Board. The last named keeps a record of the fines, which yield an exceedingly large revenue to the Board. The brokers are not the most dignified of mortals in their meetings, but are very much given to disorderly conduct and practical jokes. The annual dues of the Exchange are but <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> dollars, but the average broker pays at least ten times as much in fines. To interrupt the presiding officer during a call of the stocks subjects the offender to a fine of not less than twenty-five cents for each offence; to smoke a cigar within the Exchange costs five dollars; to be absent from special meetings is to incur a fine of not more than five dollars; to stand on a table or chair is punishable with a fine of one dollar; to throw a paper dart or ball at a member during...", "...their pranks that he refused to allow them to stop over night, and only consented to give them dinner upon promise of good behavior. The school became so popular that the best families in all parts of the country sent their boys there, but, financially, it was not a success, and after seven years' trial Bancroft was forced to abandon it, though his partner struggled on a few years longer. If the experiment had been entirely successful the cause of education might have been advanced <span class=\"clocktext\">fifty</span> years ahead of the old method, for both founders were men devoted to the cause of education and longed to see newer and broader methods supersede the old ones. As a boy Bancroft had studied at the Exeter Academy; finishing his course there he entered Harvard at thirteen, was graduated in his seventeenth year, and a year later was sent abroad by Harvard to fit himself for a tutorship in the University. During his four years' absence he studied modern languages and literatures,..."]
