He quickly abandoned his first instinct. \"With pleasure, monsieur,\" he assented. \"Tell me when to stop.\" He drove the car a few yards round the corner, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> a line of others. Their lights were all extinguished and the chauffeurs absent. \"This is a pleasant sort of picnic!\" he grumbled, as he brought his car to a standstill. \"Now what do I do, monsieur?\" \"You return with me, if you please,\" was the reply.

I soon came, in my walk, to the fortifications of Paris. They were constructed by Louis Phillippe, and are magnificent works of defense. There is one peculiar feature of this chain of defense which has excited a great deal of remark. It is quite evident that a part of the fortifications were constructed with a view to defend one's self from enemies _within_, as well as without. Louis Phillippe evidently remembered the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> history of Paris, and felt the possibility of a future in which he might like to have the command of Paris with his guns, as well as an enemy outside the wall. But the fortifications and the cannon were of no manner of use to him. So, very possibly, the grand army which Louis Napoleon has raised may be of no use to him, and the little prince, the young king of Algeria, may end his days a wanderer in the United States, as his father was before him.

He might have held his tongue altogether, and let Katie believe that love alone had brought him down, as it had done so often before; or he might have told her all, feeling sure that all must be told her before long. But he did neither; he left her in suspense, and the consequence was that before her mother's return she was very ill. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> eleven before the fly was heard in which Linda and her mother returned home. Katie had then gone upstairs, but not to bed. She had seated herself in the armchair in her mother's dressing-room, and sitting there waited till she should be told by her mother what had occurred.

The significance of this emphasis is most clear in its bearing upon our relation to the past and the present. The present is neither to be dominated by the past nor sacrificed to the future, but the past is to be appropriated by our activity in the present, and the present, while possessing reality and value in itself, looks forward to the future. Historical content, spiritual endeavour in past, present, and future, must be unified by a common task. The <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> is ours only so far as we appropriate it. Spiritual inheritance is not the same as natural inheritance. We may by our spiritual effort adopt or reject ideas or a system of life which have come to us from the past.

He listened to every word Hawkes had to say, drinking it in with the same delight he felt when drinking the Antarean wine. Hawkes was a complex, many-faceted character; he seemed to have been everywhere on Earth, done everything the planet had to offer.

It was a delightful journey through the blue sky and <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the fleecy white clouds. They played and danced with the sunbeams who led them on their way to the earth. The dimples could see nothing for them to do, so on they went, frolicking and playing. At last they found themselves among the trees and the bright flowers of the earth. They chased the sunbeams under the leaves, they rode on the butterflies' wings, they sipped the honey with the bees from the flowers. Still, they could find nothing to do.

This couple were Monsieur Jacques Robin and his wife, emigrants from Heaven knows what <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life in their native land, and now dwelling drearily, it must be confessed, in the one tavern of Foundryville--a mere hamlet back among the mountains of Pennsylvania. A year previously Monsieur Robin had applied for the post of clerk in the foundry, and obtaining the modest situation, madame had subsequently appeared on the scene.

It immediately struck them that this second marriage had been fatally injurious to their interests by dividing the Auffray property between two daughters. In times <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> they had heard their father, who was given to sneering, complain of it.

The recollection of a world of vice, and of crimes committed by her nearest kinsmen, and also of her own sins, must have constantly disturbed Lucretia's conscience. Other women who, like her, were among the chief characters in the history of the Borgias developed precisely the same frame of mind and...", "...society, and diverting his mind by painting pictures in his company. He thus lightened a captivity and turned a prison into a home of art and friendship; thus the kindness and condescension of a prince were returned in more value \"than much fine gold,\" in the bitter hour of his adversity, by his humble but warm-hearted artist-friend. That brotherly unity which ought to bind professional men of all kinds--isolated as they must be from the general world--was more of a necessity in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> time than in the present; and the artists formed a little band of friends within the walls of ancient Nuernberg, consulting with and aiding each other. The peculiarity of thought and tendency of habit which constitute the vitality of the artist-mind, are altogether unappreciated by the general world; completely misunderstood, and most frequently contemned by men of a trading spirit, who look upon artists as \"eccentrics,\" upon art as a \"poor business,\" and judge of pictures solely...", "...to Cassandra: _She at length leaves the chariot and suddenly bursts into a cry of horror_. {1038} Then follows, marking the crisis of the drama, a burst of lyrical excitement. The dialogue between Chorus and Cassandra falls into lyrical strophes and antistrophes: Cassandra, by her prophetic gift, can see all that is going on and about to be consummated within the Palace. Her wailings reproach her patron and lover Apollo, who has conducted her to a house of blood; she sees the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> murders that have stained the house, she sees the preparations for the present deed, the bath, the net, the axe; then her wailings wax yet wilder as she sees that she herself is to be included in the sacrifice. Meantime her excitement gradually passes over to the Chorus: at first they have mistaken her cries for the ordinary lamentations of captives (and borne their part in the dialogue in the ordinary 'blank verse'); then their emotions are roused (and their speech falls into...", "...at the same time increase the water-power.

Was there ever a broken sentence of Aristotle that moved so much the scholar to whom a new reading has suddenly appeared?

This is indeed the effect of most of our punishments; they injure others besides the criminal, and there is room for grave doubt as to whether they benefit anybody. Once the punishment has been undergone, the offender is supposed to have expiated his offence; but as there is no positive expiation for <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> wrongdoing, except it may be future welldoing, this is a fiction. It is not a wise thing to teach the ignorant that they can pay for any harm they do; least of all to teach them that they atone by imprisonment for injuries inflicted on others.

When the clock indicated twenty minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> eight, Andrew Stuart got up, saying, \"Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired.\" \"What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?\" asked Thomas Flanagan. \"At twenty-three minutes past seven,\" replied Gauthier Ralph; \"and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve.\" \"Well, gentlemen,\" resumed Andrew Stuart, \"if Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train, he would have got here by this time.

He had been a blind fool; but still the remembrance of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> was strong in him, and he made a last fight against believing. \"It's a lie, it's a lie,\" he repeated hoarsely. There was something in his eyes which nearly broke down May's hardness, a look she had never seen on any man's face before, which she never got out of her memory again. \"I know it hurts, Jimmy, dear,\" she said far more gently. \"It must hurt because you've been infatuated by a very clever and bad woman; but for all that it is true.

I intend to devote myself exclusively to the question as to the present standing of this theory, and I allude to its <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> history only in order to examine the statement which is frequently made, to the effect that its general prevalence in all ages and among all peoples of the world lends to it a certain degree of 'antecedent credibility.'

Some specimens of the wall decoration of later times, as of the period of the Antonines and the reign of Septimius Severus, are preserved, but they are isolated and not sufficient in number to enable us to follow the stages of the decline. Thus it happens that the only period in the history of ancient wall decoration in regard to which we have the materials for a full and satisfactory study, is the period...", "...when I was informed that this could not be done as easy as this, I went on my way as early as the next day without any passport.

Always keeping this near him in <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> years, a supreme cheerfulness of heart had welled up out of his early sufferings and his innate honesty. Hope had beckoned him on from year to year, until it seemed at last that the time had almost come when he might speak, might tell her all--his father's crime and the manner of his father's death; of his own devoted purpose in trying to expiate that crime by his own uprightness; and of his love for her.

Tennyson saw clearly the wonders of astronomy and geology, and discerned that the laws of nature were nothing more than the habits, so to speak, of a power that was incredibly dim and vast, a power which held within itself the secrets of motion and rest, of death and life. Thus he claimed for his disciples not only the average thoughtful men, but the very best and finest minds of his generation who wished to link the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and the present together, and not to break with the old sanctities. Tennyson's art suffered from the consciousness of his enormous responsibility, and where he failed was from his dread of unpopularity, or his fear of alienating the ordinary man. Browning was interested in ethical problems; his robust and fortunate temperament allowed him to bridge over with a sort of buoyant healthiness the gaps of his philosophy. But Tennyson's ethical failure lay in his desire to improve the...", "...the separation of the last two years had put that space between them which alone made it possible for them to approach each other on new ground. A kind of horror, of repulsion, for her engagement to Jeff Durgin had ceased from his sense of her; it was as if she had been unhappily married, and the man, who had been unworthy and unkind, was like a ghost who could never come to trouble his joy. He was more her contemporary, he found, than formerly; she had grown a great deal in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> two years, and a certain affliction which her father's fixity had given him concerning her passed in the assurance of change which she herself gave him. She had changed her world, and grown to it, but her nature had not changed. Even her look had not changed, and he told her how he had seen his picture in her at the moment of their meeting in the street. They all went in to verify his impression from the painting. \"Yes, that is the way you looked.\" \"It seems to me that is...", "...had no business whatever to perform: it was mere fudge; and I resolved to go home as fast as I could. But I did not go home. On the contrary, I kept strolling about from street to street, sometimes thinking upon Julia, sometimes upon Mr. Tims. The night was of the most melancholy description--a cold, cloudy, windy, rainy December night. Not a soul was upon the streets excepting a solitary straggler, returning hither and thither from an evening sermon, or an occasional watchman gliding <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> with his lantern, like an incarnation of the Will-o'-wisp. I strolled up and down for half an hour, wrapped in an olive great-coat, and having a green silk umbrella over my head. It was well I chanced to be so well fortified against the weather; for had it been otherwise, I must have been drenched to the skin. Where I went I know not, so deeply was my mind wound up in its various melancholy cogitations. This, however, I do know, that, after striking against sundry lamp-posts, and...", "...when he had time. Upon reaching the place where the pony was grazing, I saw a strange sight. There sat an Indian on a knoll, wearing a Navajoe blanket, ear-rings that hung down like small sleigh bells, his hair plaited and hanging down his back, his head decorated with eagle feathers, all of which made me think I had met a very distinguished gentleman. As a neighbor I greeted him with the customary, \"How.\" To my greeting he made no sign of recognition, did not even move a muscle. I rode <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him for some distance and then returned on the opposite side of him, and then I discovered the cause of his sullen dignity. He had fastened to his blanket a small-sized pewter plate polished as bright as a new dollar fresh from the mint, and around the rim of it was inscribed the letters of the alphabet. I saw that he had left his rifle in the scabbard of his saddle, and if he made any move of a warlike nature, I could do a lot of business before he could get organized for battle....", "...agent or superintendent, or under the charge of the United States.

Saloon keepers in towns bordering on the reservations are wary about selling it to them, but in towns some distance from the reservations open selling still goes on. On the whole, our liquor laws are more honored in the breach than the observance. The consumption of such a large amount of liquor in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> has, in a great many cases, absolutely destroyed the health of the Indians. Their constitutions always have been weak, subject to tuberculosis, pneumonia, and all pulmonary diseases, and when the consumption of large amounts of alcohol is added to this, little wonder is it that the death rate is high among them, and that so many weak, diseased Indian children come into the world. In the matter of religion, the Puget Sound Indians are in an evolutionary stage.

One, apparently little used, led westward along the eastern side of the Plain of Sharon, and thence over the famous passes of Beth-horon to Jerusalem. The direct but more arduous and dangerous road led due south across the Plain of Esdraelon <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Jezreel and Ginea, the ancient En-Gannim, which stood at the point where the great plain penetrates the Samaritan hills. Thence the main road turned a little westward, running through Samaria and Shechem. A more direct branch ran due south, past Sychar, joining the other branch just east of Mount Gerizim. It was while journeying northward along this road that Jesus paused at Jacob's Well,^{(17, 18)} on the eastern side of the fertile plain that opens to the northeast of Mount...", "...word or two, but the species, the varieties, the hybrids, and the seedlings, how varied and impossible their classification! Most men have bought books, some have read a few, and others many; but beyond this rough grouping together we shall not attempt anything. One thing, however, the majority of book-collectors agree in, and that is in regarding their own generation as a revolution--they have, as Butler has described it in his picture of an antiquary, 'a great value for that which is <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and gone, like the madman that fell in love with Cleopatra.' Differing in many, and often material, points as one book-collector does from another, the entire passion for collecting may be said to focus itself into two well-defined grooves. A man either collects books for his own intellectual profit, or out of pure ostentatious vanity.

At half <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> one, we stopped at a beach on the left-hand side going up East Bay, to boil some victuals, as we brought nothing but raw meat with us. Whilst we were cooking, I saw an Indian on the opposite shore, running along a beach to the head of the bay. Our meat being drest, we got into the boat and put off; and, in a short time, arrived at the head of this reach, where we saw an Indian settlement.\" \"As we drew near, some of the Indians came down on the rocks, and waved for us to be...", "...what safeguards should be taken against the aggressions of future sovereigns had made a report in which they recommended not only a solemn enunciation of ancient constitutional principles, but the enactment of new laws.

They determined to preface the tender of the crown to William and Mary by a recital of the royal encroachments of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> reigns, and a formal assertion of the constitutional principles against which such encroachments had offended. This document, drafted by a committee of which the celebrated Somers, then a scarcely known young advocate, was the chairman, was the famous \"Declaration of Right.\" The grievances which it recapitulated in its earlier portion were as follows: (1) The royal pretension to dispense with and suspend laws without consent of Parliament; (2) the punishment of subjects, as in...", "...with Major von Heidkaemper, of the 4th Bavarian Light Cavalry, a constant companion of \"Willie's,\" and Karl von Pappenheim, a captain of the Prussian Guard, who had been educated at Oxford, and who was so English that it was often difficult for people from London to believe that he was a Prussian.

Visions of Pharaoh and his daughter and the infant Moses would come to us. Gazing into the depths of the soft waters, pure and sweet, we should be brought back to the present, as, with delight, we should find them teeming with many varieties of the finny tribes that sport beneath the surface.

She loves her so much that if I died she would still have somebody to cling to, provided Aniela remained.

The farm was not more than five miles distant, and I had been a good walker all my life. After making the needful inquiries, I set forth to visit Eunice on foot. My way through the town led me <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the Minister's house. I had left the door some fifty yards behind me, when I saw two ladies approaching.

At the distance of a li from the Lamasery we found four Lamas, friends of Sandara, who had come to meet us. Their religious costume, the red scarf that enveloped them, their mitre-shaped yellow caps, their modest mien, the low, grave tones of their voices, all this produced a marked impression upon us, and we felt as though a perfume of religious and cenobitic life was diffused around us. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> nine in the evening when we reached the first [Picture: Accident on the Ice] dwellings of the Lamasery. To avoid disturbing the profound silence which reigned everywhere about, the Lamas made the carman stop, and filled with straw the interior of the bells which hung from the horses' necks. We then advanced slowly, and without saying a word, along the calm deserted streets of this great Lamanesque city.

The history of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and of these latter times afford us obvious illustrations of these several categories.

Finally.\" He passed a hand over his forehead and stared <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Malone at a spot on the wall. Malone turned and looked at the spot, but saw nothing of interest. \"Malone,\" Burris said, and the FBI Agent whirled around again. \"Yes, Ch--Yes?\" he said. \"This time,\" Burris said, \"it isn't the same old story at all.

But whilst he stalked along he gradually grew calmer. Things seemed to become simpler, more easy to bear, and to understand. He saw Lalage now in a different light, and he felt that, as her character was partially cleared, so, in some subtle way, his own sin became less, and he need no longer have any compunction about asking Vera Farlow to be his wife. True, for one wild moment, his old love...", "...any particular one is his, if he can't make out the brand or earmarks clearly.\" \"Earmarks?\" questioned Nort. \"Sometimes we clip a piece out of a calf's ear,\" explained Bud, \"as well as branding 'em.

Some say the orchestra was used as a book-stall when plays were not going on--an assumption justified by no other hint in Greek literature. Others have far more absurdly imagined that Plato really meant you could pay a drachme for the best seat in the theatre, and read the writings of Anaxagoras in a fashionable play of Euripides, who was his friend and follower. Verily a wonderful interpretation! If the reader will walk with me from the theatre of Dionysus <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the newly excavated site of the temple of AEsculapius, and past the Roman-Greek theatre which was erected by Hadrian or Herodes Atticus, I will show him what Plato meant. Of course, this later theatre, with its solid Roman back scenes of masonry, is equally interesting with the Theatre of Dionysus to the advocates of the unity of history!

Suddenly I remembered the ominous words of Hindoo, \"May be heard from if up to her last race.\" Evidently Bellsolar was up. Captain Alcock was carrying the business of being nice much too far. Before he could do anything about it, Bellsolar was at his shoulders.

In the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> decade it is probable that no railroad rails even for the smallest and cheapest of tracks have been made of anything but steel. The last half of the nineteenth century has been one of triumph of steel manufacture and production in America, and at the present time the United States stands head and shoulders above any other nation in this industry. In the middle of the century both Germany and England were greater producers than America; but by the close of the century the annual...", "...you?\" said Laura. Her eyes flashed. She got down from the stile. \"Good-bye, Polly! I must be going home.\" Suddenly Polly gripped her by the arm. \"Luke there!\" she said in excitement. \"Luke!--theer he goes! That's Teddy--Teddy Williams! I knew as I had summat to tell you--and when you spoak o' Hubert--it went oot o' my head.\" Laura looked at her cousin first, in astonishment, and then at the dark figure walking on the road below--the straight white road that ran across the marsh, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the lonely forge of old Ben Williams, the wheelwright, to the foot of the tall \"Scar,\" opposite, where it turned seaward, and so vanished in the dimness of the coast. It was the Jesuit certainly. The two girls saw him plainly in the strong storm light. He was walking slowly with bent head, and seemed to be reading. His solitary form, black against the white of the road, made the only moving thing in the wide, rain-drenched landscape. Laura instantly guessed that he had been...", "...the banner of King Alcohol. In the middle of the day column was formed and the boys marched out on Pennsylvania Avenue. Numbers of small boys flanked the line bargaining for the task of carrying knapsacks--carts were there for the same purpose and a brisk bargaining ensued. It was indeed a comfortable way to carry a knapsack--transferred to a cart or to the back of a negro boy. Thus disburdened, marching was easier. The air was hot, the roads very dusty. Across Long Bridge they went, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Forts Runion and Albany, to an old camp known as Camp Chase, nearly one mile in rear of the Lee mansion, on Arlington Hights. Old A tents were there, pitched and ready for occupation, true, not as clean as desirable, but a shelter which a little labor of dusting and arranging greatly improved. Routine is the term expressive of life in camp. The soldier of experience is a stranger to monotony--he is part of a machine. All the comforts and amusements he can get outside of the...", "...\"Ah,\" he murmured presently, \"life's pretty sweet, isn't it!\" CHAPTER XXXV Events followed each other with refreshing rapidity. While the crew of the big locomotive on the crossing busied themselves getting up steam, Sexton and Jules Rondeau toiled at the loading of the discarded boiler and heavy castings aboard two flat-cars. By utilizing the steel derrick on the company's wrecking-car, this task was completed by noon, and after luncheon the mogul backed up the main line <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the switch into the Laguna Grande yards; whereupon the switch-engine kicked the two flat-cars and the wrecking-car out of the yard and down to the crossing, where the obstructions were promptly unloaded. The police watched the operation with alert interest but forebore to interfere in this high-handed closing of a public thoroughfare. To Sexton's annoyance and secret apprehension, Bryce Cardigan and Buck Ogilvy promptly appeared on the scene, both very cheerful and lavish with...", "...sons valiant as their sire, to whom were given the fertile lands lying between the river Avon and the mighty midland forests, to which they gave the name \"Aescendune.\" They had held their own for three hundred years with varying fortunes; once or twice home and hearth were desolated by the fierce tide of Danish invasion, but the wars subsided, and the old family resumed its position, amidst the joy of their dependants and serfs, to whom they were endeared by a thousand memories of <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> benefits. But a generation only had passed since the shadow of a great woe fell on the family of Aescendune. Offa, who was then the thane, had two sons, Oswald the elder, and Ella the younger, with whom our readers are already acquainted. The elder possessed few of the family virtues save brute courage. He was ever rebellious, even in boyhood, and arrived at man's estate in the midst of unsettled times of war and tumult. Weary of the restraints of home, he joined a band of...", "...passion for the common good is liable to be disappointed in seeking in the Church for the encouragement and sympathy that he craves. Neither the Protestant nor the Roman Catholic Churches can claim to have inspired the Labor movement. At best it can only be said that, when the movement had struggled through the early days of conflict and persecution, the Churches reached out hesitatingly and half-heartedly a hand of fellowship in a spirit, partly of genuine desire to make amends for <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> dereliction, partly of condescension, and partly of fear. But during the severity of Labor's early struggle, Protestantism, except in isolated and unofficial representatives, gave no assistance, not even its blessing, to what was the most profoundly Christian movement of the nineteenth century. When it did not frankly sympathize with the masters in their difficulties with their unreasonable and discontented employees, it maintained a cautious neutrality. The first step to...", "...corridor, Finish the portrait out of hand--there, there, And throw him in another thing or two If he demurs; the whole should prove enough To pay for this same Cousin's freak.

It was evidently only by placing considerable constraint upon himself, that he now refrained from crumpling up the letter and throwing it from him in disgust. However, he spread it out flat before him once more--looked first at one paragraph, then at another, but did not read them; hesitated--and then irritably turned over the leaf of paper before him, and began at a new page.) \"When I told Joshua generally what I had observed, and...", "...be done.\" \"Are you?\" Marion asked, with a visible shiver. \"Ruth, are you _sure_?

The friend, triumphing in his own brick-kiln and his own more pliable master, jeered, dug him in the ribs at the Sunday gatherings, and talked of dependence, obedience, and restricted powers. Such friends are difficult to endure with composure; and Dellwig, and still less his wife, for many months <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> had hardly been able to bear the word \"brick\" mentioned in their presence. When Anna appeared on the scene, so young, so foreign, and so obviously foolish, Dellwig, certain now of success, told his friend on the very first Sunday night that the brick-kiln was now a mere matter of weeks. Always a boaster, he could not resist boasting a little too soon. Besides, he felt very sure; and the friend, too, had taken it for granted, when he heard of the impending young mistress, that the...", "...of them (as I planned them then) so strange, or so terrible, as those which happened to me.

The horses we could have shot without difficulty, but this was just what our enemies wanted. Could they but induce us to waste our fire upon the horses, we would soon be at their mercy. So, with an effort, we restrained our inclination to risk a shot, and watched their every movement with the cat-like vigilance of men who knew that their lives were trembling in the balance. Round and round went the circle of the hunt, flight after flight of arrows whistled <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> us, or spent their force against the wagon, still we were unharmed; although our escapes were narrow and incessant. The mules and horses were struck repeatedly, but so tightly were they bound together with leathern thongs that not even death could separate them.

Before he could regain his horse, father's rifle cracked and...", "...which to any one else would have seemed void of any importance whatsoever; and his heart answered that if he were indeed so senseless he must have lost his intelligence very recently.

He sat down to think about it, and was suddenly startled by the host of little circumstances which all at once detached themselves from the hazy <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and stood out in condemnation of his wife. Gouache, as he himself had acknowledged, had long worshipped the princess in a respectful, almost reverential way. He had taken every occasion of talking with her, and had expressed even by his outward manner a degree of devotion he never manifested to other women. Giovanni was now aware that for some time past, even as far back as the previous winter, he had almost unconsciously watched Corona and Anastase when they were together....", "...the work of degeneration had commenced. The atmosphere of the cathedral was no longer holy in the eyes of increasing multitudes. Better the sanguinary rites of Belgic Druids, better the yell of slaughtered victims from the \"wild wood without mercy\" of the pagan forefathers of the nation, than this fantastic intermingling of divine music, glowing colors, gorgeous ceremonies, with all the burning, beheading and strangling work which had characterized the system of human sacrifice for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> half-century. Such was the church of Notre Dame at Antwerp. Thus indifferent or hostile towards the architectural treasure were the inhabitants of a city, where in a previous age the whole population would have risked their lives to defend what they esteemed the pride and garland of their metropolis. The Prince of Orange had been anxiously solicited by the Regent to attend the conference at Duffel. After returning to Antwerp, he consented, in consequence of the urgent...", "...map; \"what's that, Dadah?\" \"That's the beginning of Chicago,\" said Mr. Merrill. \"Let's fold up the map now and see what we can of the city.

No wonder it was a strange sight to the two girls--they had never before seen anything that made them even guess the big business that they now saw spread out before them.

The hours passed rapidly. We amused ourselves by casting the parts and reading a short play which had just been played at the Royal Theatre. But suddenly our spirits flagged and the inevitable pause ensued; that awkward pause which is sure to occur after exhaustive efforts to shine and make conquests.

As fever is the universal symptom of disease, so disorder is the index of failure.

The fact that the public usually gauge a teacher's efficiency by the order he keeps has led in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> to an exaggerated emphasis upon school discipline. The means for securing good order have greatly changed since Herbart's time. A growing sense of social solidarity in the community, together with the all but universal employment of women as teachers in the elementary grades, has transferred the basis of discipline from the teacher to the community.

BY EDWIN B. HOLT. I. THE PROBLEM OF ANAESTHESIA DURING EYE-MOVEMENT. A first suggestion of the possible presence of anaesthesia during eye-movement is given by a very simple observation. All near objects seen from a fairly rapidly moving car appear fused. No further suggestion of their various contour is distinguishable than blurred streaks of color arranged parallel, in a hazy stream which flows rapidly <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> toward the rear of the train. Whereas if the eye is kept constantly moving from object to object scarcely a suggestion of this blurred appearance can be detected. The phenomenon is striking, since, if the eye moves in the same direction as the train, it is certain that the images on the retina succeed one another even more rapidly than when the eye is at rest. A supposition which occurs to one at once as a possible explanation is that perchance during eye-movement the retinal...", "...\"Where are the ladies?\" he asked whether Lady Dashwood was in. \"In 'er room, sir,\" said Robinson; and he then proceeded to explain why, and gave the doctor's report. \"Nothin' alarmin', sir.\" The Warden said \"Ah!\" and looked down at the table.

He gathered them in his hands. \"Tea is in the library for you, sir,\" said old Robinson; \"I will bring it in a minute.\" The Warden went upstairs. He went past the drawing-room and <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> his bedroom into the library.

Then he finally went out of the room and passed the head of the staircase and up the two or three steps into the corridor. He had been into the corridor three times since the arrival of his sister. Once when he conducted her to her room, on her arrival, once again when she had made alterations in the bedrooms and had asked for his approval,...", "...of your family.

St. Augustine says: \"If a man were set before the choice either of dying or of living his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life over, it is certain that he would choose to die, seeing the many perils and evils which he had so hardly escaped.\" This is a very true saying, if it be rightly pondered. Here a man may see how often he has done and suffered many things, without any exertion or care of his own, nay, without and against his wish; of which things he took so little thought before they came to pass, or while they were taking place, that, only after all was over, he found himself compelled to...", "...and have shared his melons and his conversation.

The mammals have received most attention hitherto, because their remains are so frequently met with, thus enabling us more easily to investigate their <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> history; but butterflies and snails have not been neglected, and at least one very remarkable work on the latter has been published dealing with their origin in Europe and in the remainder of the Palaearctic region. The former distribution of land and water is intimately connected with the origin of the European fauna, and the changes which have taken place in this respect may be best traced by the present distribution of mammals, snails, and earthworms.

How many times had he stood idly before those doors, reckoning it worthy sport indeed, to pass unscrupulous remarks on passers-by behind his half-smoked cheroot: he cast a sympathetic look, as he thought, at a couple of unsuspecting girls, who just then were making their way along that thoroughfare, and his face said very plainly, \"Well, you hardly know poor creatures, what noble jests your tiny feet, and tiny waists, and faces...", "...Perception._ Confining ourselves for the present to the mental, as distinguished from the physical, side of the operation, we soon find that perception is not so simple a matter as it might at first seem to be. When a man on a hot day looks at a running stream and \"sees\" the delicious coolness, it is not difficult to show that he is really performing an act of mental synthesis, or imaginative construction. To the sense-impression[5] which his eye now gives him, he adds something which <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience has bequeathed to his mind. In perception, the material of sensation is acted on by the mind, which embodies in its present attitude all the results of its past growth. Let us look at this process of synthesis a little more closely. When a sensation arises in the mind, it may, under certain circumstances, go unattended to. In that case there is no perception. The sensation floats in the dim outer regions of consciousness as a vague feeling, the real nature and...", "...kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away.

The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him. \"Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh!

But the French fought with determined courage, and hour after hour went by as the attack slowly worked its way along the line.

The crews of the captured ships were cut down as they fought, or driven over the stern into the water, where, for the most part, their heavy armour drowned them. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> noon, and the tide was turning when the left and centre, the squadrons of Kiriet and Bahuchet, were all captured. Then the attack raged round the nearest vessels on the right, tall ships of the Genoese.

This clever, handsome, resolute man had, as I afterwards found, resolved, in the first period of our acquaintance, on making me his wife--you will wonder why,--since there was little love on his part, and my poor heart was bleeding from a sense of wrong at the hands of one I had loved.

There developed in me, in spite of my struggles, the two elements of misfortune which the past had bequeathed me: at times furious jealousy attended by reproaches and insults; at other times a cruel gayety, an affected cheerfulness, that mockingly outraged whatever I held most dear. Thus the inexorable spectres of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> pursued me without respite; thus Brigitte, seeing herself treated alternately as a faithless mistress and a shameless woman, fell into a condition of melancholy that clouded our entire life; and worst of all, that sadness even, the cause of which I knew, was not the most burdensome of our sorrows.

They had built around the sides of the ship, and little above the surface of the water, a stage, or flooring, on which the sentries walked during the whole night, singing out, every half hour, \"_all's well_.\" Beside these sentries marching around the ship, they had a floating-guard in boats, rowing around all the ships, during the live long night. Whenever these boats rowed <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> a sentinel, it was his duty to challenge them, and theirs to answer; and this was done to ascertain whether they were French or American boats, come to _surprise_, and carry by boarding, the Crown Prince!

Generally speaking, it seems to be found too easy at the lower end and too difficult at the higher end. It seems certain that some of the tests have not yet found their proper level, or, indeed, that the proper level may vary from country to country, from school to school, and from one social rank to another. Thus, the writer has found that practically all the five-year-old children present in a certain school during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> two or three years are able to pass the colour test assigned by Binet to seven years of age. These children, however, probably belong to a higher social class than the five-year-olds tested by Binet. An examiner very quickly learns which of the tests beyond his age it is advisable to put to the particular child he is dealing with, and owing to the method of marking it does not matter much if one or two tests are misplaced with reference to a particular group of children.

Arus saw his mistake too late; he had not touched the soul of the pagan, in which lurked the hard fierceness of all the ages.

Do not go away, now.\" The lad, understanding the matter perfectly, replied, \"Yes, sir;\" and I attempted to pass the sentinel by mere assurance. I had learned long before how far a man may go, even in captivity, by sheer, native impudence--by moving straight on, without hesitation, with a confident look, just as if he had a right to go, and no one had any right to question him. Several times, as already related, I saw captives, who had procured citizens' clothes, thus walk <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the guards in broad daylight, out of Rebel prisons. I think I could have done it on this occasion, but for the fact that it had been tried successfully twice or thrice, and the guards severely punished. The sentinel stopped me with his musket, demanding: \"Have you a pass, sir?\" \"Certainly, I have a pass,\" I replied, with all the indignation I could assume. \"Have you not seen it often enough to know by this time?\" Apparently a little confounded, he replied, modestly:...", "...him; and I am so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in ignorance; for I am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and short, when it is long.\" And these were all the notions he had concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so universally practised, among human creatures.

For none of these considerations, she felt, came into the question of marrying Sir John. He was old and pompous and of no great family. She would be giving more than she received in bestowing her youth and her talents and her company upon him. She did not love him, therefore whether he should ever look upon her with scorn or no was a matter of indifference to her--and she would not for a moment have dreamed of any obligation to reveal that episode in her <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> to him, since the probabilities were so very remote that discovery could ever happen and therefore her silence would in no way injure him. It would be merely a bargain in which an old man bought a young woman \"as she stood,\" so to speak, for the pleasure of his eye.

His way of looking at the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> seemed very strange to us; his view of certain sides of life was essentially different from ours. He never indulged in any regrets for the Arcadian joyousness and irresponsibility which was a somewhat popular conception of slavery; his had not been the lot of the petted house-servant, but that of the toiling field-hand.

Consider, now, where our inquiries have led us.

There were abysses, both in his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life and in his character, which I could not penetrate. There was in him both a reckless frankness and a vigilant reserve: his frankness was apparent in his talk on all matters immediately before us, in the utter absence of all effort to make himself seem better than he was.

The number of such works is astonishing, but their general lack of style and broad human interest places them outside of the field of literature. The tendency of recent historical writing, for example, is to collect facts _about_ persons or events rather than to reproduce the persons or events so vividly that the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> lives again before our eyes. The result of such writing is to make history a puppet show in which dead figures are moved about by unseen economic forces; meanwhile the only record that lives in literature is the one that represents history as it really was in the making; that is, as a drama of living, self-directing men.

It is, as it were, an inscribed finger-post, warning us of the molten core within. It is at once a memorial and a monition to those that dwell beneath it. It is the witness of <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and the herald of future convulsions; yet, being such, it is itself in form the peacefullest and tenderest in nature. No woman's robe droops more delicately over her bosom than droops the once molten drapery of a volcano. Its aspect bears a double and opposed suggestiveness.

The Countess had left, but alas, the bills she had contributed to swell still remained; so did the exiguity of the children's clothing, which also was partly an indirect consequence of her presence; and so, too, did the coolness and alienation in the parishioners, which could not at once vanish before the fact of her departure. The Rev. Amos was not exculpated--the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> was not expunged. But what was worse than all, Milly's health gave frequent cause for alarm, and the prospect of baby's birth was overshadowed by more than the usual fears. The birth came prematurely, about six weeks after the Countess's departure, but Mr. Brand gave favourable reports to all inquirers on the following day, which was Saturday.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> week has been unbroken sunshine, moonlight, and smooth seas. So far not a ship has been seen. I have read carefully eleven of Shakespeare's plays during the spare hours of the voyage, and have enjoyed those most with which I was least familiar, while some passages in even the best known I wonder greatly at not having long ere this committed to memory, to live there with the rest, and come at my call to minister to me. They are such gems. I have them now, and feel as if I have...", "...go to church or take to the fields. [Sidenote: _RED HOOK._] It was thick weather when I traveled the country between Rhinebeck and Race Place, and the mist hid the distant hills and dulled the nearby Autumn tints, with now and then a shower to make the roads the better for the sprinkling. All nature had taken the veil, and there was little to see beyond the adjoining fields, and these, lacking the magic touch of the sun, were but dull companions. The towns, however, kept jogging <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> at frequent intervals, Red Hook being first on the list, the first mention of which is in 1751, when certain baptisms are recorded as occurring in Roode Hoek. The place is said to have its name from the fact that a marsh covered with ripe cranberries was the first thing that caught the Dutch eye in this spot. As one passes through the town he sees a guide-board pointing to Barrytown on the river, some three or four miles away, where that Gen.

Hearing a step behind them, Mary turned and looked; then catching Hal by the arm, she drew him into the shadows at the side, whispering to him to be silent. The bent figure of a man went <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> them, lurching from side to side. When he had turned and gone into the house, Mary said, \"It's my father. He's ugly when he's like that.\" And Hal could hear her quick breathing in the darkness. So that was Mary's trouble--the difficulty in her home life to which she had referred at their first meeting! Hal understood many things in a flash--why her home was bare of ornament, and why she did not invite her company to sit down. He stood silent, not knowing what to say. Before...", "...his companion failed to notice anything amiss. Apparently assuming the boat had been carelessly tied and had drifted away under its own power, they were not suspicious. \"That was a narrow squeak,\" Penny sighed in relief as the motorboat with the other craft in tow finally disappeared around the bend. \"The oars will quickly dry in the sun, so I guess we're safe.\" Now that they were well out of trouble, the adventure seemed fun.

The envelope was addressed correctly enough, christian and surname in full, with even a flourish of calligraphy adorning his humble title of \"Esquire.\" Many members of the \"Cauliflower\" would have pocketed the effusion without emotion, as a mere every-day conquest of some anonymous admirer, but such a suspicion never entered Goldthred's honest head.

So I floundered among details, little practical details, such as talking French to him and being seen about Dinard with him. I recalled how already Madge Aird had asked whether he had a brother. I seemed to see Alec's face when he was told that a Frenchman had fallen in love with his daughter, my own as I explained that the Frenchman was not really a...", "...he knew no woman except the widow. The black boots and white stockings of the countess passed before his eyes, but that slight imagining vanished into nothingness. He remembered meanwhile how on a certain time during conversation he had held the widow's hand; he remembered what a wish he had had to kiss it, but he remembered also how ominously Gustav's eyes were glittering at that moment. Jealousy seized him. Occasionally a scarcely visible cloud, regret for a premature promise, sped <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> in his soul and hid somewhere in its darkest caves. Then he repeated in a very tragic tone, \"I have promised, I will not go.\" One thing more angered him,--to people respected and more advanced in life this would seem a paradox,--the quiet of life angered him. Science came to him easily, he did not expend all his powers, and this roused distaste in him. Fresh, active natures, like young soldiers, feel a need of bathing in the fire of battle.

His wife was dead, and the first impulse for revenge died with the thought that she was beyond him. He looked out at the night as at a fiend. Henchard, like all his kind, was superstitious, and he could not help thinking that the concatenation of events this evening had produced was the scheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him. Yet they had developed naturally. If he had not revealed his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> history to Elizabeth he would not have searched the drawer for papers, and so on. The mockery was, that he should have no sooner taught a girl to claim the shelter of his paternity than he discovered her to have no kinship with him. This ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from a fellow-creature. Like Prester John's, his table had been spread, and infernal harpies had snatched up the food.

The king being poorly mounted, and having no lance, Bohun galloped on him suddenly and furiously, thinking, with his long spear and his big strong horse, easily to bear him down to the ground. King Robert saw him and permitted him to come very near, then suddenly turned his pony a little to one side, so that Sir Henry missed him with the lance point, and was in the act of being carried <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him by the career of his horse. But as he passed, King Robert rose up in his stirrups and struck Sir Henry on the head with his battle-axe so terrible a blow that it broke to pieces his iron helmet, as if it had been a nut-shell, and hurled him from his saddle. He was dead before he reached the ground. This gallant action was blamed by the Scottish leaders, who thought Bruce ought not to have exposed himself to so much danger when the safety of the whole army depended on him.

He did not question the possibilities of irrigation or take into account its remoteness; neither did he investigate the results of <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> efforts put forth by others in this conquest of the desert.

We asked one another whether it was true, that we, missionaries, Frenchmen, were really in the states of the Tale-Lama, in the capital of Thibet, sleeping in the very palace of the Regent. All these events, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and present, clashed in our heads. The future, especially, appeared to us enveloped in dark, thick clouds. How was all this to end? Would they say to us, \"You are free; go wherever you please?\" Would they keep us in this prison? or would they strangle us? These reflections were well calculated to chill the heart, and to cause a head-ache. But trust in God is a grand thing in such trials!

With humiliation I am forced to admit that in the recent past my noble profession has been to an alarming extent, and is still too much so, guilty of producing many drunkards in the land, directly or indirectly, by the reckless and wholesale manner in which so many of its members have prescribed alcoholic stimulants in their daily practice for all the aches and pains, coughs and colds, inflammations and consumptions, fevers and chills,...", "...a sane, dispassionate, evenly balanced man of the world, insured against sudden upheaval by a sense of proportion, and against depression of spirits by a sense of humour.\" Mr. Welwyn paused again, and there was another silence, punctuated by the rattle of traffic outside.

Moreover, the progress of linguistic analysis during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> quarter-century has strengthened the contention that some of the elements used by Flann (or another) in compiling his eleventh-century harmony are as old, in point of language, as any existing remains of Irish outside the Ogham inscriptions; in other words, being as old as the earliest glosses, they may date back to the eighth or even seventh century.

It has been suggested that if the age in which Casanova lived had been less corrupt, he himself might have used his all but universal talents to some advantage, but to our mind Casanova would always have remained Casanova. He came of a family of adventurers, and the reader of his Memoirs will remark how he continually ruined his prospects by his ineradicable love for disreputable company. His \"Bohemianism\" was in his blood, and in his old age he regrets--not his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> follies, but his inability to commit folly any longer. Now and again we are inclined to pronounce Casanova to be an amiable man; and if to his generosity and good nature he had added some elementary knowledge of the distinction between right and wrong, he might certainly have laid some claim to the character.

It had, however, fallen short of her expectations. Ontario reminded her of southern Scotland, and there was nothing to impress one who had seen the Highlands when the cars ran into the confusion of rock and forest, lake and river, along the Superior shore. Winnipeg in no way appealed to her, and she grew weary as they swept out <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> straggling wooden towns into the grass lands of the West. The towns rose stark from the prairie in unsoftened ugliness, and there was nothing to stir the imagination in the great waste of sun-bleached grass.

Causes of change had within the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> half-century been working underneath the surface of social life, and were rapidly undermining the whole structure. The growing use of firearms in war; the rapid multiplication of printed books; the spread of the new learning after the taking of Constantinople in 1453, and the subsequent diffusion of Greek teachers throughout Europe; the surely and steadily increasing communication with the new world, and the consequent increase of the precious metals; and, last but not least,...", "...development.

But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other.

RIVALS. |Mr. Gurth Egerton, as soon as he had recovered from the astonishment in which his strange meeting with Ralph's little daughter had flung him, became aware of the fact that the beautiful face of Ruth Adrian had made a considerable impression upon him. By what strange coincidence, he wondered, did this child cross his path at the very moment that he was dreaming of a new life--a life from which all remembrance of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and all fear of the future were to be banished? This little Gertie Heckett, whom he had always avoided seeing, lest such conscience as he was burdened with might be troubled, had come upon him not in the den of Josh, not leading the miserable life which he had imagined she might one day be reduced to, but well dressed, hearty, and evidently well cared for. His first thought was one of self-congratulation. He felt inclined to pat himself on the back and say, 'See, you have...", "...Mr. Charles L.

It brought back to me the times we had in the Everglades of Florida, and I told Le Marchant the story, but it did not greatly cheer him. Once that night, in our blind travelling, we stumbled out into a road, and while we stood doubtful whether we might not dare to use it for the easement of our bodies, there came along it the tramp of men and the click of arms, and we were barely in the ditch, with only our noses above water, when they went noisily <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> us in the direction of the prison. We made a better course that night, in the matter of direction at all events, but our progress was slow, for we were both feeling sorely the lack of food, and our way across the flats was still full of pitfalls, into which we fell dully and dragged ourselves out doggedly. We had been thirty hours without a bite, and suffered severe pains, probably from the marsh water we had drunk and had to drink. \"Two hundred kegs of fine French cognac we...", "...a bird chirped from the darkness of some overhanging bushes.

George felt the cool damp wind against his hot brow as he rowed doggedly on--past the lights of the windows of the inn, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the town, under the darkness of the bridge. He left them all behind, and his life and his love, he thought, and his mad passion; and himself, and Dolly, and Rhoda, and all the hopeless love he longed for and that was never to be his. There were other things in life. So he rowed away into the darkness with mixed anger and peace in his heart. What would Rhoda say when she heard he was gone? Nothing much! He knew her well enough to know that Dolly would understand, but her new...", "...from undated time they come, The martyr souls of heathendom, And to His cross and passion bring Their fellowship of suffering.

Granoux, as a rule, did not lie; but, on a day of battle, it is surely allowable to view things dramatically. \"I tell you the man tried to murder you,\" he repeated, with conviction. \"Ah,\" said Rougon in a faint voice, \"that's how it is I heard the bullet whiz past my ear!\" At this, violent emotion came upon the audience. Everybody gazed at the hero with respectful awe. He had heard a bullet whiz <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> his ear! Certainly, none of the other bourgeois who were there could say as much. Felicite felt bound to rush into her husband's arms so as to work up the emotion to boiling point. But Rougon immediately freed himself, and concluded his narrative with this heroic sentence, which has become famous at Plassans: \"The shot goes off; I hear the bullet whiz past my ear; and whish! it smashes the mayor's mirror.\" This caused complete consternation. Such a magnificent mirror, too! It...", "...with it. They could scarcely see the stones at their feet, except when, with the sudden summer lightning, the whole world of hill and dale and sea was revealed to them for a second, then shut out again as if in obedience to the immediate roll-call of the thunder.

My God, she thought, what had Michael said about the _Mino-gumi_? The Japanese mob. The taller man, she was soon to learn, was Kazuo Ina- gawa, who had been a London-based _kobun _for the _Mino-gumi _for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> decade. He had a thin, pasty face and had once been first _kobun_ for their entire Osaka organization, in charge of gambling and nightclub shakedowns.

Mute, overpowered, seized with a vague terror, unable to penetrate the dark depths of this man's soul, moved in spite of herself by the accent of sorrow, half feigned and half real--the young lady had a momentary feeling of doubt. For the first time, it came into her mind, that M. Baleinier might perhaps be committing a frightful error--committing it in good faith. Besides, the anguish of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> night, the dangers of her position, her feverish agitation, all concurred to fill her mind with trouble and indecision. She looked at the physician with ever increasing surprise, and making a violent effort not to yield to a weakness, of which she partly foresaw the dreadful consequences, she exclaimed: \"No, no, sir; I will not, I cannot believe it. You have too much skill, too much experience, to commit such an error.\" \"An error!\" said M. Baleinier, in a grave and sorrowful...", "...expect its repetition.

And when she stood still, a little frightened, to see a horde of Salvationists surge <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> her in the street, with discordant shouting and singing, waving of red flags and loud braying of brass instruments, this seemed to her a kind of solemn representation of those ancient and confused doings she had read about; beyond that it had no meaning.

Another order, the soldiers fell apart and enclosed the square in a double-ranked human fence. It was all so swift, noiseless, exact--like a beautifully ordered machine. It was noon, now. Two hours of stillness and waiting followed. Then carriages began to flow <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and deliver the two or three hundred court personages and high nobilities privileged to enter the church. Then the square filled up; not with civilians, but with army and navy officers in showy and beautiful uniforms.

Mrs. Franklyn leaned back on the sofa and closed her eyes. Some recollections of England had during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few months been very painful to her from their contrast to the present time.

It comes like a thunderclap. Are you very happy, Charlie?\" \"My God--she--she loves me!\" He sat down repeating the last words to himself.

If the bogey stopped to lick up a fallen leaf, she took it as a hostile act and wildly rushed <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him and scrambled up the rocks at the farther end of the den. This was repeated about fifteen times in twenty minutes, accompanied by a continuous series of terrified snorts. She panted from exhaustion, frothed at the mouth, and acted like an animal half crazed by terror. Not once, however, did the bogey bear pay the slightest attention to her, and his sleepy manner was anything but terrifying.

The glorious sky, the tender colours of the budding wood, the very dandelions on the untrimmed bank, contrived their hues to accord and rejoice with the laughing water, and the birds swelled out its song.

For the last three months our friend had not lacked matter for thought; to do him justice, he had exercised his mind upon it pretty constantly. To-day he had received news which gave a fresh impulse to his rumination.

The fact that James and Peter, lying side by side in the same bunker, had played respectively one and six shots, might have induced an unthinking observer to fancy the chances of the former. And no doubt, had he not taken seven strokes to extricate himself from the pit, while his opponent, by some act of God, contrived to get out in two, James's chances might have been extremely rosy. As it was, the two men staggered out on to the fairway again with a score of eight apiece. Once <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the bunker and round the bend of the road, the hole becomes simple. A judicious use of the cleek put Peter on the green in fourteen, while James, with a Braid iron, reached it in twelve. Peter was down in seventeen, and James contrived to halve. It was only as he was leaving the hole that the latter discovered that he had been putting with his niblick, which cannot have failed to exercise a prejudicial effect on his game.

Here all the great warehouses were desolate and deserted; he sat down quite breathless on the quay to recover himself, and think of the means of escape. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> midnight. The moon shone upon the broad stream and the tall warehouses on Bremen island. He felt oppressed by the death-like stillness around him. The wild scene of the murder in the alehouse was now solemnly and fearfully present to his imagination--he heard his heart beat; he wiped the blood from off his sword, and put it into the sheath.

It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the hour of ten on Saturday night, when a tall, powerfully built man emerged from what might be termed the fashionable portion of the city of Florence, and struck into the straggling suburb of Alla Croce.

The Duchess was dressed and waiting at two o clock in the afternoon. At half-past eleven that night M. de Montriveau had not arrived. To try to give an idea of the anguish endured by a woman who might be said to be the spoilt child of civilization, would be to attempt to say how many imaginings the heart can condense into one thought. As well endeavour to measure the forces expended by the soul in a sigh whenever the bell rang; to estimate the drain of life when a carriage rolled <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> without stopping, and left her prostrate. \"Can he be playing with me?\" she said, as the clocks struck midnight.

The ancient name of this remarkable relic of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> is unfortunately lost, \"Stonehenge\" being evidently of Saxon origin, and in no way connected with its architects; the tale told by Nennius, about the murder of four hundred and sixty British nobles, through the treachery of Hengist, being a later romance invented to account for its Saxon name, Stanhengist.

These cardinals, whose names he conceals \"in his breast,\" are for that reason called cardinals _in pectore_ (Ital. _in petto_). This practice seems to go back to Martin V., who may have had recourse to this expedient in order to avoid the necessity of soliciting the votes of the cardinals; but for a long time <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the popes have only resorted to it for quite other reasons. If the pope dies before making known the cardinals _in petto_, the promotion is not valid; if he publishes them, the cardinals take rank from the day on which they were reserved _in pectore_, the promotion acting retrospectively, even in the matter of emoluments. This method has sometimes been used by the popes to ensure to certain prelates who had merit, but were poor, the means of paying the expenses of their promotion....", "...substantial bars of oak, which descend vertically through the body of the revolving mill to within a small distance of the bed-stone; and upon each of the three arcs of that wheel-ring, comprised between its three strong arms, there are adjusted, in like manner, five similar uprights, which fit into hollows cut in the periphery of the moving stone.

Rising up, I find the chapar-lchana crowded with caravan teamsters, who, going <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> with a large camel caravan from the Caspian seaport of Eesht, have heard of the bicycle, and come flocking to my room; I can hear the unmelodious clanging of the big sheet-iron bells as their long string of camels file slowly past the building.

By-and-by it was my turn at the bat, and I felt kind of afraid, 'cause the comet's tail looked awful bright, but I seized it and swung it round two or three times, and it didn't burn a bit. 'One ball!' cried the umpire as the pitcher sent a star singing <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> me (and it wasn't fair, either,'cause they pitched it when I was trying the bat). I braced myself for the next one, and then that pitcher thought he'd fool me. Making out to snatch a ball from the Milky Way, he turned around, and, reaching 'way out, what do you think he did? Why, he grabbed our world, that we're living on, and threw it at me with all his might.

They have been in <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> times most active in opposing the introduction of the gospel of Jesus Christ into the villages over which they exercise an authority; and many of the popular outrages which have been committed against the ministers of the gospel, have originated in their suggestions or direct efforts.

In its warm and living application of abstract truths to daily ends, in its responsive and hopeful intensification of the nearness of God to Israel, in its idealization of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and future of the Jews, it employed the poet's art in essence, though not in form. It will be seen later on that in another sense the Midrash is a poetical literature, using the lore of the folk, the parable, the proverb, the allegory, and the fable, and often using them in the language of poetry. The oldest Midrash is the actual report of sermons and addresses of the Tannaite age; the latest is a medieval compilation from all extant sources.

And so the procession edged <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the bus, and was trailing upwards, curved solid against the sky-line towards the old church. From behind, the geranium scarlet was intense, one saw the careful, curiously cut backs of the shapen boleros, poppy-red, edged with mauve-purple and green, and the white of the shirt just showing at the waist.

Tommy's behavior seemed beautiful to the impressionable Miss Ailie, but it infuriated Aaron, and on the fourth day he set off for the parish school, meaning to put the truant in the hands of Cathro, from whom there was no escape.

But it remains true that this central and dominant scene is inherent in the very structure of dramatic writing. To repeat what was said before, the play that abandons climax may be good entertainment, but is by so much poorer drama. The best and most successful dramaturgy of our day therefore will seek to preserve the obligatory scene, but hide under more subtle technic the ways and means by which it is secured. The ways of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> became so open in the attempt to reach the result as to produce in many cases a feeling of bald artifice. This the later technic will do all in its power to avoid, while clinging persistently to the principle of climax, a principle of life just as truly as a principle of art. Physicians speak in a physiological sense of the grand climacteric of a man's age. A test of any play may be found in the readiness with which it lends itself to a simple threefold statement of its story;...", "...world is not merely a thing which God hath made, subjecting it to laws; but it is an expression of the thought, the feeling, the heart of God himself. And so it must be; because, if man be the child of God, would he not feel to be out of his element if he lived in a world which came, not from the heart of God, but only from his hand? This Christian pantheism, this belief that God is in everything, and showing himself in everything, has been much brought to the light by the poets of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> generation, and has its influence still, I hope, upon the poets of the present. We are not satisfied that the world should be a proof and varying indication of the intellect of God. That was how Paley viewed it. He taught us to believe there is a God from the mechanism of the world. But, allowing all the argument to be quite correct, what does it prove? A mechanical God, and nothing more.

This was not to be wondered at, as we had kept them on the go for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> thirty days, never once giving them a moment's rest day or night, and in that time they had very little to eat and no sleep.

He was young, and I <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> my prime; he in favour, and I a fugitive. To such reflections he put an end in a way which made me blush for my churlishness. For, suddenly awaking out of his pleasant dream, he asked me about myself and my fortunes, inquiring eagerly how I came to be in St. Cloud, and listening to the story of my adventures with a generous anxiety which endeared him to me more and more.

The superb edifices which he had commenced were abandoned by the builders; the benefits which had been heaped upon him in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> were changed into injuries, honours into insults. Many of those who had freely given him something of great value, now demanded it back from him as having been merely lent, and those others, who had been wont to praise him to the skies, now blamed him for an ungrateful and violent man.

He had placed no credence in the rumors, ascribing them to the imaginations of mischievous brains, prejudiced against Singleton because of his bluff, dominant manner. He first had suspected there might be truth in them when Joe Hamlin had told him that he had rustled cattle for Singleton. He now believed that Singleton had disposed...", "...knawed I'd come to gude; an' I'm grateful to un.\" During the evening Will was unusually silent and much busied with thought.

When the girl retired, Will's thoughts for a moment concerned themselves with the immediate <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> rather than the future; and then it was that he caught himself blankly before his own argument of the morning. To him the force of the contention, now that his position was magically changed, appeared strong as before.

The journey beside the Rhone - past Valence, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Tournon, past Vienne - would have been charming, on that luminous Sunday, but for two disagreeable accidents. The express from Marseilles, which I took at Orange, was full to over- flowing; and the only refuge I could find was an inside angle in a carriage laden with Germans, who had command of the windows, which they occupied as strongly as they have been known to occupy other strategical positions.

Everything portended a severe gale. Finding, at Mrs. Walsham's, that James was down on the beach, he continued his course until he joined him there. James was standing with a group of fishermen, who were looking seaward.

Thus for some time in Russia, as in Western Europe, \"a terrible war raged on Parnassus.\" At first the Government frowned at the innovators, on account of certain revolutionary odes which one of their number had written; but when the Romantic Muse, having turned away from the present as essentially prosaic, went back into the distant <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and soared into the region of sublime abstractions, the most keen-eyed Press Censors found no reason to condemn her worship, and the authorities placed almost no restrictions on free poetic inspiration. Romantic poetry acquired the protection of the Government and the patronage of the Court, and the names of Zhukofski, Pushkin, and Lermontof--the three chief representatives of the Russian Romantic school--became household words in all ranks of the educated classes. These three...", "...of my raid on the bicycle house. It appeared that the machine which I had borrowed was the property of a certain Major Hammond, who, when interviewed by the representative of the _Mail_, expressed himself of the opinion that I was a dangerous character and that I ought to be recaptured without delay. The narrative then shifted to my dramatic appearance on the bicycle, as witnessed by the surprised eyes of Assistant-warder Marshfield. According to that gentleman I had flashed <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him at a terrific speed, hurling a handful of gravel in his face, which had temporarily blinded him. With amazing pluck and presence of mind he had recovered himself in time to puncture my back wheel, a feat of marksmanship which, as the _Daily Mail_ observed, was \"highly creditable under the circumstances.\" From that point it seemed that all traces of me had ceased. Both I and the bicycle had vanished into space as completely as Elijah and his fiery chariot, and not all the...", "...a few public meetings by the way: and the next summer they undertook a more extensive religious visit--viz., to the six northern counties of England. In the course of the same year we find them meditating a further removal, into the immediate vicinity of London.

For some years <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> I have often thought the time might come when we might see it right to settle within Stoke Newington Meeting. This feeling now began (1845) to fasten more strongly on our minds than it had done before, and we thought it right to make an effort to let Gossom Lodge, and seek a residence at Stamford Hill; and we have reason to believe that in this important step our prayer has been answered, and that all our deliberations have been guided by that wisdom which is from above.

It may therefore be said that in the choice of the time and the scenes in which his action is laid, in the character of the action itself, and in the eminence of the personages taking part in it, Virgil fulfils all the conditions of his art which reflexion on the models of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and on the circumstances in life most capable of interesting the imagination could teach him. The care with which he prepared himself for his task is as remarkable as the judgment with which he conceived its main conditions. The conduct of his story shows the most intimate familiarity with the incidents and adventures contained in the Iliad and Odyssey, in the Cyclic poems and the dramas founded on them, in the Homeric hymns and the Alexandrine epic. It shows how Virgil so...", "...is no artifice in him; and yet no man has more of a prudent simplicity: his conversation was so pleasant and so innocently cheerful, that his company in a great measure lessened any longings to go back to my country, and to my wife and children, which an absence of four months had quickened very much. One day as I was returning home from Mass at St. Mary's, which is the chief church, and the most frequented of any in Antwerp, I saw him by accident talking with a stranger, who seemed <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the flower of his age; his face was tanned, he had a long beard, and his cloak was hanging carelessly about him, so that by his looks and habit I concluded he was a seaman. As soon as Peter saw me, he came and saluted me; and as I was returning his civility, he took me aside, and pointing to him with whom he had been discoursing, he said, \"Do you see that man? I was just thinking to bring him to you.\" I answered, \"He should have been very welcome on your account.\" \"And on his own...", "...ships and a gigantic dirty town. Are there not in Europe strong and powerful states hostile to England?\" Such questions were disagreeable for Heideck to answer, and he therefore preferred to avoid giving a definite reply. \"I have been in India for nearly a year,\" he replied, \"and know about such political matters only what the India Times and other English newspapers report. Of course, there is always a certain rivalry among the European great Powers, and England has, during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few decades, become so great that she cannot fail to have enemies; but on this point, as also on that of the present political situation, I do not venture to express an opinion.\" The Maharajah gloomily shook his head. \"Transact the business with this gentleman in the way you think best,\" he said, turning abruptly to his Minister, a wave of the hand at the same time denoting to the young German that the audience was at an end. As Heideck again stepped into the loggia he saw...", "...manners and customs her books described to her, but whose mortal semblances she had never seen? The Sleeping Beauty in the woods slumbered a century before the appointed hero came to awaken her. Beauty must wait, and wait patiently, for the coming of her fate. But poor Isabel thought she had waited so long, and as yet there was not even the distant shimmer of the prince's plumes dimly visible on the horizon. There were reasons why Isabel Sleaford should shut away the memory of her <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life, and solace herself with visions of a brighter existence. A little wholesome drudgery might have been good for her, as a homely antidote against the sentimentalism of her nature; but in Mr. Raymond's house she had ample leisure to sit dreaming over her books, weaving wonderful romances in which she was to be the heroine, and the hero--? The hero was the veriest chameleon, inasmuch as he took his colour from the last book Miss Sleaford had been reading. Sometimes he was...", "...and ants scuttering around,\" added Andy with his usual chuckle, as he peered over the lofty railing. On the way down, the attendant showed the boys a fine view from the dome, and pointed out many of the prominent buildings and towers that they had already passed in their morning's ride. As they paid the excellent guide in thanks as well as coin and went out of the great eastern portico, Tubby patted the front of his coat suggestively. \"Fellers, my feelings tell me that it is long <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> noon,\" he said. Rob pulled out his watch. \"For once your feelings are to be trusted, Tubby. It is one o'clock.

Fox looked blank. \"Didn't I? Is it possible that I omitted to state such an obvious truth?\" Sally nodded. She was looking <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him. \"Oh,\" she cried quickly, \"there's Henrietta.\" \"Another obvious truth,\" he murmured, more to himself than to Sally. \"There's Henrietta.\" Henrietta came quickly forward; indeed, she was running. And Sally met her. Sally was quick enough, but she seemed slow in comparison with Henrietta. \"Sally, dear!\" exclaimed Henrietta, kissing her on both cheeks. \"How glad I am to see you! You can't imagine.\" Which was a statement without warrant of fact. If there was one thing that...", "...At the banquet of 1885, the Prince of Wales was accompanied for the first time by Prince Albert Victor. In the speech in reply to the usual toast from the Chair, the Prince referred to his being accompanied by his son in a very different place from the Academy of Art. \"You, sir\" (addressing the President), \"have kindly alluded to our late visit to Ireland. I can only assure you that, if that visit was a labour at all, it was a labour of love.

I was sure that on going there we should meet with a kind and hearty reception, and such was the case with very few exceptions.

I had almost forgotten that I had a grandmother, when she came out, her sunbonnet on her head, a grain-sack in her hand, and asked me if I did not want to go to the garden with her to dig potatoes for dinner. The garden, curiously enough, was a quarter of a mile from the house, and the way to it led up a shallow draw <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the cattle corral. Grandmother called my attention to a stout hickory cane, tipped with copper, which hung by a leather thong from her belt. This, she said, was her rattlesnake cane. I must never go to the garden without a heavy stick or a corn-knife; she had killed a good many rattlers on her way back and forth.

Thousands of spectators lined the shores of the Strait on the evening of the 19th of June, 1849. On the land attachments being cut, the pontoons began to float off; but one of the capstans having given way from the too great strain put upon it, the tube was brought home again for the night. By next morning the defective capstan was restored, and all was in readiness for another trial. At half <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> seven in the evening the tube was afloat, and the pontoons swung out into the current like a monster pendulum, held steady by the shore guide-lines, but increasing in speed to almost a fearful extent as they neared their destined place between the piers. \"The success of this operation,\" says Mr. Clark, \"depended mainly on properly striking the 'butt' beneath the Anglesey tower, on which, as upon a centre, the tube was to be veered round into its position across the...", "...in April's train, Fixing my dying eyes for aye On the dawning brows of maiden May.

That motive was the thirst for fame, the craving to make his personality eternal in the minds of men. Meanwhile he was alone in a dim wilderness of transitory interests and sordid aims, where human life was shadowy, and where, when death arrived, there would remain no memory of what had been. The gloom of this present in contrast with the glory of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> he studied, and the glory of the future he desired, confirmed his egotism. His name and fame depended on his self-assertion. To achieve renown by writing, to wrest for himself even in his lifetime a firm place among the immortals, became his feverish spur to action. He was conscious how deep a hold the passion for celebrity had taken on his nature; and not unfrequently he speaks of it as a disease.[32] The Christian within him wrestled vigorously with the renascent Pagan.

This particular hymn is of great antiquity. Some of the chiefs expressed to me the opinion that it was composed by Dekana-widah or Hiawatha. Its tenor, however, as well as that of the whole book, shows that it belongs to a later period. The ceremonies of the council were doubtless prescribed by the founders of the League; but the speeches of the Book, and this hymn, all refer to the League as the work of a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> age. The speakers appeal to the wisdom of their forefathers (literally, their grandsires), and lament the degeneracy of the later times. They expressly declare that those who established the \"great peace\" were in their graves, and had taken their work with them and placed it as a pillow under them. This is the language of men who remembered the founders, and to whom the burial of the last of them was a comparatively recent event.

The basic Bessemer (Thomas) process, used for the \"minette\" ores of western Europe and the Swedish magnetites, may use an ore with any amount of phosphorus over 1.5 per cent. The phosphatic slag from this process is used as fertilizer. The supply of low-phosphorus Bessemer ore in the United States is at present limited as compared with that of the non-Bessemer ores, with the result that steel-plant construction for many years <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> has been largely open-hearth. The open-hearth process is favored also because it allows closer control of phosphorus content in the steel. Small but increasing amounts of steel are also made in the electric furnace; for the most part, however, this process is more expensive than the others, and it is used principally for special alloy steels.

And, to make the dismay of the novice stranger more thorough, questions were asked and answers were given in so low a voice, and Mr. Speaker uttered a word or two in so quick and shambling a fashion, that he, the novice stranger, began to fear that no word of the debate would reach him up there in his crowded back seat.

Then the novice stranger found that, though he could not see Mr. Daubeny without the aid of an opera glass, he could hear every word that fell from his lips.

It is from these monasteries that all the arts and scholarship of the eleventh century begin dimly to emerge.

After a further period of starvation and of listening to the noise in the shop, Flurry made a sortie, and, after lengthy and unknown adventures, reappeared carrying a huge brown teapot, and driving before him Mary Kate with the remainder of the repast. The bread tasted of mice, the butter of turf-smoke, the tea of brown paper, but we had got <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the critical stage. I had entered upon my third round of bread and butter when the door was flung open, and my valued acquaintance, Slipper, slightly advanced in liquor, presented himself to our gaze. His bandy legs sprawled consequentially, his nose was redder than a coal of fire, his prominent eyes rolled crookedly upon us, and his left hand swept behind him the attempt of Mary Kate to frustrate his entrance. \"Good-evening to my vinerable friend, Mr. Flurry Knox!\" he began,...", "...to tip the bottle.

George looked on, his hands in his pockets, his attitude expressing satisfaction at a just and long-deferred punishment. Slim smiled at Nora. He moved the...", "...environment waits, grim and unappeasable, and continuously destroys the innocent myriads who fail to meet the one requirement of life--Adaptation. So we must not be too severe in self-condemnation when we see how foolish, cruel, crazily wasteful, is our attitude toward crime and punishment. We become socially conscious largely through pain, and as we begin to see how much of the pain is wholly of our own causing we are overcome with shame. But the right way for society to face its <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> is the same as for the individual; to see where it was wrong and stop it--but to waste no time and no emotion over past misdeeds. What is our present state as to crime? It is pretty bad. Some say it is worse than it used to be; others that it is better. At any rate it is bad enough, and a disgrace to our civilization.

Taterleg pulled his hat over his eyes to shut out the sight of her, turned his head, ignoring her greeting.

When he entered the street again he found that it had practically given over raining, and the moon was shining brightly behind the dark masses of clouds that glided slowly after each other. Lamport looked up with an expression of relief, and his first thoughts were to make his way back to his lodgings as fast as possible, change his wet things, and sleep, if he could, over the events of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few hours. He changed his mind, however, and, hailing a cab, told the man to drive him to the quay. Why he did this it is impossible to explain. It was the working of that fatality which was leading him to the reaping of the harvest. Perhaps the knowledge that Dungaree was on his track induced him to do this. He wanted to think. Perhaps an indefinite idea of escaping, the forlorn hope of being able to get to sea somehow, moved him. And so he went.

But perhaps that was because his story aroused memories which made the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> live again. From this time the conversation drifted on to other subjects, and Signor Ricordo made himself vastly agreeable. Without in any degree monopolising the conversation, he became the centre of interest. He showed that, although an Eastern, he was acquainted with English literature, and although he spoke English with a peculiar intonation, he expressed his thoughts with great clearness. Olive said but little. The story he had told contained such a meaning for her, that...", "...sheer perfection, instinct with rhythm and significance.

With a bound he sprang <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the dusky shrubbery that hedged the lawn and overtook her, catching her in his arms. She did not struggle. He felt her yield, and strained the soft, panting body closer to him. Beneath his hand he could feel the hurrying beat of her heart.

Johnny sometimes teased his sisters by sending Rover after their dolls. Rover liked the sport, and came to think that dolls were his natural prey.

Not only is some knowledge of dialects needful for any true understanding of the history and character of our language, but the standard speech has in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> derived much enrichment and what is called 'regeneration' from the picturesque vocabularies of local vernaculars. The drying-up of these sources cannot but be regarded as a misfortune. We shall therefore actively encourage educated people, and, above all, teachers in country schools, to take a more sympathetic interest in the forms and usages of local speech.

We were more disappointed than I can tell you, but Mrs. Louderer merely went down to the river, a few yards away, and cut an armful of willow sticks wherewith to coax Chub to a little brisker pace, and then we took the trail of the departed mess-wagon.

On Thursday, July 18th, at noon, the Elizabeth was off the Jersey coast, somewhere between Cape May and Barnegat; and, as the weather was thick, with a fresh breeze blowing from the east of south, the officer in command, desirous to secure a good offing, stood east-north-east. His purpose was, when daylight showed the highlands of Neversink, to take a pilot, and run before the wind <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Sandy Hook. So confident, indeed, was he of safety, that he promised his passengers to land them early in the morning at New York. With this hope, their trunks were packed, the preparations made to greet their friends, the last good-night was spoken, and with grateful hearts Margaret and Ossoli put Nino to rest, for the last time, as they thought, on ship-board,--for the last time, as it was to be, on earth!

But it is due to England to say, that, since she withdrew from it, she has aimed to atone for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> by a noble and persevering devotion to the improvement of Africa. By repeated expeditions, by missions, treaties, colonies, and incentives to commerce, she has spread her light over the interior, and is now recognized both by the tribes of the Desert and by civilized nations as the great protector of Africa, and both geography and commerce owe to her most of their advances on the African continent.

Up to the present, our trial has been nothing; indeed, I can fancy to myself what our trials are to be. Come they may, but from what quarter I cannot form an idea: should they come, however, I trust we shall shew our gratitude for the past blessings, and our faith derived from <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> deliverances, by a devout submission to whatever the Almighty may please to try or chasten us with.\" \"Right, my dear,\" replied Mr Campbell; \"we will hope for the best; we are as much under His protection here in the wilderness, as we were at Wexton Hall; we were just as liable to all the ills which flesh is heir to when we were living in opulence and luxury as we are now in this log-house; but we are, I thank God, not so liable in our present position to forget Him who so...", "...turkeys, were horses and hounds; and as we rode forth out of the enclosure of the planter's dwelling, I noticed some half score of the latter--an appanage of every Texan plantation--trotting along at the heels of our _cavayard_.

I could form some conjecture, however--founded on a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience in the art of venerie. I remembered, while deer-hunting in the forests of the Mississippi bottom, that the hounds, especially when ill-trained ones, were often led away from the trail of the stag by that of wild turkeys; and that the birds, although not seen among the underwood, frequently conducted the chase, for a mile or so, across the hills. The turkeys would, at length, come to a stand, by taking refuge on the trees--thus leaving the hounds in a quandary, and...", "...they predicted our destruction: the floating luggage, by supporting us for a time, enabled them to make an exertion to save us; but as it was not supposed possible to survive the passage of the Cascades, no further exertions were thought of, nor indeed could they well have been made.

When the train began to move, the sense of what she had done smote her with a sudden terror, and she sprang to her feet, but sank down again, before any of the sleepy passengers had observed her motion. In a few moments she was calm. Her long habits of firm, energetic action began to resume sway: she compelled herself to look forward into the future, and not backward into the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> she was so resolutely leaving behind her.

I was at that time absorbed in the study of Plato, and as I walked, my mind occupied itself with many high problems and deep questions suggested by that great teacher. Lost in a train of profound yet pleasant thought, I strayed on further than I intended, and found myself at last in a by-path, long disused by our household--a winding footway leading downward in the direction of the harbor.

Each day his thoughts dwelt less on Mildred. He looked back upon the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> with disgust. He could not understand how he had submitted to the dishonour of such a love; and when he thought of Mildred it was with angry hatred, because she had submitted him to so much humiliation.

This conclusion is based on the assumption that our universe is like the spiral nebulae in which the orbits of the various members are nearly circular during the younger stages.

Never have I felt such a horse between my knees. His great haunches gathered under him with every stride, and he shot forward ever faster and faster, stretched like a greyhound, while the wind beat in my face and whistled <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> my ears. I was wearing our undress jacket, a uniform simple and dark in itself--though some figures give distinction to any uniform--and I had taken the precaution to remove the long panache from my busby.

The idea that a French officer might be riding with them was too...", "...and anaemic shop-assistants.

I have said that the people of Scotland will be quick to appreciate what you do. You know well that they will be quick also to follow your example. But the sign should come from you. It is more seemly that you should lead than follow in this matter.

What is said in these few pages may be objected to as vague; it is no more vague than the position seemed to me to demand. Each man must judge for himself what it behoves him to do at this juncture, and the whole Church for herself. All that is intended in this appeal is to begin, in a tone of dignity and disinterestedness, the consideration of the question; for when such matters are much pulled about in public prints, and have been often...", "...went in at the big gate and up past the kitchen door to the barn. Then the man unhooked the chains and took off the yokes and the oxen went into the barn and went to sleep. And that's all. VI. THE HORSIE STORY Once upon a time there was a farm-house, and it was painted white and had green blinds; and it stood not far from the road. In the fence was a wide gate to let the wagons through to the barn. And the wagons, going through, had made a little track that went up <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the kitchen door and past the shed and past the barn and past the orchard to the wheat-field. Not very far from that farm-house there was a field where the horses and cows used to go to eat the grass. That was the same field where they went to get water from the river; and in the wall that was between that field and the next, there was a wide gateway. At each side of the gateway there was a post with holes in it, and long bars went across and rested in the holes. And when the bars...", "...ahead Rokuzo could eye the massive walls of the moat, which hid the fortress and seraglio built up by the skilful hands of Kasuga no Tsubone in her earnest efforts to overcome the woman hating propensities of the San-dai-ke, the third prince of the Tokugawa line, Iyemitsu Ko[u]. Rokuzo was a _chu[u]gen_, servant in attendance on his master Endo[u] Saburo[u]zaemon, _hatamoto_ or immediate vassal of the commander-in-chief, the Sho[u]gun or real ruler in the land of Nippon since the long <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> days of Taira Kiyomori. Rokuzo had no great lady in charge of his domestic arrangements, one whose obsession it was to overcome his dislike of man's natural mate. Nor had he such mate to administer reproof for his decided liking for the sherry-like rice wine called _sake_. Sukebei had rigidly performed his part in the matter of the \"squeeze\"; but Rokuzo considered him decidedly stingy in administration of the wine bottle--or bottles. Willingly would he have sacrificed the...", "...and making a motion as though he were bent on accompanying Mrs. De Mille. \"No, Dickie,\" she said, firmly, \"bosses don't like to have young men a-followin' of their gells.\" This was said with an inimitable cockney accent that caused Mr. Thomas to grin appreciatively.

As she sauntered down the road that led <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the bungalow which had been erected in the rear of the Moore cottage, and which her new acquaintance had pointed out as his workshop, Jane looked as though she hadn't a care in the world. As a matter of fact, however, she was not without her misgivings in regard to the outcome of the engagement she had entered into. She had done it chiefly to torment the Willoughbys, but she was honest enough to admit to herself, as she walked leisurely on, that the man himself had aroused her...", "...so keep it cool. The entrance to Western Park has exquisite bronze gates. It is rather surprising, however, to see they are mounted with imperial crowns. The explanation is that they were originally made for Abdul Hamid, the deposed Sultan of Turkey.

Broad roads through this lovely domain, leading through avenues of trees and <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> radiant flower gardens, make the Western Park beloved of Mendozians. There is a band-stand; and on Thursday evenings, the whole place flashing with electric light, the road is blocked with automobiles and carriages, and thousands of people listening to the music.

Oh, that familiar old back! Something swelled in Split's throat and held her choking, as she grasped the banister and gazed yearningly down upon him. For a moment she had the idea of flying down <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him to save him from what was coming. But it was too late; already he had his hand on the door-knob. Did he know who it was for whom he was opening his door? Split gasped. Did he anticipate what was coming? Some one ought to tell him--to break it to him--to-- But evidently Split herself could not have done this, for in almost the identical moment that Madigan resentfully threw open the door, a stream of water was dashed into his astonished face.

She had already come to a degree of understanding with those about her that was sufficient as it regarded her ordinary wishes and wants, but of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> or future she had not means to communicate, her tongue was sealed, and for this reason her history must remain a hidden mystery to those about her whom she loved, and would gladly have confided in.

On Saturday night the German boy is turned over by the State paid school teacher to the State paid pastor who adds divine authority to the principles of reverence for the German system. There is a real system of caste in Germany. For instance, I was playing tennis one day with a man and, while dressing afterwards, I asked him what he was. He answered that he was a _Kaufmann_, or merchant. For the German this answer was enough. It placed him in the merchant class. I...", "...mutual attachment!

You remember the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> year, during our excursion to the Ruins of Oppenfeld--the borders of the great lake--our silent reveries during that magnificent evening, so calm, so poetical, so serene. Strange contrast! it was three days before that bloody duel, in which I would not take you for my second, for I should have suffered too much for you if I had been wounded under your eyes--that duel, for a quarrel at play, in which my second unfortunately killed that young Frenchman, the Viscount St. Remy....", "...of unorganized single combats in which the fighters rolled over and over, struggling ferociously with mandible and claw to destroy each other.

In that stage, the space-yacht was included in the battleground. Fights went on about its landing-fins. Horrifying duels could be followed by scrapings and bumpings against its hull.

Hence it results that the consciousness aroused is a multitudinous confused consciousness, in which, along with a certain kind of combination among impressions received from without, there is a vague cloud of ideal combinations akin to them, and a vague mass of ideal feelings of pleasure or pain that were associated with them.

ONE of my earliest village reminiscences is a vision of old Captain Garrow, in his old-fashioned, square-skirted coat, plush shorts, silk stockings, shoe buckles, and, to crown the whole, his venerable tie-wig. He was a character, the captain. He was a relic of a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> age, an antique in perfect preservation, a study for a novelist or historian. Born in Massachusetts before the rebel times, he had taken an active part in the Revolution; served as commissary, for which his education as a trader had qualified him; and the rank of captain which was attached to the office had given him the title he bore in his old age. When the war was over, his savings (very moderate, indeed, they were, for the captain was as honest as daylight) were invested in a...", "...and followed Cornwallis so closely that skirmishes occasionally happened between his advanced parties and the rear guard of the British army, but no conflict of importance ensued.

There Greene paused and meditated on his future movements. His army, like that of the British, for some time <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> had suffered much from heavy rains, deep roads, and scarcity of provisions. On reaching Ramsay's Mills his men were starving with hunger and fed voraciously on some fresh quarters of beef left behind by the British army. The troops were much exhausted and stood in need of repose and refreshment. Besides in that critical state of the campaign he found himself reduced to a handful of Continentals. Most of the militia had left him. Small as his army was he found great difficulty in...", "...face peering from beneath the upraised curtain out into the darkness.

Fugitives panted <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> us in the darkness, pursued by phantoms of their own imagining, thinking only of one thing--to leave that scene of awful slaughter far behind. The wounded toiled on, groaning and cursing, for to drop to the rear or to wander from the way was to die, if not by knife or tomahawk, none the less surely by hunger. Here and there some poor wretch who could win no farther sat groaning by the roadside or rolled in delirium upon the ground. The vast, impenetrable darkness of the forest...", "...Thud!

The officers rode back slowly, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the applauding tribunes. Eugene saw dimly that it was a colonel of infantry who rode Flambeau, a metre ahead of him, but his thoughts were more for Natalie than for himself or his successful competitor. Poor little girl!

We confess to a weakness that way. There is a depth of meaning in them which courts investigation from the strongest intellects. Even when they are nonsensical, which is not unfrequently the case, their nonsense is unfathomable, and, therefore, invested with all the zest which attaches, metaphysically speaking, to the incomprehensible. Astonishing circumstances had been raining for some time <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> around our bewildered adventurers, and, latterly, they had begun to pour. On the afternoon of the day, the events of which have been recorded in the last chapter, there was, metaphorically speaking, a regular thunder-plump.

This other throbbing sound, too: surely that must be some steamer far away on the other side of Rona? The sunset deepened. Darker and darker grew the shadows in the great mountains above us. We heard the sea along the solitary shores....", "...a queer method!\" murmured the Grand Duke. \"The man makes love by the almanac.\" \"Nay, dearest woman in the world,\" de Chateauroux went on, \"you loved me once, and that you cannot have quite forgotten.

But what a life is this of mine,--a life of dreary days, filled with sick, vivid dreams of our youth that is hardly <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> as yet!

Ah, but you were not often tender! Just for a moment I see you, and my blood leaps up in homage to my dear lady.

Insufficient as this army seemed, Wolfe determined to remain idle no longer; and a plan of attack on the town was agreed upon.

The troops had previously been landed on the southern side of the river, and in perfect safety they marched in the same direction. When they had proceeded about nine miles, they found the fleet riding at anchor, already beyond the reach or observation of the enemy. The point of attack Wolfe had chosen lay within a mile and a half of Quebec, and consequently this march had no other purpose in view than to mislead the enemy as to his intentions.

It sounded like several pairs of new boots all squeaking at once, but Mr. Vickers, who was a reasonable man and <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the age of self-deception, sought for a more probable cause. A particularly aggressive squeak detached itself from the others and sounded on the stairs. The resemblance to the noise made by new boots was stronger than ever. It _was_ new boots. The door opened, and Mr. Vickers, with a slice of bread arrested half-way to his mouth, sat gazing in astonishment at Charles Vickers, clad for the first time in his life in new raiment from top to toe.

No one was near except the good-natured sentry. I leisurely stepped beyond \"bounds,\" and, with a parting injunction to the soldier not to shoot when he saw me coming up, I stepped off down grade at a lively gait, and was soon winding down the horse-shoe curved road, which led me either to home or heaven, liberty or death. Before reaching the foot of the winding road, that led on <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the little house standing some distance below, I stopped a moment--only a moment--to plan. In those days my mind was soon made up, and, once I had decided a matter, I was always prepared to act upon it the same moment. I concluded not to go to the house--that I must avoid leaving any trail by which I might be traced. To accomplish this, it was necessary that I leave the road and clamber up the steep side-hill embankment, which was full of brush and thickets; by so doing it would...", "...help as it gave to the Long Parliament. Ireland on the other hand was ready to throw a Catholic army in the king's support on the western coast. It was doubtful too if in England itself disaffection would turn into actual revolt.

Above all the eyes of the nation rested on William and Mary. James was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> middle age, and a few years must bring a Protestant successor and restore the reign of law. But in the midst of the struggle with the Church it was announced that the Queen was again with child.

But Johnnie turned over her shoulder a shining face from which all weariness had suddenly been erased, a glorified countenance that flung him the fleeting smile she had time to spare from the machine. \"You're in worse danger right now from my driving than you are from their guns,\" she panted. As she spoke there sounded once more the ripping crack of a rifle, the singing of a bullet <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> them, and with it the flatter, louder noise of the shot-gun was repeated. Her eye in the act of turning to her task, caught the silhouette of old Gideon Himes's uncouth figure relieved against the noonday sky, as he sprang high, both arms flung up, the hands empty and clutching, and pitched headlong to his face. But her mind scarcely registered the impression, for a rifle ball struck the shaly edge of a bluff under which the road at this point ran, and tore loose a piece of the...", "...is too late; and now you sit in judgement on me. Why? It is not fair; it is unkind.\" Tears were in her voice, though not in her eyes. Major Waring tried to study her with the coolness of a man who has learnt to doubt the truth of women; but he had once yearned in a young man's frenzy of love to take that delicate shape in his arms, and he was not proof against the sedate sweet face and keen sad ring of the voice. He spoke earnestly. \"You honour me by caring for my opinion. The <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> is buried. I have some forgiveness to ask. Much, when I think of it--very much. I did you a public wrong. From a man to a woman it was unpardonable. It is a blot on my career. I beg you humbly to believe that I repent it.\" The sun was flaming with great wings red among the vapours; and in the recollection of the two, as they rode onward facing it, arose that day of the forlorn charge of English horse in the Indian jungle, the thunder and the dust, the fire and the dense knot of...", "...the other shifted like a thing of mist, and for a moment the clerk's head swam and his eyes seemed to fail. \"Then you are _dead_?\" he said under his breath with a slight shiver. \"Five years ago I left the body you knew,\" replied Thorpe. \"I tried to help you then instinctively, not fully recognising you.

One of them at once removed his helmet and waved it back to me. I was just putting on my helmet again, when the Germans--for they were Germans--fired at me again, and then dived in amongst the rocks. Their bullets appeared to whistle very close <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> me, though they may not have been as near as they seemed. At one point a lot of the enemy whom my platoon had gradually forced out of the rocks had to cross the open valley below, but they were then a long way off, and though we expended a lot of ammunition on them I only saw one drop. We also killed one black soldier at close quarters in the rocks, and I have his rifle, which I shall keep as a souvenir.

And in like manner she deceived Apollo too who longed to wed her, and besides them the river Halys, and no man ever...", "...night, and the clerk stood and stared after him. To say that Jabez Gum in his astonishment was uncertain whether he stood on his head or his heels, would be saying little; and how much of these assertions he might believe, and what mischief Mr. Pike might be going after to-night, he knew not. Drawing a long sigh, which did not sound very much like a sigh of relief, he at length turned off to Dr. Ashton's, and the man disappeared. We must follow Pike. He went stealthily up the road <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Hartledon, keeping in the shade of the hedge, and shrinking into it when he saw any one coming. Striking off when he neared the mill, he approached it cautiously, and halted amidst some trees, whence he had a view of the mill-door. He was waiting for the boy, David Ripper. Fully convinced by the lad's manner at the inquest that he had not told all he knew, but was keeping something back in fear, Mr. Pike, for reasons of his own, resolved to come at it if he could. He knew that...", "...reproached himself, that, after so great a loss, he could yet enjoy one painless, restful, indifferent moment.

He would paint them to his fancy in the liveliest colors, transport himself again into the days when they were real; and when standing on the highest elevation he could reach, when the sunshine of <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> times again seemed to animate his limbs and heave his bosom, he would look back into the fearful chasm, would feast his eye on its dismembering depth, then plunge down into its horrors, and thus force from nature the bitterest pains. With such repeated cruelty did he tear himself in pieces; for youth, which is so rich in undeveloped force, knows not what it squanders when, to the anguish which a loss occasions, it adds so many sorrows of its own production, as if it meant then...", "...generation of Exile, they mean no more than implication in the reproach and the punishment of the people's sins.[223] Nevertheless, as we have explained in a note below, it is really impossible to separate the suffering of a Servant, who has been announced as practical and prosperous in his suffering, from the end for which it is endured. We cannot separate the Servant's bearing of the people's guilt from his removal of it. And, indeed, this practical end of his passion springs forth, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> all doubt, from the rest of the strophe, which declares that the Servant's sufferings are not only vicarious but redemptive. _The discipline of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed._ Translators agree that _discipline of our peace_ must mean discipline which procures our peace.

Not only has it great snow peaks looming above the clouds more than two miles overhead; gigantic precipices of many-colored granite rising sheer for thousands of feet above the foaming, glistening, roaring rapids; it has also, in striking contrast, orchids and tree ferns, the delectable beauty of luxurious vegetation, and the mysterious witchery of the jungle.

It was well <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> nine o'clock, and two hours behind schedule, when a very limp and rumpled Lilly followed the weary straggle of weary passengers through the pale fog of the New Jersey station to the waiting ferry.

The stars floated round, now slowly, now quickly, in continually changing lines, and curiously imitated, to the swell of the music, the figures on the leaves.

Neither should be encouraged. Between more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion. We should have more revenue, and that without delay, hindrance, or postponement.

It will suffice while it lasts, but it can not last long while the outlays of the Government are greater than its receipts, as has been the case during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> two years. Nor must it be forgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve the situation, the Government is still indebted for the amount of the surplus thus accrued, which it must ultimately pay, while its ability to pay is not strengthened, but weakened by a continued deficit.

Was that last part, about his having warned all the dealers, thrown in gratuitously for my benefit, and to lead me to suppose that some one else stole the stone? If so, why does he now let me know that he saw me?\" CHAPTER XIII. MR. BARNES GOES SOUTH. Mr. Barnes now began some researches into the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> history of Mr. Alphonse Thauret. Obtaining the date of his first registry at the Hoffman House he found that to be about a month before the train robbery occurred. Finding the expressman who had brought his baggage to the hotel, it transpired that it had been taken from an English steamship, yet the name Thauret did not appear upon the list of passengers. As it was certain, however, that the man must have arrived by the ship, it was evident that \"Thauret\" was an alias. Mr. Barnes...", "...fastnesses a region of romance, and in their gullies and cloughs the grottoes and falls that to him were a veritable fairy realm. Child as he was, in the summer months he roamed the shady plantations, and sailed his chip and paper boats down their brawling streams, feeding on the nuts and berries, and lying for hours asleep beneath the shadows of their branching trees. He was one of the few children into whose mind Amos failed to find an inlet for the catechism; and once, during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> summer, he had blown his wickin-whistle in Sunday-school class, and been reprimanded by the superintendent because he gathered blackberries during the sacred hours. A few days previous to his disappearance in the snow he had heard the legend of Jenny Greenteeth, the haunting fairy of the Green Fold Clough, and how that she, who in the summer-time made the flowers grow and the birds sing, hid herself in winter on a shelf of rock above the Gin Spa Well, a lone streamlet that...", "...was fired by a sergeant, named Boston Corbett. When Colonel Conger asked Corbett why he shot without orders Corbett saluted the colonel and said: \"Colonel, Providence directed me.\" Thus the parallel runs. Booth claimed that he was the instrument of the Almighty in the assassination of Lincoln, and Boston Corbett claimed that he acted under the direction of Providence when he shot Booth. Booth was shot at about three o'clock in the morning of April 26, and he died at fifteen minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> seven. During that time he was conscious for about three fourths of an hour. He asked whether a person called Jett had betrayed him. His only other intelligible remark was this: \"Tell my mother I died for my country.\" During the afternoon preceding the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, Booth met John Matthews a brother actor, and requested him to hand a letter to Mr. Coyle, of the _National Intelligencer,_ the next morning. Mathews had a part in the play at Ford's Theater....", "...to miss this depot, we should nevertheless be fairly sure of reaching our depot in 86 deg. 21' before supplies ran short. The cross-marking of the depot was done with sixty splinters of black packing-case on each side, with 100 paces between each. Every other one had a shred of black cloth on the top. The splinters on the east side were all marked, so that on seeing them we should know instantly that we were to the east of the depot. Those on the west had no marks. The warmth of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few days seemed to have matured our frost-sores, and we presented an awful appearance. It was Wisting, Hanssen, and I who had suffered the worst damage in the last south-east blizzard; the left side of our faces was one mass of sore, bathed in matter and serum. We looked like the worst type of tramps and ruffians, and would probably not have been recognized by our nearest relations. These sores were a great trouble to us during the latter part of the journey. The slightest gust of...", "...\"Your son--\" said the elder lady. \"Take me to him at once, I pray you! Let me see him!

I knew it ere we stepped in.\" \"Dead! who says he is dead? He is not dead!\" \"Tell her,\" said Barton; \"she is heroic: let her know the worst.\" \"Take me to him!\" she said, as they remained silent.

She sprang forward--arrested herself when within a step of him, and gazed. The light passed from her own eye, and the warmth from her face; a spasm shook her, and nothing more. She did not shriek; she did not faint; she made no outcry,--scarcely a...", "...I saw my own dear mother. She simply took me by storm. I couldn't disbelieve her if I tried. I had always been an unbeliever in fortune-telling, but in the state of mind I was in I was ready to catch at any straw she held out. She took me into an elegantly furnished room, and the only question she asked about myself was the day and month of my birth. This I told her, and she sat down before me and closed her eyes as if going to sleep. Soon she began, and gave me as good a history of my <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life as I could have told her, without going into particulars more than she did. Of course I was then ready to gulp down anything she might say, and was tempted to run away and leave my future as it had always been to me, a closed book. But my desire to hear about my going home, or going to Texas was strong upon me, and I held my breath while she continued. She told me I was born to disappointment, that my plans had been upset as fast as I made them, and this would continue until...", "......\" \"Oh, the Government won't _abandon_ it,\" she said, with a little emphasis on the verb.

I began to eat unconsciously, pacing up and down the while. She was standing beside the table in the glow of the transparent light. Pallid blue lines showed in the long windows. It was very cold and hideously late; away in those endless small hours when the pulse drags, when the clock-beat drags, when time is effaced. \"You see?\" she said suddenly. \"Oh, I see,\" I answered--\"and ... and now?\" \"Now we are almost done with each other,\" she answered.

Yet her mother, more sharp sighted, soon discovered that her fair Nancy was much in love with their serving-man. When William was...", "...by storm; and to blockade a town of such extent seemed to require a land force three times larger than that which the duke had, and moreover a fleet, of which he was utterly destitute. Not only did the river yield the town all necessary supplies from Ghent, it also opened an easy communication with the bordering province of Zealand. For, as the tide of the North Sea extends far up the Scheldt, and ebbs and flows regularly, Antwerp enjoys the peculiar advantage that the same tide flows <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> it at different times in two opposite directions. Besides, the adjacent towns of Brussels, Malines, Ghent, Dendermonde, and others, were all at this time in the hands of the league, and could aid the place from the land side also. To blockade, therefore, the town by land, and to cut off its communication with Flanders and Brabant, required two different armies, one on each bank of the river. A sufficient fleet was likewise needed to guard the passage of the Scheldt, and to prevent...", "...Some of them, indeed, have never been committed to writing by the authors; for instance, of the beautiful sermon of Mr. ARTHUR, \"not a word\" was written by him either before or since its delivery.

Although myself of the Church of England, I have had many opportunities, during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> thirty-five years, of hearing discourses from Wesleyan ministers, and making personal acquaintance with them; and I believe the following Sermons are a fair specimen of the Wesleyan teaching in this country.

Anne of Austria fixed upon Buckingham a look so tender in its expression, that it denoted, not alone the indulgence of maternal affection, but a gentleness of expression like the coquetry of a woman who...", "...would reinforce from a purely legal standpoint the spiritual argument which they reserved for themselves to propound.

Trial of Turkish Believers Fortified by the reflection that never before in Baha'i history have the followers of Baha'u'llah been called upon by the officials of a State, responsible for the administration of Justice, to unfold the history and principles of their Faith, our brethren in Turkey decided to assert in their entirety those distinguishing laws and ordinances of the Baha'i Revelation which the terrors of a...", "...the influences that affect price movements, as explained in subsequent chapters.

Billions of dollars have been lost in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> by buying stocks that have become worthless. A few years ago a list of defunct securities was compiled, and it took two large volumes in which to enumerate them. New ones have been added to them every year.

The rafters had fallen in; what was left of the sides were dry-rotten under a mask of microscopic silver-gray moss. Tangled masses of wild-brier and lichens surrounded its base, and pushed their way in through the open, dismantled doorway. Even at that time, the road which once led <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the house had fallen into disuse. I suppose that to-day it would be as hard to find the house under the briers as to trace the ancient highway beneath the carpet of grass and sorrel.

I figured he'd come mogging along in half an hour and I'd have some pretty smart things to say. But when I got there I found the door open, and inside was Mark with his coat off and dust on his nose and dust on his hands, digging around among the stock to see what was there. \"There's enough st-stuff here for three bazars,\" he says to me like he judged it was _my_ fault. \"All the more to sell,\" says I. \"There's truck here you couldn't t-t-trade to...", "...enjoyment be the object of such meetings, nothing could be more absolutely attained than it was at this little fancy ball; for a scene of higher festivity and good-humour no man could desire to assist at.

For, proud as she was in her mother's heart of the bright young girl with her clever brain, the rankling fact was hidden there--her offspring had outgrown the nest. She could not realize that the age was mainly responsible for the lack of what she called \"proper respect\"--that mid-Victorian subservience. She held that what _she_ considered fit was the natural guidance for the girl; that the latter should shape her every thought in the mould of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> generation. Yet she, herself, had broken loose. It did not occur to her to weigh the question of militant suffrage in the same scales her own mother had used... Marriage had given her the right to an independent judgment, she thought--the full authority of the woman. She did not see that life had changed.

Who but the climber, the hill-tramp, knows the pang of regret with which he faces at last the truth that his favourite boots are <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> repair, the sorrow and self-reproach with which he permits them to be consigned to Erebus? I saw it all. As the Roman veteran hung upon the temple wall of Mars the arms he might no longer wield, so hither came some lofty-minded climber, bearing in devoted hands his outworn and faithful boot, to leave it sadly and with reverence in this most worthy resting-place, here to repose at the end of all the roads it had trod, on the highest of all the native hills it had climbed....", "...of it all, the pure-scented air, the voices of the birds, filled her heart with gladness.

The question was often put by one who slept--\"Are the three days <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> yet?\" and those awake gave him the answer he could not hear. Then some of them seemed to clutch his neighbour in his dreams, and call out, that he had now caught him, and would avenge on him the death of the Forester, accompanying his speech with a struggle, as if he were in the act of stabbing Gilmanscleugh.

The Korokh of to-day is between the mountains, but only some twenty-five miles from Herat. This modern Korokh has, however, many evidences of great antiquity, and it is on the high-road to an important group of passes leading <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Naratu to Bala Murghab and Maruchak. The most remarkable feature about Korokh is a grove of pine trees closely resembling the \"stone\" pine of Italy, which mass themselves into a dark blotch on the landscape and mark Korokh in this treeless country most conspicuously. There are no other trees of the same sort to be found now in this part of Asia, but I was told that they once were abundant in the Herat valley, which renders it possible that the \"arar\" trees, mentioned by Ibn Haukel...", "...most really important matter in this work is to be found in that place, for the sake of which I have considered it expedient materially to abridge my narrative.

Peto is the head of a department, of which Don Pio Perez was gefe politico. It was a well-built town, with streets indicated, as at Merida, by figures on the tops of the houses. The church and convent were large and imposing edifices, and the living of the cura one of the most valuable in the church, being worth six or seven thousand dollars per annum.

Only in one of these two positions do we ever seem to see the wings when we have to trust to our eyes alone, as the bird hurries <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> us. The impression that we have seen aright is confirmed when we stand on the deck of a steamer, and watch the gulls following in its wake. For incredibly long distances they will travel without a perceptible wing-beat. The albatross is the finest of all performers in regard to this kind of flight, which is due, apparently, to air currents created by stiff breezes, or gales. Some birds seem to make their way against a head-wind with the minimum of effort, by partly flexing the...", "...losing the way. About an hour and a half, not counting rests, is enough for the climb; and rather more than an hour for the descent. From the village, for the first ten minutes, we can take two alternative routes.

WALKING FOXHOUND PUPPIES. I believe I am correct in stating that no woman who has ever hunted, professes any other feeling than that of ardent admiration for the hounds which provide her with sport; but I would like to see this admiration take, among hunting women, the more practical form of walking hunt puppies, in whose future well-being they should have a keen personal interest. There are two maiden ladies in Ireland, who, although they have never hunted, and are long <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the age at which they are likely to do so, always, from sheer love of sport, walk a couple of foxhound puppies for their district hunt. We want, I think, more of this sporting Irish feeling among our sex, for I am sure that apart from all other considerations, a hunting woman would find more to interest her in the rearing and training of a foxhound puppy, whose career she could literally follow, than in spending money and time in clothing and nursing a useless pug or toy terrier....", "...let her know that Roger de Conde and the Outlaw of Torn were one and the same.

Edwards lays down, that a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> event is necessary, \"having already made sure of existence;\" but divine foreknowledge is such an event, and is therefore necessary. This is equivalent to the axiom, that whatever is, is.

For an actress must have one of the two kinds of knowledge: she must have either the knowledge which comes from a fine training--in itself the outcome of a long tradition--or she must have the knowledge which comes from mere living, from the accumulations of personal thought and experience.

There was something too obviously wrong with Jimmy's ordinarily fresh healthy-boy face; it had gone sallow and looked pincushiony round the eyes. I stared at him dully, but could not recall anything that might account for this alteration. Only very gradually a faint sense of...", "...waste, where the soul of man might hope to tread down underfoot him who, in the language of the place, is rarely spoken of by name, but indicated more gently as \"Chillo che sta sotto San Michele\"--\"He who lies beneath St. Michael.\" The pleasantest way to the Deserto is on foot.

In this case the syntax is of the usual sort. (1) _Have_=_own_=_habeo_=_teneo_; (2) _horse_ is the accusative case=_equum_; (3) _ridden_ is a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> participle agreeing either with _horse_, or _with a word in apposition with it understood_. Mark the words in italics. The word _ridden_ does not agree with _horse_, since it is of the neuter gender. Neither if we said _I have ridden the horses_, would it agree with _horses_; since it is of the singular number. The true construction is arrived at by supplying the word _thing_. _I have a horse as a ridden thing_=_habeo equum equitatum_ (neuter).

SPELLING The spelling of English words is not fixed and invariable, nor does it depend on any other authority than general agreement. At the present day there is practically unanimous agreement as to the spelling of most words. In the list below, for example, _rime_ for _rhyme_ is the...", "...flag flying on the roof-beams of the new house that was being built just over the privet hedge. It flapped gaily in the sea-breeze, and seemed to Miss Ethel's irritated perceptions an impudent flag, though she did not formulate her thoughts and was conscious only of a sense of annoyance when she caught sight of the bright patch of colour. As she glanced up the long hot road outside the garden, her heart almost failed her: but she had collected for the Flodmouth hospital for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> twenty-five years, and a strong sense of duty urged her to continue--especially now that the people from whom she generally collected were less able to give, and more houses had to be visited. But she was not uplifted by any feeling of self-righteousness, because it was just one of the things you did--and there was an end of it. It was a part of the system of life on which she had been brought up.

To choose such adventures for subjects and then deliberately to make no use of them and concentrate all attention on style and atmosphere, is really a _tour de force_, the crowning glory and the _reductio ad absurdum_ of this imperfective tendency. These extremities, which are largely conditioned by the whole <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> of Russian Literature, must naturally lead to a reaction. The reading public cannot be satisfied with such a literature. Nor are the critics. A reaction against all this style is setting in, but it remains in the domain of theory and has not produced work of any importance. And it is doubtful whether it will. If even Leskov with his wonderful genius for pure narrative has failed to influence the moderns in any way except by his mannerisms of speech, the case seems indeed...", "...an embalmed corpse placed erect. But the horror vanished when one gazed for a while, for an expression of patience rested on the uncanny face, the lashes of the fixed eyes began to quiver, the image became instinct with life, the chains swayed slightly, and the drops of blood again grew liquid.

Hundreds of wax limbs and silver hearts, consecrated bones and other anomalies bore witness to <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> calamities where the Wiesherrle had lent its aid.

The times of the Inquisition are not <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> for some people.\" \"It will take a little more than you to frighten me, you cur,\" said Westerham, in a low voice. Melun's face blazed with passion. He drew back a pace, and then struck Westerham heavily across the mouth. On his part Westerham did not hesitate for a moment. He lifted both his fettered hands and brought his steel-bound wrists down with a crash on Melun's head; and the captain went sprawling to the floor. \"Look you here,\" cried Westerham to the dumbfounded...", "...to her as she passed, demanding that she come ashore and show her husband, and among them she sat talking of other seasons and of the inroads of the lumber men upon their paradise. \"The Burnhams were this year on the shores of Grant Lake, the two school teachers from Pittsburgh would come early in August, the Detroit man with the crippled son was building a cabin on the shores of Bone River.\" Sam sat among them in silence, renewing constantly his admiration for the wonder of Sue's <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life.

So I begged her once more to be seated and to atone for all that was unkind in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> by letting me talk to her. There could have been no better place, outside of her cozy cabin, for this long-dreamed-of tete-a-tete, which now at last was to have a realization, than this she had herself chosen. The pile of pelts at her back kept off the east wind, the young moon in the west shone full upon her face, so that I could feast my eyes upon its glorious beauty (for the last time, I said to myself) and interpret every changing expression. And yet, just at first, I was...", "...if he was to keep the kindly feeling she had perhaps begun to entertain for him, he must resign his provisional authority into Ashley's hands and efface himself. To do that would be easy. He had only to advance by a few weeks his departure for Stoughton, Michigan, where he meant to return in any case. It was the familiar field of those opportunities in copper which he hoped to profit by again. Once he was on that ground, Olivia Guion and her concerns would be as much a part of a magic <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> as the woods and mountains of a holiday are to a man nailed down at an office desk. With a very little explanation to Ashley he could turn his back on the whole business and give himself up to his own affairs. He made an effort to recapture his zest in the old game, but after the passionate interest he had put into the past week the fun was out of it. Stoughton, Michigan, presented itself as a ramshackled, filthy wooden town of bar-rooms, eating-rooms, pool-rooms, and...", "...This changed presently to a shivering, weeping rage The wide portalled door of a house opposite opened, and a servant-girl came down the shallow steps to post a letter; I daresay she supposed I was unwell or a drunkard; and a passer-by might have concluded that I had an assignation with her, or had just had a quarrel. Then, when I had had a little ease of my anger, I pulled myself together and banished it again. Now that I had come, tardily enough, out of my fool's paradise of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> weeks, I had other things than purposeless anger to think of. I moved away from the railings; the maid, returning from the posting of her letter, quickened her steps to avoid me; and I walked slowly northeastward through the Square. Quickly I became calmer still. Soon I was calm enough to recognise that I needed this. \"What,\" I said ironically to myself, thunder-struck at a thing so very surprising! \"Did you think that because your head was in the clouds ... come, come, you'd...", "...he insisted upon sleeping on a little iron bedstead in the dressing-room close to our bedroom, to nurse me in the night.

Having been told whilst in London that novel-writing paid better than any other literary production, he now turned his thoughts towards the possibility of using his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience for the composition of a story. It would be a pleasant change from criticism, he said, and would exercise different mental faculties. Very soon the plan of \"Wenderholme\" was formed, and we entertained good hopes of its success.

His mind was in a whirl. Where would he land? How far had he yet to go? He comforted himself in the thought that there were no rocks or tree trunks to dash against, but if the soil at the bottom of the hill happened to be hard, his doom might be sealed. Already he could feel the jar and pain of suddenly coming to an abrupt stop on unyielding ground. Down, down he went, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the pack camels that were still slowly climbing the steep side of the mound, lucky enough to have been missed by the falling camel. Joe caught a momentary glimpse of his own dromedary, which was also rolling rapidly down. Suddenly he felt a severe jar and gradually came to a stop in the soft sand at the foot of the dune.

And this imagination the author had not at his call, in spite of his command over the more showy invention. It may not be without interest to consider how another writer of our time, not seeking for originality, happened to find it, and how his acceptance of certain literary patterns, so to call them--patterns inherited from the remote and shadowy <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> of our race--led him to an unforeseen effort of illuminative imagination, which suddenly elevated what he had done and gave it a significance far wider and far deeper than the author had foreseen.

One group deals with the boyhood of Mowgli among the beasts of the forest; and to many of us these linked tales represent the highest...", "...again.

Some were in process of design; others were represented by a few experimental machines. In the matter of engines, the factory was engaged in designing its own, and a few British proprietary designs had been tried, but without sufficient success to warrant an order. In fact, the Royal Flying Corps had to depend entirely on French engines, that is to say, on the 70 horse-power Renault and the 80 horse-power Gnome.

These troops, making a wide detour, swept <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Przasnysz on the east, and swinging round to the south of the city attacked the Russians holding the place from this direction. The Germans had understood that only small Russian forces were in the city. Anticipating the German movement, however, a Russian division, as the Germans learned later, had hastened to Przasnysz. The Russians also had collected large forces on the Narew, and were hurrying them toward Przasnysz on roads covering a wide front.

This is the third day that I have been attending the recitals of Sentius Augurinus, which I have not only enjoyed immensely, but admired as well. He calls his work \"Poetical Pieces.\" Many are airy trifles; many deal with noble themes, and they abound in wit, tenderness, sweetness, and sting. Unless it is that my affection for him, or the fact that he has lavished praises upon me, warps my judgment, I must say that for some years <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> there have been no such finished poems of their class produced. Augurinus took as his theme the fact that I occasionally amuse myself with writing verses. I will enable you to act the critic of my criticism if I can recall the second line of the piece. I remember the others, and now I think I have them all. \"I sing songs in trifling measures, which Catullus, Calvus, and the poets of old have employed before me. But what matters that to me? Pliny alone I count my senior. When...", "...and \"Pan in Wall Street,\" though composed in this same general period, are far more sober, deliberate, and genuinely poetical. In both Stedman dealt with the romantic rather than with the ridiculous or contemptible in city life. From the years of his work on \"The Victorian Poets\" to the end two developments took place. He inclined more to refine on the form of his poems, giving over at last all fluent satire, and he progressed in subject matter, first to what literature and the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> suggested and then, with advancing years, to considerations of age and death. The changes are not abrupt, but they are pervasive and evident. During the last dozen years of his life poetry could not be his natural form of expression, for the world was too much with him. A great deal of the time when he was not getting or losing on Change (he seems to have lost rather more than he spent) he devoted to service on all sorts of boards and councils of good works, speaking and...", "...and the chasm was not so wide. But for the young, and I was then young, the old seem at best a sort of benevolent ghosts, whose presence, more or less, chills and awes, and whose home is not properly with the younger generation.

They are puckered masks and glassy eyes, peeping from behind the door of the sepulchre that stands ajar, closing little by little to shut them in for ever. I am now but little <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> forty, yet I feel this isolation stealing upon me. I acquiesce in the law of nature, though it seems a cynical one. I know I am no longer of the young; I grow shy of them; there is a real separation between us.

Each came at the moment which closed the volume of the period <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and opened that of a new epoch.

If that which has held true in our <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience will therefore hold in time to come, it will hold not merely in some individual case, but in all cases of some given description. Every induction, therefore, which suffices to prove one fact, proves an indefinite multitude of facts: the experience which justifies a single prediction must be such as will suffice to bear out a general theorem. This theorem it is extremely important to ascertain and declare, in its broadest form of generality; and thus to place before our...", "...write out my last night's worke, which pleases me this day, but yet it is pretty to reflect how much I am out of confidence with what I had done upon Gibson's discourse with me, for fear I should have done it sillily, but Poynter likes them, and Mr. Hater also, but yet I am afeard lest they should do it out of flattery, so conscious I am of my ignorance.

He was born in Mexico, his father Irish, his mother Spanish. He had been a miner, rancher, prospector, hunter, etc., rambling always, and wearing his life away in mere waste; but now he was going to settle down.

I was trying to enter into Mac's festive humor, but I had not reacted yet from the horrors of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few months. \"Happiness!\" I said scornfully. \"Do you call this happiness?\" He put up the blacking, and, coming to me, stood eyeing me in the mirror as I arranged my necktie. \"Don't be bitter,\" he said. \"Happiness was my word.

But what an extraordinary wretched Bastille of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> was that aged Index, that senile institution now sunk into second childhood. One realised that it must have been a formidable power when books were rare and the Church had tribunals of blood and fire to enforce her edicts.

That, and that alone, had already saved him in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> week of horrible pursuit through the forests to northward.

If the bomb bay doors had opened it would have been the end of us as we were using the parachutes as pillows! When we got to Omaha, I left the other guys and took a train to Rochester. Somewhere in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> I had met an old sergeant who had given me some good advice about train travel. He said to buy a coach ticket and get on a first class car. By the time they came around to collect tickets the coach cars were so crowded they couldn't make you move. This always worked for me and I saved a lot of money.

Mysterious also is the pomp of ruin with which this revelation of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> descends upon that ancient house of Thebes. Like a shell from modern artillery, it leaves no time for prayer or evasion, but shatters by the same explosion all that stand within its circle of fury.

At that time the Bible itself was a fountain of inspired truth every where sealed up; but a whisper ran through the western nations of Europe that the work of Thomas \u00e0 Kempis contained some slender rivulets of truth silently stealing away into light from that interdicted fountain. This belief (so at least I read the case) led to the prodigious multiplication of the book, of which not merely the reimpressions, but the separate translations, are <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> all counting; though bibliographers _have_ undertaken to count them. The book came forward as an answer to the sighing of Christian Europe for light from heaven. I speak of Thomas \u00e0 Kempis as the author; but his claim was disputed.

And so, whilst waiting, Pierre stationed himself at an open window, conducting on to a balcony, and his eyes roamed over the endless sea of herbage to the far-away whiteness of Rome, above which rose the dome of St. Peter's, at that distance a mere sparkling speck, barely as large as the nail of one's little finger.

FOOTNOTES: [Footnote 73: Neal says: \"Certainly never was country more...", "...could renounce Valancourt. His reformation then appeared certain; the arguments of Count De Villefort were forgotten; she readily believed all she wished, and was willing to encounter any evil, rather than that of an immediate separation. Thus passed the night in ineffectual struggles between affection and reason, and she rose, in the morning, with a mind, weakened and irresolute, and a frame, trembling with illness. CHAPTER II Come, weep with me;--past hope, past cure, <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> help! ROMEO AND JULIET Valancourt, meanwhile, suffered the tortures of remorse and despair. The sight of Emily had renewed all the ardour, with which he first loved her, and which had suffered a temporary abatement from absence and the passing scenes of busy life. When, on the receipt of her letter, he set out for Languedoc, he then knew, that his own folly had involved him in ruin, and it was no part of his design to conceal this from her. But he lamented only the delay...", "...Lady Charlotte said, measuring them as they stood together. They turned at last. 'You shall drive back to town with me, Rowsley,' said the fighting dame. She breathed no hint of her triumph. CHAPTER XVIII A SCENE ON THE ROAD BACK After refusing to quit the grounds of Steignton, in spite of the proprietor, Mrs. Pagnell burst into an agitation to have them be at speed, that they might 'shake the dust of the place from the soles of their feet'; and she hurried <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Aminta and Lord Ormont's insolent emissary, carrying Mr. Morsfield beside her, perforce of a series of imperiously-toned vacuous questions, to which he listened in rigid politeness, with the ejaculation steaming off from time to time, 'A scandal!' He shot glances behind him. Mrs. Pagnell was going too fast. She, however, world not hear of a halt, and she was his main apology for being present; he was excruciatingly attached to the horrid woman. Weyburn spoke the...", "...were not like papa and mamma.\" So the pictures, being old, were considered worthless; and the motto being \"Each in its right place,\" the great-grandfather and the great-grandmother of the family were sent into the passage leading to the servants' hall. The son of the clergyman of the place was tutor at the great house. One day he was out walking with his pupils--the little barons--and their eldest sister, who had just been confirmed. They took the path through the fields, which led <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the old willow tree. While they walked, the young lady made a wreath of hedge blossoms and wild flowers, \"each in its right place,\" and the wreath was, as a whole, very pretty. At the same time she heard every word uttered by the son of the clergyman. She liked very much to hear him talk of the wonders of nature and of the great men and women of history. She had a healthy mind, with nobility of thought and feeling, and a heart full of love for all God's creation. The walking...", "...themselves in its depths, and have been the more secluded, like larks nesting at the bottom of a field of corn. Why, then, did he tremble so to-day, when the tip of his foot just sank into the grass? Then she led him to the forest. But the huge trees seemed to inspire Serge with still greater dread. He did not know them again, so sternly solemn seemed their bare black trunks. Here, more than anywhere else, amidst those austere columns, through which the light now freely streamed, the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> seemed quite dead. The first rains had washed the traces of their footsteps from the sandy paths, the winds had swept every other lingering memorial into the underbrush. But Albine, with grief at her throat, shot out a protesting glance. She could still plainly see their lightest footprints on the sandy gravel, and, as they passed each bush, the warmth with which they had once brushed against it surged to her cheeks. With eyes full of soft entreaty, she still strove to awaken...", "...son, who had only lived twenty-three years, and left him an old man--once again waiting, as he waited those long years in the Tower, waiting whilst others made or marred the fulfilment of his dream. Why was he thus often doomed to inactivity? Still he waited.... At twenty-three, the age at which his son met death in a Spanish ambuscade on the eve of a great discovery, with a shining future before him, he himself was fighting in Ireland, an obscure soldier of fortune. The days of his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life appeared before him, his Queen's favour, his Queen's displeasure, the high mark which he had touched, the low place to which he had sunk, his captivity, his renewal of hope through the gallant Prince who was dead, his freedom, and this last tremendous effort to bring greatness to his country, prosperity to his family; and he was still waiting, while Keymis and George Ralegh took the last great step. He would tell his wife of their son's death when he could console her with...", "...somehow that he never would. She was not a woman that changed her mind about things. Jove! but the whole experience had been interesting; and that kiss--that kiss he had been cad enough to misunderstand for an instant. ... The deepest blush of the day scorched his face as he recalled it. Miss Stansbury arrived at the front entrance of her hotel at the same moment, and tersely instructed the driver to collect his fare at the desk. She entered the hall with him, and walked indifferently <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the night clerk, answering with a nod the tacit question of that youth as he glanced from her to the cabman. She was not unconscious of the suppressed excitement in his manner nor of the elevator boy's relief as he joyfully greeted her appearance in his car. What did it matter? What did anything matter now? Her day was over. Miss Manuel, already informed of her arrival by a hurried telephone message from the office, was waiting for her at the door of their apartment. She burst...", "...gigs, chaises, phaetons, cabs, trucks, boys, whoopings, roarings, and multitudes. No tail-twisting is necessary - no iron pronging is necessary. There are no iron prongs here.

My name is Bull: yet I think I should like to see as good twin fountains - not to say in Smithfield, but in England anywhere. Plenty of room; plenty of time. And here are sheep-dogs, sensible as ever, but with a certain French air about them - not without a suspicion of dominoes - with a kind of flavour of moustache and beard -...", "...Biondello returned not. The prince could no longer conceal his impatience; he rose from the table, and paced alone, with rapid strides, up and down a retired walk. Nobody could imagine what had happened to him. I did not venture to ask him the reason of so remarkable a change in his demeanor; I have for some time past resigned my former place in his confidence. It was, therefore, with the utmost impatience that I awaited the return of Biondello to explain this riddle to me. It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> ten o'clock when he made his appearance. The tidings he brought did not make the prince more communicative. He returned in an ill-humor to the company, the gondola was ordered, and we returned. home. During the remainder of that evening I could find no opportunity of speaking to Biondello, and was, therefore, obliged to retire to my pillow with my curiosity unsatisfied. The prince had dismissed us early, but a thousand reflections flitted across my brain, and kept me awake. For...", "...alone in my study at half past seven?\" Just as her lips opened to answer me I saw a change pass over her face. I had kept her hand in mine while I was speaking, and I must have pressed it unconsciously so hard as almost to hurt her. She may even have uttered a few words of remonstrance; but they never reached me: my whole hearing sense was seized, absorbed, petrified. At the very instant when I had ceased speaking, I, and I alone, heard a faint sound--a sound that was new to me--fly <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the Glen Tower on the wings of the wind. \"Open the window, for God's sake!\" I cried. My hand mechanically held hers tighter and tighter. She struggled to free it, looking hard at me with pale cheeks and frightened eyes. Owen hastened up and released her, and put his arms round me. \"Griffith, Griffith!\" he whispered, \"control yourself, for George's sake.\" Morgan hurried to the window and threw it wide open. The wind and rain rushed in fiercely. Welcome, welcome wind!...", "...and said: 'Why, what time is it?' He took out his watch, holding it in his hand. Helena still held his left hand, and had one arm round his neck. 'I can't see the figures,' he said. 'Everything is dimmed, as if it were coming dark.' 'Yes,' replied Helena, in that reedy, painful tone of hers. 'My eyes were the same. It is the strong sunlight.' 'I can't,' he repeated, and he was rather surprised--'I can't see the time. Can you?' She stooped down and looked. 'It is half <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> one,' she said. Siegmund hated her voice as she spoke. There was still sufficient time to catch the train. He stood up, moved inside his clothing, saying: 'I feel almost stunned by the heat. I can hardly see, and all my feeling in my body is dulled.' 'Yes,' answered Helena, 'I am afraid it will do you harm.' 'At any rate,' he smiled as if sleepily, 'I have had enough. If it's too much--what _is_ too much?' They went unevenly over the sand, their eyes sun-dimmed. 'We...", "..._mustn't_ tempt me, Evan.\" What he would have said, with what eager pleadings he would have pressed the advantage gained by his appeal for the larger help, is not to be here set down. For at that moment the bamboo door curtains parted to admit the small house-mistress. \"You two!\" she scolded with light-hearted austerity. And then to Evan: \"Don't you know that we are keeping country hours here at Wartrace now? The professor will be up and calling for the car at six o'clock, and it's <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> midnight. Shame on you! Run away and get your beauty sleep--both of you!\" XIII THE LIEGEMAN Evan Blount drove himself back to the capital in the swift roadster the following morning, and there was no opportunity for further confidential speech with Patricia before he left. But with the new day had arisen, full-grown, the determination born in the moment of midnight heart-warming and inspiration. To the best of his ability he would live up to the high standard set...", "...his face with her clear eyes; she is very pale, and strangely nervous. \"My darling, my one thought is for your happiness.\" There is evasion mixed with the affection in this speech; and Clarissa notices it. \"No: say you are glad I am going to marry him,\" she says, remorselessly. \"How can you expect me to say that,\" exclaims he, mournfully, \"when you know your wedding-day must part us?\" \"Indeed it never shall!\" cries she, vehemently; and then, overcome by the emotion of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> hour, and indeed of the whole day, she gives way and bursts into tears. \"Papa, how can you say that? To be parted from you! We must be the same to each other always: my wedding-day would be a miserable one indeed if it separated me from you.\" Then he comforts her, fondly caressing the pretty brown head that lies upon his heart, as it had lain in past years, when the slender girl of to-day was a little lisping motherless child. He calls her by all the endearing names he had used...", "...finds in the failure of knowledge to probe the secrets of the universe the assurance of a transcendent power beyond human ken, the intuition of the higher reason which affirms God is, and the intuitions of the heart which promise that God is love, through whom is to come fulfilment of all human aspirations toward Beauty, Truth, and Love in immortality. If these are all points which have been emphasized, now by one, now by another, of the vast array of thinkers who have crowded the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> century, there is no one who to my knowledge has so completely harmonized the various thought tendencies of the age, and certainly none who has clothed them in such a wealth of imaginative and emotional illustration. In these last poems Browning appears to borrow an apt term from Whitman, as the \"Answerer\" of his age. In them he has unquestioningly accepted the knowledge which science has brought, and, recognizing its relative character, has yet interpreted it in such a way as...", "...children towards their parents, and felt the task of fulfilling them adequately to be so difficult that she was very doubtful how far Ernest and Joey would succeed in mastering it. It is plain in fact that her supposed parting glance upon them was one of suspicion. But there was no suspicion of Theobald; that he should have devoted his life to his children--why this was such a mere platitude, as almost to go without saying. How, let me ask, was it possible that a child only a little <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> five years old, trained in such an atmosphere of prayers and hymns and sums and happy Sunday evenings--to say nothing of daily repeated beatings over the said prayers and hymns, etc., about which our authoress is silent--how was it possible that a lad so trained should grow up in any healthy or vigorous development, even though in her own way his mother was undoubtedly very fond of him, and sometimes told him stories? Can the eye of any reader fail to detect the coming wrath of...", "...of revenue, and to a certain extent on the effort that it has made in providing this enormous sum of money from the proceeds of taxation and State services. But when this much has been admitted we have to hasten to add that the figures are not nearly so big as they look, and that there is much less \"to write home about,\" as the schoolboy said, than there appears to be at first sight. Those champions of the Government methods of war finance who maintain that we have, during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> year, multiplied the pre-war revenue, of roughly, L200 millions by more than 3-1/2, so arriving at the present revenue of over L700 millions, are not comparing like with like. The statement is perfectly true on paper, and expressed in pounds sterling, but then the pound sterling of to-day is an entirely different article from the pre-war pound sterling. Owing to the system of finance pursued by our Government, and by every other Government now engaged in the war, of providing for...", "...of Sarah, and another chapter of unusual length with the marrying of Isaac. Yet we can be at no loss to discover good reasons for this arrangement. It combines two forms of history--annals, and dramatic story. Annals are short, and necessarily somewhat dry; but they have the advantage of embracing much in comparatively short compass. The dramatic story is necessarily diffuse; it occupies a large amount of space; but it has the advantage of presenting a living picture--of bringing <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> events before the reader as they happened at the time. If the whole history of the Bible had been in the form of annals, it would have been very useful, but it would have wanted human interest. If it had been all in the dramatic form, it would have occupied too much space. By the combination of the two methods, we secure the compact precision of the one, and the living interest of the other. In the verses that are to form the subject of the present lecture, we have a lively...", "...a laughable burlesque on the blindness of anile dotage, than an analytic display of maternal affection in its ordinary workings. In _The Thorn_, the poet himself acknowledges in a note the necessity of an introductory poem, in which he should have portrayed the character of the person from whom the words of the poem are supposed to proceed: a superstitious man moderately imaginative, of slow faculties and deep feelings, 'a captain of a small trading vessel, for example, who, being <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity, or small independent income, to some village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been accustomed to live. Such men having nothing to do become credulous and talkative from indolence'. But in a poem, still more in a lyric poem--and the Nurse in Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_ alone prevents me from extending the remark even to dramatic poetry, if indeed even the Nurse itself can be deemed...", "...the night of nature, and with it came the march of tens of thousands of political lunatics, as brave as lions, though as incapable of discipline. My prediction was formidably fulfilled: the firebrand and the pike ravaged the land; blood flowed in torrents; and when the country returned to its senses, and the light of common sense once more dawned, ministers and people alike had only the melancholy office of burying the common offences in that great resting-place where the faults of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> generation are marked by tombs, and where the wisdom of the future is to be learned only from inscriptions recording the frailty of all that lived before. The conspiracy which it had fallen to my lot to extinguish had been brief and local. The half-Scottish population among whom it broke out, were among the most sharp-witted and well-informed subjects of the empire; and they had no sooner made the discovery, that government was awake, than they felt the folly of attempting to...", "...powder in his pocket in a thunder-storm, the better,\" added Jim. It took some time to bail the water out of the boat, for the rain and the spray from the river had half filled it. But the shower had cooled the air, and the boys were glad to be at work again after their confinement in the tent. They were soon ready to start; and rowing easily and steadily, they passed through the Highlands, and reached a nice camping spot, on the east bank of the river below Poughkeepsie, before half <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> five. This time they selected a place to pitch the tent with great care. It was easy to find the high-water mark on the shore, and the tent was pitched a little above it, so as to be safe from a disaster like that of the previous night. Harry wanted it pitched on the top of a high bank; but the others insisted that, as long as they were safe from the tide, there was no need of putting the tent a long distance from the water, and that they had selected the only spot where they...", "...and three or four huge crystal vessels of spirits, tulip-shaped, with gilded inscriptions and shining plated taps. Behind the counter was Miss Molly Palmer, the barmaid of the hotel, and, behind her, the alcove was lined with mirrors and glass shelves on which were rows of liqueur flasks, bottles of brandy and dummy boxes of chocolates tied up with scarlet ribands. \"Now tell me, Dicker,\" Lothian said, lighting a cigarette, \"how do you mean about Toftrees?\" The glamour of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> was on the unstable youth now, the same influence which had made him--at some possible risk to himself--defend Lothian so warmly in the drawing room at Bryanstone Square. The splendour of Toftrees was far away, dim in Lancaster Gate. \"Oh, he's jealous of you because you really can write, Gilbert! That must be it. But he really has got his knife into you!\" Internally, Lothian winced. \"Oh, but I assure you he has not,\" was all that he said. Ingworth finished his whiskey and...", "...in this world. Meanwhile, Al'mah was a woman who, like herself, had suffered. \"Let me be your friend; let me help you,\" Jasmine said, and she took both of Almah's hands in her own. Somehow Jasmine's own heart had grown larger, fuller, and kinder all at once. Until lately she had never ached to help the world or any human being in all her life; there had never been any of the divine pity which finds its employ in sacrifice. She had been kind, she had been generous, she had in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few months given service unstinted; but it was more as her own cure for her own ills than yearning compassion for all those who were distressed \"in mind, body, or estate.\" But since last evening, in the glimmer of the stars, when Rudyard went from her with bitter anger on his lips, and a contempt which threw her far behind him,--since that hour, when, in her helplessness, she had sunk to the ground with an appeal to Something outside herself, her heart had greatly softened....", "...to be sure would have let no snow through if the distance to be travelled had been twice as far. As she folded and arranged the thick stuff round Nettie's head, so as to shield even her face from the outer air, she said, half whispering-- \"I would not tell nothing to mother about your lip; it is not much.

He never said a word the whole way. Nettie was too muffled up, and too feeble to speak; so the first word was when he had come in and sat down in a chair, which he did with Nettie still in his arms. Mrs. Mathieson, standing white and silent, waited to see what was the matter; she had no power to ask a question. Her husband unfolded the counterpane that was wrapped round Nettie's head; and there she was, looking...", "...and it was expressly stated in the deed of appointment that these emoluments were conferred on Dryden \"in consideration of his many acceptable services done to his majesty, and from an observation of his learning and eminent abilities, and his great skill and elegant style both in verse and prose.\" At the time of the Restoration, or even for a year or two after it, such language could, by no stretch of courtesy, have been applied to Dryden. At that time, as we have seen, though already <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> his thirtieth year, he was certainly about the least distinguished person in the little band of wits that were looking forward to the good time coming. He was a stout, fresh-complexioned man, in grey drugget, who had written some robust stanzas on Cromwell's death, and a short poem, also robust, but rather wooden, on Charles's return. That was about all that was then known about him. What had he done, in the interval, to raise him so high, and to make it natural for the Court to...", "...with almost trembling solicitude, when alone with her brother, he informed her of the proposal Mr. Wynne had made--and he had unhesitatingly accepted--that he and his friend Mr. Temple should join their party during the succeeding week's tour. \"Not if it is disagreeable to you, Mary, certainly,\" was the brother's reply; \"otherwise I must say I can see no objection to the plan; nor does Mr. Wynne either it seems, as he made the proposal, being of course aware by this time of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> circumstances respecting you and Temple. All that of course is an affair over and forgotten, particularly when made aware how matters stand with regard to your engagement with Trevor; so on your part, you will have nothing to fear. It only rests with him, I should think, to determine whether he is equal to the ordeal of your society, though to judge by his countenance just now, firm and calm as a statue, after a meeting which must have put his feelings rather to the test, I should...", "...from their country, flying for their lives, bereft of all which centuries of luxury had given them, there stood a fair scion of those same republican families which had hurled down a throne, and uprooted an aristocracy whose origin was lost in the dim and distant vista of bygone centuries.

Their ideals, their...", "...are present somehow in _Wuthering Heights_, in spite of its monstrous formlessness. Emily may have had no more sense of form for form's sake than Charlotte; she may have had no more dramatic instinct; but she had an instinct for the ways of human passion. She knew that passion runs its course, from its excitement to its climax and exhaustion. It has a natural beginning and a natural end. And so her scenes of passion follow nature. She never goes back on her effect, never urges passion <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> its climax, or stirs it in its exhaustion. In this she is a greater \"realist\" than Charlotte. * * * * * It is incredible that _Wuthering Heights_, or any line of it, any line that Emily Bronte ever wrote, should have passed for Charlotte's.

When Saniez sang he seemed to lift himself into a different atmosphere; he was back again in France; his songs all seemed about his country and his home.

It would be so easy to teach the mere craft of painting at the academies, without incessantly talking about Michael Angelo, and Raphael, and Murillo, and Domenichino.

He doesn't bite?\" \"Oh--oh, no, ma'am. He only nibbles.\" Then she called the dog and the woman went on, relieved. But when her fright was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> she probably confessed to herself that the smallest Corner House girl certainly had originality of ideas.

He felt weak and ill, and for the first time a thrill of fear shot through his heart. Toward evening he dined exiguously on a dish of milk and porridge, and remembered hazily a dispute with the waiter on the question of a tip. He went out into the streets. A slender curve of moon rode in a sky of ice, the air was bitter cold, a sharp wind eddied round the corners of the streets, and took him by the throat. He walked on and on, with the illusion of the city slipping <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him like a river full of glittering reflections, himself treading upon air. Once he found himself shambling; it horrified him, for it was so that tramps and outcasts walked. A little later he found himself gazing on the bread-line; he stood an instant in fascinated pity, and fled. About midnight he found himself once more before the doors of the old Astor House, and felt that he could walk no farther. He gathered courage to enter, and blessed the undesigned humanitarianism of...", "...which could not be macadamized. It would seem as if this system had been rather successful, since there has not been this year a single case of fever in the _personnel_ of the new military college, established in the Salviati Palace; while in the Corsimi Palace, which is situated on the same side of the Via della Longara, but which looks out upon that part of the Janiculum which is still uncovered, there have been some fatal cases of fever. Furthermore, we have had in Rome, during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few years, some very evident proofs of the efficacy of atmospheric methods of purification. I will confine myself to the relation here only of the most striking instance, one which has been furnished us in the building up of new quarters of the city.

Deliberately fill your mind and hands so full of other things that there will be no room for these unwholesome pests. Worry does more harm than smallpox ever did!

Another way some abuse themselves is by continuing the association with those who excite or irritate them.

The signs of <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> emotion were not quite obliterated from her face. \"Mamma, you have been crying.\" It was of no use to deny it; indeed the sudden accusation brought up fresh tears then. Painful matters had been kept as much as possible from Henry; but he could not avoid knowing of the general embarrassments: unavoidable, and, so to speak, honourable embarrassments. \"What is it now?\" he urgently asked. \"Nothing new; only the old troubles over and over again.

So with doublings and turnings he came at last on the Delhi gate, a small, round, flat-roofed building pierced by a high archway. It was too dark for him to see its outline, but he knew it well, and paused against the outside wall to consider what he had to do next. The place seemed almost deserted, but a glimmer of light from the archway and the even tramp of a sentry's footstep told it was not all unguarded. What was he to do? It would be useless for him to try and steal <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the sentry, as the gate beyond must be locked, or at any rate bolted and barred. He must either, therefore, try and overpower the man or else try to gain the flat roof by the stairs--of which he knew the position--and, trusting to find a rope or something of the sort in the upper room of the gate, let himself down into the ditch outside.

He was only half conscious of his surroundings; he was moving in a kind of detached world of his own, where the warders and the Sheriff and those who followed were almost abstract and unreal figures. He was living with a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> which had been everlasting distant, and had now become a vivid and buffeting present. He returned no answers to the questions addressed to him, and would not talk, save when for a little while they dismounted from their horses, and sat under the shade of a great ash-tree for a few moments, and snatched a mouthful of luncheon.

The keeper sat on a chair facing her, and on a chair beside him sat Wiggins looking white and woebegone.

The figure of a man was plainly to be seen, stealing along in the shadows of the clumps of bushes.

But I could not stop here, because the best room in the inn was already occupied by a military officer of some distinction, a colonel, on his way, like ourselves, to Tengyueh. An official chair with arched poles fitted for four bearers was in the common-room; the mules of his attendants were in the stables, and...", "...he was out of a job. Dennis had been, at various times in his life, subjected to some rugged experiences, but could not recall any treatment quite so heartless as this. It upset all his calculations. He must exist somehow between the unhappy realities of the present and the blissful expectations of the approaching Monday. He recalled, with the self-accusation of a repentant prodigal, his needlessly elaborate breakfast, the extravagance of the necktie. His return led him <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the cheap amusement district of the Bowery. Never had their tawdry invitations seemed so alluring. By that singular perversity which opens up every suggestion of riotous expenditure to destitution, the poor fellow felt inclined to indulge himself regardless.

We've changed that much from the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> generation. We know what to do with leisure in the evening. But we're still awkward and embarrassed when we meet it by daylight. Since we have built our Country Club, a few of us have learned to enjoy ourselves in a fitful and guilty fashion late in the afternoon. But as a rule, even to-day, when you give a Homeburg man a bright golden daylight hour of leisure, he has no more use for it than he would have for a five-ton white elephant with an appetite for ice-cream.

One such theory held that an object is recognized by recalling its original setting in past experience; an odor would be recognized by virtue of recalling the circumstances under which it was formerly experienced. Now sometimes it does happen that an odor which seems familiar, but cannot be identified, calls up a past experience and thus is fully recognized; but such \"indirect recognition\" is not the usual thing, for direct recognition commonly takes place before recall of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience has time to occur. You see a person, and know him at once, though it may require some moments before you can recall where and when you have seen him before. Recognition may be more or less complete. At its minimum, it is simply a \"feeling of familiarity\" with the object; at its maximum it is locating the object precisely in your autobiography. You see a man, and say, \"He looks {358} familiar, I must have seen him somewhere\", and then it dawns on you, \"Oh! yes, now I...", "...\"shall be forsaken,\"--there is an inimitable paronomasia in his words[11]--\"And Ascalon a desolation: as for Ashdod, at noonday they shall drive her into exile; and Ekron shall be rooted up.

But neither is this very probable in itself, nor does it harmonize with what he tells us afterwards about the plunder and rapine that marked the period of Scythian domination.

THE PRESIDENT AND THE KAISER During the first years of Roosevelt's Administration he had to encounter many conditions which existed rather from the momentum they had from the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> than from any living vigor of their own. It was a time of transition. The group of politicians dating from the Civil War was nearly extinct, and the leaders who had come to the front after 1870 were also much thinned in number, and fast dropping off.

It would seem that this grandmother was not just a gifted stroy-teller, but might also have invented a more romantic <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> for herself, which she then passed off as the truth to her family, just as Karl May later also pretended that his fictional novels were true. Karl May writes that this grandmother lost her mother at an early age. She fell in love with his grandfather, but felt obliged to devote all of her energy to taking care of her ailing father.

The image is due to your <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience, as well as to the present stimulus of the words \"New York.\" Similarly, the images you have in dreams are all dependent upon your past experience, as well as upon the present stimulus to dreaming. It is generally believed that all images, in their simpler parts, are copies of sensations; if so, their mnemic character is evident. This is important, not only on its own account, but also because, as we shall see later, images play an essential part in what is called...", "...our speed to less than a four-minute gait. As we rode along at this exhilarating pace, the buggy whirling around acute curves among the mighty oaks and maples, now and then dashing down a forty-five-degree descent of fifty or sixty feet, again thundering over a dilapidated bridge of resonant planks, the doctor remarked to me that Peters was certain to die, it being only a question of days, or perhaps of hours. \"Old Peters,\" he said, \"has been without visible means of support for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> two or three years. The Lord only knows how he has lived since the period when he became unable to work. Even his small farm is mortgaged for all it is worth.\" I expressed to the doctor some surprise that he should be making twenty-mile drives to see a lonely old man whose illness he was unable to relieve, and from whom he could expect no fee. I had grown to take an interest in hearing Castleton express his opinions. Many of his conceptions of life were so unique; his mental...", "...White House till the last. The White House, which Cynthia thought the finest and most graceful mansion in all the world, in its simplicity and dignity, a fitting dwelling for the chosen of the nation. Under the little tree which Jethro had mentioned, Ephraim stood bareheaded before the walls which had sheltered Lincoln, which were now the home of the greatest of his captains, Grant: and wondrous emotions played upon the girl's spirit, too, as she gazed. They forgot the present in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and the future, and they did not see the two gentlemen who had left the portico some minutes before and were now coming toward them along the sidewalk. The two gentlemen, however, slowed their steps involuntarily at a sight which was uncommon, even in Washington. The girl's arm was in the soldier's, and her face, which even in repose had a true nobility, now was alight with an inspiration that is seen but seldom in a lifetime. In marble, could it have been wrought by a great...", "...garrisoned, the little town had at least a good English officer in charge--Major Mascarene, of Huguenot descent. The French offered terms of capitulation, threatening the arrival of more troops from Louisbourg; but these reinforcements did not arrive, the Acadians did not rise in mass, and in September the besiegers disappeared, having effected nothing. [Sidenote: _New England and Acadia._] Neglected by the British Government, Acadia was valued by New England. Massachusetts had in <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> years taken and held Port Royal, and knew well that English interests in America were not compatible with the French regaining the Acadian peninsula. The taking of Canso, the attempt {198} to take Port Royal or Annapolis, roused the 'Bostonnais,' and led to an enterprise second to none in colonial history.

When they had all entered the house the boys, as usual, were anxious to know of each other's success during the day. Not only had Frank, as we have described, gone out to his traps, but Sam and Alec had also driven some miles to the places where they, apart from each other, were also trying their skill in trapping various kinds of fur-bearing animals. Sam had gone out for several days <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> in company with a son of Memotas. He was a bright young fellow, and he and Sam had suddenly become very confidential. It was evident that they had some great scheme on between them. What it was nobody seemed quite able to make out, and so their curiosity was much excited, especially when Sam had been seen in close converse with the cook, and had then, after a hasty visit to the cellar, hurried away with young Memotas. To make matters worse, Sam had dropped a couple of large...", "...for our honey, and often a whole bee-city--all its buildings, all its inhabitants--has been ruthlessly destroyed, merely because a senseless animal wanted to satisfy its greed for honey.\" That is what Cassandra had told Maya about human beings, and until Maya had convinced herself of the contrary, she wanted to keep this belief in them. It was now afternoon. The sun was dropping behind the fruit trees in a large vegetable garden through which Maya was flying. The trees were long <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> flowering, but the little bee still remembered them in the shining glory of countless blossoms, whiter than light, lovely, pure, and exquisite against the blue of the heavens. The delicious perfume, the gleam and the shimmer--oh, she'd never forget the rapture of it as long as she lived. As she flew she thought of how all that beauty would come again, and her heart expanded with delight in the glory of the great world in which she was permitted to live. At the end of the...", "...Thaine agreed. \"So many things, I needn't name them all, bad crops, bad faith on the part of others, bad luck and bad judgment and bad health, for all his size, have helped till he is ready to go hopeless, and Uncle Jim's only fifty-one.

The vain attempt Werther had made to save the unhappy murderer was the last feeble glimmering of a flame about to be extinguished. He sank almost immediately afterwards into a state of gloom and inactivity, until he was at length brought to perfect distraction by learning that he was to be summoned as a witness against the prisoner, who asserted his complete innocence. His mind now became oppressed by the recollection of every misfortune of his <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> life. The mortification he had suffered at the ambassador's, and his subsequent troubles, were revived in his memory. He became utterly inactive. Destitute of energy, he was cut off from every pursuit and occupation which compose the business of common life; and he became a victim to his own susceptibility, and to his restless passion for the most amiable and beloved of women, whose peace he destroyed. In this unvarying monotony of existence his days were consumed; and his powers...", "...to rise A melancholy fragrance of dead dogs unto the skies. IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.

To be ill-used, as one poor, friendless, and ignoble, is no more than the complement of your condition. It is in the fitness of things that pauperism, which we English have declared to be illegal, should neither be fondled nor caressed. To be ill-used profitably there must be something pictorial in your case; it must have its reliefs of light as well as shade. There must be little touches, a bright \"has been,\" sunny spots of a happy <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> Without the force of these contrasts, there is no possibility of establishing the grand grievance which is embodied in ill-usage. Now, Mr B.

What constitutes proper payment? Every career in life carries with it some circumstance either...", "...victims. Uncle Jim shook his head. \"Trailer,\" said he sadly, \"is a little severe.\" We agreed heartily, and turned in to welcome Uncle Jim with a fresh batch of soda biscuits. The old man was one of the typical \"long hairs.\" He had come to the Galiuro Mountains in '69, and since '69 he had remained in the Galiuro Mountains, spite of man or the devil. At present he possessed some hundreds of cattle, which he was reputed to water, in a dry season, from an ordinary dish pan. In times <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> he had prospected. That evening, the severe Trailer having dropped to slumber, he held forth on big-game hunting and dogs, quartz claims and Apaches. \"Did you ever have any very close calls?\" I asked. He ruminated a few moments, refilled his pipe with some awful tobacco, and told the following experience: \"In the time of Geronimo I was living just about where I do now; and that was just about in line with the raiding. You see, Geronimo, and Ju, and old Loco used to pile...", "...uncertainly. \"Don't look at me like that, PLEASE!\" \"You were crying,\" he said abruptly. He stood before her, obviously one who had conquered the respect of the world in fair, open battle, and has the courage that is for those only who have tested their strength and know it will not fail them. And the sight of him, the look of him, filled her not with the mere belief, but with the absolute conviction that no malign power in all the world or in the mystery round the world could come <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> him to her to harass or harm her. The doubts, the sense of desolation that had so agitated her a few minutes before now seemed trivial, weak, unworthy. She lowered her eyes--she had thought he would not observe the slight traces of the tears she had carefully wiped away. She clasped her hands meekly and looked--and felt--like a guilty child. The coldness, the haughtiness were gone from her face. \"Yes,\" she said shyly. \"Yes--I--I--\" She lifted her eyes--her tears had made...", "...And Cyril had to do so. Then they set off to walk to the village. It was more than a mile, and the road was very dusty indeed, and the sun seemed to get hotter and hotter, and the gold in their pockets got heavier and heavier.

However far back we may go, geology does not, and cannot, reach the actual beginning of the world; and we are, therefore, left simply to our own speculations on this point. With regard, however, to the existing terrestrial order, a great deal can be discovered, and to do so is one of the principal tasks of geological science. The first steps in the production of that order lie buried in the profound and unsearchable depths of a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> so prolonged as to present itself to our finite minds as almost in eternity. The last steps are in the prophetic future, and can be but dimly guessed at. Between the remote past and the distant future, we have, however, a long period which is fairly open to inspection; and in saying a \"long\" period, it is to be borne in mind that this term is used in its _geological_ sense. Within this period, enormously long as it is when measured by human standards, we can trace with reasonable...", "...good reason. NORTH.

He quotes a few fine lines from the \"Praise of Italy,\" and then one line which he calls prosaic, and would have us to hold up our hands in wonder at the lame and impotent conclusion--at the sudden transformation of Virgil the poet into Virgil the most prosaic of Prosers.

Their good example was followed by Richard Mansfield. He used a version of the tragedy, made by himself,--a piece indicative of thoughtful study of the subject as well as a keen intuitive grasp of it. He did not stop short at being a commentator. Aiming to impersonate a character he treated Shakespeare's prolix play in such a manner as to make it a practicable living picture of a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> age. The version was in five acts, preserving the text of the original, much condensed, and introducing a few lines from Cibber. It began with a bright processional scene before the Tower of London, in which Elizabeth, Queen of Edward IV., was conspicuous, and against that background of \"glorious summer\" it placed the dangerous figure of the Duke of Gloster. It comprised the murder of Henry VI., the wooing of Lady Anne,--not in a London street, but in a rural place, on the road to...", "...yeer past, and sewrete for the half yeer comynge, or ellys we wold distreyne and put hym out of pocession, and put in a newe fermoure; and so oure demenyng was suche that we toke no distresse, and yit we have hym bounde in an obligacion of xviij_li._ payabil at Michelmesse without condecion, and vj_s._ viij_d._ we receyvid of hym for opocession, for the ferme as yit remayneth on gatherid in the fermourez handes.

The impulse is natural, and, if the resulting tables are not accepted with too much confidence, the result is not undesirable. The truth of the matter is that all of these pedigrees are more or less hypothetical. They simply show what connection seems most likely. In all of them are spaces filled with doubtful names. Each addition to our acquaintance with the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> history of animals necessitates revision of our tables. The student of fossils, trying to rebuild in imagination the world of the past, finds himself often strangely unable to link these animals together.

Accordingly we are more than commonly pleased when we find the clear indication of a genuine pedigree, actually illustrated by real examples,...", "...different footing from an inheritance tax; because it involves no question of the perpetuation of fortunes swollen to an unhealthy size. The question is in its essence a question of the proper adjustment of burdens to benefits.

But whether it is absolutely impossible is another question; and if possible it is most certainly desirable. The first purely income-tax law was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> by the Congress in 1861, but the most important law dealing with the subject was that of 1894. This the court held to be unconstitutional. The question is undoubtedly very intricate, delicate, and troublesome. The decision of the court was only reached by one majority. It is the law of the land, and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole in coming to a conclusion, when considered...", "...in its arrangements. A toilet-table stood there with most costly fittings; brushes with silver and ivory handles were lying upon the faded silk; a little pair of satin shoes had been thrown carelessly upon the floor; a cloak of crimson satin was flung over a chair.

And among these relics of an unknown <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> the child made her simple toilet. She had never seen such magnificence, or felt, she thought, so sad. But when she returned to the hall ten minutes later, the sadness was forgotten.

The middle of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> century seems to have been a critical period in the mining industry of the earth. There was a great impetus given to mining by the greed for gold which caused the settlement of our western states and the Australian states, as already mentioned.

The trial of the ruffian was anxiously waited for, in the hope that something would connect him with Carbonarism. Nothing, however, was found in the whole of the long and minute examination; and it soon became evident that the crime had been committed by a fanatic who was isolated, without adherents, instigators, or accomplices.

But, as a matter of fact, the air goes with us too. If you are inside a railway carriage with the windows shut you do not feel the rush of air, because the air in the carriage travels with you; and it is the same thing on the earth.

It was manifestly not a failing of the Princess's to forget <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> favours, and though increasingly absorbed by the demands of town life she treated her new friend with the same affectionate frankness, and Undine was given frequent opportunities to enlarge her Parisian acquaintance, not only in the Princess's intimate circle but in the majestic drawing-rooms of the Hotel de Dordogne. Now, however, there was a perceptible decline in these signs of hospitality, and Undine, on calling one day on the Duchess, noticed that her appearance sent a...", "...it when present, but know now what it was, and how it has led down to the present--this amounts to enough knowledge to make up a tolerable system of the universe, without invoking pragmatic verification or \"truth\" at all. I have never been able to discover whether, by that perception of fact which is not \"truth\" but fact itself, pragmatists meant each human apprehension taken singly, or the whole series of these apprehensions. In the latter case, as in the philosophy of M. Bergson, all <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> reality might constantly lie open to retentive intuition, a form of knowledge soaring quite over the head of any pragmatic method or pragmatic \"truth.\" It looks, indeed, as if the history of at least personal experience were commonly taken for granted by pragmatists, as a basis on which to rear their method. Their readiness to make so capital an assumption is a part of their heritage from romantic idealism. To the romantic idealist science and theology are tales which ought to be...", "...of the 'Viking.' That is enough to excite anxiety, I admit; still, we must not expect the same punctuality from a sailing-vessel as from a steamer.\" \"I have told Hulda that again and again, and I tell her so yet,\" interrupted Joel. \"And you are quite right, my boy. Besides, it is very possible that the 'Viking' is an old vessel, and a slow sailer, like most Newfoundland ships, especially when heavily laden. On the other hand, we have had a great deal of bad weather during the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few weeks, and very possibly the vessel did not sail at the date indicated in Ole's letter. In that case a week's delay in sailing would be sufficient to account for the non-arrival of the 'Viking' and for your failure to receive a letter from your lover. What I say is the result of serious reflection. Besides, how do you know but the instructions given to the captain of the 'Viking' authorize him to take his cargo to some other port, according to the state of the market?\" \"In...", "...the encounter had ceased even to be a topic of conversation. For two days they continued upon their perilous way. Already the cliffs loomed high and forbidding close ahead without sign of break to encourage hope that somewhere they might be scaled. Late in the afternoon the party crossed a small stream of warm water upon the sluggishly moving surface of which floated countless millions of tiny green eggs surrounded by a light scum of the same color, though of a darker shade. Their <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experience of Caspak had taught them that they might expect to come upon a stagnant pool of warm water if they followed the stream to its source; but there they were almost certain to find some of Caspak's grotesque, manlike creatures. Already since they had disembarked from the U-33 after its perilous trip through the subterranean channel beneath the barrier cliffs had brought them into the inland sea of Caspak, had they encountered what had appeared to be three distinct types...", "...the breeze, the diminuendo of the faint surf running along the shore--and, gradually, of a white speck, growing to a blur, that intruded itself upon the drab prospect of the sea. Lazily interested, he watched this blur increase until it became the _Idalia_ steaming at full speed, coming down the coast. Without changing his position he kept his eyes upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near, and came opposite to Coralio. Then, sitting upright, he saw her float steadily <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> and on. Scarcely a mile of sea had separated her from the shore. He had seen the frequent flash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck-awnings--so much, and no more. Like a ship on a magic lantern slide the _Idalia_ had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul's little world, and was gone. Save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea, she might have been an immaterial thing, a chimera of his idle brain.

I think they generally know that they have been ushered into a house of life of which they are quite unworthy, and that they take their first steps therein in reverence and in awe. Let me simply enumerate some of the manifest consequences of this love. 1. From the very first love expresses itself as a reaching after intimacy. For many days two lovers are busy telling each other all about themselves, about their <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> experiences, their hopes and aspirations, their doubts and fears, their relations to other people, and their various circumstances. They want to know and be known. They want to share everything. Towards mere friends we do well to practice some reserve. By talking about ourselves we may be apt to bore them. But lovers want to know everything, and are wise if they have no reserves. 2. Then, secondly, love obviously increases the vitality and so adds to the physical beauty of both...", "...hurried by, westward. With news such as this we could scarce afford our weary horses the rest they needed, before we set forth again. Our guide led us down a steep track into the valley, and then, striking straight across, we toiled up the mountain path which ascended the high ridge opposite. He checked our pace as we neared the top, advising us to await daylight for the descent. When at length at our backs rose the glorious sun over the eastern hills, flashing his light <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> us into the valley below, we saw, stretched out, a great plain like a map, through which the windings of a river sparkled; while, beyond, rose another ridge of hills higher still than that on which we stood. Our guide beckoned us to a place whence we could look-out without being exposed to the view of any one in the valley. For awhile we searched the plain in vain. Only a few herds drove their cattle afield; and now and then the sharp bark of a dog broke the stillness. At...", "...revolts and would be soothed, entreated, and on bended knee implored, before it is won; that same nature will undergo the ordeal of the burning ploughshare, take all the extremes of misery and distress, brave the fury of the elements and the wrath of man, and in every peril be a patient comforter, when the cause that moves her is the vindication of her love. Affection is to her what glory is to man, an impulse that inspires the most adventurous heroism. There had been for some days <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> in Mildred's mind an anxious misgiving of misfortune to Butler, which was but ill concealed in a quiet and reserved demeanor. The argument of his safety seemed to have little to rest upon, and she could perceive that it was not believed by those who uttered it. There rose upon her thoughts imaginings or presentiments of ill, which she did not like to dwell upon, but which she could not banish. And now when Horse Shoe had told his tale, the incidents did not seem to warrant the...", "...alone, it's better left alone.\" Rising dejectedly, he wandered off to his rabbits, while Laura, as soon as the curtains at the door had fallen together again behind his shrunken little figure, forgot him with that complete forgetfulness of trivial details which is possible only to the mind that is in the possession of an absorbing emotion. All hesitation, all uncertainty, all disappointment, had been swept from her consciousness as if by a destroying and purifying flame; and for the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few weeks she had lived with that passionate swiftness of sensation which gives one an ecstatic sense of rushing, like a winged creature, through crawling time. Life, indeed, was winged for her at the moment; her soul flew; and she felt her happiness beating like a caged bird within her breast. The agony of the imprisoned creature was there also, for she loved blindly without understanding why she loved--and yet it was this hidden mystery of her passion, this divine miracle which...", "...remote ancestors. The third and most interesting case is that of the production of quite new characters which never existed in the ancestors. Upon this progressive mutability the main development of the animal and vegetable kingdom evidently depends. In contrast to this, the two other cases are called retrogressive and degressive mutability. In nature retrogressive mutability plays a large part; in agriculture and in horticulture it gives rise to numerous varieties, which have in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> been preserved, either on account of their usefulness or beauty, or simply as fancy-types. In fact the possession of numbers of varieties may be considered as the main character of domesticated animals and cultivated plants. In the case of retrogressive and degressive mutability the internal cause is at once apparent, for it is this which causes the disappearance or reappearance of some character. With progressive mutations the case is not so simple, since the new character must...", "...of their country, which appeared to them so much the more brilliant because it presented a unique spectacle in the history of nations. Instead of breaking with the historic traditions they respected them, and gave them a new lustre, a new life, by representing them under a more beautiful, more animated, and more striking form. In short, if Polish romanticism was an evolution of poetry in the national sense, it did not depart from the tendencies of its elder sister, for it saw in the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> only the nobility; it was and remained, except in a few instances, aristocratic. Now let us keep in mind that this contest of classicism and romanticism, this turning away from a dead formalism to living ideals, was taking place at that period of Frederick Chopin's life when the human mind is most open to new impressions, and most disposed to entertain bold and noble ideas. And, further, let us not undervalue the circumstance that he must have come in close contact with one of...", "...treat of varied aspects of Shakespearean drama, its influences and traditions, but I think that all may be credited with sufficient unity of intention to warrant their combination in a single volume.

Even in the papers which embody researches in sixteenth- or seventeenth-century dramatic history, I have sought to keep in view the bearings of the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> on the present. A large portion of the book discusses, as its title indicates, methods of representing Shakespeare on the modern stage. The attempt is there made to define, in the light of experience, the conditions which are best calculated to conserve or increase Shakespeare's genuine vitality in the theatre of our own day. In revising the work for the press, I have deemed it advisable to submit the papers to a somewhat rigorous verbal revision. Errors have been corrected,...", "...good horse it would take more riding than he could do in his present state to reach the nearest food. Without weapons of any sort, he could scarcely hunt, even if there were game to be found in the barren sun-baked Gap. Food therefore was out of the question.

The question was how by the aid of all the devices of colour to represent the multifarious forms of human activity: the phases and conditions of life, fashion as well as misery, work and pleasure, the drawing-room and the street, the teeming activity of towns and the quiet labour of peasants. The essential thing was to write the entire natural history of the age.

The happenings of the next few moments were like a swift, horrible dream. Suddenly she felt limp and cold.

She staggered back against a post and stood there motionless while a dark shape brushed <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> her. She recoiled as a hand touched hers in passing, and she caught a fleeting but unforgettable glimpse of a face. It was gone in a moment, but the swarthy features, framed by coarse black hair that reached to the shoulders, the flat, short nose, the thick and jutting lower lip, the great eyes with their lambent flames that seemed to send streaks of fire into the darkness, gave her a feeling that something evil and loathsome had passed.

The legal-tender money is no longer money if it will not secure for man the things which are most important for his welfare, if it will not buy food, clothes and shelter; for it performs none of the functions of money except the subsidiary one of cancelling past debts. Moreover, the obligatory uses of legal-tender money are in fact very inconsiderable. A law requiring a <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> debt to be satisfied with money of a certain kind has for its essence only the payment of something of a definite value, or its equivalent; in practice, it does not even bring about the actual use of a legal money, since the monetary habits of the community will not necessarily require the debt to be paid in such money.

I thought of neither my <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> nor my future; I was wholly taken up with the idea of the ceremony, of that sacrament, the most solemn of all, of the oath I was about to take before God, and also by the thought of the crowd gathered expressly to see me pass.

We may explain the _modus operandi_ of the great offering in any of these ways, for the Scripture presents it in all of them--but the great thing is to accept it; for by the nature of our mental constitution, such an acceptance, whether with or without an intellectual explanation, affords the assurance which we stand in need of; and building upon the Foundation we can safely rear the edifice of our future...", "...thy dreams all the winter's cold, When weeds are withered, and the garden grey, Dream thou of roses with their hearts of gold,-- Beckon to summers that are on their way.

But the government was not quite through with its operations in Richmond.

It was <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> midnight when the Mayor learned that Ewell had issued orders for firing the government buildings and the tobacco warehouses. He sent a deputation of prominent citizens to remonstrate. They were referred to Major Melton, who was to apply the torch. \"It is a cowardly pretext on the part of the citizens, trumped up to save their property for the Yankees,\" said he. The committee endeavored to dissuade him from the act. \"I shall execute my orders,\" said he.

The new voice has distinction and dignity of its own, and we are grateful for this history, others more so than myself, because most of what is written therein I knew already, and I wanted a secret which is not revealed.

The <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> few days had vastly deepened and widened her mental horizon; and now Barron for the first time saw something of what he wanted in her eyes as she gazed away over the sea and did not look at him as usual. There, sure enough, was the soul that he knew slept somewhere, but had never seen until then. And the sight of it came as a shock and swept away his sophistries and ugly-woven ideas.

The author of \"Old Sleuth\" measured in that way would be the greatest American writer, in fact, the greatest writer of any time. You can't reckon the sale of such books by numbers; you reckon them by tons.

I believe old Walt Whitman stated the whole problem when he said: \"All that the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> was not, the future will be.\" I do not believe that the future of the world is to be a future of war. I believe it is to be a future of industrial peace as Professor Pearson [Charles W. Pearson] has indicated.

In other words, the whole tendency of modern art is towards the celebration of the individual by the...", "...produce-marketing organizations have all gained a sound footing and each year shows an increase in their numbers. The movement has been consistently fought by competitive profit-seeking interests but without avail further than to delay the movement.

Even now, within the <span class=\"clocktext\">past</span> five years, agricultural colleges have been prevented from adding advisers on cooperative organization to their extension staffs, retail merchants' associations have prevented cooperative organization legislation, and insidious attempts have been made to prevent popular education with reference to the movement.
