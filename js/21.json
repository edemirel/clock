Oak bark contains usually the largest proportion of tannin, and according to Davy's experiments eight-and-a-half pounds of oak bark are equivalent for tanning purposes to two-and-a-quarter of galls, three of sumach, seven-and-a-half of Leicester willow, eleven of Spanish chesnut, eighteen of elm, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> of common willow bark. Tannin obtained from these sources, however, differs materially in some of its characters. The tannin of nutgalls, which is that generally employed for chemical purposes, is sometimes called gallo-tannic acid, to distinguish it from other species.

It was while the road was still building that an enterprising packer brought <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> camels on the trail. They were not a success and caused countless stampedes. Horses and mules took fright at the slightest whiff of them. The camels themselves could stand neither the climate nor the hard rock road.

Forrest lost in killed and wounded seventy-five men, a large percentage of whom were killed. Streight's loss was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> killed and wounded. A good many of horses were captured from the enemy, on which Streight mounted a number of his men. On the same afternoon the enemy attacked again, but was driven back with considerable loss, after a severe engagement lasting from three o'clock until dark.

He was a missionary of the American Seamen's Friend Society for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years, stationed at the Sailors' Home in Cherry Street, and surely a man of God. Borella never came to church or prayer-meeting alone: he always had men in tow. There was an upper room at the Sailors' Home that meant much to many men, and there Borella did a work that resulted in great acquisitions to the church. It is true that many \"going down to the sea in ships\" were never heard of again, and years afterwards nearly 400 names of seamen were at one time removed from...", "...mother, and I loved him as I did my life. Since he became of age, at such times when I was not in prison, or otherwise unavoidably separated from him, we had been associated in business, and had traveled and lived together.

Shortly after I sold my horses, one day I was in my room at the hotel, when word was brought to me that some one in the parlor wanted to see me. I went down and found a young man, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age, who immediately came to me addressing me as \"father,\" and he then presented a young woman, about two years older than he was, as his sister and my daughter. I had not seen this young gentleman since the time when I had carried him off from school and from the farmer to whom he was bound, and had clothed him and taken him with me to Amsterdam and Troy, subsequently sending him to my half-sister at Sidney.

The fort is in reasonably good preservation, and is said to have been constructed mainly by the labor of Indians.

There at the close of 1787 he spent several weeks, hopefully endeavouring to extract money from the bankrupt Government.

What a contrast to the limpid life of Corsica was that turbid frothy existence--already swirling towards its mighty plunge! After a furlough of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> months he rejoined his regiment, now at Auxonne. There his health suffered considerably, not only from the miasma of the marshes of the river Saone, but also from family anxieties and arduous literary toils.

The sons of the poorer nobles were usually placed in the family of some superior lord of renown and wealth, whose castle became a sort of school, where they were trained in the duties and exercises of knighthood.

At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> the squire became a knight, being then introduced to the order of knighthood by a peculiar and impressive service. After a long fast and vigil, the candidate listened to a lengthy sermon on his duties as a knight.

By observations on the spots, we learn that Mars revolves on his axis in very nearly the same time with the earth, (twenty-four hours thirty-nine minutes <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> seconds and three tenths,) and that the inclination of his axis to that of his orbit is also nearly the same, being thirty degrees eighteen minutes ten seconds and eight tenths. Hence the changes of day and night must be nearly the same there as here, and the seasons also very similar to ours.

The third edition was revised in 1785 by Isaac Reed; and this was succeeded by the edition of Malone in 1790, in which the vast learning and conscientious care of that scholar combined to produce the most trustworthy text so far published. Malone was not brilliant, but he was extremely erudite and candid, and his so-called \"Third Variorum\" edition in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> volumes, brought out after his death by James Boswell in 1821, is a mine of information on theatrical history and cognate matters, which will probably always be of value to students of the period. The name of \"First Variorum Edition\" is given to the fifth edition of Johnson and Steevens, revised by Reed in 1803, and \"Second Variorum\" to the sixth edition of the same, 1813.

The dominating group, however, was orthodox in background, though most of them were not orthodox in conviction.

Under the provisions of the indentures, he was to serve as his brother's apprentice, until he was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age, but he was to be allowed the wages of a journeyman during the last year of the apprenticeship. It was a fortunate thing for the apprentice that he should have become bound to a master, who had been trained for his craft in London, and the extraordinary skill which he early acquired as a printer was probably due in part to this circumstance.

It is difficult to find any other characteristic deserving of grave censure, but his enemies have adopted a simpler process. They have been able to find few flaws in his...", "...which can be pitched upon for extraordinary and romantic projects.' The bank, of course, suffered by these speculative measures, and was repeatedly exposed to a run upon its specie resources. In 1722 the _rest_ (or reserve fund) was established by the bank, as a measure to cover extraordinary losses in the future, and to inspire more confidence among the public as to the ability of the bank to meet reverses. This fund, in July, 1862, had accumulated to L3,132,500 sterling, or about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> and a half per cent. of the capital. The first forged note of the Bank of England was presented in the year 1758, or sixty-four years after the bank was established. In 1780 these forgeries became more numerous, and were so well executed as to deceive the officers of the bank. Let us now recur to some of the incidents connected with the bank in early ages. Of these, the author, Mr. Francis, furnishes numerous instances. Among other frauds upon the bank was that of...", "...but recommended for use--was the instrument on which the fanatical revolutionists placed most of their reliance for the extirpation of \"aristocracy.\" The energy of the _Jacobins_, aided by the general dread of a restoration of the royalists to power, and by the fury of the Paris populace, proved too strong for the more moderate party to withstand. The king, designated as _Louis Capet_, was arraigned before the assembly, tried, and condemned to death. There were seven hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> votes: his death was decreed by a small majority (Jan. 17, 1793). Through all the terrible scenes of the trial, the parting with his wife and children, and the execution (Jan. 21), _Louis_ manifested a serene and Christian temper.

The mist, meanwhile, had disappeared, leaving the sky perfectly clear. It was nearly three when dinner was finished. The Isles of Shoals were full <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> miles distant, and if they were to be reached before night, there was no time to be lost.

CHAPTER XVIII--WAGES When I learned that in Lesser London there were 1,292,737 people who received <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> shillings or less a week per family, I became interested as to how the wages could best be spent in order to maintain the physical efficiency of such families. Families of six, seven, eight or ten being beyond consideration, I have based the following table upon a family of five--a father, mother, and three children; while I have made twenty-one shillings equivalent to $5.25, though actually, twenty-one shillings are equivalent to about $5.11. Rent $1.50 or 6/0...", "...a Lampard in this parish. That I know.\" \"You don't know!

For the first three years, it was, for a certain quantity of each, to be at the rate of L.6; for the second three years at L.4; and for the third three years at L.2. The seventh and last bounty of this kind was that granted by the 19th Geo. III. chap. 37, upon the importation of hemp from Ireland. It was granted in the same manner as that for the importation of hemp and undressed flax from America, for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years, from the 24th June 1779 to the 24th June 1800. The term is divided likewise into three periods, of seven years each; and in each of those periods, the rate of the Irish bounty is the same with that of the American. It does not, however, like the American bounty, extend to the importation of undressed flax. It would have been too great a discouragement to the cultivation of that plant in Great Britain. When this last bounty was granted, the British and Irish...", "...upsetting to the nerves. Be sure you get that buttonhole the right size.

At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to his brother James, who was a printer. At the same time--perhaps a little later--he used to sell his own ballads in the streets of Boston. At <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age he was a master printer in Philadelphia, in his shop on Market Street. He had been at school in Boston for two years, but after the age of ten he had been obliged to teach himself: he was too poor to spend even those early years in a schoolhouse. Yet he learned without such helps as schools and schoolmasters afford. He studied Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, and German, and lived to hear two continents call him the greatest philosopher of his time. He...", "...bare earth.

As a matter of fact the percentage of illiterate voters answered closely to the percentage of males over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> in the census returns, who could neither read nor write. Only two petitions followed the general election, one at Belfast against a nationalist, and the other at Derry against a tory, and in neither of the two was undue influence or intimidation alleged.

What would we think of a general, invading such a state, if he should order his soldiers to kill the people slowly, lest the wild beasts might increase upon them? Is it possible that a God capable of doing the miracles recounted in the Old Testament could not, in some way, have disposed of the wild beasts? After the Canaanites were driven out, could he not have employed the hornets to drive out the wild beasts? Think of a God that could drive <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> millions of people out of the promised land, could raise up innumerable stinging flies, and could cover the earth with fiery serpents, and yet seems to have been perfectly powerless against the wild beasts of the land of Canaan!

Documents show that Jacopo Bellini was living in Venice in 1437, first near the Piazza, and afterwards in the parish of San Lio. He was a member of S. Giovanni Evangelista, and probably one of the leading artists of the city. His two sons helped him in his great decorative works, and also went with him to Padua, where he painted the Gattamalata Chapel. Their relative position is suggested by a document of 1457, which records that the father received <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> ducats for \"three figures, done on cloth, put in the Great Hall of the Patriarch,\" only two of which were to go to the son. In 1459 Gian. Bellini's signature first appears on a document, and at about this time we may suppose that he and his brother began to execute small commissions on their own account. On these visits to Padua the intimacy must have sprung up, which led to Mantegna's marriage in 1453 with Jacopo's daughter. At Padua, too, Bellini, in company with Mantegna,...", "...a great diversity of opinion on these points, and particularly in reference to the drainage of stiff clay soils; some of the most intelligent and practical farmers in this country hold to the opinion that, on such soils, the maximum depth should not exceed three feet, and the distance apart sixteen to twenty feet.

On lighter soils, having a free subsoil, four feet deep and forty feet apart are the usual limitations. This farm may be taken as a fair average of the land in Ireland, as a test for drainage; the soil is a deep clay loam; the subsoil a compact mixture of strong clay and calcareous gravel, almost free from stones.

I have also measured in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> birds, including the above dozen, the prominence of the crest of the sternum relatively to its length, independently of the size of the body. In two of the twenty-one birds the crest was prominent in the same relative degree as in the rock-pigeon; in seven it was more prominent; but in five out of these seven, namely, in a fantail, two scanderoons, and two English carriers, this greater prominence may to a certain extent be explained, as a...", "...for they see the Divine attractions as clearly as is given to man in his mortality, and seeing them thus clearly, every slight infidelity to a God so beautiful and so good, assumes importance in their eyes, and excites a corresponding sorrow.

Vergil was then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age--nearing his twenty-second birthday--and we may perhaps assume in Donatus' attribution of the _Culex_ to Vergil's sixteenth year a mistake in some early manuscript which changed the original XXI to XVI, a correction which the citations of Statius and Lucan favor.[2] Finally, when, as we shall see presently, Horace in his second _Epode_, accords Vergil the honor of imitating a passage of the _Culex_, Vergil returns the compliment in his _Georgics_.

The first instance is that of a basement floor laid <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years ago, a portion of which was made by excavating one foot below the floor, six inches of coarse stone being filled in, then five inches of coal tar concrete made up with coarse gravel, and finally about one inch of fine gravel concrete.

The concrete was then filled in upon the floor timbers, and thoroughly tamped and...", "...Charter of 1832\" was carried, received the royal signature, and became law. The passage of this memorable act brought about these beneficent changes: (1) It abolished nearly sixty \"rotten boroughs\" (S579). (2) It gave every householder who paid a rent of ten pounds in any town a vote, and largely extended the list of county voters as well. (3) It granted two representatives to Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, and nineteen other large towns, and one representative each to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> other places, all of which had hitherto been unrepresented, besides granting fifteen additional members to the counties. (4) It added, in all, half a million voters to the list, mostly men of the middle class, and it helped to purify the elections from the violence which had disgraced them.[1] [1] See Summary of Constitutional History in the Appendix, p.xxvi, S31.

Whigs and Tories of influence alike insisted that further innovation could not be contemplated, but the radicals and the laboring masses insisted no less resolutely that the reformation which had been begun should be carried to its logical conclusion. The demands upon which emphasis was especially placed were gathered up in the \"six points\" of the People's Charter, promulgated in final form May 8, 1838. The six points were: (1) universal suffrage for males over <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age, (p. 083) (2) equal electoral districts, (3) voting by secret ballot, (4) annual sessions of Parliament, (5) the abolition of property qualifications for members of the House of Commons, and (6) payment of members. The barest enumeration of these demands is sufficient to reveal the political backwardness of the England of three-quarters of a century ago.

The daily average consumption of water, during the year 1844, was one million gallons; and, from the comparative great capacity of the reservoir, sufficient time is allowed for the water to settle, in one of the four compartments, before it is drawn for the use of the city.

In a mixture there is no chemical change in the molecules of the substances mixed.

The regulations for admission to library privileges are important. In this country the age limitation is more liberal than in Europe. The Boston Public Library, for example, is free to all persons over twelve years of age. In the Library of Congress, the age limit is sixteen years or upward, to entitle one to the privileges of a reader. In the Astor Library, none are admitted under nineteen, and in the British Museum Library none below <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years.

No, let her have the pleasure, if it was one, at any rate the wholesome excitement, of companionship; it might save her from lapsing into melancholy or a worse form of madness.

In the first of these trucks came the Directors of the Railway Company and their friends, followed by <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> trucks (all open to the sky, like ordinary goods-trucks), loaded with various passengers, and finally six more waggons of coal. Such was the first train. A man on horseback, carrying a flag, having taken up his position in front of the 'Locomotion' to head the procession, the starting word was given, and with a hiss of steam, half drowned in the shouting of the crowd, the first railway journey ever made in England was begun. The man on horseback probably stepped aside...", "...the mercantile trade, as well as farming, placed him in his store as clerk; the succeeding year he was clerk in a store at Concord, but the next year, 1839, he returned to his home, taking charge of the business of his father, who was in failing health, and who died on the 9th of August following, at the age of sixty-four years. His father's death necessitated changes in home affairs, and in March, 1840, he entered the store of William Whittle, at Goffstown, where he remained until <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age; he then returned once more to his home and went into the mercantile trade at his father's old stand.

When the day fixed for the opening ceremony arrived, a further adjournment was rendered imperative owing to the very sparse attendance of bishops. The First Session was held on the 13th December 1545, and the second in January 1546. There were then present in addition to the legates and theologians only four archbishops, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> bishops, and five generals of religious orders. These two preliminary sessions were given over almost entirely to a discussion of the procedure that should be followed. In the end it was agreed that the legates should propose to the council the questions on which a decision should be given, that these questions should be examined by committees of bishops aided by theologians and jurists, that the results of these discussions should be brought before a full congregation of...", "...perfectly mature; they are then carefully gathered, and the bad fruit picked out, and, with the stalks, put aside.

A French General is said to have characterized the British troops at Inkerman as 'an army of lions led by asses.' Whether the epigram was really uttered by the General in question, or was one of the inventions of the British camp, it certainly expressed a very general feeling both at home and in the Crimean army.

When I got to be thirty-two or thirty-three and had gone along a little in the world, I fell in with men of my own station; and as I lived in a town where nearly everybody drank, including many of the successful business and professional men--men of affairs--I soon got into their habits.

The river, which in the dry season is simply a great bed of sand, in the rainy season is sometimes so high that bandys cannot cross, except on rafts, and sometimes not at all, because of the very swift current.

It was not very deep, however, and I decided not to wait the river's pleasure, but to risk crossing it. It took <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> men to get us across that river! Pudchi, my servant, piled all my boxes on the board, which, in a bandy, is the bed, and he and I perched ourselves on them, balancing as best we could. One man went ahead to sound the river, two guided the bullocks' heads, two drove, eight took the wheels, five pushed, and the others steadied us; for more than once it seemed as if the current would sweep us over.

Coins were actually struck and circulated, but the patent itself was sold to John Knox in the very year of its issue. Knox, however, had his patent specially renewed, but his coinage was interrupted when James II. issued his debased money during the Revolution (see Monck Mason, p. 334, and the notes on this matter to the Drapier's Third Letter, in present edition). Knox sold his patent to Colonel Roger Moore, who...", "...(James) of that profession. In 1717 my brother James returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston.

Friends thought he should be well satisfied when he was sent to live with his grandfather at Hartford and apprenticed to the law; but John Ledyard hated the pettifogging of the law, hated roofed-over, walled-in life, wanted the kind of life where men do things, not just dicker, and philosophize, and compromise over the fag-ends of things other men have done.

The main water-supply for the city of Bloemfontein was drawn from a point on the Modder {252} River, where it is crossed by the high road running due east to Thaba'Nchu. This point, which is about twenty-one miles from the capital, is known as Sannah's Post. On March 15 the \"somewhat inadequate force of 300 mounted infantry\" was sent out to hold the Waterworks, and two days later a mounted column, 1,500 strong, under General French, was pushed on to Thaba'Nchu, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> miles farther east. From this force Colonel Pilcher was detached, and through his operations definite news of the enemy's whereabouts was obtained and duly forwarded to Bloemfontein. General French was soon after called back to Headquarters, and left Colonel Broadwood in command of the column.

It had attained the height of seventy feet; the branches covered an area one hundred feet in diameter; the trunk was sixteen feet in circumference at seven feet from the ground, and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> feet at the insertion of the great branches twelve feet above the surface. There were about ten principal branches or limbs, and their average circumference was twelve feet.

In this way also the position of geography, at the point where physical science meets and mingles with mental science, is explained and justified.

The next day she came up to the palace reading a book, which turned out to be a cookery-book in English, found at her yali; and a week later, she appeared, out of hours, presenting me a yellow-earthenware dish containing a mess of gorgeous colours--a boiled fish under red peppers, bits of saffron, a greenish sauce, and almonds: but I turned her away, and would have none of her, or her dish. * * * *...", "...has rarely saved, and has rarely made an honest marriage.

The mortgagor himself or anyone to whom he transfers, or who acquires his interest, is entitled to the equity of redemption. If _A_ mortgages his farm to _B_, to secure a promissory note of one thousand dollars due in one year, _A_ does not lose his right to the property by failure to pay the note when due. He may bring a suit in equity at any time, usually within <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years, after the note becomes due, offering to pay the mortgage debt, interest, and costs, and asking for a return of the property.

The Amirante Group consists altogether of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> low coral islets, resting (with the exception of Isle des Roches, which is on a separate bank) on an extensive coral bank, whose long axis lies in a north-north-east and south-south-west direction, and is eighty-nine miles in length, with an average breadth of nineteen miles. It is included between the limits of 4 deg. 50-1/2' and 6 deg. 12-1/2' south latitude, and 53 deg. 45' and 52 deg. 50-1/2' east longitude, and is about seven hundred miles distant from the nearest part...", "...that all male persons born and abiding within the hundred of St. Briavel's, being upwards of twenty-one years of age and having worked a year and a day in a coal or iron mine or stone-quarry within the said hundred, should alone have the right to hold or dispose of such works, a register of all such persons being kept as \"free miners.\" It suppressed all claims to pit timber, with all \"customs,\" and assigned to the Commissioners under the Act the duty of fixing rents and royalties for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years, and to the gaveller power to limit and regulate as well as to enter and survey all works which might be re-awarded or galed.

Hawks, D. D. From this I obtained facts which might serve for the intricate mazes of a romance. It had been a pet scheme with Sir Walter Raleigh to colonize the coast of North Carolina, then known as Virginia, and though several expeditions had been sent out for that object, each had failed of successful issue. One of these expeditions sent by Sir Walter to Roanoke Island consisted of one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> persons, of whom seventeen were women and six children. Of all these souls only two men returned to the old country, the fate of the remainder being unknown, and shrouded in the gloom which always attends mystery. England did not, however, leave her children to perish on a barren shore in the new land without at least an effort to succor them.

Eight years younger than her husband, she was just <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> at her marriage, and bore him twelve children. Haydn's regard for her was deep and sincere; and it was one of the tricks of destiny that she was not spared to witness more of his rising fame, being cut off in 1754, when she was only forty-six.

It will be observed that, according to the marriage bond, Virginia was married under her maiden name of Clemm, thus ignoring the former ceremony; and that Poe subscribed to the oath of Thomas Cleland that she was \"of the full age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years,\" when in reality she was but thirteen, having been born August 16, 1822. Thus is shown how pliable was Poe in the hands of his mother-in-law; and as regards Mr. Cleland, who was a very pious Presbyterian, it can only be hoped that he never discovered in what manner he had been imposed upon.

When Poe went to Richmond as assistant editor to Mr. White, it had been with the expectation of resuming his old place among his...", "...But fire from German guns wrought heavy havoc in the ranks of the British seamen: nineteen officers and 170 men were killed; two officers and fourteen men were missing, and twenty-nine officers and 354 men were wounded.

The losses of the British forces engaged in this operation were small. It was later reported that <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> German destroyers and a large number of submarines were penned in the Bruges Canal docks as a result of the naval operations against Zeebrugge. Engagements, without leading to any results, occurred on April 23, 1918, between five Austrian and two British destroyers.

The round trip was 320 miles, and I made it in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> hours and forty minutes. Excitement was plentiful during my two years' service as a Pony Express rider. One day as I was leaving Horse Creek, a party of fifteen Indians jammed me in a sand ravine eight miles west of the station. They fired at me repeatedly, but my luck held, and I went unscathed.

These details, which are wonderfully reminiscent of the childish days at Galloway House eight years before,[14] and show how like the young man of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> was to the boy of thirteen, may be supplemented by an extract or two from the diary of another member of the same family: _Christmas Day_, 1868.--We had midnight Mass at St. Philip's, the little church in our garden.

For about ten years he practiced his profession, but continued his studies with indefatigable zeal. The investigations of Pasteur had already filled Europe with applause when Koch, following on the same lines of scientific exploration, began to enlarge the borders of knowledge.

Koch was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years the junior of Pasteur; but his enthusiasm and genius now bore him rapidly to a fame as great as that of his predecessor. His first remarkable achievement was a demonstration of the cause and cure of splenic fever in cattle. He showed, just as Pasteur had done in similar cases, that the plague in question was due to the specific poison of a bacterium, and that the disease might be cured by inoculation against it. This he proceeded to do, and the demonstration and good...", "...line each way. There was already a semi-monthly line operated by Messrs. Hockaday and Liggett, running from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Salt Lake City. This line was poorly appointed. It consisted of a limited number of light, cheap vehicles, with but few animals to draw them. The same team was used for hundreds of miles, as no stations had been established on the long route. The teams were turned out to graze, and were obliged to stop often for that purpose. It sometimes required <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> days to make the trip from St. Joseph to Salt Lake.

Now what was Addison, that people are remembering him for two hundred years? First a scholar. Then he must have studied hard. Also he was an author--a poet. When he was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> he wrote a poem addressed to Dryden. Just remember that man's name, will you? Some day we will make his acquaintance.

This is attached to a micrometer,--a delicate piece of apparatus, used for reading the minute subdivisions of angles; for, after dividing the limb of the instrument as minutely as possible, it will then be necessary to magnify those divisions with the microscope, and subdivide each of these parts with the micrometer. Thus, if we have a mural circle twenty feet in diameter, and of course nearly sixty-three feet in circumference, since there are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> thousand and six hundred minutes in the whole circle, we shall find, by calculation, that one minute would occupy, on the limb of such an instrument, only about one thirtieth of an inch, and a second, only one eighteen hundredth of an inch. We could not, therefore, hope to carry the actual divisions to a greater degree of minuteness than minutes; but each of these spaces may again be subdivided into seconds by the micrometer.

It was through his agency that Greek was first taught in Scotland by Petrus de Marsiliers at Montrose. This fact counted for much in the progress of the Reformation. Erskine was also drawn towards the new faith, being a close friend of George Wishart, the reformer, from whose fate he was saved by his wealth and influence, and...", "...a special tax is levied on their wash-houses, and a new regulation made, by which no one can carry baskets on poles across the sidewalks; that being the way they carry about vegetables to sell.

Thus of the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the catalogue of Messrs.

The calculation of the average assay value of standing ore from samples is one which seems to require some statement of elementals. Although it may seem primitive, it can do no harm to recall that if a dump of two tons of ore assaying twenty ounces per ton be added to a dump of five tons averaging one ounce per ton, the result has not an average assay of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> ounces divided by the number of dumps. Likewise one sample over a width of two feet, assaying twenty ounces per ton, if averaged with another sample over a width of five feet, assaying one ounce, is no more twenty-one ounces divided by two samples than in the case of the two dumps. If common sense were not sufficient demonstration of this, it can be shown algebraically. Were samples equidistant from each other, and were they of equal width, the average value would be the...", "...young man upon a fresh impulse would dash into defiant eulogy of his darling; and so impetuous was the rush of his desperate words that at the beat of every new wave Mr. Marrapit would withdraw his startled hand from the letter; frown at George across the coffee-pot.

As I was much surprised that the wings of closely confined birds should thus so frequently have been increased in length, it occurred to me that it might be solely due to the greater length of the wing-feathers; for this certainly is the case...", "...vessels, plying between Europe and America.\"[A] Upon looking into this with a view to test its correctness, it was found to be within the truth; for, including transient steamers, the number was greater than stated.

As I moved out I was met by the critic of _The Disciples of Tone_, who said to me: \"Lieber Kerl, I must congratulate you; it beats Richard Strauss all hollow. _Who_ and what was _Childe Roland_? Was he any relation to Byron's _Childe Harold_? I suppose the first theme represented the 'galumphing' of his horse, and that funny triangular fugue meant that the horse...", "...would profit individually in their exchange operations as much as the state would in its restored currency of silver. \"The above lords,\" says the preamble to the first-cited Act, \"considering the numerous petitions made to them by many artificers, merchants, and honourable citizens, of the incredible lack of silver money in the state of Florence, on account of which the citizens of the said state suffer many inconveniences and wants, have determined to have and have had counsel of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> guilds of the city, who have [by a roundabout method] chosen eight men, skilled and prudent in the aforesaid, who have had counsel with the officers of our Mint and with certain others of the trade of exchangers,\" etc., with such result as above.

After the death of Attila we hear little more of the Huns. GENSERIC THE VANDAL KING FROM 427-477 A.D. I The Vandals were another wild and fierce tribe that came from the shores of the Baltic and invaded central and southern Europe in the later times of the Roman Empire. In the fifth century some of these people occupied a region in the south of Spain. One of their most celebrated kings was name Gen'ser-ic. He became king in 427, when he was but <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age. He was lame in one leg and looked as if he were a very ordinary person. Like most of the Vandals, he was a cruel and cunning man, but he had great ability in many ways. He fought in battles even when a boy and was known far and wide for his bravery and skill as a leader. About the time that Genseric became king, the governor of the Roman province in the north of Africa, on the Mediterranean coast, was a man called Count Boniface. This Count Boniface had...", "...real one. And I find it hard to believe that pilots don't know what they're doing. During the summer of 1953, UFO reports dropped off considerably. During May, June, and July of 1952 we'd received 637 good reports. During the same months in 1953 we received only seventy-six. We had been waiting for the magic month of July to roll around again because every July there had been the sudden and unexplained peak in reporting; we wanted to know if it would happen again. It didn't-- only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> reports came in, to make July the lowest month of the year. But July did bring new developments. Project Blue Book got a badly needed shot in the arm when an unpublicized but highly important change took place: another intelligence agency began to take over all field investigations. Ever since I'd returned to the project, the orders had been to build it up--get more people--do what the panel recommended. But when I'd asked for more people, all I got was a polite \"So...", "...As I first caught sight of them when within a few miles of Marysville, they gave me a distinct thrill. I could hardly believe my eyes and thought of mirages; for those pointed, isolated peaks rise precipitously from the floor of the Sacramento valley; in fact, their bases are only a mile or two from the river. They have every indication, even to the unscientific eye, of having been upheaved by volcanic action. Perhaps that accounts for the uncanny impression they impart. A walk of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> or two miles without food, in any kind of weather, is apt to produce an aching void. My first efforts on reaching Marysville were therefore directed to finding the sort of place where I could eat in comfort. The emphasis which Robert Louis Stevenson employs when upon this most important quest would be amusing were it not also a vital problem in your own case. There is nothing humorous per se in hunger or thirst; at any rate, not until both are appeased.

There are eleven thousand factories in New York State, and only one inspector to investigate their condition; while in England, scarce larger in territory, forty-one inspectors are appointed by the Government. The Andrus bill, adding to the power of factory inspectors, raising the working age of children to fourteen years, and prohibiting night work for girls under <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> and boys under eighteen, was sent with the Factory Bill to the Central Labor Union, and the women were largely instrumental in obtaining the passage of the measure. Why such determined opposition still meets every attempt to bring about the same inspection for mercantile establishments cannot be determined; but thus far, though admitted to be necessary, the act has at each reading been laid upon the table. Another effort will be made in the coming winter of 1893-94. In...", "...was made to correct the abuse introduced by the act of 1837. That act had done four things:--1. It had carried back the commencement of invalid naval pensions to the time of receiving the inability, instead of the time of completing the proof. 2. It extended the pensions for death to all cases of death, whether incurred in the line of duty or not. 3. It extended the widows' pensions for life, when five years had been the law both in the army and the navy. 4. It pensioned children until <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age, thereby adopting the English pension system. The effects of these changes were to absorb and bankrupt the navy pension fund--a meritorious fund created out of the government share of prize money, relinquished for that purpose;--and to throw the pensions, the previous as well as the future, upon the public treasury--where it was never intended they were to be. This act, so novel in its character--so plundering in its effects--and introducing such fatal...", "...who are of neither party--_qui neutrarum partium sunt_--in a war, and who do not, in accordance with a treaty, give assistance to either party. Vattel (III. [p] 103), on the other hand, makes use of the term \"neutrality,\" and gives the following definition:--\"Neutral nations, during a war, are those who take no one's part, remaining friends common to both parties, and not favouring the armies of one of them to the prejudice of the other.\" But although Vattel's book appeared in 1758, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years after that of Bynkershoek, his doctrines are in some ways less advanced than those of Bynkershoek. The latter, in contradistinction to Grotius, maintained that neutrals had nothing to do with the question as to which party to a war had a just cause; that neutrals, being friends to both parties, have not to sit as judges between these parties, and, consequently, must not give or deny to one or other party more or less in accordance with their conviction as to the...", "...the 'Victory.' And again in April 13, 1825, this boat ('Challenge') started from the Horseferry at four minutes past three in the morning, reached Sunbury to breakfast at half past seven, and having taken luncheon at the London Stairs, just above Staines, went through Windsor bridge by two o'clock in the afternoon. After having seen Eton, the crew returned to Staines to dinner, and ultimately arrived at the Horseferry, having performed this distance in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> hours. The locks detained them full three hours, and, including all stoppages, they were detained seven hours. A waterman of the name of Ellis steered the boat in this excursion, and both steered and conducted himself remarkably well.

He soared above the trifling allurements that too often lead childhood and youth astray. His studies were his chief delight. He exhibited a maturity of judgment, clearness of perception and depth of thought--seldom manifested in juvenile life.

He passed the ordeal of his final examination at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> and was licensed to proclaim to his fellow men the glad tidings of the Gospel of Peace. He immediately became the assistant of his revered father--a favorite among their parishioners--an eloquent preacher of plain practical Christianity.

This, too, gradually decreased in violence, and during the second week of the month only minor engagements between outposts and the usual trench activities occurred. On December 17, 1916, the Germans, after considerable artillery preparation, started a more extensive offensive movement in the vicinity of Great and Little Porsk, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> miles southeast of Kovel. After considerable fighting, lasting all afternoon, nightfall put a temporary stop to this undertaking. It was, however, renewed during the early morning hours of the following day, and as a result the Germans occupied small portions of the Russian positions. These were held against a number of Russian counterattacks made during the following days. Minor engagements also occurred on December 16, 17, and 18, 1916, near Kabarowce, northwest of...", "...\"I'd forgotten that.

And, again, when a State does exclude a portion of its male inhabitants, etc., the basis of representation in such State is not reduced in the proportion which the number of such excluded males bears to the number of persons--male and female--in such State; but only In the proportion which the number of such (excluded) male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age in such State. This provision assumes that females are no part of the voting population of a State. The XV. Amendment is equally decisive. It recognizes the right--that is, power--of any State to exclude a portion of its citizens from the right to vote, and only narrows this right in favor of a particular class. Its language is: The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged,...", "...2.

Benjamin Franklin felt much disappointed when his father refused to help send him to England. But he was not discouraged. In a few weeks he was ready to return to Philadelphia. This time he did not have to run away from home. His father blessed him, and his mother gave him many small gifts as tokens of her love. \"Be diligent,\" said his father, \"attend well to your business, and save your money carefully, and, perhaps, by the time you are <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years old, you will be able to set up for yourself without the governor's help.\" All the family, except James the printer, bade him a kind good-bye, as he went on board the little ship that was to take him as far as New York.

I learned that South Framingham is <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> miles from Boston, at the junction of the Boston and Albany and Old Colony Railways. Its population at that time was about 10,000. Its graded schools are among the first in the State.

He worked as a journeyman at his trade in Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, California and Oregon, thus working his way westward by successive stages until he reached the Pacific coast.

The individual scores of various tourists, reported in the _American Angler_ during the summer and fall of 1885, and not containing any that were phenomenally large, averaged twenty-five trout per hour for each rod, a record with which the most ardent angler ought surely to be satisfied. A majority of these scores were made in the vicinity of Livingston, near which town another visitor is reported to have caught <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> fine, large trout \"after supper,\" while two others are stated to have brought in 160 as the result of \"a day's sport.\" The Yellowstone also contains a gamey fish known to local anglers as grayling, but pronounced by Mr. W.

But the delays we had already suffered had not yet spent all their influence, for we were now advanced into a season of the year when the westerly winds are usually very constant, and very violent; and it was thought proper that we should put to sea in company with the fleet commanded by Admiral Balchen, and the expedition under Lord Cathcart. As we made up in all <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> men-of-war, and a hundred and twenty-four sail of merchant-men and transports, we had no hopes of getting out of the Channel with so large a number of ships without the continuance of a fair wind for some considerable time.

It forms, on account of its hardness, the base of the Arani or sacred fire-drill, and in it the wedge of the softer Pipal wood works and fire is produced by friction.

On February 1, latitude 64 deg. 15' S. and longitude 159 deg. 15' E., we coasted along one side of a berg which was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> geographical miles long: the only other side of which we got a good view stretched away until lost below the horizon. In latitude 62 deg. 10' S. and longitude 158 deg. 15' E. we had \"a real bad day: head wind from early morning, and simply crowds of bergs all round. At 8 A.M. we had to wedge in between a berg and a long line of pack before we could find a way through. Then thick fog came down. At 9.45 A.M.

In 1892, the output of the Rand was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in value; in 1893, it rose to nearly twenty-six million.

Ben Jonson, the son of a clergyman and the stepson of a master bricklayer, received a good education at Westminster School. Unlike Shakespeare, Jonson learned much Latin and Greek.

In this way he acquired the habit of trying to express unpoetical ideas in verse.

Documents of this period put the rent of this piece of waste at L5 _per annum_! and this amount had only risen to L8 10_s._ in the space of a hundred years. But so rapidly did the value of land now rise, that in 1776 a lease was granted at the yearly rent of L100; and fourteen years later a renewal was effected for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years at L190. The poor of Newington should have been in excellent case by this time, unless, indeed, their numbers increased with the times. And certainly the neighbourhood had now grown by prodigious leaps and bounds, and Newington Butts had now become a busy coaching centre.

The 9 per cent, annually of the Welser (Ehrenberg, _Zeitalter der Fugger_, I, 195), pales into insignificance beside the 1634 per cent, by which the fortune of the Fuggers grew in <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years (Schulte, _Die Fugger in Rom_, I, 3). In 1511 a certain Bartholomew Rem invested 900 gulden in the Hochstetter company of Augsburg; by 1517 he claimed 33,000 gulden profit. The company was willing to settle at 26,000, and the resulting litigation caused the figures to become public (Wrede, _op. cit._, II, 842, note 4; III, pp. 574 ff.).

The Gregs usually had a hundred boys and girls between the ages of ten and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> in their apprentice house, and the care of them was one of the main occupations of the family. They came from the refuse of the towns, yet the harmony of wise and gentle rule for the young, along with dutifully adjusted demand and compliance between the older hands and their employers, ended in the transformation of the thin, starved, half-dazed creatures who entered the gates of the factory into the best type of workpeople to be found in the district.

Among numerous ornaments the most common is a large round concave portion of melon shell, sometimes beautifully inlaid with filagree work of tortoise-shell, worn on the breast.

The town of Pedro stood on the edge of the mountain country; a straggling assemblage of stores and saloons from which a number of branch railroads ran up into the canyons, feeding the coal-camps. Through the week it slept peacefully; but on Saturday nights, when the miners came trooping down, and the ranchmen came in on horseback and in automobiles, it wakened to a seething life. At the railroad station, one day late in June, a young man alighted from a train. He was about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age, with sensitive features, and brown hair having a tendency to waviness. He wore a frayed and faded suit of clothes, purchased in a quarter of his home city where the Hebrew merchants stand on the sidewalks to offer their wares; also a soiled blue shirt without a tie, and a pair of heavy boots which had seen much service. Strapped on his back was a change of clothing and a blanket, and in his pockets a comb, a toothbrush, and a small pocket mirror.

Respecting the salute of twenty-one guns, as it is a salute among western nations, it does [not] tally with the customs of China. Your Excellency being now in China, and, moreover, entered the river, it is not the same as if you were in your own country; and, consequently, it will be inexpedient to have the salute performed here; also, China has no such salute as firing <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> guns; and how can we imitate your country's custom in the number, and make a corresponding ceremony in return? It will, indeed, not be easy to act according to it. When the English admirals Parker and Saltoun came up to Canton, they were both in a passage vessel, not in a man-of-war, when they entered the river; nor was there any salute. This is evidence plain on this matter. \"Concerning what is said regarding a personal visit to...", "...Skirving, and Margarot, four gentlemen lately convicted in Scotland of the crime of sedition, considered as a public offence, and transported for the same to this country.

A guard of an ensign and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> privates of the New South Wales corps were on board the transport. Six of these people were deserters from other regiments brought from the Savoy; one of them, Joseph Draper, we understood had been tried for mutiny (of an aggravated kind) at Quebec.

So great was the boy's ability, that at fifteen he had become the intimate and almost confidential friend of the emperor, who was a keen judge of merit.

Yet, with all this, the outward West India fleet in 1778 waited six weeks, April 10th-May 26th, for convoy. Immediately after it got away, a rigorous embargo was laid upon all shipping in British ports, that their crews might be impressed to man the Channel fleet. Market-boats, even, were not allowed to pass between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. Three days after Byron had sailed, Admiral Augustus Keppel also put to sea with <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> ships of the line, to cruise off Brest. His instructions were to prevent the junction of the Toulon and Brest divisions, attacking either that he might meet. On the 17th of June, two French frigates were sighted. In order that they might not report his force or his movements, the British Admiral sent two of his own frigates, with the request that they would speak him. One, the _Belle Poule_, 36, refused; and an engagement followed between her and the British ship, the...", "...per cent of the males and sixty-two per cent of the females in Hungary generally are still illiterates. This excludes from the calculation children under six years of age. On comparing notes, other countries do not come out so very much better. It is calculated that 30 per cent of French conscripts are unable to read; moreover, in _our_ \"returns\" of marriages in England in 1845, a percentage of forty-one signed the register with _marks_. In 1874 the number of illiterates was reduced to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> per cent. I elicited a good many interesting facts from my Wallack guide, several that were confirmatory of the terrible ignorance existing amongst the priesthood of the Greek Church. The popes do not commend themselves to the good opinion of the male part of the community, whatever hold they may have on the superstition of the women. I cannot see myself how things are to be mended till the position and education of the priesthood are improved. It is said that, in the old...", "...upon their western frontiers. Of these encircled tribes, four were of chief importance: the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Choctaws, and the Chickasaws. In 1825 the Creeks numbered twenty thousand, and held between five and six million acres of land in western Georgia and eastern Alabama. The Cherokees numbered about nine thousand and had even greater areas, mainly in northwestern Georgia, but to some extent also in northeastern Alabama and southeastern Tennessee. The Choctaws, numbering <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> thousand, and the Chickasaws, numbering thirty-six hundred, together held upwards of sixteen million acres in Mississippi--approximately the northern half of the State--and a million and a quarter acres in western Alabama. The four peoples thus numbered fifty-three thousand souls, and held ancestral lands aggregating over thirty-three million acres, or nearly the combined area of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Furthermore, they were no longer savages. The Creeks were the...", "...nobles, extending farther and farther west as the city melted rapidly into the country. London itself was a town lying high upon a hill--the hill of Lud--and consisted of a coil of narrow, tortuous, unseemly streets, each with a black, noisome rivulet running through its centre, and with rows of three-storied, leaden-roofed houses, built of timber-work filled in with lime, with many gables, and with the upper stories overhanging and darkening the basements. There were one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> churches, small and large, the most conspicuous of which was the Cathedral. Old Saint Paul's was not a very magnificent edifice--but it was an extremely large one, for it was seven hundred and twenty feet long, one hundred and thirty broad, and had a massive quadrangular tower, two hundred and sixty feet high. Upon this tower had stood a timber-steeple, rising, to a height of five hundred and thirty- four feet from the ground, but it had been struck by lightning in the...", "...plant, of which a portion is represented at Fig. 31, has the stoutest spines of all cultivated Cactuses, and their arrangement on the ridges of the stem is such as would withstand the attacks of all enemies. The broad tongue-like spine is purple in colour, and as strong as iron; the three erect horn-like spines yellow, and as firm as the horns of an antelope, to which they bear a resemblance. The stem is sphere-shaped, grey-green in colour, and is divided into from fourteen to <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> stout wavy ribs, upon which the spine tufts occur at intervals of about 2 in. The arrangement of the spines is shown in the illustration, as also is the position of the flowers, which are small, with narrow purple petals and brown-red sepals. The plant is a native of Mexico and Guatemala, and would require stove treatment. We have seen only small living examples, but according to descriptions and figures, the most interesting character it possesses is its spiny armament. It...", "...indescribable effects were being produced on them, and on the ship. Arcot alone could know the enormous gravitation, and his accelerometer told him now that he was subject to a gravitational acceleration of three thousand four hundred and eighty-seven feet per second, or almost exactly one hundred and nine times Earth's pull. \"The _Thought_ weighs one billion, two hundred and six million, five hundred thousand tons, with tender, on Earth. Here it weighs approximately one hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> billion tons,\" said Arcot softly. \"Can you set it down? It may crush under this load if the gravity drive isn't supporting it,\" asked Torlos anxiously. \"Eight inches cosmium, and everything else supported by cosmium. I made this thing to stand any conceivable strain. Watch--if the planet's surface will take the load,\" replied Arcot.

II I first became acquainted with Whitman's poetry through the columns of the old \"Saturday Press\" when I was twenty or <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years old (1858 or 1859). The first things I remember to have read were \"There was a child went forth,\" \"This Compost,\" \"As I ebb'd with the Ocean of Life,\" \"Old Ireland,\" and maybe a few others. I was attracted by the new poet's work from the first. It seemed to let me into a larger, freer air than I found in the current poetry. Meeting Bayard Taylor about this time, I spoke to him about Whitman. \"Yes,\" he said, \"there is something in him, but he is a man of colossal...", "...had also given the southern party the slip on the way to the depot in 80deg.

We had thought of reaching the depot before the close of the day, and this we could easily have done if the good going had continued; but during the afternoon the surface became so loose that the dogs sank in up to their chests, and when -- at about six in the evening -- the sledge-meter showed <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> geographical miles, the animals were so done up that it was no use going on. At eleven o'clock the next morning -- Sunday, November 12 -- we reached the depot. Captain Amundsen had promised to leave a brief report when the southern party left here, and the first thing we did on arrival was, of course, to search for the document in the place agreed upon. There were not many words on the little slip of paper, but they gave us the welcome intelligence: \"All well so far.\"...", "...and they fell into twelve, ten, and eight fathom, within the compass of a few minutes. Mr. Cook immediately ordered every man to his station, and all was ready to put about and come to an anchor, when deep water being met with again at the next cast of the lead, it was concluded that the vessel had gone over the tail of the shoals which had been seen at sun-set, and that the danger was now over. The idea of security was confirmed by the water's continuing to deepen to twenty and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> fathom, so that the gentlemen left the deck in great tranquillity, and went to bed. However, a little before eleven, the water shoaled at once from twenty to seventeen fathom, and before the lead could be cast again, the ship struck, and remained immoveable, excepting so far as she was influenced by the heaving of the surge, that beat her against the crags of the rock upon which she lay.

I give you just two minutes.\" He stopped. \"You have no right to locate--you are a minor,\" said he, livid with rage. \"You just inform yourself better, by asking a polite question or two of my parents.

The cavalry, directly the fighting was finished, had been sent off to pursue the Dervish horsemen, but they had got too long a start, so Colonel Broadwood's men only followed for about two miles, where the track was lost in the bush, and the force returned. The losses of the British brigade were five officers (including three who died subsequently) and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> men killed, and ninety-nine officers and men wounded. The Egyptian loss was much more severe, fifty-seven men being killed and 386 wounded, including ten of the British officers.[164] The total, 568, though heavy enough, would doubtless have been greater had Mahmoud's forces been provided with anything like proper ammunition. As it was, their cartridges, originally of poor quality, mostly turned out from the arsenal at Khartoum, had much deteriorated; consequently the...", "...this year (1177) this pompous ceremony was performed for the first time. The Doge died in the following year. On Ascension Day the Venetians, headed by their Doge, celebrated the triumphant event. Galleys, sailing-vessels, and gondolas accompanied the chief of the State, who occupied a prominent position on the 'Bucentoro,' which held, as its name implies, two hundred persons. This vessel was decorated with columns, statues, etc., and the top was covered with crimson velvet. There were <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> oars on each side. Musical performers attended in another barge. The vessel left the Piazza of St. Mark under a salute of guns, and proceeded slowly to the Isle of Lido. Here the Doge, taking the ring from his finger, gave it to his betrothed wife, the Adriatic, by dropping it into her bosom, repeating these words: 'We espouse thee, oh sea! in token of our just and perpetual dominion.'[73] The reader will remember the well-known lines of Byron, written at Venice: The...", "...perfect, but what a whole!

And she knows how many shillings go to a sovereign.\" \"Twenty,\" remarked Tom. \"Ah, that is where you are wrong. She gets <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> for each of her sovereigns.

A contemporary writer says, \"The signal being given the engine started off with this immense train of carriages; and such was its velocity, that in some parts the speed was frequently twelve miles an hour; and at that time the number of passengers was counted to be four hundred and fifty, which, together with the coals, merchandise, and carriages, would...", "...SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER KAPPA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER OMICRON WITH OXIA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER NU~} when it is found in his model, but not (as it would seem) all the itacisms or errors of the scribe, conforming in such cases to Stephen's edition of 1546.

Celsus long ago laughed at it, calling it the \"absurd ark.\" This difficulty is solved by Buteo and Kircher, who, supposing the common cubit of a foot and a half, prove, geometrically, that the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals supposed to be lodged therein. The capacity of the ark will be doubled, if we admit, with Cumberland, &c. that the Jewish cubit was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight inches.

Several attempts were made to interest the French government in his invention, but although certain commissions reported favorably on his ideas, nothing came of them for a time. In 1800, however, Fulton succeeded in interesting Napoleon in his scheme, and the following year he was given the opportunity of building his first submarine boat, the _Nautilus_. This boat was cigar shaped, about <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> feet long and seven feet in diameter, and made of copper supported by iron ribs. When operating at the surface this boat used a peculiarly shaped sail; but when submerged it was propelled by a screw actuated by machinery turned by hand.

The question as to the desirability of a Presidency for Munster was to be carefully considered in all its bearings. Leix and Offaly being in great measure waste, the Lord Deputy was to grant lands in fee simple at a small quit-rent either to Englishmen or Irishmen, binding them to erect and maintain farm buildings, and to till a certain portion of land. By this means it was hoped that these unfortunate districts would soon be made like the English Pale. Leases for <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years were to be given to Crown tenants generally, including holders of monastic lands.

His experience at Augsburg with certain impertinent snobs disgusted him with the place, and he wrote his father that the meeting with his fair cousin was the only compensation of visiting the town.

Fifty-seven Terns and Noddies are found throughout the world. Of these, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> have been recorded from Australian waters.

On August 9, 1680, under the leadership of Pope, a medicine man of San Juan, they revolted in unison, slew four hundred Spaniards, including <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> missionaries, and drove the remaining 2200 Spaniards from the Pueblo district. Under Governor Otermin and Lieutenant Garcia the settlers retreated to El Paso.

What is the matter with you?\" \"Going to school again at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> is hard work, grandmother,\" he said. \"Don't you try it. But I don't think I'm particularly ill: few folks can keep a complexion like yours, grandmother.\" \"Yes,\" said the old lady, rather pleased, \"many's the time they said that about me, that there wasn't much to complain of in my looks; and that's what a girl thinks of then, and sweethearts and balls, and all the other men looking savage when she's dancing with any one of them. Well, well, Harry; and what is all this...", "...of white voters. The South now enjoys a greater privilege because it counts all the negroes. The fourteenth amendment expressly provides for a situation like this. It says:-- \"When the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice-president of the United States, representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a state, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state, being <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such state.\" Whether it will be possible under our form of government to carry out this provision of the fourteenth amendment may be doubted, but that it is fast becoming a...", "...in his day to send young men of fortune to make the tour of Europe, as it was called, at an age when they would now be sent to either Oxford or Cambridge. Lord Charlemont was but eighteen when he left England. Locke, at the end of his work on _Education_, said in 1692 much the same as Johnson said in 1778. 'The ordinary time of travel,' he wrote, 'is from sixteen to one and twenty.' He would send any one either at a younger age than sixteen under a tutor, or at an older age than <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> without a tutor; 'when he is of age to govern himself, and make observations of what he finds in other countries worthy his notice ... and when, too, being thoroughly acquainted with the laws and fashions, the natural and moral advantages and defects of his own country, he has something to exchange with those abroad, from whose conversation he hoped to reap any knowledge.' Goldsmith, in his _Present State of Polite Learning_, ch. xiii, wrote in 1759:-- 'We see more of...", "...the Roman road system. The road to Ostia may have existed from the first: but after the Latin communities on the lower Anio had fallen under the dominion of Rome, we may well believe that the first portion of the Via Salaria, leading to Antemnae, Fidenae (the fall of which is placed by tradition in 428 B.C.) and Crustumerium, came into existence. The formation (according to the traditional dating in 495 or 471 B.C.) of the _tribus Clustumina_ (the only one of the earlier <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> tribes which bears a local name) is both a consequence of an extension of territory and of the establishment of the assembly of the plebs by tribes, for which an inequality of the total number of divisions was desirable (Mommsen, _History of Rome_, i. 360). The correlative of the Via Salaria was the Via Campana, so called because it led past the grove of the Arvales along the right bank of the Tiber to the Campus Salinarum Romanarum,[12] the salt marshes, from...", "...of these two, no being now living ever saw them, but the poetry that was in the soul of a battered weaver makes them human to us for ever.

In these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> occupations selected by Dr. Tatham as having an alcohol mortality which exceeds the standard by at least 50 per cent., we can work out the alcohol factor and find that it amounts to 24.5 per cent.

And all of a minute the road was filled with men on horses riding along, so that my father had to take shelter in Delane's big haggard by the roadside. And he heard the horsemen calling on Delane's name. And <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> days after, Delane lay dead. There's no doubt at all about the truth of that, and they were no riders belonging to this world that were on those horses. _Thomas Brown:_ There was a woman walking in the road that had a young child at home, and she met a very old man, having a baby in his arms.

This girl was born in Milwaukee <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years ago, and became an orphan when only four years old. She was brought up in the home of an aunt who seems to have been a good woman, but somewhat unfeeling, and was given little or no opportunity for education, going to work at any early age.

In that case she should give up eating the rest, but otherwise she should go on eating till she lays her hands on the salted ball. The Pandit adds, that the observance of this ball depends on the wish of the woman.

A photographer came and took a group of the British soldiers, who were mostly dressed in French uniform, and next day they were all taken off to Germany.

At a signal from the flagship the long lines of flags used to dress ship were swayed aloft and all the American battleships, the Brazilian ships, the Italian cruiser and the German cruiser in port suddenly were alive with snapping pennants from bows to taffrails. The American ensign was at the fore and the Brazilian ensign at the main of our ships. The saluting signal came and the 3-inch guns on the ships roared out a welcome of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> guns on each vessel to the President. Slowly the yacht approached the fleet and began to encircle it, passing first on the side opposite from Rio. The Louisiana was the first ship to be passed.

There was nothing in all that solitary, desolate peak to call them; nothing, for that matter, to beckon Garry, except the hot desert days, the cool breath of evening and the glory of nights when the stars hung low over all the miles of sand and sagebrush that reached far out to the rippling sand-dunes shimmering in the distance.

But several of the twenty-one Epistles in the New Testament are certainly earlier than A.D. 62, and out of the whole number only the three by St. John can be confidently placed at a later date than St. John's Gospel. Now, these <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> Epistles assume the truth of the story contained in the Gospels. They do more than this. For they prove that during the lifetime of men who had personally known Jesus Christ, there were large numbers of earnest men and women who were at home with the same ideas as those which Christians have cherished until modern times. Some of these ideas explain what we find in the Gospels. For instance, the doctrine of the Atonement is more plainly expounded in the Epistles than in...", "...of their king?

In short, it is almost to insult the understandings of my readers, to seem to institute any comparison between the two things; and nothing in the world, short of this gambling, this unprincipled, this maddening paper-money system, could have made men look with patience for one single moment at loans like these, tossed into the air with the hope and expectation of re-payment.

The girl's father hands her horoscope to their Tandan, who, when he has received them both, passes them on to the astrologer. The two horoscopes should agree on <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> points--a requirement which might prove awkward, were it not that a balance in favour of beneficent influences is generally allowed to admit of the marriage taking place. In the case of agreement, the boy's uncle, through his Tandan, then pays two fanams [20] (eight annas)--one for each horoscope--to the astrologer.

Until that time, whatever wages he might earn belonged to his father.

He told David that if he would work for Mr. Wilson until his wages paid that sum, he would then release him from all his obligations to his...", "...scramble out of his basket and crawl out on the framework, while the balloon swayed in the air.

The first half of the distance was covered in nine minutes, so <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> minutes remained for the balance of the journey: success seemed assured; the prize was almost within the grasp of the aeronaut. Of a sudden assured success was changed to dire peril; the automatic valves began to leak, the balloon to sag, the cords supporting the wooden keel hung low, and before Santos-Dumont could stop the motor the propeller had cut them and the whole system was threatened.

The one thing for which Patricia had to be grateful to her aunt was her general knowledge, and the sane methods adopted with her education. But for this she would not have been in the position to accept a secretaryship to a politician. When Patricia was <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> her father had died, and she inherited from her mother an annuity of a hundred pounds a year. Her aunt had suggested that they should live together; but Patricia had announced her intention of working, and with the money that she realised from the sale of her father's effects, particularly his library, she came to London and underwent a course of training in shorthand, typewriting, and general secretarial work. This was in March, 1914. Before she was ready to undertake a...", "...controlled him in about the same manner that he would manage the animals above alluded to.

The spirit of freedom in this passenger was truly the \"one idea\" notion.

The Queen was not satisfied with a formal telegram of regret; she wrote a letter, not as the sovereign of England to the wife of the President, but as one sorrowing woman to another, expressing her warm sympathy.

Often in the course of a single year many thousand papers were presented to her, and of these there were few to which she did not have to give close thought. For <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years she had discussed everything with Prince Albert, and when they had come to a conclusion, he would, as in the _Trent_ affair, write whatever was necessary. Then they would read the paper together and make any changes that seemed best. After his death, the Queen had to do all this work alone. She could wear the Kohinoor diamond, and she could build a million-dollar palace if she chose, but there were few persons in the kingdom who worked harder than she.

The Scottish School Boards are still elected under the latter system, and the following particulars of the elections in Glasgow on 2 April 1909, illustrate the admirable manner in which returning officers in this country, as elsewhere, carry out the tasks assigned to them. The whole city was polled as one constituency; fifteen members were to be elected, and each elector had fifteen votes, which he could distribute or cumulate as he pleased upon any of the <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> candidates nominated. There were on the roll 157,194 electors, of whom 40,778 took part in the election. The returning officer, in this case the Treasurer of the Glasgow School Board, had therefore to deal with over 600,000 votes, but he had to make provision for counting a much larger number of votes. Yet he had no difficulty in accomplishing successfully and expeditiously this gigantic task. He enlisted the services of over 250 clerks, and the whole process of extracting...", "...and expedient to admit her; (5) that he did not favor the inclusion in the commonwealth of the pro-slavery counties of the Valley; (6) that he did not want a provision saying that a person born one day should be a slave forever, and that one born the next day should be free; and finally (7) that he would like to see an amendment, providing that \"all children who, at the time this constitution takes effect, are fifteen or sixteen years of age, shall be free upon arriving at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> or thirty-five years,\" i.e., a provision for gradual emancipation that will enable some of those born before as well as all of those born July fourth, 1863, to obtain their freedom.[87] Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, prefacing his remarks with the statement that he had not examined the question, proceeded to make the following observations: (1) that he wished to be assured that the State could be admitted constitutionally; (2) that considering the position of the State, the...", "...large eyes, and small but full lips.

The improved condition of this branch of our commerce is mainly attributable to the above-mentioned treaty. Provision was made in the first article of that treaty for a commission to designate the mouths of rivers to which the common right of fishery on the coast of the United States and the British Provinces was not to extend. This commission has been employed a part of two seasons, but without much...", "...than I thought I had ever seen them before, and feeling an inclination to count the flocks that might pass within the reach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated myself on an eminence, and began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every flock that passed.

I traveled on, and still met more the farther I proceeded. The air was literally filled with pigeons; the light of noonday was obscured as by an eclipse; the dung fell in spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow; and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose.

Here there is a difference legally perceptible between the methods of changing the constitution and other laws; but it may be remarked that a provision in the constitution to the effect that all laws should require two readings at an interval of twenty-one days, would not essentially change the nature of the constitution, and yet in theory it would make that constitution flexible instead of rigid. As it is, the fundamental laws are quite as much under the control of...", "...did of my own accord come to an allowance of her of L30 a-year for all expences, clothes and everything, which she was mightily pleased with, it being more than ever she asked or expected, and so rose, with much content, and up with W.

At any rate, when one enters or leaves the harbor he fires a salute of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> guns. And it is only fair that the marine should have a salute fired on his own account now and then, for he is a leading and important figure in all the pomp and ceremony of man-of-war life.

The Colorado is still deepening its gorge. In the Grand Canyon its gradient is seven and one half feet to the mile, but, as in all ungraded rivers, the descent is far from uniform. Graded reaches in soft rock alternate with steeper declivities in hard rock, forming rapids such as, for example, a stretch of ten miles where the fall averages <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> feet to the mile. Because of these dangerous rapids the few exploring parties who have traversed the Colorado canyon have done so at the hazard of their lives. The canyon has been shaped by several agencies. Its depth is due to the river which has sawed its way far toward the base of a lofty rising plateau. Acting alone this would have produced a slitlike gorge little wider than the breadth of the stream.

He was called to the bar in 1754. In 1759 he removed to the Inner Temple and was made a commissioner of bankrupts. His devotion to his cousin, however, was a source of unhappiness.

Not only each _sign_, but each _face_, was assigned to some peculiar planet; hence _whos_ means 'of which planet.' Besides this equal division of each sign, we find unequal divisions, called _terms_. For example, the sign Aries, considered as a whole, was called 'the mansion of Mars.' Again, of this sign, degrees one to ten were called 'the face of Mars'; degrees eleven to twenty, 'the face of the Sun'; and degrees <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> to thirty, 'the face of Venus.' Lastly, of the same sign, degrees one to six were 'a term of Jupiter'; degrees seven to twelve, of Venus; degrees thirteen to twenty, of Mercury; twenty-one to twenty-five, of Mars; and twenty-six to thirty, of Saturn. Of course, the whole of this assignment was purely fanciful, imposed at first by arbitrary authority, and afterwards kept up by tradition. Cf. l. 1293. 1311-1322.

In the course of the work their ideas underwent some change, and the transition is easily seen in comparing the first bill of 1779 with the act as passed in 1780. In some respects the first is more liberal than the second; in other respects less so. Thus at first it was intended to make the children of slaves servants until <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> only.

The night was dark as pitch, the sky being overcast, and there was a gentle breeze blowing off the land, affording us smooth water for the delicate operation of landing. But there was no time to be lost, it wanting only four hours to daylight, by which time it would be necessary that the schooner should have secured a good offing; so, having under Hoard's pilotage stood in until the lead gave us <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> fathoms--at which point Hoard informed us that we might consider ourselves half a mile from the land--the gig was lowered, and, with her crew armed to the teeth, we shoved off, the second mate being in charge, with Hoard and myself sitting on either side of him in the stern-sheets, the former still acting as pilot.

It is useful, in the first place, to compare the revolution of the companion around Sirius with the revolution of the planet Uranus around the sun.

But such instances are few; while for a right feeling of the marvel of this poem and of the two preceding it, we must remember that Milton was only <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> when he wrote them. Apparently to make one of a set with the _Nativity_, he began to write an ode on the _Passion_, but, finding the subject \"above the years he had when he wrote it, and nothing satisfied with what was begun, left it unfinished.\" The fragment is full of unworthy, though skilful, and, for such, powerful conceits, but is especially interesting as showing how even Milton, trying to write about what he felt, but without yet having generated thoughts enow...", "...shown to have acted upon the question, which, by the text they understood better than we, is twenty-three, leaving sixteen not shown to have acted upon it in any way. \"Here, then, we have twenty-three out of our 'thirty-nine' fathers who framed the government under which we live, who have, upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths, acted upon the very question which the text affirms they 'understood just as well, and even better than we do now;' and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> of them--a clear majority of the 'thirty-nine'--so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety, and wilful perjury, if, in their understanding, any proper division between local and Federal authority, or any thing in the Constitution they had made themselves, and sworn to support, forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal territories.

More than a century later _The Cambridge Tables for renewing of Leases and purchasing Liens_, a standard work in England, with the certificate of Sir Isaac Newton to its accuracy, proposed, as a remedy for the inequity of this fanciful rule, to make the increase for each additional life less by one year, so that, valuing a single life at ten years, two lives shall be reckoned as nineteen years and three lives as twenty-seven years.

Fisheries also are insignificant, and not likely ever to constitute an industry, so we may confine ourselves to the three first named. Of these three agriculture is now, and has hitherto been, by far the least important. Out of an area of two hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> thousand square miles in Cape Colony alone, probably not more than one one-thousandth part is now under any kind of cultivation, whether by natives or by whites; and in the whole country, even if we exclude the German and Portuguese territories, the proportion must be even smaller.

The train consisted of six waggons loaded with coals and flour; after these was the passenger-coach, filled with the directors and their friends, and then <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> waggons fitted up with temporary seats for passengers; and lastly came six waggon-loads of coals, making in all a train of thirty-eight vehicles.

They had been out, from the fort at Wheeling, on a scouting party, and were waylaid at a pass called the narrows. The Indians had dropped a pipe and some trinkets in the path, knowing that the white men would pick them up, and look at them, and while the latter were grouped together in this act, they fired and killed every man. The Indians certainly fought hard for the possession of this valley, aiming, at all...", "...Duncan took his place.

Twice over the judges measured the throw, then announced \"One hundred and <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> feet.\" Mack had won by two inches.

This land was owned by the family of the Emperor and was rented at $1.55, gold, per acre.

His yield of wheat was expected to be eleven to twelve bushels per acre, his beans <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> bushels and his millet twenty-five bushels which, at the local prices for grain and straw, would bring a gross earning of $35, gold, per acre.

He was interrupted by cries of \"No more Carmagnoles!\" \"No more of Barere's puns!\" At length, five months after the revolution of Thermidor, the Convention resolved that a committee of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> members should be appointed to examine into the conduct of Billaud, Collot, and Barere.

A subsequent mental weakening would be no ground for annulling a marriage. An Illinois court recently remarked, it is a harsh rule that would permit a married man whose wife later in life became insane to put her away on account of her misfortune. If one were so intoxicated that he did not act intelligently, he could avoid his marriage. A male at common law can marry at fourteen, a female at twelve. By statute a later date, <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> for males and eighteen for females has been fixed in many states. The right to disaffirm a marriage on the ground of non-age, unlike the parties to a contract, applies to both parties. In this country marriage is regulated largely by the states, though a movement has been started to make marriage and divorce a matter of national regulation. As marriages are of higher character than other contracts relating to the ordinary dealings of men, even those that are prohibited...", "...he asked. \"Yes, some beautiful ones.

An annuity of L35, therefore, would cost a yearly premium of L22 0s. 5d., or a lump sum of L426 8s. 4d. One or two of the insurance companies have also prepared tables for the endowment of children. I find, for instance, in the tables issued by the North British and Mercantile that an annual payment of L3 11s. begun at infancy will insure the sum of L100 at <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years of age, with the return of the premium should the child die, or that L35 10s. paid annually will insure the sum of L1,000.

But the fourth pair take the form of fangs, which are very stout and strong, and very much curved, while at their base, just inside the head, is a little bag of poison. In the northern centipedes, which are quite small, the fangs are not large enough, nor the poison sufficiently strong, to cause a serious...", "...captured a wagon train with about four hundred Federal troops, mostly convalescents going to Columbia.

William Cullen Bryant (b. 1794, d. 1878) was born in Cummington, Mass. He entered Williams College at the age of sixteen, but was honorably dismissed at the end of two years. At the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> he was admitted to the bar, and practiced his profession successfully for nine years. In 1826 he removed to New York, and became connected with the \"Evening Post\"--a connection which continued to the time of his death. His residence for more than thirty of the last years of his life was at Roslyn, Long Island. He visited Europe several times; and in 1849 he continued his travels into Egypt and Syria, In all his poems, Mr. Bryant exhibits a remarkable love for, and a careful...", "...larger and larger purses were given; and at Buffalo in 1872 the prizes amounted to $70,000. Since then the amount offered in the United States and Canada, during a single year, has reached $1,500,000. Individual trotters, in the course of a long turf career, earn enormous amounts. A remarkable instance of this was the mare Goldsmith Maid, by Alexander's Abdallah (a son of Rysdyk's Hambletonian), out of an Abdallah mare. She began trotting in 1866, and left the turf in 1878, when <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years old, and her winnings amounted to over $200,000. In 1869 the National Trotting Association was formed, under which an elaborate code of rules has been published. In trotting races, it will be noted, the time test is supreme, differing from running races, in which time is of comparatively little consequence. The animal which has the fastest record for 1 mile in harness is, until deposed, the king or queen of the trotting turf.

A committee was at once appointed to consider the matter, and on the 24th September they brought in their report.(156) The Virginia Company had agreed to take 100 boys and girls between the ages of eight and sixteen, and to educate and bring them up at the company's charge. The company were prepared, moreover, to give each boy and girl fifty acres of land, to each boy as soon as he was twenty-four years of age, and to each girl at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> or her marriage, whichever should first happen. The charge of fitting out and transporting that number was estimated at L500, which sum the court agreed should be levied on the inhabitants of the city rateably according as each was assessed towards the last poor rate. The young emigrants were soon afterwards shipped to their new home,(157) and so successfully did the undertaking turn out that in little over a year another application was made to the Common Council (18 Dec.,...", "...and returned, \"to the end that their posterity might be discriminated from the future settlers.\" From these two emphatic words--The Unity of the Empire--it was styled the U.E. list, and they whose names were entered therein were distinguished as U.E.

Loyalists themselves, but guaranteed to all their children, upon arriving at the age of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> years, two hundred acres of land free from all expense. It is a pleasing task to recall these generous acts on the part of the British Government towards the fathers of our country, and the descendants of those true and noble-hearted men who loved the old Empire so well that they preferred to endure toil and privation in the wilderness of Canada to ease and comfort under the protection of the revolted colonies.

Right across, on the sea side, are the big guns.

Tom and Ned reached New York City without incident of moment, and, after a night spent at a hotel, they went to the Battery, whence the small government steamer leaves every day for Sandy Hook. It is a trip of <span class=\"clocktext\">twenty-one</span> miles, and as the bay was rather rough that day, Tom and Ned had a taste of a real sea voyage. But they were too experienced travelers to mind that, though some other visitors were made quite ill. A landing was made on the bay side of the Hook, it being too rough to permit of a dock being constructed on the ocean side. \"Now we'll see what luck we have,\" spoke Tom, as he and Ned, inquiring the way to the proving grounds from a soldier on duty, started for them.
